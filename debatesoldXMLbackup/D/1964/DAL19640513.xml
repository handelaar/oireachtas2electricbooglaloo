    <Speaker pid="ThomasDunne" hpid="Mr. T. Dunne Mr. T. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that owing to the drainage operations by the Office of Public Works under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 small farmers adjoining the Crannagh River in the Nenagh catchment area have had comparatively large parts of their lands fenced off; and that these lands are not available for their use since 1960; and, if so, what steps he proposes to take to relieve the hardship caused to these farmers either by way of compensation under the provisions of the Act, or by the early removal of the fences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Malley) Donogh O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The lands at the outfall of the Crannagh river are below the water level of Lough Derg and it was necessary to provide embankments and a <Col N="1379" /> pumping system to protect them from the frequent flooding and waterlogging to which they were liable before the drainage scheme.  The embankments, which have an average width of about 25 feet along the drainage channels, were fenced off to protect them from grazing by heavy cattle which would cause serious damage and endanger the stability of the embankments. Grazing by sheep or meadowing of the embankments would be welcomed.</P>
      <P>No claims have been received for compensation for the loss of grazing on the banks and indeed I think it would be difficult to sustain such a claim in view of the provision in the Act that in the assessment of compensation regard must be had to the benefit conferred by the drainage works. In this case the benefit has been very great.</P>
      <P>I am advised that, for the proper maintenance of the banks, it is essential to retain the fences and we cannot therefore agree to their removal.  I would point out that these expensive protection works were carried out at full State cost and their maintenance is a statutory obligation and is for the benefit of the adjoining landowners.</P>
      <P>The loss of grazing on the embankments is relatively a very small consideration in comparison with the benefit which the drainage works have brought to the landowners and we look for their co-operation in helping to preserve the banks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether or not there is a reciprocal agreement between Great Britain and this country with regard to the recognition of commercial aircraft pilots' licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland and Great Britain as members of the International Civil Aviation Organisation recognise each other's professional pilots' licences for the purpose of flight of each country's aircraft across the territory of the other.  There is no reciprocal agreement for the grant to the holder of a professional pilot's licence of a corresponding licence of the other country, and each case arising is considered on the merits.  In practice, there is little difficulty in obtaining corresponding licences between Great Britain and Ireland as a suitable period is allowed an applicant to comply with any special requirements of either country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that while the British pilot's licence is recognised in this country, the Irish pilot's licence is not recognised in Britain until a very stiff test has been passed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>British pilots coming here generally have to acquire information on Irish air regulations which they have not got.  Generally speaking, this is a reciprocal arrangement which, I am informed, works very satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not seem to be aware that there is a big difference in the way in which pilots from Britain are treated here and the way in which Irish pilots are treated in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That would depend <Col N="1382" /> on the conditions obtaining in Britain. British flying conditions are somewhat different from ours but I understand that the arrangement is that pilots from this country are given an opportunity of acquiring the extra knowledge they need in Britain.  There are some conditions in this country different from those in Britain.  I have no evidence that this matter does not work out satisfactorily and I have no complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the matter is brought to the Minister's notice, will he ensure that discrimination against Irish pilots, because that is what it amounts to, will not be continued any longer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had complaints that pilots were discriminated against in Britain and not given the opportunity to acquire the necessary knowledge of flying conditions in that country, I would be glad to take the matter up with the British civil aviation authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that the Minister is not aware of the facts.  They must have a completely different set of arrangements in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, there is no absolute reciprocity in this matter as the conditions may be different from one country to another, but, in practice, the arrangement works out very well.</P>

    <P>8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that in a recent advertisement for pilots for Irish International Airlines it was specified that a Performance A certificate was necessary; and that this qualification is a British one, and is not available in this country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that last February Aer Lingus, having earlier intensively searched the market for suitably qualified Irish pilots and having failed to find sufficient candidates, issued an advertisement in the English Press, seeking pilots with qualifications including Performance A, which is a British qualification <Col N="1383" /> provided for in a different manner in Irish pilots' licences.  Although aiming this advertisement mainly at the English market, it was decided also to insert it in the Irish papers lest there should by any chance have been an Irish candidate about whom the company was unaware.  I think it extremely unlikely that any Irish candidate was deterred from applying because of the wording of the advertisement but the company have assured me that they will avoid any possible misunderstanding for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if an advertisement was inserted in the Irish papers before an advertisement in the British papers?  Is it not a fact that there was no advertisement except this one and that it specified a qualification required only by British pilots?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>A number of regulations necessary under the new Copyright Act are in course of preparation.  It is expected that they will be ready for promulgation in the near future when I hope to be able to fix a date on which the Act will come into operation.</P>

    <P>That it is expedient to authorise such charges on and payments out <Col N="1394" /> of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof and such payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present session to provide for the increase of certain pensions payable in respect of public services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Money Resolution I wish to take the opportunity to discuss a matter which I had hoped to raise on the Committee Stage but because of a ruling made by the Chair on an amendment of mine, and which, of course, I accept, I now wish to discuss on this Money Resolution.</P>
      <P>I had suggested an amendment to this Bill in the following terms:</P>
      <P>That an increase under this Act of a pension to a widow or orphans shall not be taken into account in assessing the means of a person for the purpose of the payment of a widows' non-contributory pension or an orphans' non-contributory pension scheme.</P>
      <P>The Chair has communicated with me and informed me that this is out of order because it would have the effect of imposing a charge on State funds. Whilst accepting, of course, the ruling, it does appear to me that the effect of my amendment is not so much to impose a charge on State funds as to stop a reduction in State expenditure and there is, I think, a difference involved but, as the amendment has been ruled out of order, I wish to take the opportunity of referring to it now on the Money Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House should know what is being done in this Bill with regard to the rights of persons in receipt of widows' non-contributory pensions.  As I understand the position, the only class of persons whom my amendment would affect would be the widows of retired members of the Garda Síochána.  As I understand the position, the members of the Garda Síochána are not entitled to contribute to a contributory pension, a right which other State servants have, and as a result, if they die, their widows are not entitled to a contributory widows' pension and have to fall back on the <Col N="1395" /> meagre allowance given to widows who fall into the non-contributory class.</P>
    <P>As is known by Deputies, there are rigid controls on the income which such a person is entitled to before she is entitled to a pension and I do not know whether or not it is generally realised what is happening.  If it were realised I would hope that Deputies would try to see that the Bill was amended in order to ensure that what is happening would be stopped.</P>
    <P>These widows have been getting a pension, a very inadequate pension, but some pension, to help them to live. In addition, they have been getting the non-contributory widow's pension.  The recent increases which have been given to them to assist them because of the increase in the cost of living and to compensate them for this increase amount to 5/- a week.  With the increase of 5/- a week in their Garda widow's pension has come about a decline of 5/- a week in their widow's non-contributory pension.  So that, one of the poorest sections in the community are being deprived of the increase which it is admitted they are entitled to because of the rise in the cost of living and the State is giving 5/- with one hand and taking it back with the other.  This seems to me to be an extraordinary situation.  I find it hard to understand how it can be justified.</P>
    <P>It is to be borne in mind that long before this State was founded it was recognised that persons who served in a police force were subject to certain special responsibilities and were entitled to special treatment on retirement. In 1925, after the State was founded, this special position was recognised and serving members of the police force were treated not very handsomely on their retirement but nonetheless were given special treatment in that it was recognised that the State should pay them some gratuity and this gratuity also went to the benefit of their widows.  This gratuity has been increased over the years as a result of the cost of living index figure increasing.  In 1956 it went to £51 10s.; in 1959 it increased by a <Col N="1396" /> little over £7 a year; there was another increase in 1962 to £98 per annum and in 1963 to £111 per annum.</P>
    <P>What has happened is this.  The public assistance authorities have taken into account the increase given last year when deciding the means of an applicant for a widow's non-contributory pension.  Because they have received an increase in their Garda widow's pension they are being decreased correspondingly in the amount they may obtain from the public assistance authorities.  I have a letter here.  I shall not give the name of the person by whom it was written, but I think it is of relevance because it indicates what is happening.  This lady writes:</P>
    <P>I became a widow last July and, as my late husband was a member of the Garda, I received a pension of £98 a year, which increased to £111 last November.  I received a non-contributory pension of 16/- a week which rose to 18/6 per week last November.  Early last week I received a letter requesting the return of my allowance book for reassessment.  This morning Social Welfare informed me they had decided to reduce my allowance by 5/- per week, stating that my Garda pension was now £113 12s., which is incorrect.  Their decision means that I, in fact, will receive no increase whatsoever.  They are also in possession of my allowance book which means I am unable to obtain my weekly allowance.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure I am not the only one who has received letters similar to that.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister&mdash;he must have these figures&mdash;how many people are involved in this.  I do not suppose there are a couple of hundred in the whole country.  What great loss to the Exchequer would there be if we allowed the widows to keep their 5/- a week non-contributory pensions and gave them also the 5/- increase in their Garda pensions?  It is obvious that the State is not going to collapse under the burden of this beneficence. What great principle would be involved if he were to do this?  Is it going to <Col N="1397" /> mean that a whole lot of other increases will come about, that a chain reaction will set in, that it will end up with retired servants getting further increases, with existing servants getting further increases, going up to Ministers, judges and even the President? Do we anticipate some sort of chain reaction like that if we allow these widows to keep their 5/- increase?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>This is a special category&mdash;a small category.  It was deemed desirable and necessary to compensate these people for the very great hardships they have to contend with by giving them what could not be considered an overgenerous increase in their pensions to compensate for the rise in the cost of living.  It seems to me to be extraordinary that we should, in fact, decide to take it away when they apply for their non-contributory pension.  It may be argued that the amendment I put down may involve a charge on the Exchequer.  As I said, I think there are arguments against it.  But whether or not it does, I would suggest it should not be ruled out of order on a technicality like this.  If the Minister accepts these arguments, he can bring in a suitable amendment.</P>
    <P>We have had pension increases before.  In each of these Acts, in section 10, subsection (5), there is a provision that says:</P>
    <P>An increase under this Act of a pension shall, for the purpose of Clause (e) of paragraph (II) of Rule 1 of the Rules contained in the Seventh Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952, be regarded as a voluntary or gratuitous payment.</P>
    <P>The Schedule there referred to was the Schedule dealing with the means which are to be taken into account to ascertain the eligibility for a widow's non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>That section is not in this Act.  The amendment which I drafted was in wider terms and was designed to make it perfectly clear that the public assistance authorities in taking into account a widow's means would not take into account these increases.  The letter I have read out indicates what has happened throughout the country.  I <Col N="1398" /> understand it has happened in several other places.  The recipients of these social welfare benefits were told or read in the Press that they were getting a 5/- increase in their Garda pensions. They are grateful even for small mercies.  Last November, a circular went out from the Department of Social Welfare informing all the branches of the Department that this increase was to be taken into account in deciding the eligibility for widows' non-contributory pensions.  The result is now, I hope, clear.</P>
    <P>I do not see that anything will be upset unduly in our public finances if the ideas contained in this amendment are accepted.  I would urge the Minister to accept them.  I think the only point that can be made is that now the Garda widows are getting a pension equivalent to the widows' contributory pension and that they should be satisfied with that.  The proper answer to such a suggestion is the one I gave earlier, namely, that this society of ours has recognised that we owe a special obligation to the members of the police force and that we have fulfilled that obligation, not very magnificently but to some extent, by giving gratuities on retirement payable to their widows.  This is a matter entirely separate from the level of contributory widows' pensions.  It is something that has arisen as of right.  I do not think we should determine the level of payments to widows of retired guards by reference to this standard.  We have given them pensions in the past.  We have increased those pensions because of the rise in the cost of living, and we should not take away that benefit now because of the failure to put in an amendment such as I have suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I started dealing with these pension problems, I have found there appears to be a complete misunderstanding or lack of appreciation of what has been done for the Garda.  It must be remembered that Garda widows get pensions.  Civil servants' widows do not, and neither do the widows of teachers.  Therefore, they get special treatment in getting a pension themselves on the same terms &mdash; except that they spend 30 <Col N="1399" /> years where the civil servants spend 40 years&mdash;and, in addition, a widow's pension is awarded.  Let us, therefore, not be under the illusion that we are treating gardaí and their widows badly. We may owe them a special obligation for their good service but, if we do, we have recognised that in the pensions we have awarded.</P>
      <P>In 1950 and 1956 and so on, increases were given to the widows.  At that time they were dependent to a great extent on the widow's non-contributory pension, in addition to the pension as a widow of a garda.  It was provided in those Acts that the increase would not count as means.  In other words, the small increase she was getting would not be used to reduce the non-contributory pension. When it came to 1962, a very big increase of 20 per cent was given, an increase bigger than any increase given up to that time.  In 1963, five per cent was added but, in addition, the five per cent plus 20 per cent would have brought the widow's pension up to £74 5s. 11d.  We went further than that and made it £111.</P>
      <P>Actually, therefore, during the two years, 1962 and 1963, the Garda widows' pension was increased by £1 per week and the reason why it was so increased was in order to bring it up to the contributory pension the widow outside is getting.  The gardaí are not insured under the Social Welfare Acts for widows' pensions and we thought it only fair that the Garda widow should get the equivalent of the social welfare pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill it is provided that, whatever she might be entitled to on a percentage basis, the minimum will be brought up to £111, which is the same as the contributory widow's pension. Contributory widows who are not the widows of gardaí are ineligible for the receipt of any portion of a non-contributory pension.  That does not apply in the case of the gardaí.  If a Garda widow has £111, and no other means, she is entitled to some portion of a non-contributory pension.  There again they are treated better than other members of the community.  I mention these facts not to illustrate how well <Col N="1400" /> off they are but in order to rebut some of the allegations made here that we are treating these people badly.  Compared with other sectors of the population we have treated them well and we should not be accused of having treated them badly.</P>
    <P>With regard to the particular instance mentioned by Deputy D. Costello, I think he said that this widow became a widow in 1963.  If that is so, it bears out what I have said: she was getting what was equivalent to a non-contributory pension and she was also getting portion of a non-contributory pension which is, as I have said, better than the ordinary non-contributory pension awarded to the widow of a worker who was engaged in industry or something else.  It is also laid down in present regulations that the widow going out&mdash;again this is proved by the case quoted by Deputy Costello&mdash;has a pension awarded to her, but there is no part of that pension excluded from the means test.  It would be wrong in my opinion&mdash;certainly it would be very hard to justify it&mdash;to give any better treatment to widows retiring before 1961 than we give to those who become widows now.  In no way can the argument that we should do something more than we have done for the widows of gardaí be sustained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot altogether agree with the Deputy that they will be taken away.  There is no concession being made to the contrary.  In most cases, if a person gets a wage or pension, it is treated as means under these various Acts.  We did exclude these increases already.  Under the earlier Acts, we excluded them from the calculation of means.  Now, we are not putting that in for the 1962-63 increases. That is the only difference. The reason it is not being put in is that the widow of a Garda is now treated at least as well as, but in most cases better than, the ordinary non-contributory widow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Knowing, no doubt, that I was in the middle of saying a few words on the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, I got a series of notices this morning from the Minister reminding me of the increased telephone charges that I would have to pay.  I am sure they were sent to me specially on the post last night in case there was any possibility that I might omit to make reference to it in the House.</P>
      <P>The residence rental rate will go up by £3 a year.  A business rate will go up by £2 10s. a year.  No doubt, when the Minister is replying he will tell us why he made the differentiation.  There will be an increase of 50 per cent in the cost of local calls.  We knew it already for the past month but it did not make it any more pleasant when I was reminded of it this morning in my post.  In respect of trunk calls, dialled through an operator&mdash;provided, as I said the other day, he knows that the number which I am anxious to dial exists&mdash;the 8d. charge will go up to 9d. and the 2/- charge will go up to 2/3d.  I suppose we should be thankful to the Minister that the trunk calls obtained through the operator will not be increased also by 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one is making a call through a coinbox, I notice one will not have to pay the increased charge for some time because the Minister has not been able to adapt the mechanism as yet. However, in case I had not remembered to say a word on these increases, I got this chit this morning addressed to each subscriber.  I say this to the Minister and his minions: they are better in their documentation than the authors of the document we have just been considering where we had sentences of 15 lines.  At least when the Minister is dishing out his unwelcome news, it is in terse sentences that one <Col N="1406" /> can, in the main, understand.  But I do not understand what this sentence means:</P>
    <P>In the case of trunk calls dialled direct by the subscriber the charge for each period of time will be increased to 3d. but the period of time allowed will, as far as possible, be increased <i>pro rata.</i></P>
    <P>What does this mean: &ldquo;...as far as possible be increased <i>pro rata</i>?&rdquo; Surely it is possible to decide? I understand that STD worked on a system of units&mdash;that the unit was the local call and that if one were dialling a short or a long distance, the local call unit was 15 seconds, 30 seconds or one minute as the case might be.  How the period of time allowed will &ldquo;as far as possible be increased <i>pro rata</i>&rdquo; is something my intelligence cannot accept in relation to units of seconds in the manner that has been determined.</P>
    <P>I do not know what it means but I have a suspicion, an unworthy one perhaps, at the back of my mind that it is so phrased for the purpose of hiding another increase which at a later stage the Minister will bring in and tell us about, a third Budget perhaps, in this respect.  I do not know what the aim or object is in putting it in that way.  It seems that in regard to telephone charges, one should be prepared to say simply and categorically what the charges will be and the effect of these changes.</P>
    <P>When speaking on this yesterday, the Minister, as if he were sitting on a hot seat, became very upset about certain quotations or paraphrases I gave from the Taoiseach's speech in the Budget debate.  He seemed to think I was saying something that was not what the Taoiseach said.  I admit frankly I was then talking from recollection and I had not the exact quotation to hand but I have it now.  If the Minister had not been jumping about, so obviously embarrassed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We all know that Deputy Hilliard as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has no sense of humour.  We accept that.  We all know that as a person in certain walks of life, he would make ten of us and would be able to buy and sell us, but the fact is that in this Department of State, vital to our economic growth, he has completely fallen down on the job and is unable to take the criticism due to him and which should come to him.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to enter into anything that is <i>sub judice</i> or discuss the rights and wrongs of the case which is before the courts and which will be dealt with by the courts and not by this House.  It should not be dealt with in this House, but the attitude of the Minister in refusing to acknowledge every reasonable communication that was sent to him; the attitude of the Minister in his house in Navan when an officer of the court tried to do his duty and the Minister tried to prevent him from doing so, is something <Col N="1409" /> that when the case is over will be raised by me in this House and it will not be very edifying for the Minister or his colleagues to hear what transpired.</P>
    <P>I am not dealing with my criticisms of the Minister.  I am dealing with the criticism of the Taoiseach who, on 15th April was perforce bound to come into the House and say: &ldquo;The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is now about to initiate a drive....&rdquo;  Every member of that Government there was adjuring every person in private life, every member of the business community, to ensure that he started a drive for productivity, started a drive to make certain that the effect of the additional costs that were bound to accure would not have to be imposed on the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>The members of the Government were right, that unless that drive was made to ensure productivity would increase, then the effect of the increases and the inflation which the Minister for Finance himself generated a year ago would be to price us out of our export markets.  The members of the Government were right but, instead of delivering that homily to the members of the public, the person to whom they should have delivered it was the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs because it was only one day after the Budget, when the shock in the morning papers had so staggered everyone, that the Taoiseach, in an effort to rally the falling popularity of his Party after the Budget had been announced, came in here and said the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs &ldquo;is now about to initiate a drive&rdquo;.  Never did any Minister get such a slam in public from his Leader as this Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was given by the Taoiseach that day in the Budget debate.</P>
    <P>In relation to telephones, some people feel the £10 installation fee which has now been announced is merely a method of getting more money.  There were about 13,900 telephone applications pending at the time of the Budget.  That would be £140,000&mdash;in the words of the Minister for Transport and Power, &ldquo;small beer&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that anybody in on the 13th April is not charged but I am taking that as an average figure, amounting to about £140,000 a year.  The real reason why I was attracted to that figure was that it was very nearly twice £75,000, not quite, and the Minister for Transport and Power considers the figure of £75,000 very small beer indeed.  I was wondering whether the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in imposing this additional £10, which is approximately twice £75,000, felt that twice small beer was big beer.  I do not know whether that was the purpose or whether it was because effecting installations over a period like that was an easy method of getting additional revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have thought that the way in which an ordinary business man would have approached this situation would have been in accordance with what, for the sake of brevity, one might call the Woolworth principle, the more telephones one gets, the greater will be the volume of traffic and the greater the revenue, and that it would not pay to dissuade connections for that reason. I should have thought that another method of dealing with the position <Col N="1411" /> would have been to consider that there are peak times in which the telephone system is taxed not merely to the utmost but far beyond its capacity and that a better method of getting additional revenue would have been to ensure that the off-peak volume of traffic would be increased and so provide a greater return for the mechanisation involved.</P>
    <P>It does not require any great knowledge of engineering to know that the way in which engineering firms at the present time make substantial amounts is by ensuring that the large, expensive machines they have do not stand idle at all.  It pays them handsomely to pay heavy overtime, double time, for the purpose of ensuring that the machines go on operating and that those idling times which cost money are not running against them.</P>
    <P>It is commonly accepted that at certain times of the day, the peak hours, as they are called, the telephone system is strained beyond satisfactory working.  I have never been able to get from the Minister what those peak times are but it does seem to me that one of the ways in which we could deal with this problem of productivity in telephones is to provide that the use of this expensive equipment will be spread over a larger part of the 24 hours.  Our small beer friend, the Minister for Transport and Power, is making an effort, or pretends he is at any rate to extend the tourist season because it is too short.  In the same way, could the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs not make some effort to ensure that the period during which the telephone system in the automatic areas is used will be extended and thus get additional revenue for the vote as a whole?</P>
    <P>The Minister may use Government priority to get his telephone calls and so may not be acclimatised to the infuriating delay of having to dial half a dozen times and getting, not the engaged signal from the number concerned, but from the trunk line concerned. Many business people would be prepared to off-load a great number <Col N="1412" /> of their calls into times when the trunk lines are not so busy, if they were given any inducement to do so, or if they were even told that there are certain times when the lines are not so heavily engaged and when they could get a no delay service.  I suppose that to do anything like that would be too modernistic and smack too much of business efficiency to suit the Minister.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the postal service. I do not suppose there is an awful difference between the Minister's age and mine.  We are both about the age when each of us should have got sense and neither of us has.  I can remember when I was a young man starting in my office and if you posted a letter this afternoon, not after 6 o'clock but in the early afternoon, you could be certain that it would be delivered on the first post in London or certainly on the 10 o'clock post.  If the destination were outside London, it would still be delivered the next day.  I am thinking of a place approximately 25 miles outside London and in those days a letter posted this afternoon in Kildare was delivered for certain 25 miles outside London tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister say what will happen today?  He cannot.  From London to Dublin or from Dublin to London now takes two days.  A letter is never delivered until the day after the next day, unless one makes it express delivery, and certainly one will be lucky if a letter from Kildare is delivered to some place outside London in two days.  What has happened?  Is the fault on their side or on our side?  It happens both ways.  It also happens internally here.  I got a letter at 2.30 p.m. yesterday delivered in Dublin which had been posted in Cork on Saturday morning.  Is that the efficiency of quick delivery that is going to ensure economic growth?</P>
    <P>The Minister may say, perhaps with justice, that there are so many million letters delivered each day and that he receives only .0001 per cent complaints. The people who complain are told: &ldquo;We cannot do anything about it.&rdquo;  I have sent envelopes back to the Minister's Department and I have never got any explanation for these <Col N="1413" /> delays, except: &ldquo;We cannot understand how this happened.&rdquo;  Other people tell me the same thing.  They say it is no use raising the matter because they are met with a woodenness of courtesy, courtesy always, without any reasonable explanation of the matters of which they complained.</P>
    <P>The fact is that 30 years ago there was a much more efficient postal delivery service from Dublin and from London to Dublin than there is today. I do not know whether it is more efficient in the percentage of deliveries but it is not as efficient in a matter of letters reaching their destination quickly.  Perhaps one of the reasons is that there was a much smaller volume of mail in those days and that it is easier to handle the smaller volume. Whatever the reasons, the results are not satisfactory and do not help the business community.</P>
    <P>I understand that in relation to the postal services, no effort is being made by the Post Office to segregate the type of mail delivered to it or to give any concession or incentive to people who deliver bulk mail to the Post Office in a suitable way.  I always try, in election times, to deliver my election address to the local post office parcelled in such a way that it will be easily divisible amongst the various post office areas in the constituency.  I do so because I want to make sure that it is delivered and to assist the post office people.  It is always delivered except in the most rare case.  It makes it easier for sorting and for productivity, that awful word, in the postal services.  Has the Minister ever thought of doing anything similar in relation to bulk postage?  Has he ever given any incentive in relation to bulk postage to ensure that it will be segregated in a similar way?</P>
    <P>I have here a letter from a man who says his organisation will have to pay £5,000 more a year for postal services as a result of the Minister's order, who also tells me that he has tried to see whether by simplifying the method of bulk postage for the Post Office anything could be done to ease the system of delivery or reduce his costs and he has met a blank wall in that respect. An organisation that will have to pay <Col N="1414" /> the Minister an additional £5,000 a year as a result of his order is not a small organisation.  It is one that is using the services of the Minister's Department to a pretty substantial degree.  Would it not be well worth while examining the position in relation to bulk postage of that sort and the giving of some incentive to people to hand it into the office segregated according to the Post Office areas.</P>
    <P>It is that type of recurring customer that is worth while to the Post Office. It is that type of recurring customer with whom it would be easier to make some approach to a new type of productivity. Unless the Minister's reports are shrouded in secrecy and are hidden behind the words of the Taoiseach, &ldquo;that the Minister is about to initiate&rdquo; we have seen no evidence that he is thinking at all along lines of greater productivity there.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me ask the Minister one question.  He has always been&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; because he is the head of the Department whom we must criticise here&mdash;a great stickler for the Conventions.  He has always sat back and defended himself in any possible situation from attacks on the basis that if we did X or if we did Y, we would be contravening one of the Conventions, be it the Stockholm Convention, the Copenhagen Convention, or otherwise, in relation to radio or television transmission.  He is a member of the Government and, as the Tánaiste is very fond of saying he has got a collective responsibility as a member of that Government.  He has a collective responsibility as a member of the Government, in the eyes of the Tánaiste, anyway.  What is he doing in relation to the Copenhagen Convention or the Stockholm Convention in relation to sound radio when, as a member of the Government, he is sitting idly by and, in fact, assisting the fitting out of the pirate radio ships to operate in defiance of these Conventions? Either the Conventions work, either we are bound by them, either we should be bound by them, or we should not.</P>
    <P>I have always felt, I may say, that the Minister took the Conventions far too literally and when other people <Col N="1415" /> in other areas were ignoring those Conventions, he used them as a means of avoiding modernising, used them as a means of avoiding having to do any thinking on a new line.  Here is some thinking on a new line.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. If the Conventions are to be quoted against us when we suggest new modernistic and better methods of improving our services and if we are told that we cannot improve Irish services because we are bound by the Conventions, surely there is similarly a duty upon us to ensure that the same Conventions, which we are so certain to impose upon our own people, are not used by others to the detriment of our own people and we should not turn a blind eye to breaches of the Conventions by others when we turn the most powerful binoculars we can find on any minute breach of those Conventions by our own citizens.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that he has no direct control, no direct responsibility, in these matters.  Maybe not, but he is a member of the Government and, in the words of the Tánaiste, he has a collective responsibility as a member of the Government.  He sits around the Government table and these matters must be discussed by the Government there and it is up to him to say: &ldquo;I have ensured that these Conventions will be obeyed scrupulously, even though it hurts our own Irish people and if I have done that honestly and honourably for our own people, it behoves my colleagues of the Government to do it so far as others are concerned and not to turn a blind eye while they are expecting me to turn the most scrutinising eye against our own people if they should be in any way in breach of these Conventions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This Vote for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is one that can do a great deal to ensure that we get a better standard of living for our people.  It is one that can do even more to put a brake on any improvement in that standard of living.  I am afraid that it is an obvious commentary on the faith, or the lack of faith, that the Fianna Fáil Party have <Col N="1416" /> in the present incumbent of the position of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that there is not one member of the Fianna Fáil Party here to stand over him in the hash that he has made of our whole business communications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like briefly to refer to a few points that have not been mentioned in this debate.  I want to refer the Minister to the fact that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs must change their methods and their tactics in dealing with wage claims of their staff.  Their present method is outmoded and is not suitable for the year in which we live.  The position was that Department officials met representatives of the unions; they adjourned for some time; met again, had a discussion; they adjourned. There was nothing definite.  That went on for a couple of years until the staff of today, younger men, refused to submit themselves to conditions as they existed in Victorian days.  They decided to take direct action, notwithstanding their unions.</P>
      <P>The difficulties of the unions were caused by the delaying tactics and the methods adopted by the Department.</P>
      <P>The men decided to take matters into their own hands and, after two meetings were held, representative of all the Post Office workers of Ireland, the Department suddenly realised the position, awoke form their slumbers and, within a matter of five or six weeks, granted a concession, which the men refused.  They went to arbitration and refused the award at conciliation level and then there was an award granted by the arbitrator.  That was only as a result of the direct action taken by the staff in refusing to submit to the injustice that had been endured for the past two or three years.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has promised that the claim of Post Office men and telephonists will be considered but is there any justification for the present methods adopted by the Department to keep men waiting for two years for the eighth round which was granted by private employers two or three years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Congratulations have been extended <Col N="1417" /> by Deputies on all sides of the House to the Post Office staff, to the postmen and to the staff in general throughout the country, who are in daily contact with the public.  I am surprised that the reorganisation of auxiliary postmen is not completed in all districts. I carried out reorganisation in a number of districts.  Where there were three auxiliary postmen and one retired, I divided his wages between the remaining two in order to increase their emoluments.  I suggest to the Minister that he should consider that point.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the fact that some postmen work only four or five hours.  I know that at one time while men had only about four hours work, they were ten hours away from their homes.  They had to go out to an area five or six miles away and remain there idle for three or four hours, waiting to take back the letters to their headquarters.  That has been changed now.  Where possible, the Minister should try to reorganise auxiliary postmen so as to provide them with proper wages without involving a charge on the State.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has difficulties in regard to savings.  I appeal to him to fight the Department of Finance and demand an increased rate of interest for depositors in the Post Office Savings Bank, which is a very popular method of saving for the working classes.  Savings committees are being organised in industry through the trade unions, but they are not being given the proper encouragement because they are not being offered a rate of interest similar to that given by the building societies.  The Department of Finance are more concerned with the effect on the banking system. They are afraid that if the rate of interest on deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank is increased, it will have an effect on the banks.  I am certain the Minister will be able to press his case with the Department of Finance to get for the small investors, who cannot deal on the Stock Exchange or avail of National Loans, an interest rate of four per cent the same as that offered by the building societies.</P>
    <P>The Minister should try to get the <Col N="1418" /> Department to change their whole method of dealing with the staff. There is discontent at the manner in which they have been treated.  While there is a temporary lull at present, that will not continue if these men have to wait two or three years to have their demands met.  It is unfortunate that the ordinary postmen, about whom we have heard so much praise, have not yet got the eighth round increase. They have had to meet the increased cost of living with the promise that some day they will get it. I hope the Minister will stir up the conciliation machinery and see that this increase is given.</P>
    <P>I shall not refer to all the matters raised during this debate.  There was talk about delay on the telephones, and one Deputy pointed out that he had to listen to private conversations. All that is understandable at present when we have overhead lines, storms and so on.  If a wire comes in contact with another line, it is sure to affect the call.</P>
    <P>I could not understand a remark the Taoiseach made to the Leader of the Opposition on the Question of telephone tapping.  He said he referred the matter to Deputy Everett.  He knows very well that an ex-Minister will not talk out publicly.  I am satisfied that the Minister does not know anything about this and neither does the Minister for Justice.  There are confidential men in higher quarters for that purpose. It would not come to the Minister's knowledge.  I admit I gave orders, but it was a matter involving the safety of the State, a matter where criminal action was contemplated.  It was only done in those cases.  But I never received&mdash;and I do not think the Minister ever received&mdash;any report. Does anybody object to that?  I certainly could not object, and I do not think any reasonable man could object in the case of criminals out to destroy the Constitution.</P>
    <P>We are told that the Labour men are objecting to increases for the Post Office staff.  They are not. During my days as Minister, I objected to the principle that the Post Office was to be a paying concern.  The Post Office performs a most useful function <Col N="1419" /> for the general public.  I always maintain that, if it were necessary to have the Army and the Garda paid out of taxation, Post Office employees should be paid out of taxation also.  A day will come, probably sooner than we expect, when we will be unable to increase postal charges further.  However, the Minister will get further demands from the staff, and they will have to be met out of taxation.  That is my only objection.  I do not want the Post Office staffs to be told they are responsible for all these increases because of the turnover tax, the 12 per cent increase and so on.</P>
    <P>As one who has had experience of the Minister's problems and one who has had a long connection with the trade union movement, I appeal to the Minister to change the present system in the Post Office.  We know that the threat of dismissal or withdrawal of pension rights will have no effect on the younger men.  I see letters from Post Office men who have grievances. They are determined and prepared, if some change is not made soon, to work as a united team and take action in spite of their union.  That is not what the Minister or the Department want.  They should try to help the unions.  But the unions have not been helped by the Department because of the manner in which they have been treated over the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to bring greater contentment to the staff.  I believe he can do that if he gets rid of the old Victorian ideas, if he has the grievances of the staff considered and a decision made and not have the unions informing the staff that the matter is still under discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear Deputy Everett in good voice.  I should like to agree with him on one matter&mdash;the continuation of the so-called principle that the Post Office should pay for itself.  I have never seen any reason why that practice should be elevated to the level of a principle.  The Government, and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in particular, should reconsider a system which involves, as it has this year, very heavy increases in postal charges. <Col N="1420" /> I very much regret that it has been found necessary on the head of this so-called principle to put up letter post to 5d.  In Britain it is possible to post a letter for 3d.  I fail to see why here, having regard to the circumstances of the ordinary people <i>vis-á-vis</i> their counterparts in Britain, they should be asked to pay almost twice as much.  I also consider the minimum price for parcel postage now excessive.</P>
      <P>What seems to me to have happened is that nobody envisaged the vast expansion in the work and scope of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and, over the years, successive Governments and successive Ministers made insufficient provision for the future. We found ourselves, therefore, facing real chaos in regard to telephones about 18 months ago.  Almost the entire system had broken down.  It was virtually impossible to get a call from any part of the country to any other part of the country.  It was discovered that this was due to an unexpected vast increase in the use of the telephone.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with any Minister who finds himself in the circumstances in which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs then found himself.  Like a man, he went along to the Government and persuaded the Government to make good the deficiencies of the past and to provide him with the money which would in time solve what had obviously become a very difficult problem indeed.  I agree with Deputy Everett when he says that there does not seem to be any principle involved but merely an established practice in regard to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs paying its way.  I regard it as a fluke, and nothing but a fluke, that that Department had sufficient revenue over the years to keep it a viable entity.  It either is a fluke, or it is not, and there either is a principle, or there is not.  If there is, I should very much like to know where that principle is to be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Everett said also, from a practical point of view, we will soon see, if further increases are demanded, whether there is or is not a principle. We will soon see if a further expansion in services becomes a fact and increased costs become necessary, <Col N="1421" /> whether it will be practicable to increase letter or parcel post, or the cost of telephones, without having a very strong public reaction.</P>
    <P>With regard to Telefís Éireann, I hope that in future that body, which has done quite well in the past, will take particular care in the selection of people responsible for interviewing strangers who happen to visit this country.</P>

      <P>I should like to mention an experience I had one evening when watching Telefís Éireann. I became convinced, from the behaviour of certain people, that two very distinguished and cultured visitors were going to be held up to abuse.  On the one and only time in my life, I telephoned Montrose and asked that a message be conveyed to the person in charge of the programme.  My instinct proved to be accurate.  These people were held up to opprobrium in a fashion that made me cringe as an Irishman.  To say, as was said on that evening, that some, or many, of our young Irish boys and girls go unprepared to the type of life they meet in Britain is a sad truth.  It is something in regard to which anybody&mdash;Irish, English, Jewish, or anything else&mdash; who does anything to try to ameliorate conditions deserves our deepest thanks and certainly not the opprobrium of ignorant people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the changes made after 1st January, many of the children's programmes were changed from a very suitable time to a most unsuitable time.  This was remedied to a large extent after a few weeks, presumably as a result of public reaction. May I repeat what I said before with regard to children's programmes? There ought to be a practice of putting on these programmes before 9 o'clock, to conclude not later than 9 o'clock, and the Authority should take the greatest care to ensure that all programmes shown up to 9 o'clock are suitable for children, even those directed at an adult or mixed audience. For some months, there was a series at, I think, 8 o'clock.  It was called <Col N="1422" />&ldquo;Twilight Zone&rdquo;.  It was an appalling programme for any child.  I remember only too well going to see a film called &ldquo;Frankenstein&rdquo; in Galway when I was about 13 years old.  The impact it had on me was dreadful.  I do not think I slept properly for six months afterwards and the horror of the wretched thing is with me to this day.  Some of the features shown in &ldquo;Twilight Zone&rdquo; were equally horrid and should never have been exposed to the gaze of children.  When I say children, I include those up to 16 years of age.</P>
    <P>One programme which was particularly attractive to children was changed to either 10 o'clock or 10.15 p.m. as a result of the New Year changes.  The result was that literally thousands of fathers and mothers had the greatest problem trying to get their children to bed at a reasonable time. It is well known that when children get used to a programme, they like to see the whole series.  These series usually last something like 36 weeks.  If children have seen ten or 15, they want to see the remainder.  They consider it unfair, and so do their parents, that the Authority should suddenly change the programme from 6.30 p.m. to 10 p.m.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters to which I should like to refer with regard to the activities of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs but I do not propose to deal with them now because the Minister has been kept here for such a very long time.  I want to mention the advertisement published earlier this year showing a television set surrounded by a chain held in the hand of a detective, presumably from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I think that was a mistake.  I notice that the threat to confiscate the set was removed the second week the official in question, or whoever he was, was appealing to the public to pay their licence.  It is only right and proper that the public should be made aware of their responsibilities and should discharge their responsibilities, but, as a people, we are rather sensitive about threats such as that contained in the <Col N="1423" /> message given out each evening and depicted on the Department's poster.</P>
    <P>Ireland is one of the countries where grabbing of any kind has a long and unenviable history and where, unlike America, for instance, the system of foreclosure is unknown.  It takes a long legal process eventually to secure any article and to have it taken from a private citizen.  If the Department of Posts and Telegraphs threaten and publish posters showing chains around a television set, it conveys, first of all, a picture which is unfair to the Department inasmuch as the Department would not do that except by due legal process&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his work in the Department.  He is a man who calls a spade a spade and who likes others to do so.  For that reason, I have always found him particularly easy to get on with.  He understands plain language and he speaks it himself. I imagine that he and his Department must get on very well, as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney </NameTxt>
      <P>It is a long time since the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was the subject of such a bad-tempered debate but, on examining what has transpired, I think there is every justification for it. It could be described as the £2 million trick on the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Budget was introduced without any mention of the £2 million which will be taken out of the pockets of certain citizens.  They are the citizens who use these services, both postage and telephone, and the more they avail of these services, the more they <Col N="1424" /> will have to pay, but the services are available to the person who contributes little or nothing, just the same.</P>
    <P>As reported at column 376 of volume 209 of the Official Report of 23rd April, 1964, the Minister said :</P>
    <P>It has been the settled policy of all Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs that the Post Office should pay its way on a commercial basis. A departure from this policy is certainly not warranted now and charges for Post Office services must therefore be increased substantially. Faced with the need to raise well over £2 million in excess of the revenue figure shown in the Book of Estimates, I have to look to basic items of the letter post and the local telephone call.</P>
    <P>That explains the reason for the trend that this debate has taken.</P>
    <P>The Minister says here that the figure was not shown in the Book of Estimates, but why not?  Surely the Minister and his Department knew exactly what the requirement of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was long before the Book of Estimates was printed?  But, instead, it was decided to give the Minister for Finance an opportunity to present a Budget which really misrepresented the situation and they left the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to come in the back door the next day and to demand £2 million&mdash;and how was he to do it, as the previous Deputy mentioned? The first blow was an increase of 1d, to 5d, on the letter post.  After that, the telephone charges were to be increased substantially and, further still, the parcel post.</P>
    <P>The case has been made that in these modern days there is no reason why any Department should pay its way, particularly when it is providing a service for all citizens which is available to them if and when they wish to avail of it.  The people who actually avail of the service and pay dearly for it are the people whom the Minister burdens further by increasing these charges.</P>
    <P>Take a commercial firm which uses postage stamps, telephones and the <Col N="1425" /> parcel post extensively, thus contributing substantially towards the cost of these services.  On the other hand, take the citizen who rarely writes a letter, who rarely sends a telegram, rarely sends a parcel or uses the telephone. Exactly the same services are available to him as to the person who contributes substantially and who is the backbone of the services.  It is time, therefore, for the Minister and his Government to stop talking about any particular Department being run on a commercial basis and being made to pay its way when the citizens have equal rights regardless of the extent to which they contribute to the services.</P>
    <P>What does the 1d extra charge mean even to small commercial firms ? Take a very small firm which three or four years ago was paying £9 a week for postage stamps.  The price of the stamp was raised from 3d to 4d and, by a stroke of the pen, the postage bill of that firm went up from £9 to £12 a week.  Now by a stroke of a pen on Budget day, the Minister increases that firm's postage bill from £12 to £15.  The small commercial firm, in the space of a couple of years, has its post bill alone increased from £9 to £15. One can imagine what the commercial firms with a post bill of £50 or £70 a week think of the increase that has been imposed.</P>
    <P>In addition, postcards have been increased and so has the cost of the newspaper delivery through the post. How will that expense be passed on. Using the letter post is mainly a service and one cannot get back the extra cost of 20 or 40 dozen letters per week. It is quite different when you have goods to sell and can put up the price by a certain amount to meet the increased cost resulting from the imposition. When it comes to providing a service by letter post or by telephone or the parcel post, it is difficult to increase charges.  Take a bank charging, perhaps, 6½ per cent interest on overdrafts. That involves possibly a lot of correspondence.  They cannot put up the bank rate to 6¾ per cent to pay the extra cost of postage and telephones. If they dealt in goods, the <Col N="1426" /> price of the goods could be increased minutely to meet the extra charge.</P>
    <P>In the case of a small firm operating by means of the parcel post, particularly with parcels under 2 lbs., suppose they are paying out £15 a week for postage on parcels not exceeding 2 lbs.  They must now pay £24 a week to send the same number of parcels. That is a very steep increase.  How can they get it back except by increasing the cost of the goods which they distribute through the post?  I could go into other figures in regard to the parcel post but I think the Minister can see that if a small firm paying £15 postage per week must now pay £24 for the same volume of post, it is no wonder the people are up in arms against the increased charges for these services.</P>
    <P>I agree with the suggestion that it is unfair to pick on those who avail of the services to carry the increased burden.  It would be better to spread the burden over all citizens to whom the service is equally available.  The increase falls on those who make the most use of the services which could never have been organised or maintained but for the contribution made by those who avail of them.  It is not the men who write an occasional letter or make an occasional phone call who have given the country the network of services we have.  It is time the Minister realised that instead of attacking&mdash;that is what I call it&mdash;the people actually using the services and taking an extra £2 million from them, he should decide that since the service is available for all citizens, they should contribute to it generally.</P>
    <P>I was surprised that there was no mention of the pirate radio station in the Irish Sea in the Minister's statement. Does the Minister intend to take any action in relation to it?  He did not indicate whether he was for or against it.  I imagine he would be against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins </NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>At least he can make a contribution on an international basis in regard to it.  The Minister knows there has been considerable activity in the British Parliament in <Col N="1427" /> regard to this matter.  Questions have been asked and this station, and its advertising potential particularly have been debated.  I feel the Minister is not &ldquo;with it&rdquo;: if he were, he would have taken action of some kind and would have mentioned it here.</P>
      <P>I was impressed by the previous speaker's remarks.  When we undertook the heavy cost of providing our own television service, we should ensure the best use is made of it and I think in our case the best use is related to its educational aspect.  I am fully in favour of a vigorous swing-over to the use of television for the purpose of educating our young people and giving them every opportunity to learn techniques. Very valuable techniques are televised, making it possible to learn technical subjects through television.</P>
      <P>I feel that if educational programmes were provided all day and made available throughout the country to growing children and if they provided that kind of visual education which television can provide, this would be a very valuable service to the nation and the heavy cost would be justified.  Visual education is first-class from the point of view of getting impressions over to young people.  I have no doubt television would have a terrific impact if educational programmes were shown in the schools.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney </NameTxt>
      <P>While television is not directly under the control of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, at least it is related to his Department and, so far as administration is concerned, I believe the Minister would have considerable influence in regard to television trends as they affect the nation, and particularly in regard to the educational aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have been very slow about insisting on a proper system for the suppressing of interference.  Unfortunate people who have paid a licence for television and expect to get good reception, when they switch on, find their next-door neighbour is shaving, <Col N="1428" /> using a drill or some other hobby gadget.  The result is programmes are made unpleasant for all the neighbours and they are deprived of the service for which they have paid their licence. Proper action has not been taken to make it illegal to use this electrical equipment without fitting suppressors.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister, like everybody else, has tried to use the telephone after the normal working hours. There is a general complaint that people cannot get a reply, although they hold on for a long time.  I suppose the same would apply to the 999 call, except that I presume there is a special staff for that.  Sometimes a person making an ordinary call, perhaps to a doctor, when there is no reply, has to break the call and dial again in the hope that he will get attention on a new board.</P>
    <P>It is possible that there are not enough telephone operators available at night-time to cope with the number of calls coming up on these boards. Certainly some remedy, technical or other, ought to be devised, instead of leaving people with what one might call no service at all at night.  When people dial the exchange, whether it is 0, 10, 31 or 39, they should get an answer within a reasonable time. Otherwise people may not know whether their telephones are working or not.  I am sure if the Minister has tried making a call at night, he will be able to bear out what I am saying in regard to the difficulty of getting a prompt reply after hours.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree there must be an opening here in Dublin city for a private postal delivery service.  I am sure that up to half a million letters a week are delivered around the city through the various branches of the Post Office.  When it costs 5d. to send a letter from one part of the city to another, a situation may arise in which a group will be set up here in Dublin ready to provide a delivery service for letter post at a much smaller cost than 5d.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know that one can telephone from Belfast to London for 4d.  To telephone London from here costs 6/- or 7/-.  There ought to be <Col N="1429" /> some minimum figure for telephoning from Dublin to London instead of the present heavy charge.  This all adds up to the fact that our postal and telephone services are probably the most expensive in the world and certainly the most expensive in Europe, with letter postage gone up to 5d., increased telephone rental charges and call charges, and taking into consideration the kind of service available.</P>
    <P>When the Minister asked for £2 million and set out the very heavy charges which people who avail of these services must pay, he stated that this does not include the 12 per cent wage increase.  Why not ?  Why did the Minister not provide for that in the Budget ?  Surely he knew it was coming ?  He certainly knew at the time of the by-elections that the 12 per cent was coming and told everybody about it.  When the Book of Estimates was being prepared, this 12 per cent should have been included in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has heard plenty about the heavy cost of these services amongst the larger firms which are the backbone in the matter of contributing towards the running of the services.  I am wondering if it would be possible for him to devise some kind of concession to those firms who avail of these services, for instance, a certain charge for the first hundred telephone calls per week, so much less for the second hundred telephone calls, and so on.  Similarly, could he arrange for a graded system of charges for the ordinary letter post, say, a certain charge for the posting of under 50 dozen letters per week, a lesser charge for those who post between 50 dozen and 100 dozen letters per week, and a still lesser charge for those who post anything between 100 dozen and 1,000 dozen letters per week.  Surely he could devise some sort of credit system.  These are the people who are bearing the brunt of these charges, not the people who never use a telephone or post a letter but for whom, nevertheless, the service has to be available. The staff and the engineers and all the technical people are standing by to give service to people who rarely write a letter or use a telephone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" /> The increased charges on the newspapers are ridiculous.  They have an organised postal routine and there is nothing unusual in the service given to them.  There seems to be no reason why the extra charges should be imposed on them, but, again, it is the newspaper people who have to keep the service going for the people who rarely avail of it.  The Minister will agree that as these services are increased, as more letters are sent off, more telephone calls than ever before, one would expect that the costs on the average should be lower.</P>
    <P>During the year, I was in touch with the Department regarding the provision of a parcels van for Balbriggan.  There are five or six factories there, all of which have parcels to post.  Each factory has to hawk them over to the post office where they are stamped and franked and then they have to be hawked by handcart from the post office to the railway station.  That is a very cumbersome method of handling them.  I asked the Department to arrange that the van should call to the factories, pick up the parcels and take them to town but that was not found practicable.  It was stated that the only van going through Balbriggan is full up by the time it gets there and it could not alter its schedule by calling at the factories.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of service that the Department should try to provide.  It should not be impossible for the Department to send a parcels van to the four or five factories in Balbriggan and to the three or four factories in Skerries and so put an end to this donkey-work of hawking parcels to the post office and then hawking them to the railway station.  I know that in Dublin post office vans call and collect parcels from various big firms.  When these vans are available in the country, the Department should try to provide this service.</P>
    <P>No doubt tourists coming to this country this year will be surprised at the cost of sending a postcard to their friends at home.  It is a custom with tourists, whoever they may be, to buy a couple of dozen postcards and send them to their friends.  Now they will <Col N="1431" /> have to pay a further 1d. in postage which was dear enough already.  I am sure they will find that the postage on postcards from this country is the dearest in Europe.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to learn from the Minister that there is practically no prospect of new telephones being provided for the next two years.  In these days of modern living, there is a demand for a telephone.  In other countries such as the Netherlands, for instance, no new house or cottage is built that is not wired for the telephone service because the telephone is considered to be one of the essentials of modern living.  For that reason, it was something of a shock to learn from the Minister that a large number of people will have to wait for at least two years before they get a telephone.</P>
    <P>Here is another shock for people who use the Post Office services.  The large number of people who buy a postal order for a shilling or two every Monday or Tuesday to pay for their entries in the competitions in the Sunday newspapers will find that it will cost them an extra 4d. commission.  It is fantastic to put an increase of 4d. on a one shilling postal order.  All these increased charges are nonsensical. It would seem that the Minister intends to put an end as soon as possible to the sending of telegrams.  In his statement he boasted of having reduced the number of telegrams last year by 100,000.</P>
    <P>I could go on complaining about these matters but it is only when these extra charges are put into effect that the people will realise the heavy impost and the injustice of these proposals. These increases are directed at the people who cannot avoid them, the people who avail of the services and who are the backbone of the services.</P>
    <P>Another matter on which I should like to comment is the late arrival of the post in the rural areas.  In these modern times, the postmen should be so organised as to ensure that they will be able to deliver their post in all areas before midday.  In fact, there are places where people do not see the postman until 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock in the afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish </NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few things I should like to speak about on this Estimate.  It is not an indication that I am going to start off with a tirade of abuse of the Department when I say at the outset that I should like to thank the officials of the Department and, indeed, the Minister, for their courtesy and efficiency in running the Department.  Too few Ministers and too few officials appreciate that comments made, especially in relation to a Department such as this, while they may be critical, are intended to be helpful.  It is in that spirit that I want to approach discussion of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the matters in respect of which the Minister has responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as courtesy and service are concerned, one would have to travel far to find exceeded the behaviour of <Col N="1433" /> telephonists, postmen and all those thousands of officials who are under the Minister's charge.  However, the Department is not an ideal Department and never will be.  There are legitimate criticisms that can be levelled against it, despite the counter-accusations thrown across the House from time to time as to what happened in 1954 or 1957 and what is happening now. What the people cannot understand and what the Minister has failed to explain to the House and the country is the inability to provide an adequate telephone service and by &ldquo;an adequate telephone service,&rdquo; I mean a sufficiency of telephones.</P>
    <P>I had reason personally to complain about service between here and my constituency and within my home town about 12 months ago but, whilst I criticised on that occasion, I should like to acknowledge now an improvement. The situation has changed very much for the better, which goes to show that the questions raised in this House and the comments we made on the Estimate for the Department may have borne some fruit.  In any case, there has been an improvement.  But, again, we still cannot understand why more telephones cannot be provided. There has not been a complete answer to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned in the course of the past 12 months his difficulties with regard to getting the skilled technical staffs, equipment and all that sort of thing.  The position seems to have deteriorated as far as my constituency is concerned because, as a result of a Parliamentary Question which I asked the Minister some time ago, it would seem that the number of telephones being installed in the constituency or in the county of Wexford has diminished over a period of three years.  I would not say that the demand has diminished.  In any case, the Minister has a problem.  I trust that when replying to the debate he will give a more convincing reason as to why there is such a backlog in regard to telephone installations.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make a song and dance about it, but I should like the Minister and his officials to note a <Col N="1434" /> complaint I made some time ago, that is, in regard to undue political influence in the recruitment of workers to the Engineering Section of the Department.  There is a difference, of course, between political influence and political pressure, political pressure being the more objectionable.  I do not think anybody, Minister, Party or individual, will take exception to representations being made to a Minister, or say, to an engineer in charge to take on this man, that man or the other man, but I believe in certain areas there is undue political pressure, which is being yielded to, unfortunately. I remember an occasion in the past two or three years where I tried to get a job for a man who had come back from the Congo.  It was impossible.  He was discharged from the Army after doing his service in the Congo.  It was impossible to fix him up with a labourer's job in the Department. Others who never saw the Army and who were never in or near the Congo, who had no sympathy with those who went to the Congo, could be taken on.  The Minister should watch that particular aspect of his Department, especially in the matter of employment.</P>
    <P>I am told there is procedure through which men must go in order to secure employment but I do know that there is undue political pressure being exercised.  As I said with regard to political influence, representations by a public representative to get a man a job may be all right but when one is told, in effect, that a man must be given a job, or else, that is a different story, but let me not pursue it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Casey has given the complete attitude of the Labour Party with regard to the increase in charges in the Post Office generally in respect of stamps, telegrams, telephones and so on and he has also given the viewpoint very clearly.  With regard to the question of an increase in wages, the defence of the Minister and the defence of the Taoiseach seems to be that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has been tacitly regarded as being a commercial concern, a concern that should be regarded as being self-supporting. He may have accepted that; his Party <Col N="1435" /> may have accepted that.  He tries to make-believe that this has been, in fact regarded as a commercial concern over the years.</P>
    <P>The Road Fund is self-supporting in that the amount of money paid into it from the tax on motorcars is the only amount that is paid to the various local authorities for the making and repair of roads.  It may have been the impression of the Minister and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs that income and expenditure should balance.  If that is their attitude, they would be at one with the members of the Fine Gael Party, some of whom seem to believe that the Post Office should be created or established as a commercial concern.  The Labour Party entirely disagree with that point of view.  We believe that the Department should be regarded in the same way as any other Department.  We do not think that the postmen, the telephonists and all the various clerks in the Post Office should be blackmailed to the extent of the public telling them, through the Minister and the Taoiseach, that they could get their increase in wages only if the public are prepared to pay for an increase in the price of the stamp or in the price of the telephone.</P>
    <P>We regard the Department as a service, the same as any other Department of State is a service to the public. If Fianna Fáil want to pursue their attitude, let them defend it but we will oppose the Department being run as a commercial concern.  That attitude is not peculiar to the Minister's Party.  I heard expression of the same opinion from members of the Fine Gael Party. We want it to remain as a Civil Service Department.  If the postmen, clerks or telephonists want an increase in wages, they should be considered, not in relation to postal or telephone charges, but at Budget time when taxation generally is being imposed. They should not be in the position of having those to whom they deliver letters saying to them : &ldquo;We had to pay 5d. for a stamp because you wanted an increase in wages.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to support strongly the plea <Col N="1436" /> made concerning auxiliary postmen.  It may be true, as the Minister has suggested, that they are receiving a reasonable hourly rate.  But when one looks at it as a weekly wage&mdash;and to many hundreds of these workers, it is a weekly wage&mdash;one can only conclude it is inadequate.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question recently, the Minister referred to the wages and the hours worked.  He suggested their remuneration was not unreasonable, having regard to the number of hours they worked.  He should also appreciate that these men should be compensated for their availability.  Many people in the State receive a full week's wages for what might be described as a short week, but they are paid that wage because they are available to do this work.  If the Minister and the Government do not decide to compensate these people adequately, they might arrive at the stage where they would have nobody to do the job.  That may be a fantastic claim.  Everybody accepts that there is a flight from the land, and the Ministers have pointed out that it is evident in some degree all over the world.  Rural postmen and those who aspire to be rural postmen&mdash;it is not a very high aspiration, in view of the wages paid&mdash;will not be content to work for anything from £4 to £8 per week.</P>
    <P>The situation so far as auxiliary postmen are concerned was revealed in a reply to a Parliamentary Question tabled yesterday by Deputy Desmond. He asked the Minister to state increases that had been given to the various categories of auxiliary postmen. The number who received an increase of £1 as a result of the national wage agreement was nil. Therefore, I assume there is no auxiliary postman receiving £8 per week.  There were six who received an increase of 18/- but less than £1.  That suggests there are six in the whole country who have approximately £7 4s. per week.  There were 631 who received an increase of 16/-but less than 18/-, which means that 631 had approximately £6 8s.  The figures I quote as wages do not include the recent increases given.  There were 851 who received 14/- but less than 16/-, which would mean their <Col N="1437" /> wage was £5 12s. and that they now have something like £6 6s. per week. These are rough and ready figures, but I think they are approximate enough.</P>
    <P>These are the people the Minister says work 30 or 35 hours or so per week.  He suggested that this is part-time employment.  The Minister is a sensible man because he comes from the rural areas.  By &ldquo;rural areas&rdquo;, I mean that part of Ireland outside Cork and Dublin.  He knows it is impossible to get part-time employment.  It may be that some of these auxiliary postmen have small holdings.  Between their wages as postmen and the income they may get from those small farms, they may have reasonable incomes. But that is not the point.  To say this is only part-time work and the man can get other employment is not good enough.  If we want auxiliary postmen, even if they work only 25 or 35 hours a week, we should pay them a weekly wage and compensate them for their availability.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to pursue the matter further.  I would ask the Minister, if he has any doubts, to establish some committee representative of his Department and the union catering for these workers to evolve some scheme which will ensure they will have a weekly wage at least equivalent to that received at present by road workers and agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>I would also support the plea made for the issue of a decent type of uniform for postmen.  The present uniform is outdated.  None of us is too fashion-conscious, I suppose, but we all recognise how out-dated the postman's uniform is.  The &ldquo;Oxford Bags&rdquo; were popular 30 or 40 years ago.  To-day it is pathetic to see postmen going around in these sailors' trousers.  I do not know whether they have them in Dublin.  Certainly, I see them in the country.  They look ridiculous.  I do not suggest they should get uniforms costing as much as Saville Row suits, but their uniforms should be smart; and they cannot be smart with the present design and material.</P>
    <P>So far as television is concerned, as Deputy A. Barry said recently, you can have 144 opinions about Telefís Éireann.  I do not want to tell them <Col N="1438" /> how they should run their station or what programmes they should put on. However, I still adhere to my original belief that, while the Director and the Authority are responsible for the programmes, we, as the liaison between the public and them, are entitled to express our viewpoint.  There is a responsibility on the Director General and the other directors to listen to the viewpoint of the people.</P>
    <P>There are newspaper critics of television. I believe they were very fair to Telefís Éireann in the initial stages and gave them a chance.  Now they are critical.  They criticise efficiently and give praise also where praise is due. These are columnists.  I will not say they are doing this for a living; they are experts at their job, whether it be music, drama or sport.  But we are the public representatives who meet the people.  They tell us what they think about &ldquo;Mr. Ed.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Father Knows Best&rdquo; or the sports programmes.  We try to represent that point of view in Dáil Éireann to ensure that the public will be given what they want.</P>
    <P>This is a commercial station.  They have to have regard to the opinions of the public.  As a commercial station, they are dependent to a great degree on advertising for their revenue.  If the programmes are not good, the advertisements are useless, because there will be no audience for either the programmes or the advertisements.  Mark you, in a big portion of the country in recent times, audiences have a choice. In many parts, they have a choice of three other stations, UTV, ITV Welsh and BBC.  I am sure the advertisers have an interest in the type of programme produced in Telefís Éireann and are conscious of the kind of programme best suited to the public taste. I do not think the Director, therefore, and those under him, can afford to act as virtual dictators in regard to the type of programme they put on.  I do not suggest they do that, but, if they do not listen to the critics in the newspapers and the critics, helpful or otherwise, in Dáil Éireann, there is a possibility they may lose revenue in that they may lose their advertisers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1439" /> I have commented on individual programmes before and I think the Minister knows my tastes, not that he is interested in them, I am sure, and neither need he be, but there have been criticisms with regard to the half-hour shows on Telefís.  Of course, what is one man's meat is another man's poison.  Some may like &ldquo;Mr. Ed.&rdquo;. Deputy A. Barry likes &ldquo;Bat Masterson&rdquo; and Deputy Colley, I think, likes &ldquo;Father Knows Best&rdquo;.  I would not challenge these likes or dislikes but these weekly features can be dragged on for too long.  &ldquo;Father Knows Best&rdquo; has been running now for two-and-a-half years and, whether he does or not, I think we have had enough of that programme.  The longer these programmes go on, the quicker they will lose their audience.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann are to be congratulated on the good things they have done in recent times.  One of the most worthwhile programmes was the Eurovision relay of &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo;.  I do not know how expensive that was, but I know many people were astonished to discover it was midnight when it finished, they enjoyed it so much.  I trust the Director General and the Director of Programmes will explore the possibility of participating in shows like that, if the price is right.</P>
    <P>There have been many criticisms of the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;.  It is an extremely popular show and it is performed in a very competent manner. The one thing that has annoyed people in recent times is the tendency&mdash;perhaps it is unconscious&mdash;to insult or belittle people who appear on the show.  A great many of them behave rather like a man&mdash;I cannot think of his name at the moment&mdash;who indulged in cutting down to the very bone, as it were.  The &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; is not an inquisition.  Those who come to be interviewed come in good faith.  I do not know whether they receive a fee, but, if they do, I am sure it is not a very big one.  Those from abroad are thrilled to sit before an Irish television camera.  I have seen an American who had not been in the country for the past 50 or 60 years and <Col N="1440" /> he was thrilled to the marrow because he was here amongst those he regarded as Irish friends, before an Irish camera.  He wanted to show how glad he was to be here and to give his image of Ireland.  Unfortunately, the image he wanted to preserve was destroyed by some insulting remark. Those in charge should ensure that, while the questions may be searching in order to elicit opinions, they should not be embarrassing or put for the purpose of showing how clever the questioner is.  They are mainly ordinary people being questioned by professionals, or at least by those who have been on the show five or six times and are accustomed to being before television cameras.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute&mdash;I always make a point of this&mdash;to Radio Éireann.  I do not think we appreciate the efforts of Radio Éireann in trying to provide good programmes.  I have heard it compared with Radio Luxembourg in this House, to the BBC Light Programme, to the Third Programme and the Home Service, and so on.  There has always been criticism that Radio Éireann does not do this or that, supply this or supply that.  I live in Wexford and I have some difficulty with regard to reception.</P>

      <P>Underdeveloped areas. Radio Éireann gives a good cross-section programme and people should not belittle it.  It has always worked under tremendous difficulty, the problem being the inadequacy of the premises in Henry Street.  The musical programmes are good.  The talks <Col N="1441" /> and plays are up to the best standards. We get very little music from Telefís Éireann.  I have children and I know that children prefer Freddy and the Dreamers to John McCormack or Chaliapin, but I think we are getting a surfeit of what is called &ldquo;pop&rdquo;. Saturday afternoon can be very enjoyable, but the situation is impossible from about 5 or 6 o'clock until 7 o'clock, with Telefís Éireann competing with UTV and the BBC.  They do not go in for &ldquo;pop&rdquo; so consistently as the other stations, but there is still too much of it.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister was a jazz fiend in the Twenties.  He shakes his head.  His contemporaries were jazz fiends.  We were Bing Crosby men and Frank Sinatra men.  There was an attempt by Radio Éireann then and by our parents to introduce us to reasonably good music.  Telefís Éireann are doing little or nothing in that respect. It may be said that sound is the next best medium for giving this better type of music, whether Irish, continental, operatic or symphonic.  But Telefís Éireann could contribute something and certainly could continue using the symphony orchestra.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to answer the specific question when replying whether it is difficult or expensive for Telefís Éireann to use the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra or the Radio Éireann Light Orchestra on television.  The symphony orchestra was used, I think, last year or the year before to great effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I start off where the Leader of the Labour Party finished. There are a tremendous number of things about Radio Éireann that merit very laudatory comment.  Before we get into the laudatory session, I must start with my annual request for information as to when the people of my constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;can hope to get reasonable reception from Radio Éireann.  Very big technical problems are involved and we have got repeated assurances that some amelioration of <Col N="1442" /> the situation is under way but the time has come for the Minister to give us an indication of the foreseeable prospects.</P>
      <P>I was interested to find that Deputy Corish, like myself, has a very high appreciation of the standard of music of Radio Éireann.  It would be very difficult to deny to the Radio Éireann orchestras the quality and the standard they have achieved.  In the south of Ireland, we have been particularly appreciative of their concerts, in Cork in particular.  The Minister must be well aware that nowhere will the orchestra do better or get a greater reception than in the south.</P>
      <P>Taking the combination of the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra, the Radio Éireann Light Orchestra and the String Quartet, I have often wondered why we have not been able to persuade Telefís Éireann to give us occasional worthwhile interludes by any one of this particular trio of very successful and very high standard orchestras.  I know perfectly well that the &ldquo;pop&rdquo; idea is endemic at the moment.  We do not suffer from quite the same frenzied variety as Deputy Corish does because, in the south, we receive only Telefís Éireann&mdash;and the Minister indicated to me, in answer to questions, that he has no intention of making any arrangements to make other television channels available to us.</P>
      <P>At the moment, particularly on Telefís Éireann, we are left with too much emphasis on two contrasting styles of music, without being given a fairly reasonable amount of what I would consider good occasional entertainment music.  We now have a kind of tug-o'-war going on between ola-goning ballad singing and those &ldquo;Picking the Pops&rdquo;.  I suppose it is necessary that the programme must cater for all sections but some of the improvement in Telefís Éireann programmes could become more rapid if more stress were laid on these types of informative and worthwhile general knowledge programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that Telefís Éireann &mdash;with.  I am sure, the enthusiastic help of the Minister&mdash;has proved, as I felt it would when I raised the question some time ago, very effective in <Col N="1443" /> the educational field.  Its programmes are certainly of immense value and are a tremendous credit to the producers. They aroused quite an amount of favourable comment not only at home but outside home on the approach of Telefís Éireann to the educational programme.</P>
    <P>It may well be that this idea of programme casting and the nature of the programme may primarily be within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Education but it is a very helpful thing to see that the medium of television has been used and has proved so effective. I hope that there will be an expansion of this type of programme which is so informative and helpful to the young.  A series of programmes should be made available for the information and education of adults.  In this modern time of stress and strain, there are many programmes on home techniques whether it be in carpentry or knitting, cooking, or that kind of thing, which can be of immense interest and value.  It may be odious to mention people but one must realise how appreciative the womenfolk are of Monica Sheridan's Kitchen and the types of home hints given on that programme.</P>
    <P>I shall not be supercritical of Telefís Éireann.  I know there is a great deal of bias in it but they are suffering from growing pains and they will get over them.  The Government may unconsciously feel that Telefís Éireann is a plaything in which they can project their views or, in some insidious way, project a political bias, but, again, people will see through that and eventually the service will grow up into a service for all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>There has been, and it would be remiss not to say so, a substantial improvement since the beginning of last year in the general programmes of Telefís Éireann.  In particular, there has been a tremendous improvement in their outside broadcasting and in its presentation.  To that extent, it would be unfair not to pay a tribute to them for the standard they have set.</P>
    <P>Looking at the programmes of other <Col N="1444" /> stations when I am here in Dublin and around the area, I sometimes feel satisfied that, within the limited resources available, Telefís Éireann have built, in general, a worthwhile type of programme and style of programme. However, having dealt with the credits they deserve, let me say that it is time they recast in some way their method of commercial interjection.  It is not easy to stomach it at any time but we seem to have succeeded in achieving the most insidious and invidious way of interrupting the most interesting programmes with the most puerile rubbish to which we have to listen in commercials.</P>
    <P>I do not know what new method can be devised but certainly there were programmes of quality and purpose in recent months on Telefís Éireann which were completely destroyed by this quarter-hour or 20-minute intermission with cats dancing around the place or some such stupid nonsense. I do not know what technical difficulties in regard to the dissemination of advertising may arise for Telefís Éireann but I earnestly appeal to them to try to let us have broadcasts of worthwhile Eurovision programmes and programmes tying up with big events with the minimum of commercials, except before and after, so that we shall not have appalling interjections in the middle of programmes of very strong interest.</P>
    <P>We must come back to the mundane problems of the Department proper.  The Minister, of course, will get no orchids from anybody on his position at the moment.  He has been put in the invidious position of being a subsidiary Minister for Finance and he has to come here and levy in a rather brutal way a very large sum of money to maintain his Department.  I think it is true of our people that it is not the levies and the increased prices that incense them as much as what they are not getting.  It is the backlog and the inefficiency of the Department that create the greater distress.  I have heard the Minister, in public and private, describe the problem of modernising and properly equipping the Post Office as an immense task. To get the equipment required, the <Col N="1445" /> automatic exchange system, and instal a modern, fully-diffused telephone system would cost a sum running into millions of pounds but I cannot understand why we should not face that fact, why we have this kind of expediency approach to a problem that should obviously be dealt with on a capital basis with a funding and a spreadover that would enable the equipment to be supplied and its cost included in capital outlay to be recovered over the period of its useful life.</P>
    <P>I feel, not that the Department should be converted into a commercial concern, but that it should be made run itself as a commercial concern. The best counterpart would probably be the ESB.  In their case, when large capital investment and expenditure were necessary, they were able to raise their own loans guaranteed by the Government and fund them for repayment. You will not make progress with a haphazard policy in the capitalisation programme that is necessary for the new installations that are imperative if we are to have an efficient postal and telephone service.  Whether the Department likes to believe it or not, there is chaos in our telephone system.  I do not know what technical difficulties have arisen but the amount of wire-crossing and the interference one encounters on picking up a telephone that is meant to be free, is staggering.</P>
    <P>We suffer occasionally in Cork from a breakdown in the cable between Cork and Dublin.  I do not know why, but recently this kind of technical breakdown has become more frequent and the lines are temporarily out of order. You get a recorded voice saying that if you want to dial somebody urgently, you should ring the operator, and pay double for it.  That is what I cannot understand&mdash;why we must become the victims of double charges for something over which we have no control. If a line becomes overloaded and if you want to get an urgent call to Dublin, you must pay double.  I do not understand the principle behind that particularly as, inevitably, it is the person who is using the trunk line <Col N="1446" /> most frequently who may have the necessity to make the urgent call.</P>
    <P>In general, I think subscribers are very fair in their approach to the Department and there is no doubt, whoever is the inspiration of it, that there is tremendous courtesy shown by the officials when you harangue them about your difficulties.  Courtesy wears very thin, however, when the time involved and the delays become greater and greater.  That is one thing that aggravates subscribers, particularly in Cork city and county in regard to modern telephone services.  If for some reason completely outside the subscriber's control there is a temporary breakdown on the line, and you want to get an urgent call to Dublin, you must pay through the nose for it.  The Department will have to reassess that situation.</P>
    <P>While I do not agree with Deputy Rooney that it would be practical to work out a scheme in relation to the number of letters and the cost of postage, scaling down as the number of letters goes up, I think there is a very practical procedure open to the Post Office if they learn from the ESB and find a way by which after a certain number of units have been used on the automatic line, your calls cost less. This would be like the system the ESB have worked out, whereby after a certain number of units the price goes down and a further increase in units brings the price down further.  In other words, as your consumption increases, there is recognition of that in the diminishing unit charge.  That could be very reasonably applied to telephone subscribers and subscribers who are using their phones very extensively should be entitled to a reduction in the rate at the upper end of their usage.  Strictly speaking, it is not the limited social user of the telephone who carries the burden of the service but the person using it extensively in business.</P>
    <P>I shall not be highly critical of the Minister in regard to delays in telephone installations if he can give me any practical reason why he cannot get the instruments.  I believe that with the development of the new bakelite <Col N="1447" /> type of instrument, it should be possible, and is possible, to get delivery of these instruments, ordered in large quantities.  Is it the actual instruments themselves ?  Or is there some installation difficulty or some lack of cable or line ?  Is that the real explanation ?</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary that no matter what the Minister tries to tell us in bland answers, and assurances of all consideration and reasonable despatch, in my constituency people have been waiting for years for connections they have not yet got.  It is all right to tell me that some places are isolated and difficult to get at, but surely if we are genuine in our efforts to try to ameliorate the lot of the people in rural Ireland, to try to keep employers active in the rural areas, and to try to keep the people in the rural areas, we should provide what are now normal modern amenities for these people.  I never back away from cost when cost is necessary, but, as I said at the outset, I feel that if we are to face the problem of re-equipping and modernising, the method adopted by the Minister on this occasion is no solution to our problem, because obviously it is trying to make current earnings pay for substantial capital outlay, which is nonsense.</P>
    <P>What justification can the Department give for the fantastic rises in charges?  I do not know how the figure of an increase of £3 for basic rentals was arrived at, but it seems to me to be no better than a kind of haphazard guess.  I should like to hear the Minister justify the amount of the increase, and also justify the differential between the increase for one type of subscriber and another.  It may be only a paltry 10/- in the year.</P>
    <P>I have considered very carefully whether the Minister is doing an immense disservice to the Department by the steep rise in letter posting costs. That will definitely force business people to adjust their approach to letter posting and to the use of stamps at all.  I have heard discussions among some of my friends in business who extensively used postage for the purpose of what might be described as the short haul&rdquo; delivery of letters around <Col N="1448" /> the city.  When they figured out the increased cost, they found it would be infinitely more practical to get a small scooter and pay a man to deliver them rather than pay the Post Office.  With a 100 dozen or 200 dozen letters pouring out in a week, it would be cheaper for them to have the letters delivered than to pay the Post Office.  Any such development will take the sweetest part of the cake from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>There certainly should be some method of differentiating between cost of delivery within the city and the general over-all cost of delivery throughout the country.  Someone is not thinking.  The Department are taking the easy way out.  Someone does not want to get down to realising that there are two completely different problems which are aggravated, as suggested by Deputy Rooney, by the increased impost on newspaper delivery through the post.  Someone has not sat back and taken a look at the situation, and realised that, in so far as the main bulk of postal delivery in the populous areas of Dublin, Waterford, Cork and Limerick is concerned, there is a necessity for an adjustment between the charges for posting within the greater metropolitan areas and the country generally.  I am advocating all this because I can see dangers and difficulties in the future for this system.  If it is now to become part of a pattern of Government expenditure, we will have the Department of Posts and Telegraphs continuing in the role of tax designers and tax collectors.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see a more modern approach to, and a better variety in our stamps.  I should like to see some of the characteristic features of certain developments in the country portrayed on our stamps.  I should like to see a good deal more public competition in the design of our stamps. That is a feature the Department have not developed properly.  We should move with the modern trend of using our stamps to show significant features of our national development.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with some of the problems that are apparently endemic in my constituency and I want to ask <Col N="1449" /> the Minister to review the letter delivery times, particularly in the Adrigole and Castletownbere areas. Adrigole in particular has its problems and there is one glaring problem that is causing immense disquiet in the Keimaneigh area in regard to deliveries. I do not think it is the fault completely of the Department.  The fact is an additional auxiliary postman is required in that area if there are to be reasonable deliveries.  Anybody in the postal department who has any southern slant knows that down in the Keimaneigh area, you are getting into the fastnesses of Gougane Barra and that semi-paradise that I usually speak of on the Estimate dealing with the Tourist Board.  People in the area are grumbling about the fact that letters are delivered at uncertain times and in a sporadic manner. There is no involvement in this of the local postmistress, and I would ask the Minister to have a general review of these isolated areas where special consideration has to be given.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what are the prospects in relation to the backlog in applications for telephones in South-West Cork.  I know that where gangs have gone back into certain town areas and places contiguous to Skibbereen, Clonakilty and Bantry, it has been possible to get a number of connections made but it is the places a little outside the perimeter of these sub-main offices that I want to know about and when they can hope to have connections there.  The people seeking telephones are farmers doing agricultural contracting, or young farmers doing a great deal of stock buying.  Every time you meet these people, they ask why they cannot get special consideration.  I am not suggesting that the Department is not doing its best but I am anxious to know when most of this backlog will be cleared up.  I know that the same situation exists in every constituency but I suppose our instinct as Deputies is to father our own child and it is in that spirit that I am asking the Minister to have a look at these problems. Your excuses wear a bit thin, even to your most enthusiastic supporter, when the excuses are repeated for years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1450" /> I feel that the Minister should have fought for a completely new approach to his problem rather than have this dull kind of expediency approach that we have.  We should be adult enough to realise that the telephone service has been creaking for years and we should be making worthwhile efforts to try to get an alternative system while the old system can still continue to bear some of the brunt.  The longer we delay in facing up to the problem of re-equipment, the more outmoded, outworn and unsuitable the existing service will become.  The Minister and his advisers should start considering a positive and effective plan and indicate the cost and the return they will get for the investment.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the question of making the Post Office a commercial undertaking, I feel perfectly sure that if an effort is made to fund it in a different way, the response of the public will be very good, particularly the response of telephone subscribers. When one realises that we are in a spiral of rising costs for all types of technical equipment, one then realises we will have to start thinking on this line quickly if we are to think at all. The Department has to face up to the fact that there is a limit beyond which it will be very unwise to go in the spiral of increased postage costs, telephone costs, telegram costs, or any other type of charge and the only way in which you can restore public confidence in the Department is by giving efficiency by way of return for your increased punitive charges.</P>
    <P>Even in the present situation, it should be possible to eliminate a lot of the overloading and the difficulty that has been created in regard to telephone calls.  It would be well worth the Department's time considering Deputy Sweetman's suggestion that there should be a distinction between peak and off-peak periods and that information should be available for subscribers as to when they are likely to get improved or more rapid connections, particularly in regard to trunk and foreign calls.</P>
    <P>There is not sufficient reciprocity between the British Post Office and our own in regard to postal deliveries, <Col N="1451" /> not so much outside London which was the problem referred to by Deputy Sweetman, but in the Midlands and the North of England where you have this delay of upwards of two days before letters are delivered to people there.  The Minister may tell me there has been an immense increase in the volume of traffic, but surely the number of employees and the system of sorting and of delivery have expanded to such an extxent that there should not be any real difficulty in providing a 24-hour service in respect of mails posted before 6 p.m.</P>
    <P>These problems are worth examining. Every increase in efficiency in the delivery of the mails, every improvement in the telephone service, will go some way towards restoring goodwill between the public and the Department which is becoming the butt of jokes about inefficiency.  The Department alone can remedy that.  The remedy will have to be something more than a courteous admission of inability to do anything.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister's excuse about lack of equipment and lack of personnel will carry much weight any longer.  Would the Minister let us know why there is everincreasing difficulty in getting telephone connections; would he let us know the justification for the tremendously steep increase in costs, particularly in the low weight parcel range, apart altogether from letters?  Would he let us know on what basis or estimate the Department arrived at the conclusion that the steep increases have become necessary?  Unless such disclosures are made, it will be impossible to get the public to believe there is any justification for this type of savage, punitive estimate, this thirsty, hungry chase after taxation which the Minister for Finance has delegated to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs because he did not want to face it himself in his Budget.</P>

      <P>The State has a monopoly in relation to our postal services and it therefore is proper for Deputies to express in this debate any <Col N="1452" /> criticisms they may have with regard to the manner in which postal and allied services are provided in the country.  The major concern of most Deputies this year is the fact that the Minister has, as a result of a Government decision, decided substantially to increase postal charges.  To find, as the people will now, that a 5d post is to become the normal one is certainly a very intimidating departure by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I believe that in England at the moment the 3d stamp carries a letter from England or to anywhere inside Britain.  To impose a 5d charge here is not merely asking the people to pay for a service.  It is imposing taxation. As a manner of taxation, it is particularly regressive because it does not take into account, as any just system of taxation should, the ability of the people to pay the charge exacted.  It is wrong that poor people, people of slender means indeed, have now to pay a charge which some years ago would have been regarded as fantastic, for a stamp.</P>
      <P>In this respect, we on this side of the House can merely ventilate the sense of indignation which people feel and do our utmost by what we say here and by the manner we vote here to get this impost withdrawn.  I do not imagine the Minister or the Government will alter their decision.  It is wrong that a charge of this kind should be suddenly announced without any real case being made for it, but certainly, in so far as it is an extra burden on every person in the country, irrespective of his or her means, it is a type of taxation that appears to us to be wrong.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the other increased charges announced by the Minister.  It appears to me that a telegram will shortly be a thing of the past.  The charges for telegrams are outrageous already and I cannot see what justification there is for the very large increases to be imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, it appears to me that the charge in respect of telephone installation is one which is utterly excessive. It would appear to have been announced without any care or consideration <Col N="1453" /> of the cost involved.  It is interesting to note there are close on 14,000 applications for telephones and that many of them have been pending for as long as three years.  I do not know what the situation will be in regard to these pending applications, but if the people have had their applications delayed merely for the purpose of making them pay the new installation charges, that again is unjust.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to one or two other points before I come to deal with some of the matters raised in relation to Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann.  I have received numerous complaints which, perhaps, the Minister might care to deal with later. They relate to the difficulty of making trunk calls, particularly at night.  I am informed one of the reasons is that the major telephone exchanges are not adequately staffed for night calls. That is a matter which has been raised from time to time.  It is certainly one which should receive attention from the Minister.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) All land which has been sold within the eighteen months preceding the coming into operation of this Act shall be inspected by the Land Commission with a view to acquisition.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was suggesting to the Minister that if he were prepared to agree to have another look at this amendment, he might in some way meet our wishes.  We do not want to make the position impossible because I quite agree that if the Bill were passed now, there might be extreme <Col N="1454" /> difficulty in going back for 18 months to find out who bought or sold land.  However, in view of the fact that the Bill is making such slow progress through the House, if the Minister started making a list of purchases or sales of lands now, he might have it up to date by the time the Bill became law.</P>
      <P>In any event, the Minister himself might possibly consider amending the section.  If he is prepared to state that the Land Commission have the right to put a stay on attempted sales until they inspect the land, then he should be with us in the principle that in regard to sales which have taken place, many of them, if you like, shotgun sales that took place as soon as the people who owned the land found the Land Commission were interested in the land, the Land Commission should have the option of acquiring these farms.</P>
      <P>A difficulty I see in this regard is that, even though the Minister would have the right to do this, it may happen that aliens, in particular, who come to this country, and purchase land which was being badly used, by carrying out a certain amount of activity, may be able to make a strong case to the Minister why he should not acquire the land, whereas the section gives him the right to look at the land and put the matter back for 18 months or for some other period. Perhaps the matter could be settled in that way.  Anyway I do not intend to press the amendment, if the Minister is not prepared to accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly could not support this amendment because it would not be right or proper for the Land Commission to interfere with genuine sales of land that have taken place.  Where it has been established that congestion existed or where a farm had been sold which had been on the records of the Land Commission for division, in the event of the sale taking place within a period of 12 or 18 months, most certainly it would be right for the Land Commission to investigate the merits of the case which the local applicants had made in regard <Col N="1455" /> to the acquisition and division of such a farm, provided the Minister was satisfied that the area could be described and scheduled as a congested district.  However, I should be very slow, and I hope the Minister will be slow, to instruct the Land Commission to investigate the many sales of land which have taken place where there is no question of land agitation.</P>
      <P>Many small and other holdings have exchanged hands and the sales took place simply because the owner was retiring from farming or the owner died, or some other reason was involved.  It would be wrong, in the absence of agitation for the division of land, to have such land inspected, and if such land were inspected, it would immediately reduce the value of land on the public market.  The result would be a very serious financial loss for the vendor.  The less interference the State has with property the better.</P>
      <P>I am surprised at a man of the experience and intelligence of Deputy Tully asking the Minister to accept an amendment such as this, and I am glad that, after consideration, he has agreed to withdraw it.  I certainly feel more happy about the situation since he has indicated his intention to withdraw it.  There are many instances where holdings which are already on the records of the Land Commission and under consideration for acquisition have changed hands.  In those cases I am certainly with Deputy Tully but the amendment to which he has just spoken does not cover those.  As the amendment stands, I could not subscribe to it, but I should be very glad to hear the Minister express an opinion on this matter.</P>

      <P>I have much sympathy with the object behind this amendment and share the view which was undoubtedly in the drafters' minds when this amendment was put down.  However, it would be impracticable to give effect to it.  It is true that a number of sales have taken place in anticipation of this Bill, that a number of people have jumped the gun to deprive the Land Commission <Col N="1456" /> of lands in which they knew the Land Commission were interested and which were on the Land Commission records. That is one matter, but it is quite a different thing to write into the Statute Book that the Land Commission must investigate every single sale that has taken place in the past 18 months.  It would be impossible to do that and in cases in which the Land Commission were not interested, cases which were not on the Land Commission register of absentee owners, it would be unjustifiable to investigate these.</P>
      <P>When this Bill becomes law, those blatant cases that were on the Land Commission's books can be reconsidered and the situation assessed then. It may be possible to have a limited look at those that were on the Land Commission's records over a number of years.  If there is a practical way of doing that, I can assure the Deputy I shall look into it between now and the final Stages of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister, but perhaps he is giving a different interpretation to the words &ldquo;shall be inspected by the Land Commission&rdquo; in the amendment.  It all depends on what &ldquo;inspection&rdquo; means. The Minister is well aware that some of the inspections of the Land Commission are simply inspections from a Dublin office.  Nobody goes walking the land with a stick to find out what type of land it is.  Perhaps the Minister is taking a different view from that which we intended.  However, I am always happy to make Deputy O. Flanagan happy and, therefore, I do not intend to pursue this matter. Nevertheless, it is wrong we should suggest that the only land in which the Land Commission should be interested is land about which there is agitation. If that were to be the case, then local people would be agitating and, as I have often complained, the migrants would take over.  The question of agitation should not come into this at all. Either the land should be taken by the Land Commission and they should get all the power they need to do it, or they should not take it, and then there should be no undue interference.  I am glad the Minister has assured me this <Col N="1457" /> matter can be dealt with in some other way, and I accept that assurance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;()  No person or trust shall be permitted to purchase more than one hundred and fifty statute acres of arable land after the passing of this Act.  Non-nationals shall not be permitted to purchase more than ten statute acres of arable land except for industrial purposes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are told that this section is a very drastic section which will have a very big effect on the farmers but I should like to put a few facts before the House.  The Minister has said again and again that at the present time 45 acres of mixed land is a viable farm. I like that word.  If 45 acres is a viable farm, is there any good reason why somebody who has 150 acres should be entitled to buy up more land?  That is what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find that while the Land Commission and the Minister are complaining that the pool of land available for acquisition is becoming <Col N="1458" /> smaller every year, nevertheless, individuals are being allowed to buy up land that comes on the market, thereby making the amount of land available for acquisition smaller.  That kind of thing is an inroad on the pool of land available and should be stopped and stopped now.  Any man with 150 acres of land should be able to live on it and rear his family on it.  We have been used to the idea that anything from 15 to 30 acres of good land is a farm and in my constituency there are hundreds of migrants making an excellent living on farms of 15 to 30 and 35 acres. It all depends on the type of farmer you are and the type of land you are farming.  There is no suggestion in this amendment that we should interfere with the ownership of land already in the possession of any individual.</P>
    <P>The second part of the amendment deals with non-nationals.  At one time the Minister said that the question of the purchase of land by non-nationals was not a matter of grave importance. However, gradually the tone changed and bit by bit it was admitted that for every five acres of land acquired by the Land Commission a non-national purchases one acre.  In that way, the pool of land available for acquisition and to give land to our own people is being further reduced by people who have no right whatever to acquire such land.</P>
    <P>Last night, I heard the Minister become quite annoyed with somebody who made the suggestion that non-nationals should not be allowed to acquire land in this country and he said that Irish nationals would be allowed to acquire land in Britain or America.  But he did not go on to deal with the continent of Europe and say what would happen if Irish people went to buy land in Holland, Belgium, France or Germany.  He did not say what land Irish people could acquire in these countries.  There has been a lot of talk about what would happen if we joined EEC but the Minister did not tell us what land we could acquire in these countries or what qualifications we would need before we could get even one acre.</P>
    <P>The reason the purchase of land by <Col N="1459" /> non-nationals in this country is limited to ten acres in the amendment is that we have a number of big estates and the Land Commission find, when such an estate is acquired, that there is usually a big house on it which is very little use to anybody.  There was a time when certain religious orders were prepared to take possession of these houses but the supply of such orders seems to have run out and there is nothing the Land Commission can do except demolish the house.  Our suggestion is that if non-nationals want to live in Ireland, let them buy these houses and have with them ten acres of parkland but no more.</P>
    <P>That would solve the problem of the Land Commission with regard to the houses and it would also solve the problem of the acquisition of big estates by people who have no right to purchase such land while we have people hungry for land and able and willing to work it.  All the available land that can be taken without hardship from the people who are in possession of it should be so taken and given to the people who need it immediately.  It should not be allowed to pass to aliens who come in here and who, even if they leave it there for only a few years, come back and hope to sell it at a substantial profit to someone from their own countries who wants to have a gamble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the first part of the amendment. I do not think it is right that the State should intervene to restrict the amount of property which any person should have.  If we have reached the stage in this country when the State can decide that a person may own only 150 acres of land, we may soon reach the stage when we will take steps to limit the amount of money a person may have on deposit in his bank or to limit the amount of housing accommodation a family may have.  This is a dangerous step, and I hope the Minister and the House will reject the principle of restriction on the amount of property which a person may or may not hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong, and very wrong, that the right of any individual to purchase <Col N="1460" /> or maintain any property, land or otherwise, should be restricted.  If a person buys a substantial holding, whether it be 150, 80, or 400 acres, and pays for it, if he is a good citizen and works that land so that it will produce food for man and beast, if he gives good employment on it, the State should be very slow to intervene.  Any action by the State to restrict the amount of property a person may own should be seriously contested.  There is Civil Service and State interference which is inclined to handcuff and blindfold the individual.  Soon the stage will be reached when one will have to get permission to breathe.</P>
    <P>In this country the principle has been maintained that the individual has a right to purchase what he wishes. I would urge that that principle be maintained, more particularly when I see that no person or trust shall be permitted to purchase more than 150 statute acres of arable land.</P>
    <P>What would happen in the case of a college or community requiring a substantial acreage of land for the maintenance of the community?  There might be a case where a religious community would wish to purchase arable land to the extent of 200 acres. There are holdings of more than 150 acres which are held by farmers who may have three or four or five sons, who work the land well, who bought the property with hard-earned money, who are not under any compliment to the State, to their neighbours or to any individual.  There are religious communities who have very large tracts of land which is being worked well.</P>
    <P>It would be a great pity if steps were taken to restrict the rights of colleges, religious communities or anybody else in the acreage of land which they can own.  One might as well set out to limit a man's income, to limit what he can earn, what he can spend, what he can save, what he can own. I hope that tendency will not be allowed to develop here.  The tendency is for the State to restrict the individual.</P>
    <P>In every democracy, the individual has rights and Parliament should protect and safeguard those rights.  It <Col N="1461" /> would be wrong for us here to limit the amount of land a person may purchase. I would raise the same opposition to the proposal, irrespective of what limit Deputy Tully or the Labour Party would put.  The amount of property which a person, a trust or a community may purchase should be left as a matter for themselves and should not be subject to restriction.</P>
    <P>I now come to the next part of the amendment which says that non-nationals should not be permitted to purchase more than ten statute acres of arable land, except for industrial purposes.  I am with the Labour Party on that to a certain extent.  I am reminded of the very praiseworthy and good advice which the late German Ambassador to this country gave to his countrymen in his own country on the subject of the purchase of land in this country by Germans. The advice was not to purchase arable land in this country, that it would not be wise for them to do so, that it would not be in their own interests. Naturally, we always welcome foreign investment in this country.  We welcome foreign industrialists and anyone who is coming here to carry out a scheme of development or to establish industry.  This Party and any other Party would not oppose any foreigner coming in here for the purpose of purchasing industrial sites.  That is why I am glad to see mention in the amendment of land for industrial purposes.</P>
    <P>The advice I have quoted was good advice given by the German Ambassador to his own people.  He knew that we have not sufficient land to meet the needs of the Irish people who are seeking that land.  The German Ambassador was fully aware of the serious implications of aliens purchasing large tracts of land in this country. He knew that they would be bound to meet with a certain amount of disapproval. Neither the Land Commission nor the Minister for Lands today knows the seriousness of the problem that prevails at this very moment in regard to the purchase of Irish land by aliens.</P>
    <P>I have viewed this Bill with great suspicion because in this Bill as circulated, <Col N="1462" /> there is not a single section that curtails or restricts the activities of aliens in the purchase of land.  It is suggested that the 25 per cent tax payable by an alien in respect of the purchase of property here will curb the activities of such people in respect of land purchase.  That is all nonsense. Even with the 25 per cent duty payable by aliens the land is still far cheaper here than it would be in their country of origin.  Foreigners are coming here to buy large tracts of arable land to the dotriment of local smallholders and in many cases they have successfully wiped the eye of the Land Commission and in many cases where it can be established that there is a serious problem of congestion, lands were purchased by aliens.</P>
    <P>On numerous occasions we have heard from the Minister for Lands that foreigners coming here to buy land were buying land which was of too poor quality for the Land Commission or forestry purposes, but when we get down to the statistics submitted to all Deputies by the NFA, which examined the problem, we find that there were large tracts of good arable land in the heart of the country that were purchased by aliens and the Land Commission not only turned the deaf ear but the blind eye to the local people and the people in the congested areas, who were anxious to obtain additions to their holdings, to the farmers' sons who were well prepared financially to work the land, if only they could get it.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that a little interference on the part of the State and on the part of the Department of Local Government would ensure that the principle enunciated by James Fintan Lalor was carried out, the principle of the land of Ireland for the people of Ireland, to have and to hold from God alone who made it.</P>
    <P>The stage is being reached where there is a new invasion of this country by foreign landlords.  There are foreigners coming in here and buying up good arable land, land adjacent to good fisheries, where there are entrances and rights of way to the seashore. Such a practice is wrong and should not be tolerated.  If anybody <Col N="1463" /> has a claim on the land of this country, it is the Irish people.  There is nothing in this Bill to ensure that the land of this country will be held for the people of this country.  That is why I think that the least this amendment does is to give us an opportunity of expressing our disapproval of the manner in which the Government have allowed foreigners to come over here and buy up good land while the cream of Irish manhood is forced to emigrate to the US, Canada or Great Britain. Many of them are farmers' sons, born and reared on the land.  Many of them have their names on the files of the Land Commission seeking additions to the small holdings from which they have emigrated.</P>
    <P>All that is to the discredit of the Land Commission.  It is something of which the Minister should take a serious view.  For some reason, however, he always maintains that this problem is not a very serious one.  No case has been established to bear out the Minister's statement that the land being purchased by these foreigners is the poorest quality land.  They have purchased land in Meath, Laois, Offaly, Westmeath, Kilkenny and Tipperary.  They have purchased large tracts of good land all over the country. The Minister knows the number of places in my constituency.  He is negotiating there to purchase from a German a very extensive tract of land in an area of South Laois and North Kilkenny where there is very serious congestion.  There should be some restriction in regard to the purchase of lands by aliens.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the first part of this amendment.  I think it would be wrong to limit the amount of property any person should hold.  If that were done, it would deprive a citizen of his right to enjoy the freedom to which he is entitled in a democracy. If he is a good citizen, if he has his own money and is prepared to pay for the property, and if he is working his land well, it would be wrong for the State to interfere in respect of the amount of property he can purchase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this <Col N="1464" /> limiting amendment.  Generally speaking, it would be both undesirable and unworkable.  Acreage limitation unrelated to the user of land would be most undesirable.  We all know one man may hold 500 acres and secure such production and provide such employment that he is an asset to the district and the nation, whereas another man with only 50 acres may be using it so badly that he is a disgrace to the community.</P>
      <P>In any event, it would not be practicable to enforce a limit of this kind, even if we had it.  For instance, if a man has 150 acres, assuming his wife and his children could have another 150 acres or other areas of land, he could form a family company of as many of them as he wishes and they would each be individuals in law.  You could not possibly enforce a limit of that kind.  As Deputies will realise when they think on this matter, the quality of land varies so much that it would be impossible to lay down a limit of 50 acres, 100 acres or 200 acres.  I cited a case here on my Estimate of an individual who had bought a holding in my county&mdash;I forget whether it was 5,000 or 7,000 acres&mdash; the valuation of which was 2d. per acre.  That is an indication of where one might get by putting on a limitation, because nobody could live on this huge tract of snipe grass.  I suggest to Deputies that even on the question of the varying quality of land, to lay down a limit would be completely impracticable.</P>
      <P>Absenteeism is a more common feature than large-scale purchasing. The Bill deals with absenteeism in sections 34 and 41, which have yet to be dealt with.  That would also deal with the type of case to which Deputy Tully referred&mdash;if not on this section, then in a previous debate in the House &mdash;of aliens not living in this country who bought lands here and let them to other people.  There are sections in this Bill to deal effectively with that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that in any country the rationing of land would be only a last resort.  The Government must follow the positive course of taking up vacant <Col N="1465" /> and underworked land before contemplating such a negative policy, and I would regard rationing as a negative policy.  For all these reasons, apart from the other reasons advanced by Deputy Flanagan, in my view any limitation of the size of holdings would be impracticable.</P>
    <P>It was stated that the Land Commission pulled down the big houses on estates.  That is not so.  Indeed, we have some recent experiences of large residences of the type referred to by Deputy Tully.  We find a ready market for them for the purpose of conversion into hotels and so on. There are a couple on the Land Commission books at the moment, and there are many inquiries for them. By no means does it happen in all cases that the residence is pulled down and sold for scrap value, as suggested by Deputy Tully.</P>
    <P>Returning to the question of laying down a hard and fast rule of 150 acres for a holding, I should like to remind Deputies thinking that way that you cannot have such a national pattern in this country.  There are different types of agricultural economies in different parts of the country. Indeed, a number of these larger farms in the midlands form the market for the small stores from the west of Ireland.  This pattern has been followed traditionally down through the years.  Even from the point of view of farm structure and agricultural economics, you cannot divide the whole country into units like a draught board with no unit bigger than 150 acres.  I think I have made it clear that this would be an impracticable proposition.</P>
    <P>When I come to the second leg of this amendment, which purports to deal with purchases by aliens, I suggest again this is not a practical way of dealing with what the Deputy fears. There are ways and means of dealing with the matter if the problem becomes sufficiently big to justify steps being taken.  It is nothing like a national problem now.  We have the exact figures for alien purchases.  I have given the figures from time to time here.  We know exactly where we stand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> Our people who emigrate, mainly to Britain and the United States of America, are quite free to purchase land in these countries.  There is no law against such purchases.  Some Deputies&mdash;Deputy Tully was one&mdash; threw in Holland, Belgium, France and Germany.  I should like some of those who were so vocal about the laws in other countries to indicate to me what particular limitations exist. I have made careful inquiry and I have discovered that the laws vary very much.  In many instances, although there are some regulations to control alien purchases, it was found impracticable to exercise that control, despite the fact that the problem was, unlike ours, a national one.  In some of these countries, aliens are entitled, subject to certain qualifications, to acquire land and property.</P>
    <P>The number of Germans coming in here is infinitesimal.  The arguments made here remind me of the story of someone who walked down a street in Manchester and reported that the whole of Manchester was inhabited by Jewish people.  There are some who, if they see a couple of foreigners, or read of a couple of purchases, immediately jump to the conclusion that there is a German invasion.  That is not the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan waxed eloquent about the new invasion.  May I remind him of the attitude taken by his own Party when they were in Government? Deputy McQuillan tabled a Bill on this issue.  That Bill was opposed, and defeated, by Deputy Flanagan's Party and the then Coalition Government, on the ground that the figures for land purchases by aliens were running&mdash;I am speaking from recollection&mdash;from 5,000 to 7,000 acres per year.  I forget how many hundreds of years it would take, on the basis of that figure, for such purchases to make any real impact on the land of Ireland.  It was pointed out, of course, that we have 12 million acres of arable land.</P>
    <P>Whatever criticism might be offered as to the inaccuracy of the figures at that time, or as to lack of knowledge of the extent of the problem, no criticism can be made now, since we know every foot of land sold to an alien as a result of the Finance Act of <Col N="1467" /> 1961.  The register is kept.  The average figure for sales in respect of which the 25 per cent penal stamp duty has been paid runs at approximately 7,000 per year.  Some of the sales take place between the aliens themselves; some are sales of land in which the Land Commission are not interested.  We know exactly the size of the problem. If the figures take a sudden upward trend, it will be a very easy matter to deal with.</P>
    <P>This section will enable the Land Commission to move quickly in appropriate cases.  It can be used to deal with the land required by the Land Commission for the relief of congestion. Deputy Flanagan continues to misquote me, apparently in the hope that, if he misquotes often enough, someone will swallow it.  I never said all the land purchased by aliens was land that would be useless to the Land Commission.  I said a number of these purchases were what we would regard as &ldquo;white elephants&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never denied that some of these purchases were of good agricultural land.  I merely pointed out that it is fallacious reasoning to take the figure of purchases provided by our register, as Deputy McQuillan did, and assert that there were so many 50 acre holdings in the 7,000 acres which would cater for so many families, if the lands were acquired and divided.  It was being assumed that all these people bought the very best land and none of the other type.  They have bought any amount of the other type.  They have bought land our people were not interested in and it has come to our notice that some of these got their fingers burnt and are trying to get others to take over their liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know the extent of the problem. An amendment confining purchases by aliens to ten acres would be impracticable. It would also prevent these people purchasing the &ldquo;white elephants&rdquo; the Land Commission do not require.  It would be an undue discrimination against some of these <Col N="1468" /> people.  If the figures at any time show an upward trend or indicate a threat nationally, it will be very easy to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the argument that a 25 per cent penal duty is not a substantial one.  It is, of course&mdash;and a very substantial one.  If, in competition on the Irish market, some individual has to pay 25 per cent more for any portion of land or buys land for a substantial amount of money and has to pay 25 per cent more for it than his Irish competitor would, it is quite a hefty penalty.  Anybody who is familiar with land sales realises that. Of course, this figure of 25 per cent could, if thought nationally desirable, be increased at any time.  But whatever method might be thought necessary from a national point of view to deal with a problem of this kind, if it did arise, I suggest that this ten-acre limitation would not be the way of going about it.  For all these reasons, I must refuse to accept this amendment.  I think both legs of this amendment, if I may so describe it, are unworkable and I must reject it.</P>

      <P>Incidental to the Minister's statement, I should like clarification on one point regarding the purchase of land by foreigners.  In the Skibbereen area of Country Cork, a foreign group purchased a substantial acreage of land, a very big farm, some years ago for industrial development. Everyone was very pleased at the time that this group came along to buy a farm for industrial development and to give substantial employment in the area.  However, when the farm was bought, this industrial project&mdash;if it ever existed&mdash;fell through and the land is now in the ownership of these people.  In such circumstances, in view of the Minister's statement, could the Land Commission then step in and, say, re-purchase a holding and divide it amongst congests in the locality?  In this case, it was a question of the best land in the area and undoubtedly there was a plentiful supply of local people to avail of that land if it had been purchased in the first instance by the Land Commission.  I should like the Minister to clarify that matter now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to say something on the Labour Party amendment. The discussion to which I listened from the Minister's side was so broad that I thought it included the section as well. The Labour Party amendment seeks to confine the amount of land that may be purchased by Irish nationals to 150 acres and, in the case of aliens, to ten acres.</P>
      <P>I think there is a way to treat aliens and we do not seem to want to use it. Either we should accept that aliens are free to come in here and to buy land or that they are not.  If we are afraid, and we appear to be afraid in section 13, we should debar them outright.  We should not seek measures, when they have got the land, to take it back from them.  We should not seek to put these people in the position where they can come in here and buy land freely and pay 25 per cent more for it and break no law in the country and that then we move in and compel them to go to court and to make a case for compensation when the Land Commission acquire it.</P>
      <P>I think that the idea of free sale was very valuable.  If we chop up holdings&mdash;and that is what this means&mdash; it will prove to be a mistake.  If we can sell only 150 acres of any holding or if a person can buy only 150 acres, so that the holding must be split up, it will be an unwise step.  Take a holding of 200 acres.  Surely it is not a practical suggestion that that holding must be split up prior to selling it?  Normally, there is only one dwellinghouse and one farmyard and very often that will reduce considerably the value of a holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1470" /> One could have a farm of 400 acres of bad land and it would take the 400 acres to give a living to a family.  The question of mountain land, bogland, and so on, comes into it.  I would prevent aliens from buying land at all except for an industrial site.  That is my evaluation of it.  What is the purpose of confining it to ten acres?  An alien could come in here and have 10 acres for a hobby and it could be ten acres of waste because there is a nice dwellinghouse on it.  I do not think the amendment is practical.  I do not know why we are talking so much about keeping aliens out if we are just dealing with the question of 10 acres.  I think ten acres is really only an industrial site and we want them for industry.  After that, they should be kept out altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amused by the efforts of Deputy Flanagan to get the cloak of all religious orders in the country not alone around himself and the Fine Gael Party but around the Fianna Fáil Party as well.  It was a great effort.  If that can be used as an argument against our amendment, then I suggest he is perfectly entitled to try to use it.  For the life of me, I cannot see its relevance.  In fact, the amendment says &ldquo;150 acres of arable land&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know quite a number of religious orders who have bought houses and farms in my constituency.  None of them has been rich enough to go over the 150 acres.  Most of them are very glad to be able to get farms of well under 100 acres.  I know that on occasion the Land Commission have given farms of 150 acres to favoured individuals but that is not the normal thing.  The whole argument being made against the amendment, in my opinion, does not ring true.  Perhaps, if it does nothing else, the amendment shows clearer than anything else the different outlook the members of the Labour Party have on this particular problem from that of the combined Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Parties.  We believe that if somebody acquires or buys 150 acres of arable land, he is buying a very sizable farm.  I was rather disappointed that neither the Minister nor <Col N="1471" /> Deputy Clinton seemed to appreciate the fact that the amendment refers to arable land, and land on which you cannot feed snipe does not come into it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>How do you define arable land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy can define it better than anybody, better even than the Minister.  Deputy Flanagan quoted James Fintan Lalor's &ldquo;the land of Ireland for the people of Ireland&rdquo;.  Apparently he added a mental note, making it &ldquo;the land of Ireland for the rich people of Ireland&rdquo;, because the man who is able to buy more than 150 acres of arable land at present must be a very rich man. Deputy Clinton inquired as to what would happen in the case of a 200-acre farm if the owner could sell only 150 acres in one lot.  He must have forgotten there would be one of the Minister's viable farms over, with some acres to spare, and I know many people who would be delighted to get a 50-acre farm, even if they had to buy it.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a very serious mistake when he alleged on two occasions that I said the big houses on the farms taken over by the Land Commission were being pulled down and sold for scrap.  I said no such thing.  What I said was that up to recently the religious orders had been taking these houses and that we seemed to have run out of orders and that the houses were an embarrassment to the Land Commission, that it was necessary to give far more land than the Commission have available with those houses in order to get people to take them.  Perhaps the Minister expected me to say what he suggested I said but actually I did not say it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister about foreign purchasing being a small problem.  Possibly the Minister comes from a part of the country where it may be a small problem but I come from another part where it is not a question of an odd German or Frenchman or a Belgian buying a farm.  A very serious encroachment has been made in County Meath by those people.  They may be excellent <Col N="1472" /> people, but as long as there are Irish people who could use that land, I do not believe foreigners should be allowed buy it.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked somebody to tell him what is the situation in the countries I mentioned where I claimed there are restrictions against Irishmen buying farms.  Nobody knows that as well as the Minister.  When he was pressed here some time ago, he did give some of the restrictions.  If he would prefer to have it that way, we can put down a Parliamentary Question asking him what are the restrictions. We would find that in most cases there are very severe restrictions. For instance, in Holland, not alone can foreigners not buy land but even a native must prove that he either has taken a degree in agriculture or is a practical farmer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is land which they control and the Minister should be well aware of this.  This is a situation where the Government can have control of certain lands and instead they say that the highest bidder can buy, no matter who it is.  We believe, no matter who is concerned, he should not be allowed to buy more than 150 acres.  If that is done, many problems about which we hear day after day will be solved.</P>
      <P>Secondly, we believe that if an alien wants to buy a house for residential purposes, he should be entitled to ten acres of arable land but no more.  If he is buying for industrial purposes, it is a different matter, but, like Deputy Murphy, I know of a number of farms that were bought for industrial purposes but which are being farmed only in a middling way ever since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest there is merit in the amendment and that the Minister should have another look at it because we should not allow the position to continue in which anybody can buy land at a time when&mdash;and this is becoming <Col N="1473" /> a serious menace&mdash;a man with a lot of money but no knowledge of farming who has a greed for land can buy up farm after farm in an area.  That should not be allowed to continue. There is one way of stopping it and we make no apology for suggesting that it should be done, that is, to provide that the area of land which anyone can buy should be limited to an area of 150 acres of arable land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <P>Perhaps I misunderstood Deputy Tully about the large houses.  I have had experience as Minister during the past couple of years, of at least one of these houses with which I am familiar and which was sold with some amenity lands, about which the Deputy is complaining, in order to sell it well.  It was bought and converted into a hotel and is giving employment now to 40 or 50 people which is a tremendous boon to the district.  Where things like that happen, it is a good thing that these large mansions should be sold with sufficient amenity land to make them a practical proposition.</P>

      <P>They do their share of work west of the Shannon and also in the Deputy's area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Holland, there is a rule or a law in respect of reclaimed land, land reclaimed by the Government at very high cost and, as far as I have studied it, I understand the people who get that land must not alone qualify as the Deputy has said, but must show they have sufficient capital to work it intensively and they must pay a full <Col N="1474" /> economic rent to the Government, having regard to the money spent on it. That is reclaimed land.  It does not apply to land generally.  To my own knowledge, there is a place in Holland that I knew of before I became a member of the Government, of more than 3,000 acres, operated and owned by a non-Dutch company and worked very intensively.</P>
    <P>The suggestion seems to be generally accepted by a number of Deputies that in most continental countries, it is practically impossible for a non-national to acquire land.  That is not necessarily the case.  In the different cantons in Switzerland, you have different rules, and also in Germany, because there are different succession laws in many of these countries and these tie up the devolution of land in certain cases.  Outside these, with certain restrictions, other people can acquire land in these countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy raised the question of an alien&mdash;I do not know if he said a German or not&mdash;who acquired some land allegedly for industrial purposes in his part of the country.  I think the best answer to the Deputy is to refer him to the Finance Act of 1961. Section 33, subsection (6) provides:</P>
    <P>Where, subsection (5) of the 1947 section having not applied in the case of a conveyance or transfer of property because the case fell within subparagraph (i) of paragraph (c) of subsection (4) of that section, the property has been retained by the person to whom it was conveyed or transferred but has not been used for the purposes of an industry other than agriculture within three years from the date of the relevant instrument&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>This is the type of property to which the Deputy referred, property which was alleged to have been bought for the purposes of industry but was not used for the purposes of industry within three years from the date on which it was purchased.  This is the law that will apply:</P>
    <P>(a) that instrument shall, notwithstanding that it has been stamped already, and irrespective of whether <Col N="1475" /> or not it has been stamped with a particular stamp denoting that it is duly stamped, again immediately become chargeable with stamp duty,</P>
    <P>(b) that duty shall be chargeable at the rate of twenty-five pounds per cent on the amount or value of the consideration, due allowance being made for the amount of the stamp duty already paid,</P>
    <P>(c) if, at the expiration of thirty days after the instrument becomes again chargeable with stamp duty, it is not stamped in accordance with the foregoing paragraph, a sum equal to twice the amount of the duty unpaid shall thereupon be a debt due to the Minister for Finance for the benefit of the Central Fund by the said person.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) (a) provides:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of paragraph (c) of subsection (4) of the 1947 section, the Revenue Commissioners may require the delivery to them of statutory declarations in such form as they may direct and of such further evidence, if any, as they may require.</P>
    <P>The position is that if an alien purchases land for the purposes of industry and does not proceed with that industry within three years, he becomes liable to the full penal duty, and on the expiration of a further 30 days, he becomes liable to estate duty by way of penalty.  So far as the Land Commission are concerned, the ordinary law of the land would apply, and if the land is suitable for the relief of congestion, the Land Commission can move in on him.  If this Bill goes through the House, the Land Commission will be better equipped to move in much more promptly in a case like that.  What I have quoted for the Deputy is the law on the matter, and the person does not escape.  If he does not proceed with the industry, he loses the exemption he received from stamp duty on the purchase of the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In this instance, the land was for sale in the Skibbereen area and a foreigner came in and was made welcome by the local <Col N="1476" /> people because they thought he would be starting an industry almost immediately. Naturally the land was purchased at a depressed price, and if the 25 per cent had to be paid subsequently, it was still a very cheap farm.  The Minister knows very well that in a congested district such as West Cork, if an alien comes in to buy a farm for industrial development, he will be welcome, and the people will help him in every way possible, and provide him with the land he needs at a reasonable price. If the industry falls through, or if he never had any intention of setting up an industry but wanted to acquire a good farm at a reasonable price, would it not be very good value, even if he had to pay an additional 25 per cent on the original price?  In such a case, if they are satisfied that the purchaser of the land never had any intention of establishing an industry, the land should be open to acquisition by the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every purchase of an agricultural holding by an alien shall be subject to the consent of the Land Commission after inspection by the latter as to its suitability or otherwise for land division.</P>
      <P>This does not cut across the purchase of land by aliens?  It is merely an attempt to provide that our own people, and our own congests, have first choice and get first consideration. I think it would be appropriate that in any purchase of land by an alien, at the earliest possible opportunity the purchaser should know whether he was going to run into difficulties as regards the purchase of the land.  Under this amendment, the land would be looked at by the Land Commission to see if it were suitable for division, and if there was a congestion problem in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that land has been purchased on the continent and elsewhere.  He said there is no <Col N="1477" /> restriction on land being purchased by Irish people in Britain, America, and on the continent.  In actual practice, our people do not buy land in Britain, America, or on the continent. Our emigrants are poor people, and they are barely able to live.  They go away to work.  The majority of our emigrants are quite unable to buy land so that does not arise, whereas a number of aliens who come in here are wealthy, and they buy land merely as a hedge against inflation in many cases, or as an investment.  I put down this amendment to protect our own people, and to give them first choice. It is a cause of annoyance and social unrest when people wake up in the morning in an area where there is congestion and find that a large estate has been bought overnight.  It is to obviate conditions such as that that I put down this amendment.</P>
    <P>This happens in my constituency, and, as I have said, we have as large a proportion of congestion in my constituency as other Deputies have in theirs.  The Minister should accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, for the record, it is quite obvious that the Deputy is not aware that some of our people do purchase land in the United States and it was my privilege to visit some of them in Colorado and Wyoming over the past ten years.  They are quite free to do so, if they wish, and if they have the wherewithal, just as people are elsewhere, in Britain, for instance, if they desire.  The Deputy is making the greatest mistake of his life if he suggests that all our people who go abroad are poor people.  He should see some of them and compare them with the neighbours they left behind.</P>
      <P>Coming to the amendment, I say seriously that I simply do not understand it.  It says that:</P>
      <P>Every purchase of an agricultural holding by an alien shall be subject to the consent of the Land Commission after inspection by the latter as to its suitability or otherwise for land division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The alien is free to purchase the holding.  I am trying to find out what <Col N="1478" /> the Deputy really has in mind.  The Land Commission come along afterwards and inspect it for suitability. &ldquo;Shall be subject to the consent of the Land Commission&rdquo;.  I do not understand what he means.  They inspect it for suitability or otherwise.  If the Land Commission in their wisdom decide to inspect any holding owned by an alien or anybody else and if there is congestion in the vicinity, they are entitled to take it over, even under existing law.  I just do not understand what the meaning of this amendment is.  It is beyond my comprehension.  That is all I can say about it.</P>

      <P>Every purchase of an agricultural holding by an alien shall be subject to the consent of the Land Commission after inspection by the latter as to its suitability or otherwise for land division.</P>
      <P>The Minister will note carefully the words &ldquo;every purchase of an agricultural holding by an alien&rdquo;.  What this amendment purports to do is to differentiate in regard to the rights of a national.  What we are defending on this side of the House is the right of the national to do what he likes with his land, provided he does not infringe the law or does not do anything contrary to the wellbeing of the State as a whole.  This amendment relates to the alien and I ask the Minister to give it his consideration.</P>
      <P>Recently I asked the Minister what was the number of aliens who had bought land over a certain period.  In so far as one can in a Parliamentary Question, I tried to find out from the Minister how he knows whether aliens were buying land or not.  I do not think there is any method by which we can know.  What Deputy Hogan wants to do is to make it clear that an alien is placed in this category. We on this side do not accept that nationals should be regimented by the State, by the Land Commission, or by a Minister.</P>

      <P>As I understand <Col N="1479" /> Deputy Esmonde, he wishes that in every sale of land, the Land Commission must give their consent and if he desires to put down an amendment to that effect, I will undoubtedly consider it, because if nobody can sell land without the consent of the Land Commission, then we must refuse it to the alien until we examine the position.</P>

      <P>The Minister has come a certain way with what I have tried to convey but I do not think he has fully understood.  There must be a differential between the rights of aliens in relation to land and the rights of nationals.  As I interpret Deputy Hogan's amendment, he wants to make it crystal clear that when an alien buys land, the Land Commission will know he is going to do so and can have the right to say whether it is reasonable or otherwise for him to buy the land.  That is the whole point.  We do not want a complete control over the sale of land as far as nationals are concerned.  That is where we joined issue with the Minister last night and he told us we were obstructing.  We were not; we were trying to defend the rights of nationals.  Our Leader came in here last night and made that case clear, that we were standing up for what our people fought for for centuries. There is no point in having fixity of tenure or security for Irish nationals if foreigners can come in and buy land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to take it further.  Land here has gone for £250 per acre which is considered to be a high price but it is comparatively nothing by European or even British standards.  You must deal with a situation in which the tendency is for people to invest more in fundamental securities such as land. You have many big industrialists, not only from the Federal Republic of Germany but from France, Italy and from different parts of Europe, and even people from America, wishing to do this.  You have the great risk, as auctioneers will tell the Minister, of British nationals coming over to buy land because they feel there is going to be a Labour Government <Col N="1480" /> and they want to invest in securities somewhere else.  That is the point of this amendment.  It is very reasonable if the Minister looks into it and it covers a small section.</P>

      <P>From my remarks on a previous amendment, the Minister knows now that I am prepared to go to great lengths to prevent aliens purchasing arable land, but I agree with the Minister that the land must be purchased, and I can see a serious situation arising if somebody sells a farm to an alien and, as a result of that sale, gets about three times as much money as he would get from an Irish citizen. Would it not become a kind of a racket, this sale of land to aliens, the vendors knowing that the Land Commission would be likely to come in? Should we not find ourselves in a serious situation?  If some clear-cut effort is made to prevent aliens purchasing arable land here, I am prepared to go the whole way, but I do not think this amendment will do that.</P>

The only information he can give us&mdash;he calls it reliable&mdash;is based on the Finance Act which gives details of the amount collected in 25 per cent duty paid by aliens who purchase land here, but that information does not tally with the amount of land purchased by aliens as given in the NFA survey.  I put it to the Minister that the NFA have organised practically every parish, have set up sub-committees to deal with this matter.  Therefore, they must know the position reasonably accurately.</P>
      <P>The NFA circularised each parish in the country and in each parish information was collected based on the actual position as to the number of acres of arable land purchased by aliens.  That was submitted to headquarters and accordingly the NFA were able to furnish details.  The result of that survey has been referred to on many occasions in the House. The Minister got a copy and there is a copy in the Land Commission, covered with dust and cobwebs because nobody ever read it.  If there is no register in the Land Commission of the arable holdings purchased by aliens, how is the Minister to know that a farm has been so purchased?  The Minister's confusion, I notice, has been causing a certain amount of laughter from even the Fianna Fáil benches.</P>

      <P>The Minister is bogged down and needs a little enlightenment. Deputy Hogan's amendment is crystal clear.  All it seeks is that if a farm is about to be bought by an alien, the Land Commission's consent should be obtained, or refused. He also wants the farm inspected to see if it is suitable for acquisition and division among smallholders and congests for the relief of congestion.  The Minister, however, says that is not possible.  Why, I do not know.</P>
      <P>The Minister goes on to say he has no way of finding out when a farm is about to be purchased by an alien.  I have made it clear that the only way he has of finding out is through a system such as that suggested in the amendment.  It is quite clear to us that at the moment there is no record in the Land Commission, that the Minister has no record, as to the acreage of land purchased by aliens.  He goes on now to ask the House how he is to find out when an alien is about to purchase land so that he can give his permission or refuse it.  Can the Minister not arrive at a position in which he can ask a prospective purchaser: &ldquo;What is your name, your address; where do you come from?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Now the Minister is trying to confuse the issue. Deputy Hogan says in his amendment: &ldquo;Every purchase of an agricultural holding by an alien shall be subject to the consent of the Land Commission...&rdquo; The Minister has ways and means of dealing with this matter. <Col N="1485" /> Surely the Minister knows that when a person goes to buy a holding, the conditions of sale are clearly read out by the solicitor or auctioneer, and then a quarter of the purchase money, together with five per cent auction fees, is placed as a deposit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am telling the Minister how it can be done.  If the purchaser is an alien, in accordance with Deputy Hogan's amendment the Minister can then instruct the Land Commission to carry out an inspection. If he is satisfied that there is congestion in the district, that is a case in which consent may be refused to the alien and the lands purchased for the relief of congestion in the area.  There is nothing simpler or easier to implement than that.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why the Minister appears to be so dumb on this issue.  He is a man of intelligence and is not alone a well-known member of the legal profession but has an outstanding record as a brilliant solicitor. Now that the Minister is in a happier and more pleasant mood, perhaps he can see the wisdom of Deputy Hogan's amendment and how it can be implemented. Not alone is this an amendment of common sense and intelligence but it is one which will curb considerably the purchase of land by aliens. Now that this has been clearly explained to the Minister, he should accept this amendment, thus enabling the Land Commission to say to a purchaser: &ldquo;You may not complete this sale.  In accordance with section 13 of the Land Act, 1963, the consent of the Land Commission is refused&rdquo;.  Then the lands are inspected, found suitable for division, divided amongst the local people, and all is well.  Can the Minister tell me what is wrong with that procedure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I subscribe fully to the view already expressed by Deputy Clinton that the one way of dealing with the problem is to stop aliens from buying land here <Col N="1487" /> altogether because we have a greater demand by Irish people for land than there is land available for them.  This problem will not be solved to the satisfaction of all concerned until steps are taken by the Government to stop the purchase of land by aliens except for industrial purposes to the extent of a nominal acreage which they require for those purposes.  Deputy Hogan has performed a great service to the House and made a very generous contribution to this section by his amendment, and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very cleverly worded amendment in that it is a prohibition on the purchase of Irish land by aliens without calling it that. One of the main purposes of the section is to ensure that land is not snatched by aliens at prices which make it unavailable to nationals.  This is one way of ensuring that no holding in which the Land Commission are interested will be sold without first being brought to the notice of the Land Commission, who would then have an opportunity of buying it and distributing it among people who need land badly.  This is a very desirable amendment and I cannot see why the Minister is unwilling to accept it.  It would solve many problems for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>As this amendment reads, I am not surprised I am not the only person in the House at a complete loss to understand what is behind it.  Deputy Flanagan knows quite well that if a farm is purchased, probably by a solicitor in trust on behalf of an alien, by the time that transaction comes on the Land Commission register the sale is closed; he has got his five per cent; the deeds are stamped; the alien has paid over his money and is in possession of the land.  I repeat: how could the Land Commission know in respect of any holding, unless by divine inspiration, that it was the intention of any Irish farmer to sell his holding to an alien? That is what they would want to know to give effect to this amendment, that before the land is purchased, the Land Commission should know that X is about to sell his land <Col N="1488" /> to a foreigner so that they could then put a plaster on it.</P>
      <P>There is only the one way to do that.  It is not the alien you want to control in that case; it is the man who is selling the land you want to control.  If the Deputy wants to put down an amendment on Report Stage prescribing that any man who wants to sell his land must first notify the Land Commission, then we can consider it.  That is what I understood he was trying to get at because if this amendment does not mean the control of the sale of land, I do not know what it means.  That is the only possible effect this amendment could have, that every purchase by an alien would require the consent of the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>When an alien has purchased an agricultural holding in this country and that fact comes to the register, that sale has already taken place.  The only way to achieve what the Deputy would appear to have in mind is to make all sales of land subject to the consent of the Land Commission.  That is already the law with regard to subdivision of land.  In that situation, the Land Commission eventually insist on approving the purchaser and insist on the purchase being made by a man whose holding is uneconomic before allowing the purchase.  If that is the intention of Deputy Hogan, that all sales be subject to the approval of the Land Commission, there is a lot to be said for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister first put his finger on the point of the whole matter and then avoided it. He pointed out, and rightly so, that a solicitor buys in trust for an alien and it is only when the deed is about to be completed and the solicitor gets his costs and stamps and everything else that the Minister or the Land Commission become aware of it.  But does that not apply to the farmer who is selling the land as well as to the Minister? If a solicitor is buying in trust, surely he does not tell the farmer who is selling that he is buying for a German?  The solicitor is allowed to keep the name of the person for whom he is buying in strict confidence.  There is no control on him.  He gets his fees <Col N="1489" /> and stamps the deed and that is that.</P>
      <P>The Minister wants the farmer who is selling to be the person responsible. How can he be made responsible if the farm is put up for sale in the ordinary way and we want to retain free sale, as we must, regardless of what anybody says?  I insist that is the right of every Irish farmer.  If there were a section such as this in the Bill, setting out that there could not be a sale to an alien without the consent of the Land Commission, it would put the alien on notice that he was buying a very doubtful proposition.</P>
      <P>On the question of alien purchases, if I understand the land law rightly, and I think I understand it as well as any layman, surely an alien buying a farm of land is not placed in any more favourable position than any ordinary John Citizen?  If an alien has bought a farm and there is congestion in the area, surely the Land Commission have the right to take over that farm, if they want to.  Is that not the truth?</P>

I am not too greatly perturbed about that because I understand that the Land Commission have power to take the land of an alien as well as the land of any ordinary citizen.  If this amendment is inserted in the Bill, it will put an alien on notice that he is buying something that may be taken from him.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the Minister's attitude when he says that he would have to be divinely inspired to know if an alien is buying land.  This amendment endeavours to put it into the legislation that it shall be mandatory that the Land Commission be notified when an alien is buying land.  Is there anything revolutionary about that? The Minister wishes us to accept the principle that anybody who wants to sell land should notify his Department <Col N="1490" /> straight away; in other words that the Department should have complete and absolute power over the sale of land.</P>
      <P>That is one of the fundamentals in this Bill that we object to and are fighting all the way.  What this amendment does is to put aliens in a different category from nationals.  That is all we are asking the Minister to do. The Minister says that eventually he is bound to know if an alien purchases land.  I do not know much about legal matters but I do know that when the deposit money is paid and all the complicated legal matters gone through, it may be six, nine or 12 months before the deed is finally completed and the sale carried out. It is the Minister's argument that it is only when the deed comes to be registered that the Land Commission will be aware of the fact that an alien has bought the land.  If we embody this amendment, which is a simple one, in the Bill, all it means is that it will be an illegal act for anybody to buy land for an alien without notifying the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>What the Minister means when he wants legislation whereby anybody who sells land, even if he is a national, must have the approval of the Land Commission is that everybody who sells land should be subservient to the Land Commission.  We object to that.  What we are fighting for here is the rights of Irish nationals <i>vis-à-vis</i> aliens.  I do not think anything could be simpler than that and I do not see why the Minister should not accept it.</P>
      <P>The Minister is very naive.  He wants us to accept <i>in toto</i> legislation providing that the Land Commission may have these complete powers over anybody, no matter who he may be.  What we are fighting for is simply this, that we do not want to give aliens the same right as nationals.  In other words, we want to protect the rights of nationals and want to place aliens in such a position that the Land Commission, who are the only people who can defend this country against the purchase of land by aliens, can do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister thinks he would want to be divinely inspired to do that.  He <Col N="1491" /> does not want to be divinely inspired. All that is required is to insert a provision in the Bill which will safeguard land for Irish nationals for all time. That is the whole basis and fundamental of the land laws that have been passed starting in 1880 with the first Land Act.  That is what we are asking for and that is what Deputy Hogan's amendment means.</P>
    <P>If the Minister would tell us that he would agree to that, Deputy Hogan could amend his amendment and bring it in on Report Stage and we would be quite happy to let it go through. With respect to the Minister and to the silent few who sit there, may I say that I notice the expressions on the faces have all changed since I started speaking.  If the Minister would only do as I have suggested, we could go on with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Minister is, I believe deliberately, trying to pretend that he cannot understand this.  This is not an attempt to control free sale, in which we believe. It is rather primarily an attempt to control purchase of land by aliens.  It is quite a simple matter for the Minister to draft regulations providing that a solicitor acting for any foreign trust or purchaser should at the earliest possible opportunity notify the Land Commission of such purchase by an alien.</P>
      <P>In every sale after the auction there is the payment of a percentage of the total property charge.  The moment the deposit money is paid the deal is completed, subject to the necessary legal formalities.  Surely, it is not impossible to provide that at that stage all lawyers should notify the Land Commission that Mr. So-and-So of Holland has today paid £2,000 deposit for such a farm?  Is it impossible for this House to provide the legal machinery to make it obligatory on every legal agent to provide that information forthwith to the Land Commission the moment the first instalment of the deposit money is paid, before any further formalities are carried through, before anything further is done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1492" /> I do not know the technicalities carried out by lawyers as regards the transfer of properties and so on but I do know that when something is auctioned there is an immediate payment of proportion of the money which establishes that man as the purchaser. If he afterwards forgoes the deal he has usually to forfeit the money.  At that stage there is <i>prima facie</i> a sale and at that stage could it not be made mandatory on the agents of the purchaser to inform the Land Commission that a man had paid a deposit on such a farm and the Land Commission that a man had paid a deposit ado, if the land were situated in part of the country where there was considerable local demand by smallholders? It would, admittedly, limit free sale but to a very slight degree and it does subscribe to the purpose of trying to put some control on the purchase of land by foreigners where that land is necessary to our own people who should have prior claim upon it and it will obviate circumstances arising of the sale being presented afterwards as a <i>fait accompli</i> to the whole locality, causing considerable annoyance, as it has caused on occasions, throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I said already that I am not the only one who misunderstands the effect of this.  What Deputy Hogan is saying now is something that is not here.  There is nothing here to compel a solicitor to break the privilege that exists between himself and his client and disclose his client's secrets.  It may well be that the Deputy could put down an amendment to the effect that the Dáil enact, for instance, that the Deputy in his professional capacity will have to disclose the names of the patients in his home, the fees they pay, the disease from which they suffer.  That is the very same type of privilege as exists between doctor and patient and solicitor and client as far as the law of privilege is concerned. If the Deputy wants to burst that, that is one thing, but that is not this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment again says that every purchase of an agricultural holding by an alien shall be subject to the consent of the Land Commission <Col N="1493" /> after inspection by the latter as to its suitability or otherwise for land division.  What that means I do not know because it contemplates every purchase of a holding by an alien. The holding, having been purchased by an alien, the Land Commission could not possibly go into or be privy to the deal, until the deal, in fact, was registered, until everybody was paid and it came along to the Land Commission to register.  The alien is then in possession.  He has parted with his money.  He has paid whatever he has to pay.</P>
    <P>There is only one way of dealing with the situation if the Deputy wants to do it, as I have already said, that is, to forget about bringing in unworkable laws&mdash;if, in fact, it would be constitutional to compel legal people to break the privilege that exists between themselves and their clients&mdash;and prevent the landowner from selling to an alien.  If that is the Deputy's intention, then the way to do it is to make the sale of land subject to the consent of the Land Commission and, as I have already said, if that is what the Deputy wishes to have done we will give consideration to it on the Report Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As this amendment stands it is meaningless, ineffective and, in fact, could not achieve any of the objects the Deputy said it would.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what the Minister has just said, he certainly has gone a little further than before but is the Minister prepared to differentiate between aliens and nationals?  That is the key point of the amendment.  We are not lawyers on this side of the House.  We do not know if this is correctly worded to meet the requirements of drafting of Bills and so forth but what we do want to do is to differentiate between the rights of aliens and the rights of nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has again brought us back to the question that we must have an overall law whereby it is the right of the Land Commission to have to agree to every sale in this country. The Minister will perhaps, in all reason, agree that that is a limitation on <Col N="1494" /> free sale.  We object to that.  We suggest there is a particular problem with regard to aliens.  I am sure I may speak for Deputy Hogan here, having listened carefully to what he and the Minister said.  Is the Minister prepared to put in an amendment on Report Stage in which he will differentiate between aliens and nationals?  If so, we are satisfied.  We cannot be satisfied otherwise. We are not going to sacrifice our principles because the Minister says you cannot bring in legislation which will break the secrecy between a solicitor and his client.  Did this Government not bring in legislation by which they forced bank managers to state what their clients have in the banks? I am not saying the Fianna Fáil Government are worse than any other in that respect, but Governments have power to do that.  Putting it to us in this way is only begging the question.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister directly: is he prepared to bring in an amendment covering this so that the Land Commission may be fully cognisant when aliens are purchasing land, an amendment that differentiates entirely between nationals and aliens?  That is not in this amendment.  This amendment is intended to cover aliens and not nationals.  Would the Minister reply?</P>

      <P>In a country like Ireland, where there has been land legislation over a period of 70 or 80 years, could anything be clearer than asking the Minister to differentiate between the rights of aliens and of nationals in relation to land?  Has not the whole history of this country been bound up with trying to create vested holdings so that our nationals may <Col N="1495" /> enjoy the privilege of owning the land? That is what people have fought for over the centuries.  A different situation has arisen today, whereby aliens are endeavouring to buy land in Ireland.  It has been repeatedly stated by the Minister that there is not sufficient land to accommodate Irish nationals.  We are asking the Minister: is he prepared to have separate legislation for aliens, or does he want to embody nationals and so destroy all the rights and privileges they now enjoy and for which they fought?  It is a simple question and I would ask the Minister to answer it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I do not know the level of the Minister's comprehension.  Any suggestion of interference in the private relationship between a solicitor and his client upsets the Minister.  I would be the first person to support the Minister in any attempt he might make to defend the private relationship between a solicitor and his client.  It is a fundamental thing; it is something we should all protect.  But what we are asking is no grave departure from what has existed for a number of years.  We merely want the Land Commission informed by any legal agent purchasing land for a foreigner, or for a foreign trust, of the nationality of the purchaser. There is nothing revolutionary in that departure.  I see no difficulty for the Minister or his parliamentary draftsman in accepting that amendment in principle and drafting regulations to make that practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister pretends not to understand. He says that is not in the amendment.  The purpose behind the amendment is crystal clear.  If it is not, it has been made clear by speaker after speaker.  We merely want to give our own people a first crack at land if it is going, rather than that the foreigner with a lot of money should come in and buy it and our own people <Col N="1497" /> should wake up the next morning to find the land gone.</P>
    <P>It is as simple as that.  I do not know in what more simple language I can explain it.  It appears the Minister rejects it because I am not able to draft some kind of legal formula.  The Minister has more ability in that respect than I have, because it is his life's work.  He is a lawyer.  I do other jobs at which the Minister might not be so efficient.  At least he understands the purpose of the amendment and, if he has any sympathy with it, which, of course he has not because he is antagonistic towards it, he would at once say that he accepts the principle, but thinks the amendment is badly drafted: &ldquo;I would suggest you do so and so with it.&rdquo;  He has given us no indication of how far he will go. He merely persists in the obstinate attitude he has consistently adopted all through this debate.  He will not even answer the simple question: does he accept in principle the fact that an Irishman should have even that slight advantage over an alien in the purchase of land?  Does he accept even that slight differential in favour of our own people?</P>

      <P>May I suggest to the Minister that he has twice or three times offered to meet us, but what he offers us we cannot accept, and he has then more or less jibed at us and said the drafting of the amendment is wrong&mdash;it is unworkable, impossible, and so forth.  May I respectfully suggest that the Minister is himself a lawyer and is considered to be quite an expert on land legislation, coming, as he does, from a county in which there is a good deal of that sort of work.  Apart from that, he has expert advisers whose job it is to draft legislation and, if they are not in a position to draft it, they may refer it to more experts in order to produce something which will achieve the object we desire to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last time the Minister intervened, he said he could not understand what we wanted and he said the <Col N="1498" /> Labour Party could not understand it, either.  I learn with deep regret that the Labour Party are in difficulties as to what we want and I beg to intervene now to make crystal clear what we want and to ask the Minister if he could see his way to drafting something to meet our requirements, doing it himself, if he feels qualified, or, if he does not, doing it by falling back on his expert advisers.  Where we join issue with the Minister is that he wants legislation whereunder no national, or anybody else who owns land, can sell that land without the consent of the Land Commission.  In all fairness, I think my colleagues&mdash;I am glad to see those on the opposite benches are now listening to me with respectful silence &mdash;will see that it is desirable that Irish nationals with vested holdings, whether they are subject to a Land Commission annuity or otherwise, should have the right to free sale.</P>
    <P>What we are asking the Minister to do is simply to perpetuate that right. We do not agree with interfering with the rights of Irish nationals and we are asking the Minister to draft an amendment whereby aliens will not have the same rights to buy.  I have stated the reasons before.  The Minister says he cannot understand them. May I briefly state them now?</P>

      <P>As far as the Labour Party are concerned, we are in complete agreement with any attempt to limit sales to non-nationals.  There is, however, one matter in relation to which I am not clear.  How can we give Irish farmers the right to free sale to anybody and, at the same time, say they cannot sell to non-nationals? If someone would explain that, perhaps we would be able to make up our minds.  One or the other is wrong.  Either you have free sale and everybody, including non-nationals, can purchase without the special permission of the Land Commission, in which case there would have to be an amendment, or you have not.</P>
      <P>I suggest this amendment does not cover the point.  The intention may be right.  We are all with it if the intention is to prevent non-nationals purchasing land, but I am afraid the amendment here does not do that, and it has not been proven to us, no matter what discussion we have had here tonight, that it can in any way help to solve the problem.  That is the difficulty.</P>

      <P>This section is one of the most disastrous features of this Bill.  It introduces a system of control on dealings in land in respect of which the Land Commission propose to institute, or actually have instituted, acquisition proceedings.  No sale, no transfer, no letting, no subletting can lawfully be made without the consent of the Land Commission. Here, a real effort is made to prevent the sale of land, the transfer of land, without the consent and approval of the Land Commission.  Beyond all shadow of doubt, this is prohibiting the sale of land.</P>
      <P>Not alone does this section prohibit the free sale of land but it interferes with ownership.  Certainly, it interferes with the right of a private individual to do what he likes with his property. It is an infringement of the right of a citizen.  We have now reached the stage that if this section is passed, a person cannot sell his land, transfer it, let it, set it, sublet it or subdivide it, without the consent of a Government Department.  In my opinion, this is State intervention in respect of private property.  It is a case of the State preventing the citizen from exercising his lawful and democratic right as a citizen and it is wrong.  That is why I oppose this section very strenuously.</P>
      <P>But this section does more than that. It will now make it a serious offence for any person to transfer his property, to sell, set, let or sublet his property without the consent&mdash;in writing, I thank you&mdash;of the Land Commission. It does more than that and is more serious than that because this section 13 prohibits the sale, transfer, letting or subletting of all land in this State, except with the permission and approval of the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that, It is more serious still when it comes to the question of the serving of the notice by the Land Commission because this is a case in which the Land Commission will have the right, the authority and the power to freeze the lands, according to this section, for a period of a year.</P>
      <P>Last night, the Minister said he was prepared to come back to us on Report Stage and when I pressed him to have a period of three months, he said he might consider allowing a period of six months.</P>
      <P>Where proceedings have been instituted, the control period runs until the termination of these proceedings. Where notice of inspection with a view to possible acquisition has been served, the control period&mdash;until the Report Stage of this Bill&mdash;runs for one year. That is as we see it here.  This is a very drastic interference with the rights of ownership.  Simply by serving a notice of inspection, a Land Commission officer, a senior inspector or any high-ranking officer of the Land Commission can freeze all dealings in respect of a holding for one year.</P>
      <P>We appreciate the necessity of empowering the Land Commission to take prompt and effective action in certain circumstances but we consider that the period of control should very drastically be reduced.  I hope that when the Minister comes to us on Report Stage, he will meet us very generously on this matter and that, when contemplating a six months period, on further consideration, he may perhaps agree to the three months period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period when the lands are frozen, the owner will be deprived of any benefits or any profits from the land, whilst at the same time he is responsible for rent, rates and outgoings. We can also understand the more serious aspect that whilst the Land Commission may serve notice <Col N="1503" /> and freeze all dealings in relation to the land for a period of a year, the value of the land will very seriously be affected.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the full market value of land will reduce drastically in the event of the Land Commission serving the notice.  Consider the period when the lands will be left idle, when they cannot be set, sold or transferred.  In my opinion, it is a very serious attempt drastically to devalue the property, to reduce the value of any man's farm or any man's holding. It is something to which we on this side of the House cannot subscribe. That is why I feel very strongly about this objectionable section.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious matter to deprive by law the owner of land of his right to sell his property when and if he so desires.  It is a very grave abuse of the authority of Government to interfere with the right of free sale which was obtained in this country after many years of struggle and very great sacrifices.</P>

      <P>That is quite correct, but if the Land Commission serve a notice or carry out an inspection, then, under this section, for a period of a year, the owner may not sell the land, set it or transfer it to his son or to a member of his family, or even give it away for love and affection. He can do nothing with it.  That is why I say this matter is very grave and something which members of this House ought to view with very serious concern.  This procedure can be used unfairly.  The Land Commission can effectively leave a landowner in a very difficult position.  As a result of the implementation of this section, a landowner can be forced to sell his land eventually at a price far less than its market value.</P>

      <P>When a man is forced by the laws of the country to sell <Col N="1504" /> his land at less than market value, it is something the members of the House must view with the gravest concern. The section deals with the complete freezing of all lands on which the Land Commission serve notice.  What is to stop any Minister for Lands from taking advantage of that?  We may take the word of the present Minister for what it is worth that such notices will be issued by the Commission only after most serious thought and consideration of all circumstances but we have no guarantee that for political, business, personal or other purposes, the Land Commission on the instructions of any Minister for Lands will not serve notice on any farmer, whether there is an agitation for the division of land or not.  They may leave that farm for 12 months in such a way that the owner cannot derive a penny benefit from it, no matter what its extent because they serve notice of intention to inspect with a view to acquisition.</P>

      <P>When the Land Commission serve notice, the moment the inspection is carried out, the owner cannot sell after that; he cannot set and he cannot give it away.  He cannot transfer the land.  The lands are frozen under this section for 12 months and he can do nothing with them.  That is an objectionable state of affairs that we cannot possibly tolerate.  I am not too satisfied that there will not be reasons, political or otherwise, for which certain farmers may be served with notice and their lands frozen so that eventually they will be compelled to dispose of their land under value. That is a very serious matter and we must oppose it.</P>
      <P>This is a most objectionable section. It could deprive farmers of their livelihood and eventually of their land. It will deny them rights and facilities they now properly enjoy as free citizens.  This may cause a great deal of amusement to Fianna Fáil members, but when this section is passed and becomes law, many representations will be made to Deputies by landowners saying they are compelled to sell their lands under value, or that the lands are being allowed to remain in a position of giving no financial return for 12 months or whatever period the Minister fixes under this section.  That is very serious and objectionable.  It deprives farmers of the right of free sale.  No civil servant, Minister, or State Department should have authority to devalue anybody's property or prevent him from doing as he wishes with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section is not only objectionable but undemocratic and I seriously feel it is unconstitutional.  Eventually, it will cause severe hardship to all landowners and farmers.  There is nothing to prevent the Land Commission from <Col N="1506" /> serving notice and carrying out an inspection on any farm they like.  It is one of the most objectionable sections of the Bill and I hope that the House in its wisdom will, as a result of the division which will take place on it, have it rejected.</P>

In this section we are empowering the Minister to do a job in which we all hope he will succeed, that is, to bring about a state of affairs in which a man can have an economic holding.  He should live solely on the land, and his holding should be A, B or C, according to the disposition of the Land Commission.</P>

What Deputy Flanagan suggests is completely ridiculous.  A man may fall <Col N="1507" /> on hard times and want to let his land for a few years.  In that case the Minister wants him to tell the Land Commission that he wants to let the land for a few years.  Is that not the position?  Surely that is not too much to ask of anyone.  The position in Dublin and every other part of Ireland is that the Land Commission cannot buy any land at all.  They have no right to go in, good, bad or indifferent. Even if the Land Commission could buy land, it would be too expensive for the tenants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been accused here during the past few weeks of holding up the business of the House, of impeding the Minister in his endeavour to get the Bill through.  I should point out, therefore, that the last piece of reminiscence by the Fianna Fáil Deputy from Dublin has cost the House exactly 30 minutes of its valuable time.  All I want to say is simply that we believe the Bill, if it is to have the desired effect, must have teeth, and here are the teeth of the Bill.  Last night the Minister told me &mdash;I believe he also told Deputy Flanagan&mdash;that he was prepared to consider reducing the period from one year to six months.  If he implements <Col N="1513" /> that promise, it is all the safeguard that is needed.</P>
      <P>The NFA, in their survey report, say they appreciate the necessity for empowering the Land Commission to take prompt action in certain circumstances but that they consider the period of control should be reduced to one month, with, perhaps, an extension of a further month in certain cases.  As far as I am concerned, I believe a period of six months is reasonable.  We know that in the interim period, a man will be deprived of the use of his land.  In fact, the NFA report states that this has the effect of prohibiting the sale or transfer of land except by the consent of the Land Commission where the Land Commission have instituted, or propose to institute, proceedings for acquisition or resumption.</P>
      <P>Objection is made to the method by which a senior inspector of the Land Commission has the power of freezing.  What has been happening is that whenever the owner of a big piece of land which has not been properly worked has heard that the Land Commission have become interested, he runs off to sell it.  I have addressed question after question to the Minister and the Land Commission requesting that something should be done. Deputy Flanagan has been working on the same idea.  Our reason was to attempt to stop the leakage of thousands of acres of valuable land from the land pool.  We must be prepared to support efforts of the Government to achieve this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's offer of six months is not good enough because it would mean there would be a freeze of that duration on the disposal of land.  Certain Deputies, particularly Deputy P. J. Burke, have talked about 5,000 acre holdings.  I wish to talk about a man with 45 acres, perhaps in poor economic circumstances, perhaps because he still has not got over the effects of the Economic War, who has not been able to work that holding properly for that reason.  He loves that land, but he has to leave it: he must go to England or elsewhere to try to get a few quid together so that he may <Col N="1514" /> be able to return to that land some day.  Now, once the Land Commission put their dead hand on that land and freeze it, nobody will pay that man a bob for it.  He is like a man under sentence of death; he will have to sell the land eventually at much less than market value.</P>
      <P>Deputies have been talking about the people who may be looking for land; I am talking about people who are trying to sell land.  What will Fianna Fáil Deputies say to a man who comes to them and says: &ldquo;They have frozen my land&rdquo;?  I know what we shall say, if they come to us: &ldquo;Go to the Fianna Fáil people&mdash;they made it possible&rdquo;. Why should the Land Commission be allowed six months in which to make up their minds as to whether or not they should buy a farm, let it be 20 acres or 1,000 acres?  An ordinary individual must go out into the open market and make up his mind in two days.  That is only as it should be.</P>
      <P>I know the officers of the Land Commission.  They are all over 21 years of age; they have been around; they know how to buy land, how to value it.  If land is advertised in the newspapers, the Land Commission can nominate a buyer to go after it, to examine it first and buy it if it is suitable for their purposes.  If a farmer can get a better price for his land from an Irish citizen than from the Land Commission, why should the Land Commission be permitted to go in and prevent that farmer getting that price? We have had a lot of clap-trap about the economic advances made in the country.  Most of these advances were made because the price of land advanced, because it became easy to sell land, to realise money on it. Bankers were prepared to give people extra overdraft accommodation because of those circumstances.  I have in mind one case of a farmer who had a bank overdraft, and when it became public property that land in the area was being sold at excellent prices, he was able to go to his bank manager and say, having pointed out the circumstances: &ldquo;I owe you only £2,000. In the circumstances you should advance me another £2,000.  Then I can go out and buy 12 cows.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We should look at this clearly and not continue to talk about 1,000 acre holdings.  If one goes into the west of Ireland, one finds small holdings from which people have been driven through economic circumstances. Why should the disposal of such holdings by the owners be frozen if those owners can get good prices from Irish citizens?</P>
      <P>My colleagues have put up a very good case to the Minister.  We want to see the sales of lands to foreigners controlled and if the sale is to a foreigner or to an agent of a foreigner, the Land Commission should step in. We consider this section to be wrong. It is wrong to freeze a man's land for six months.  It would be wrong to go into a fair and say to a man: &ldquo;You may not sell your cattle for another three hours until we go into a hotel and decide what we shall give you for them&rdquo; while there are plenty of people at the fair to buy them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission have a job to do.  They have people who know how to value and how to carry out the various transactions.  The only thing that is wrong is that they are too slow about it.  I would exhort the Minister to make the period three months.  Three months is long enough to hold up any man's place.  It is a terrible thing we are doing here.  There were some irresponsible Deputies here like Deputy Burke talking about Irish people who owned land as if they were <Col N="1516" /> Hottentots.  They have the right to sell their land.  If a man is broke and wants to sell his farm and can get a good price for it so that he will have money in his pocket, is it Fianna Fáil policy to prevent him doing so?</P>
    <P>I made a statement here tonight that the Minister and the Land Commission are trying to set themselves up as head landlords of Ireland.  We do not want any more landlords in Ireland.  This is the kind of section that would make a Minister&mdash;and he might not want it&mdash; the head landlord.  The Minister could come along to take over a farm in accordance with a provision dealt with last night where the Land Commission can, after the passing of this Act, make an advance for the purchase of a holding.  Then the man's land can be fenced off and he is prevented from selling it at the market price.</P>
    <P>The man who owns that land is a citizen of this State.  He was probably born on that farm and his father before him.  Nevertheless, we talk lightly here of putting him out of it.  The poor man does not want to sell.  They run down the value of the place.  The owner is out of his depth and is often frightened of the whole business.  This is a scandalous state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I grew up among people whose proudest boast was what their people did in the Land War and the fact that they stuck to their lands.  Now if their sons or grandsons want to sell their land the Parliament of Ireland will go coldly into these lobbies and vote to deny them that right.  I have looked over at the Fianna Fáil Party's empty benches in the long watches of this debate.  Nobody spoke except Deputy Burke and he spoke out of turn. Nevertheless, when the bell rings, they will go into the lobbies like the trained dog I saw in the Gaiety Theatre long ago and pass the section if we challenge a division.</P>

      <P>They do not know what is going on in the House.  The Minister should look at this again.  I want to give the Minister every possible <Col N="1517" /> chance of taking over land that should be taken over.  I want to prevent the Minister and the Land Commission being put in a position to say in regard to a holding: &ldquo;We have made an advance on this holding and, therefore, nobody within 50 miles may buy it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In regard to subdivision, I do not know why we must write down everything. If a man has 60 acres of land and wants to sell 20 acres, he must reapportion the land annuities.  I have known &ldquo;slickers&rdquo; in this country who would sell portion of their land and who would endeavour to have all the land annuities on the holding imposed on the portion they were selling, giving them a freehold.  It is not a bad idea if one can get away with it.  However, my experience of the Land Commission is that they will not allow people to do that.  They go back even to the Brehon laws.  As we were told on one famous occasion: &ldquo;To every cow its calf and to every book its copy.&rdquo;  The Land Commission have added: &ldquo;To every acre its annuity.&rdquo;  It is not necessary to put that down solemnly in an Act that people must get permission from the Land Commission to subdivide their land.  I am sure the Minister in his professional capacity, when a sale takes place and he is acting for the vendor, will automatically write to the Land Commission and ask the Land Commission to reapportion the land annuities. There is a great deal of deadwood in this Bill that will only make the whole land issue more complicated.  The more complicated it is made, the worse it will be from the point of view of selling land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan was criticised here for remarks in regard to division of <Col N="1518" /> land.  My memory is not bad.  I have never seen a question down from Deputy Flanagan where he wanted an ordinary farm to be taken over.  It might be a big estate that was not being farmed properly.  I remember when this Party were over there and Deputy Blowick was Minister for Lands, Deputy Flanagan stormed him on the question of taking over these estates in his constituency.  Deputy Flanagan was right and Deputy Flanagan will do it again.  I am thankful that I represent a constituency where even though there are land hungry people, as there are everywhere in Ireland, they are not coming to me in this connection.  Most of the big estates in County Waterford that were not being run properly were taken over and divided, and rightly so.  There are big estates left in County Waterford and the Land Commission would have no business entering them at all because they give an enormous amount of employment.  The employers are generous and they have the sign of good employers in the age of the people working for them.  They have people working for them who worked in these estates for three generations.</P>

These statutory definitions are as follows:</P>
