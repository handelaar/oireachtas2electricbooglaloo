      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this Vote last night I expressed the opinion that it is one of the most important that comes before this House.  I admit that the Minister has gone a long way since he assumed office in this Department but there are certain sections in the Department that still have not got over 1955-56 and the slow-up tactics then adopted. Evidently when a civil servant gets something into his mind it is a devil of a job to get it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister particularly to have a look at the regulation governing houses capable of economic repair. In rural areas, especially in villages, there are many houses let at about 2/- a week.  Who would repair such houses?  The Minister says local authorities may take them over and repair them but local authorities in general are not prepared to involve themselves in a lot of legal proceedings for the benefit of lawyers every day of the week.  I suggest that part of <Col N="455" /> the Department's administration badly needs improvement.</P>
    <P>I dealt last night with the problem that arises when a medical officer in an area returns a number of families being in need of houses.  Say he returns 24 families as being in need. I wish to know from the Minister how ultimately those 24 can be reduced to 18&mdash;by 25 per cent.  I endeavoured about a fortnight ago to get the answer from the Minister on that point.  He told me he would bring in a new Bill. That anomaly remains in the meantime and we find that if a medical officer reports that 24 families in an area are in need of houses&mdash;the medical officer knows what he is talking about&mdash;that number is nearly invariably reduced.  It means that a certain number of families will still be in need of rehousing.</P>
    <P>In regard to housing in general, there are inexcusable delays in the Minister's Department.  I have examined the matter as fairly as I can.  I shall give an example.  At the end of 1962 a survey was taken in an area under the jurisdiction of the Cork County Council and, as a result, I moved that 24 houses be built.  Unfortunately, the owner of the land selected by the architect objected to the site and compulsory proceedings had to be taken.  On 3rd July, 1963, I asked the Minister for Local Government the date of the inquiry for Compulsory Purchase Order No. 1 of 1962 for the acquisition of housing sites at Carrigtwohill and Dripsey, County Cork, and the reason for the delay in the decision of his Department.  The Minister's reply was:</P>
    <P>The public local inquiry in relation to the South Cork (No. 1) Order, 1962, was held on 18th December, 1962.  Due to pressure of other work, the inspector was unable to furnish his report until the middle of last month.  A decision on the Order will be made shortly.</P>
    <P>That was from December to the following July&mdash;from, one might say, January, 1962, to last week when the lay-out plans for that scheme of houses left the Minister's Department. <Col N="456" /> There is no justification for that and nobody will pretend to me that there is.  The building of houses for 25 families is held up from 1961 until July of 1964 and not a sod is turned yet.  We have yet to invite contracts for them and those contracts have yet to be approved by the Department. The Minister should find some means of cutting the red tape.  If I am an inspector in his Department and I hold a sworn inquiry in December surely it will not take me from December until the following July to give my decision?  If a judge in the law courts did that he would forget all about the case after six or seven months.  That is only one example.  I should not mind so much if it were only an isolated case but we have a very large number of them.  Housing is more important than swimming pools and so on.  It is the most important matter we have to deal with.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Our young people are now settling down and getting married. They have constant employment and a decent job.  Next to a decent job, a man is entitled to a decent home.  If he cannot get that, then all our proposals are of no use.</P>
      <P>We hear talk about amenities.  Just consider this case.  We built some schemes of houses.  Whilst there was a backdoor, there was no entrance at the back so that a lorry or a cart might enter.  I know of the case of a man who earns his livelihood by sawing blocks and selling them.  The old horse he has to cart the blocks has to be brought in the front door every night, right through the hall and into the backyard and, in the morning, the horse has to be brought out the same way again.  We applied to the Department of Local Government to have a back way created.  There was no delay about their reply which said that it was not an amenity and was not required. The horse is still going in through the halldoor in a village of over 1,000 inhabitants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the same position very largely in regard to housing.  I do not think that anything less than an Order should be issued by the Minister to all <Col N="457" /> local authorities that housing sites should be purchased in the neighbourhood of every village and town, particularly where there are amenities or the hope of an industry.  Just outside Blarney, the mills are expanding and will give employment to an additional 170 people but there is no hope of houses being provided.  The owners of that industry have to send buses as far as Macroom to collect workers.  It is time that that position were remedied in no uncertain fashion.  I went to that area and asked how many people were prepared to build their own houses, without the local authority, on condition that the local authority provided and developed a site and gave it to them at roughly cost price.  There are 32 families in that village prepared to build their own houses under that system but they are held up until a site is found for them.  In all such cases, particularly in areas where industry is located, the local authority should take steps to acquire housing sites and to develop them and have them ready. I believe that the 32 families were driven to the decision to build their own houses by virtue of the regulations in force in the Minister's Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that because out of some 35 applicants for local authority houses in that village only two were sanctioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought four. Two?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They got four after a row but it started at two.  That kind of thing must stop.  If the Minister has officials whose business apparently it is to hold up housing, let him get rid of them, throw them out in the street and not have them delaying the building of decent houses for our people. I hold it is deliberate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I shall not have to go further than that.  Anyone who wishes to follow the matter up need only refer to General Costello's statement where he said he could give employment to 200 more families in Mallow if the local authorities would provide houses for them.  At present he is sending out <Col N="458" /> buses to Newmarket and Kanturk collecting workers and bringing them in. Those workers are deprived of the overtime that in the ordinary course they would get in the industry.  Those anomalies are there and while we are happy that the tide has turned and employment is being found for our young people in their own country, still, if employment is to be found for them they must be housed near their work.</P>
    <P>Another thing I come up against in the Minister's Department is the position in regard to subsidy.  Under the Department's regulations a man cannot get a house when he gets married. Apparently, the Department decrees that he must live in a tent or under a bush.  What happens is that a large number of decent people living in villages and small towns and in rural districts are driven into the cities there to take one room at from £3 to £4 a week.  That is the only hope they have of housing.  It is common practice all over the country.  In order to pay the £3 or £4 a week the man, of necessity, must find a fairly highly-paid job in that city or town.  He will not go back to the country.  He is lost to the country solely because he cannot get a house.  In many cases the people-in-law take them in but when that happens the vicious system of the Department decrees that the unfortunate man with his wife and perhaps two or more children cannot get a local authority house because if the local authority give him a house they lose either one-third or two-thirds of the subsidy that would ordinarily go with that house.  That is a definite regulation and if the Minister has any doubt about it I can show him seven families in Blarney village alone living under those circumstances, having to stay with a father and mother and probably unmarried brothers or sisters of either the husband or the wife in an ordinary local authority house.</P>
    <P>I know there is a regulation by the Minister or the Department that such people are not to be allowed in with their in-laws but the facts are there and it is time the Minister considered this matter and remedied that situation. It is not in Dublin or in Cork city <Col N="459" /> that the worry of housing exists: it exists in every rural town and village, perhaps more so than in the cities. What you have in the city are unfortunate couples driven in from the country because they have no hope of getting a house in the country.  I do not know if the Department have any idea yet of providing houses for couples when they are married.  I do not know when the Department changed in this regard.  I shall just give this instance. Some years ago we succeeded in the South Cork Board in building 50 houses at Little Island in County Cork. When the ordinary housing needs of the area were filled I appealed to the manager on behalf of a number of families down there, all courting couples as we call them, who wanted to get married and who had no houses. I made a bargain with him.  He said: &ldquo;Let them come to me with a letter from the parish priest certifying their intention of getting married and getting a house and I will give them a house.&rdquo; There are six families in Little Island today rearing their families under those circumstances.</P>
    <P>What has changed in the Department? What Pooh-Bah has jumped up? Some little Hitler wants to say: &ldquo;Look what I can do&rdquo;.  What is wrong with decent boys and girls who want to get married being provided with a house by the local authority?  Are they to be driven into the city or the local town to live in squalor in one room for three or more years and then when they apply for a house in the country, where they came from they are told that they are living and working in an urban area and, therefore, the rural authorities cannot consider them for housing.  That is how the cities are being packed up.  Let us try to end that if we can.  I hope that when the Minister brings in his new Bill we shall have a better time.</P>
    <P>Before leaving housing there is another matter I want to deal with. Last night Deputy Corish referred to the increase in the subsidy but I find you have two regulations in the Department in that connection which should be changed because of their grave injustice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> A man working at Rushbrooke is three and a half miles from Cobh. A man working in Haulbowline is half a mile from Cobh.  The man in Rushbrooke is not entitled to a county council house.  The urban council must provide for him.  The man living in Haulbowline is a country boy, although he is only half a mile from the town across the water, and he has to be provided with a house by the county council.  Under that scheme I have succeeded in having over 200 houses built by the county council in Cobh.  If the burden of providing those houses had fallen on the urban council it would be wiped out.</P>
    <P>Those houses are side by side. There is a line of 24 county council houses on one side of the road and across from them are 52 houses which are the property of the urban council. We brought in a purchase scheme in the county council under which a man can purchase his house if he wants to do so and under that scheme he can purchase at a reduction of about 2/-a week in the rent, from 11/- to 9/-. The urban council houses were built in the same year and at the same rent but when a man wishes to purchase one of them the rent will be increased from 11/- to 32/- due to the fact that the moment the house is purchased the Department grabs back the subsidy. A lot of the men living in both schemes are working in the same job and have the same pay but that is the rotten position that exists.</P>
    <P>It is a long time since I came here and one of the earliest jobs we set ourselves at the time, we were idealists then, was to make every man as much the owner of his own house as the farmer was of his farm.  We have travelled a lot of queer roads since then but I put this to the Minister, if all the houses in Cobh were purchased tomorrow the Department or whoever paid the subsidy would gain £1,800 a year.  I see no justification for preventing these people from purchasing their houses, and I would suggest that the Minister look into that part of his programme.</P>
    <P>There is an institution in existence that has now become known as the <Col N="461" /> National Building Agency.  Those of us who are fairly old here, and some who are not so old, can cast their minds back to the old arrangement that prevailed before we got the labourers' cottage schemes under which the labourer became at least partially the owner of his own house.  We can all remember that for a month before the 25th February of each year that unfortunate labourer lived in terror that the farmer would come along and say to him that he did not want his services after 25th March and that he wanted the house.</P>
    <P>I have often seen these labourers with their donkeys and carts and their few articles of furniture going off and looking for a new home on the 25th March.  Thank God we ended that system when we brought in the rural labourers' cottages scheme but it is being brought back here under a new system.  The old farmer was not a bad fellow, he had some consideration for his workers.  One could also expect consideration from the old time industrialists but under this National Building Agency system the houses built are the property of the industrialists. If a man becomes ill or dies and his family are living in one of these houses the industrialist can tell them to get out.  We are getting back to a system that is wrong, fundamentally wrong.  You cannot expect a German, Italian or Frenchman who comes over here to run our industries to have the same consideration for our workers as the old time industrialists had.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government is in charge of the National Building Agency.  Any industrialist today has enough to do to watch his industry without turning himself into a cottage builder and a repairer of houses.  Under the old system of local government we were able to make provision for houses for key men in industry.  I will give some examples.  In Youghal the Dwyer firm are paying the rent for a large number of houses every month to the urban council.  These are houses that <Col N="462" /> were built by the Youghal Urban Council for the key men in that industry and they cost the ratepayers nothing.  Under the same scheme I had six houses built in Midleton, also for the Dwyer firm, and the rent of those houses is paid each month to Cork County Council by the firm which has the say as to who is going to occupy them.  The firm built them and paid all the expenses in connection with them and we facilitated the firm as far as the ground was concerned.</P>
      <P>That is a better system than the one under which the National Building Agency is operated.  That agency can build a couple of hundred houses, but if one of the men living in those houses becomes ill and cannot work, he can be thrown out on the road.  I suggest that the money being provided for the National Building Agency could be very usefully employed in other directions as regards housing. We should avoid a return to shoneen landlordism.</P>
      <P>For the past seven or eight years work on the road in Glanmire, which is part of the main road from Cork to Dublin, has been held up because some genius in the Department of Local Government got an idea about running a new road and by-passing Glanmire. I do not mind the by-pass but I do mind the plan for the routing of the new road and the cost of it.  I intend putting down a couple of questions in regard to the matter.  Admittedly, the revenue from petrol, oil and other things is 15 times what it was when I last asked a question about it. The revenue from motor taxation has also gone up and it is time that we knew what it is now.  All this money should not be poured back into the roads in order to make roads for some lunatic to drive along at 80 miles per hour without regard to whom he may kill.  There are more deaths on the roads since the roads were widened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I challenge the Minister to produce for me the figures with regard to accidents on the road from Cork to Carrigtwohill in the last two years as compared with the figures for the previous five years.  He will find that there were more accidents in those two years <Col N="463" /> than there were in the five previous years.  That road is now 80 feet wide in parts.  Money is being poured into it.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the estimate for housing should be increased by £250,000 and we should proceed with housing and clean up the mess that exists in regard to it.  The Minister should get a scissors and cut the red tape in his Department.  If seven or eight years ago, I was able to get a municipal house on receipt of a letter from a parish priest that a couple were getting married, what has happened in the Department of Local Government that that is no longer the case?  I thought they were to simplify matters. Instead, they have so tied matters up that a man with a wife and ten children who applies for a house tomorrow will have it built for him in ten years' time.</P>
    <P>The houses in Carrigtwohill have been under discussion for three years and a sod has not been turned yet.  I have given the figures.  There were plenty of reminders.  I have here question after question that I asked in regard to those houses and other houses in my constituency.  If there is money available it should be spent in providing decent homes for our young people and let the swimming pools and motor roads take second or third place.</P>
    <P>I do not blame people for being sore. I do not blame a man with a wife and three or four children being sore because he finds himself dependent on his mother-in-law or his father-in-law for shelter.  There is no use in pretending that labour is not available for building purposes.  At the moment at Tivoli just outside Cork City there is a circus being built for millionaires. About 80 workers and tradesmen go to work there every morning, building hotels.  Where is the money for that coming from?  What kind of people are being catered for?  I am sure, a Cheann Comhairle, that even on your salary you could not afford to live in one of them and could not afford a month's holiday in one of them, not to mind the ordinary Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to two <Col N="464" /> speakers from the Fianna Fáil benches last night and today&mdash;Deputy Burke last night and Deputy Corry today.  Of course, Deputy Burke congratulates whatever Minister is concerned, no matter what the state of his Department may be.  I suppose that has been part of his technique since he came in here.  Deputy Corry, however, has not congratulated the Minister.</P>
      <P>First, I propose to deal with two matters with which every member of a county council or local authority is concerned at the present time, namely, roads and housing.  I shall take roads first.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke, last night, mentioned that it was a lovely thing and a matter on which the Minister should be congratulated that the time was coming when there would be three laneways on the arterial roads from the city of Dublin.  He suggested that it was a lovely thing that on the Bray road it would no longer be necessary for cars to travel bumper to bumper on a Sunday afternoon.  He suggested that planes were held up at Collinstown because the roads were not sufficiently wide to take the cars bringing passengers to the Airport and, according to Deputy Burke, planes always waited for the passengers.  He suggested that the Minister is to be congratulated on having all these exits from Dublin and that it is a wonderful thing.  Deputy Burke lives in Dublin and, like many other people living in Dublin, is far removed from the people in the country.</P>
      <P>I attended a meeting of Kilkenny County Council last Monday week. We got notices of road grants for the coming year.  To our great surprise, the county road improvement grant has been out again.  In 1962, the county road improvement grant was £100,700.  In 1963, it was cut to £48,200.  For the coming year the figure is being cut to £38,100 and the Minister advised us that if we have more than 50 per cent dust-free roads in the county we can transfer more of the county road grant to main and arterial roads.  He has transferred 52 per cent of what we were getting in 1962-63 from county roads to other roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> Some members asked was the Minister out of touch.  The Minister was at one time a county councillor.  He had the same regard for the people as every other member of a county council has.  They wondered if the Minister has been too long in office. When you are in office seven or eight years, you begin to think you own the country.  I had that experience myself in Kilkenny Corporation.  I was a member of that Corporation for eight years and I began to think I was half proprietor of the town hall, I was there so long.  People are wondering if the Minister is losing touch with the ordinary people of the country.  I know he requires technical advice, but he should take only advice, not direction. He should be the one person to maintain contact between the Government and the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>The majority of our county council strongly support the Minister, but not one member got up to support him on that day.  They all felt the Minister was losing touch with the ordinary people.  In 1962-63 the arterial road improvement grant was £30,000.  In the coming year, it will be £90,000, an increase of 200 per cent.  This is for seven or eight miles of the Dublin-Cork road and portion of the Carlow-Waterford road.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister realise the number of people leaving farms for lack of amenities and want of consideration from the Governments in power?  The county council feel that the only way to keep people at home is to provide good roads to their houses.  Two years ago, they started a scheme for taking over and improving <i>cul-de-sac</i> roads.  They agreed to spend £30,000 each year for three years to put them into first-class condition.  We found this scheme of such benefit that we plan to do it for the coming three years.  At the same time, however, the Minister reverses his whole outlook on county roads.  Instead of improving a certain portion of them each year, we are back to a situation in which there is practically no improvement at all.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, we had a five-year plan for our roads.  That plan could be seen in the office of every county <Col N="466" /> surveyor, showing the roads that would be done this year, next year, and so on up to the five years.  Priority was given according to whether it was a main road or a link road.  Because of the Minister's action, that plan has been practically scrapped.  The county surveyor was asked when people entitled to have their roads done next would have them done, and he said the earliest date he could possibly do them would be in five years' time.</P>
    <P>Under the five-year plan, the people got their roads done in rotation and they were satisfied.  When they asked when their road would be done, they were told they would have to wait another two years but then the road would be done.  With this change in policy, people will no longer have an opportunity of getting their roads done.  The county council appointed a deputation of the five Deputies from the constituency to meet the Minister and ask him at least to put back the £10,000 he took off last year's county road improvement grant, so restoring it to the £48,000 it was last year.  Two years ago, it was £100,000 and this was geared to the five-year plan; now it is £38,000.  It means that not one mile of road in Kilkenny will be rolled this year.</P>
    <P>I am giving particulars of the position I know myself.  I am sure in the remaining counties they have much the same problem.  I was asked by the county council to raise this matter, but I did not think I would get the opportunity so soon.  I am genuinely appealing to the Minister to reconsider this matter.  The people feel that the engineers have the master's say, and the Minister tells them to do as they wish. There has been an increase in the yield from motor taxation, and if this were used for the improvement of arterial roads, I would have no objection.  But I do object to the fact that people cannot bring cars and tractors up to their houses and have no hope of getting their roads improved for five years.  As one councillor said, we have had 40 years of native government and the people still have these old roads.  These people, whether they are farmers or labourers, have to have a car or motorcycle to get to work or to town.  They <Col N="467" /> are paying high taxation on their cars and tractors.  Milk and beet lorries are refusing to call to their houses because springs are broken.  These people have to bring beet one or two miles to meet the lorries.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have been converted to this arterial road policy.  I would appeal to him very strongly at least to restore the grant of £48,000. When the people see these roads improved and the county roads ignored, they are annoyed.  If the Minister were living in his own constituency and had people coming into him every week inquiring about roads, he might have a different outlook and might handle the officials better.  I am sure, too, the Minister has been directed by the Government. This Government are known as a Dublin Government.  They have practically no contact with the country at all.  Everybody knows that.  The present Government, from the Taoiseach down, are practically all Dubliners.  They have lost touch with the country.  The Minister, being refreshed every weekend, as I am sure he is, should give the country people reasonable roads at least.</P>
    <P>I and the other Deputies in my constituency have been asked to meet the Minister.  I am sure he will meet us. I hope to impress upon him, and so do my colleagues, the necessity for retaining the five-year plan in order to allow the roads to be finished in a normal way.  I am not by any means against arterial roads, but there should be enough money there to deal with all roads.  The Government have, of course, reduced the grant from the Road Fund this year.  In the last two years there was a grant of £555,000 but that has been cut this year to £350,000.  This grant was supposed to help local authorities to provide roads in areas in which the railway was closed down.</P>
    <P>The Kilkenny-Portlaoise railway was closed down and buses are now serving Kilkenny to Portlaoise.  They travel over a good part of County Kilkenny and they have to traverse a very bad road indeed from Ballyraggett to Durrow.  No money has been allotted <Col N="468" /> for the improvement of that road.  Kilkenny has received no money to help them to improve the roads in those areas in which the railway was closed down.  I think it is a very bad principle to reduce the money from the Road Fund.  Deputy Burke said last night there is plenty of money for everything and the only difficulty is to know where to spend it.  He also said there is plenty of work to be done.  Yet, the Minister states that he is cutting the grant from the Road Fund.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter and to continue the five-year plan for county roads.  That did serve a purpose and the people were quite satisfied to wait.</P>
    <P>I come now to housing.  Nobody agrees more with Deputy Corry than I do in what he said this morning.  He said there was inexcusable delay&mdash;I thought the word &ldquo;inexcusable&rdquo; particularly apposite&mdash;in the Department. I thoroughly agree with that.  I have personal knowledge and experience of Kilkenny local authority.  The Minister has been eight years in office now and, during that eight years, the Corporation have not brought one single scheme forward.  It is not that they are not active.  They are a most active local authority but they know that, if they rehouse people living in overcrowded conditions, they will not get the full subsidy.</P>
    <P>I remember being on a deputation to the Minister to ask him to reconsider that, but we never got anywhere.  I think the Minister's idea was that, if we knew we were not going to get the two-thirds subsidy, we would drop housing very soon.  Housing was dropped.  We completed one scheme since the Minister came into office, but that had been initiated by his predecessor. There has not been one scheme since.  Young married people with children are living with their parents. I look on this in another light.  What effect will it have on the health of the young people?  We have health services and we are contributing £ for £ towards the health services.  If we do not provide proper housing for the people what will the health services be except a waste of money?  Is not the first <Col N="469" /> essential to health good housing, water and hygiene?</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government closed down on housing completely since 1956.  Indeed, it is only this year they have really awakened to the housing situation.  They indulged in delaying tactics.  They did not say they were not going to build, but they delayed.  Deputy Corry mentioned one instance today in which one scheme took 3½ years and I believe a sod has not yet been turned on the site.  There was a sworn inquiry 3½ years ago about taking the land and not one sod has been turned on the land yet.  Does that not show, as he said, inexcusable delay?</P>
    <P>It is no use blaming the officials. They play the tune the master calls. If the master calls for a slowing down, they will slow down.  If he calls for an increase in tempo, they will speed things up.  It is no use blaming the officials.  Look at the returns in the last year or so.  Houses fell down in Dublin.  The Minister and the Government got a shock.  They were shocked into doing something at last about housing.  There were consultations between the local authority housing officials in Dublin and the officials of the Department.  Until the houses fell down there was no consultation.  There were delaying tactics.</P>
    <P>I know of a case in Kilkenny of a man with nine children.  He has a job in Kilkenny and his wife and children live 50 miles away.  He has been there now six months.  He hikes home every Saturday afternoon and back again on Sunday evening.  Another man, a postman, told me that he is going to apply for a transfer to Dublin because there is no hope of getting a house in Kilkenny. He and his wife and family are living with his parents.</P>
    <P>The local authority will not build when they will not get the full subsidy. These young people cannot afford to pay £3 and £4 per week for a house which carries only one-third subsidy. Overcrowding provides, in my opinion, complete justification for rehousing, with the full subsidy.  These young men on comparatively small wages will sometimes pay £3 or £4 a week for a flat, but that is a temporary arrangement. <Col N="470" /> They hope to get houses as quickly as possible and at an economic rent.</P>
    <P>This matter has been raised on several occasions at municipal conferences, appealing to the Minister to give the full subsidy for rehousing those in overcrowded conditions.  Have these representations done any good? Have they been of any use?  The Minister has taken no action whatsoever. Look at the contributions to local authority housing.  In 1961-62 it was £2,190,000.  In 1962-63 it was £2,345,000, an increase of £155,000.  In 1963-64 it was £2,380,000, an increase of £35,000.  In 1964-65 it will be £2,460,000, a mere increase of £80,000. The Minister should be ashamed. The increase in the contributions over the past four years is only £270,000. Money talks.  That shows the approach. If the Minister were prepared to invest money in housing we would have plenty of houses.  I appeal to him to change the policy.  He has been forced to change it in the case of Dublin. Down the country the position is as bad as it is in Dublin, if not worse. People are leaving the country and coming to Dublin in the hope of getting a house.  There is no hope in the country at all.  The Minister need not bring in any new Bill.  He need only relax the regulations that are there and use them to enable the local authorities to rehouse the people where there is overcrowding.</P>
    <P>Due to the non-building of houses, many old houses that were condemned have been reoccupied.  Those people should be rehoused and it would be better to start at the beginning and build good houses.  As Deputy Corry said, there is no scarcity of workers or tradesmen.  Luxury hotels are going up all over the place.  First things should come first.  We should build houses first and then luxury hotels.  We all agree that tourism is a great thing. No one objects to that, and the more hotel accommodation we have the better.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to change his policy and to ask the Government to change their policy, more especially in regard to the country areas.  If the Government are out of touch with the <Col N="471" /> country, the Minister should not be. He should change his policy as regards the country, and give us an opportunity to provide the houses which are so badly needed.  As I have said, practically no houses have been built throughout the country since the Government took office eight years ago.  Not one house has been built in Kilkenny since the Government took office.</P>
    <P>While we all welcome the group water schemes and the regional water schemes, we think that progress is much too slow.  In Kilkenny, the Mooncoin regional water supply scheme was initiated about 12 years ago and it is still not completed.  I appreciate that a certain amount of delay is inevitable in relation to water supply schemes.  The flow of water has to be measured.  Calculations have to be made which cannot be made in one year and take perhaps two or three years, but in the meantime documents could be prepared and land could be acquired.  I appreciate that all that cannot be done overnight, but there is no point in having those schemes hanging fire for ten or 12 years.</P>
    <P>What is happening in Kilkenny is that quite a number of farmers have started a scheme of their own, and the Mooncoin scheme will not be half as economic a proposition for the council when it comes into operation as it would have been if all the people were to take the supply.  I am sure the regional scheme would be ample for everyone, but, as I say, some farmers have prepared there own methods of providing water.  I suggest that the engineers of the Department should be given the task of streamlining those schemes, and they should not wait ten or 12 years to put in a regional water scheme.  Every help and encouragement should be given to them.</P>
    <P>I want to appeal to the Minister again in regard to the county roads. Now that I have brought it to his notice, I hope he realises what some councils are thinking about himself and his administration.  They feel the Minister is no longer thinking for himself. They feel he has got out of the <Col N="472" /> habit of thinking for himself and is letting his officials think for him.  If he were thinking for himself, he would never have got into this impasse about the county roads.  The Minister should wake up and think for himself.  He should renew his energy and do something about the housing and the roads which are so badly needed.  I ask him to shake himself up and do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one Department that can be described, like the curate's egg, as good in spots.  I am afraid I would not quite agree with some of the previous speakers who seemed to think the Minister is out of touch with what is happening in the country.  As a matter of fact, it would appear from some of the replies which he has given from time to time that he knows a lot more than might be expected about some of the matters&mdash;even very minor matters&mdash;that have occurred throughout the country.  While he may not have the slant which we would like him to have on those matters, at the same time it does display a certain interest on the part of the Minister, even in minor matters.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I should like to point out that if he can have this intimate knowledge of the matters which occur in the country, he must take responsibility for things which go wrong.  I should like, in particular, to refer him to the question of road grants. In my constituency we have been boasting that our county council have achieved 100 per cent black top, dust-free roads.  Last year, because of that, we were penalised by a complete loss of the county road grant.  We got £98,000 less than we got in previous years.  That regulation which is administered by the Department is very unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could have administered the money given to the council in some other way, but we set out to make the existing county roads black top, dust-free, and we took practically every lane in the county in which there were two or more houses, and made them county roads.  For doing that, £98,000 was swiped from us this year.  The Minister pointed out that the Meath County Council returned quite a substantial amount of money which they <Col N="473" /> had been unable to spend.  They were unable to spend it not because of the fact that they had no work to do, but because of the fact that it was an arterial road grant.  Our planning was not sufficiently advanced and the result was that we had reluctantly to notify the Department that we were unable to carry out the work in the prescribed period.  While we are going ahead with the planning it is possible that the same thing, or almost the same thing, may recur this year.</P>
    <P>This has an effect in two ways.  It means that useful work which could be done is not done and it has the effect of reducing the amount of money available for employment.  Practically every local authority has now got its road staff down to a fairly compact group, ranging between 300 and 500. The local authorities have endeavoured to keep those people employed for the full year but with increasing costs of wages and materials, and with the reduction in road grants, the problem is becoming very difficult.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate that because he was chairman of his own county council for years and his local authority has the biggest number of direct employees in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would ask him to carry out as soon as possible what he said in his opening address he intends, that is, to have a revision of the entire road system.  In Meath we have a considerable number of roads which are still listed as county roads but which are carrying a far greater volume of traffic than some of the main roads in other parts.  It is only reasonable that we should ask that those roads be classified as main roads so that we can at least get the grant available for their maintenance.  The position has been aggravated because all the railways, except the main line between Dublin and Belfast, have been closed.  Quite a volume of cement traffic goes from Drogheda to various parts of the country.  Before the lines were closed, the normal thing was that this would be sent by rail direct from the cement factory.  Now it is sent by road and one only has to look at the roads to realise the damage being caused by heavy lorries on roads which were <Col N="474" /> never intended to carry such heavy traffic.  Neither did we get any railway grants and it is only fair that we should ask the Minister to get his Department to consider allocating some type of grant to compensate for the damage being done to those roads. Unless that is done, it means that the rates in Meath must carry very heavy increases for the purpose of doing this type of work and I do not think that is desirable.</P>
    <P>The improvement of the arterial roads is to be welcomed, but as some other speaker said, it might go a little bit too far.  I do not believe that it is a good policy to spend between £10,000 and £20,000 to remove a small hill from a road.  Possibly later on when an American tourist passes over it, he will consider it an excellent road. It would be much better if that money were spent on essential roads for essential purposes.  As far as traffic is concerned, we all know that over the past few months the position is becoming chaotic, particularly on the Dublin-Belfast road.  We now have very heavy trucks carrying merchandise which was formerly carried by rail.</P>
    <P>A matter about which the Minister might be able to do something with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, is that some drivers seem to think they must drive as close to the white line as possible.  This can hold up a whole line of cars.  I am sure the Minister has had experience of this exasperating practice by people who have no regard for anybody else on the road.  Another thing is that you find heavy trucks with trailers attached to them driving as close as possible to each other and not making use of the space available to them.  I do not know whether the Minister can deal with that or not.</P>
    <P>As far as the speed limit is concerned, I have expressed my views on this matter before.  It seems that the speed limits are being kept by some people but not by others and why they get away with that I do not know.  It is quite common to find, coming into a town, that as we slow down to observe the 30 miles per hour speed limit, somebody passes us at 50 miles an hour, or 60 or 70 miles an hour, <Col N="475" /> and mainly through the villages and towns.  Most of these drivers, I still maintain, come from Northern Ireland. They seem to think that the law does not affect them at all.  Some of them are not from the north of Ireland but the majority appear to have north of Ireland registrations.  There are others, as I say, who do not come from the north of Ireland but who appear to think they are above the law and who continue blatantly to break the speed limit.  They do not appear to be picked up for this and as long as they get away with it, they will continue to break the speed limits.</P>
    <P>In regard to arterial roads, I understand that some of the planning has been held up because an aerial survey has not been carried out.  When I was young, I understood that a good engineer with a good map and a rule could plan a road.  Apparently this is not the position now.  He must have an aerial picture of what is happening. I suggest the Minister might tell his engineering staff that it is not necessary to have all the details of the house rooftops, etc., before they plan a road and that a rule and map might still be used extensively.</P>
    <P>Practically every speaker in this debate referred to housing.  I am afraid my approach to this question is different from that of many others. I am not prepared to agree that as far as house planning, sanctioning and so on is concerned matters are as bad as others believe.  There has been quite a substantial improvement in the rural areas as far as the planning and sanctioning of houses is concerned and my complaint is of another type.  I feel that for some extraordinary reason, whether because of lack of staff or lack of will, the grant applications sanctions and the sending out of cheques for work done seem to have come almost to a standstill.  It is not unusual for people like myself to have to ring up again and again only to be told that the file is with the inspector.  Whether the inspector has gone on a vacation to Bermuda, or somewhere like that, and taken the file with him, I do not know, but it is no use to people who with no small <Col N="476" /> amount of capital have carried out the reconstruction or erection of a house to be told months afterwards when they expected to have their bills paid and when people who supplied them with material are dunning them, to be told that the file is with the inspector.</P>
    <P>If there are not sufficient inspectors, the Minister should get more and if the clerical staff&mdash;who are extremely courteous and who go to great trouble to get details for one&mdash;are not able to handle the work, then some more should be supplied.  There is no use talking about increased grants and facilities if the most important part is held up for some reason or another.  I suggest the reason is shortage of staff. Normally, up to about 12 months ago, when a job was finished, then within three weeks the person would have the money.  Now it appears to be months and months and there does not seem to be any way of getting the red tape cut.  Following on that, there are occasional schemes which appear to be held up for some peculiar reason by certain groups of officials.</P>
    <P>I will instance one such scheme.  The Minister in his opening speech referred to the facilities which should be and would be given to tenants of local authority houses who were prepared to build houses for themselves, and, in fact, suggested they should be facilitated in every way, even to the extent of having sites made available to them. I want to instance the case of one group of 14 people, five of whom are tenants of urban council houses, who after trying all round the town to purchase a site for themselves eventually purchased a site beside the town of Navan &mdash;I am glad the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is here; I am sure he knows as much about this case as I do&mdash;and paid for it out of their own funds.  They formed a society and started to build houses.</P>
    <P>It is not an understatement if I say that every possible obstacle that could be created at local authority level or Department level was placed in their way.  Attempts were made to prevent their building the houses.  After being refused the facilities for which they asked, a connection with the urban <Col N="477" /> supply which was only a couple of hundred yards away, and after the county council members had insisted on such supply being given to them, the Department of Local Government have now decided that because they are getting the facility of having the urban water supply connected to their houses, there will be a cut of £25 per house on the grounds that they are getting a public supply.  The sum of £25 per house may seem very small but it is £50 when the local authority subsidy, the supplementary grant, is taken in.  These people have been treated shamefully. Whether it is somebody at local authority level or somebody within the Department who is raising obstacles out of a fit of pique because things did not work out the way he expected, somebody definitely has a spleen against these people.</P>
    <P>I am stating this categorically because if the Minister and his officials want to have an investigation into this I shall be only too pleased to meet them at any time and to bring the necessary evidence to prove that this is so.  It is disgraceful that young married men with not very much resources who are working for a living, who attempt to supply themselves with a house instead of waiting for the urban council or the county council to do it and who in fact in five cases are giving up the tenancy of urban county houses when the houses are built, should be treated in this manner.  I suggest the Minister should take an active interest in this because the only way it can be cleared is by direct action of the Minister.  I have done my best and so have the members of the society.  How those people succeeded in keeping the interest of the other members in the society and eventually in getting the houses under way&mdash;and they are going on fairly well now&mdash;I do not know.  However, they did so.  This situation must be remedied because if it is not the good name of the Department of Local Government will suffer and other people who may be approached to join a similar type of society will say: &ldquo;Look what happened to St. Joseph's Building Society.  Were they not prevented from getting money to which they were justly entitled?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> I am aware that a number of other building societies in County Meath have built houses and have got every facility possible.  The Department and the council have bent over backwards to see that they got everything to which they were entitled.  It is a great credit to the officials concerned that they have facilitated in the way they have the building of houses.  Great credit is also due to everybody connected with these efforts.  We should not let one scheme ruin all the good work which has been done in cases like this.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of new houses being built, the Minister must clear up the misunderstanding which has occurred because of his promise to introduce a Bill to increase the amount of grant.  The evidence is that the people in the country are very confused.  Not alone are they confused but the local authority officials are confused and I suggest the Minister's own officials are confused because they do not know what the situation is.  Some people will say the scheme cannot be put into operation until the Bill becomes an Act.  Others will say it is in operation now but the money is not available.  I know the Minister said £80,000 was provided so that the scheme could be put into operation.  I wish the Minister would make a statement when he is replying so that we shall know and the country will know what the position is.  Otherwise there will be continual trouble about this.</P>
    <P>I suggest a bad mistake was made by the Department on the question of housing grants.  The mistake is that the supplementary grants cease at £832.  Most of us know that when a worker reaches an income of £832, if he has not good accommodation or if he is living in a house belonging to somebody else, he is anxious to build a house for himself.  At that stage he is told: &ldquo;You may build it but you will not get a supplementary grant if you do.&rdquo; In view of the fall in the value of money the income limit should be raised to at least £1,000 or perhaps slightly more.  If that is done I believe very many more people will be tempted to build houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="479" /> The cost of sites seems to have risen very substantially in country districts. Where a few years ago a site could be picked up for a nominal sum, the figure has gone up several hundred pounds, and if the local authority has extended a water scheme to the site then the figure doubles.  Perhaps that is all right but something has happened recently to which I have personally objected and on which I think the Department should be very firm.  There are instances where people who are tenants of local authority dwellings, unvested labourers' cottages, have offered a site to a member of their own family, a son, a son-in-law, a nephew, or someone like that, for the purpose of having not a local authority cottage but a private house built under the grant and loan scheme, an SDA house.  The local authority has insisted on a very substantial payment being made for that site, not to the person who was a tenant of the cottage but to the local authority.  The figure in one case was £30 plus costs.  That may seem a small sum to some people but when it is considered that the people concerned are in most cases rural labourers whose income is only between £7 and £8 per week, it represents a month's pay.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the amount of money paid for such a site should not be a nominal sum.  It is quite reasonable that the people should be asked to pay the costs.  The costs are usually something around £5, maybe a little bit more.  It is unreasonable they should be asked to pay a sum of £30 to the county council for what is, in fact, the side portion of the garden which their own father of father-in-law is giving them.  If the father, instead of giving the site, vests the cottage and disposes of it afterwards, then, of course, the local authority will get nothing for it.  Some local authorities, despite the assurance again and again of the Minister for Local Government that it is quite in order to give permission to build an SDA house and get a loan and grant on such a vested cottage plot, say their legal adviser advises against that and says <Col N="480" /> it cannot be done.  Therefore, we find a number of very suitable sites are held up.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister's views on this and perhaps there is not a great deal more he can do about it but if there is any way in which he can deal with the local authorities I suggest he should do so, and point out to the county managers concerned that if it is good enough for the Minister for Local Government and for this House it should be good enough for the legal advisers attached to some of these local authorities.</P>
    <P>There is another matter with regard to housing which I have raised again and again by means of question in this House and I am still not satisfied with the outcome.  I am referring to the question of the subsidy given on local authority houses.  According to the Act, if somebody from an overcrowded house or a condemned house is housed by the local authority, the subsidy is two-thirds of the loan charges and if they are from any other type of house the subsidy is only one-third of the loan charges.  To me that means two-thirds of the actual cost of the erection of the house but that is not how it works out.  Most local authorities simply charge as much as they think the unfortunate tenant can afford to pay.  In some cases, that is as much as £1, 25/-, or 30/- a week out of an income of £7 or £8 and they then get one-third or two-thirds of the loan, which is an entirely different matter.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which must be clarified by the Minister.  I admit that as it is being administered it is a big saving to the Department of Local Government, but I do not think it is what the Act intended.  We have now reached the stage where we have a number of people living in bad houses.  They would like to get new houses but they are afraid to get a house built because they feel they would not be able to pay for it.  It is about time something were done to clarify this position.  If two-thirds of the loan charges were to be paid, then it should be paid and the rent fixed after that.  This is a matter which must be fixed sooner or later.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> Some local authorities, particularly in urban areas, have been building small houses for old people.  While it is a good idea to put old people into low cost houses, as I see it, there is one big snag in it.  I find local authorities putting people into a one-roomed house&mdash; a room in which they eat, live and sleep.  I do not think in the year 1964 that is the standard of housing we should offer to anybody.  Those houses could easily be converted into tworoomed houses and I believe that should be done.  I do not think any old person should be asked to go into a house where a visitor must sit on the edge of a bed while having a meal. I think 1964 is not the year in which we should introduce that type of house, and I would ask the Department to express a view on that before it becomes widespread.</P>
    <P>A reference has been made by Deputy Corry to tied houses.  I agree there is a danger that the tied house system may start developing again in another way.  Perhaps the Minister could have a good long look at the system before he allows it to develop. Over the years when people lived in those houses, they were ordered out of them as soon as they lost their jobs or when the person who held the job died. We do not want that to develop again.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I have raised here again and again by way of question and otherwise relates to repairs to labourers' cottages and the way in which appeals are dealt with.  A person living in a cottage belonging to a local authority may ask to have the cottage repaired by the local authority.  The authority may after years send somebody to do the repairs and when it is repaired, it is then vested in the tenant. A tenant has no say in whether or not he is satisfied with the repairs.  He has a right of appeal to the Minister for Local Government against the repairs. When this is done, the Minister may, after months or a couple of years, send out an inspector and that inspector examines the house and adjudicates on the list of repairs which the tenant alleges still require to be carried out. In some cases it occurs that during the time from the making out of the list to the actual time of inspection, serious <Col N="482" /> deterioration may have occurred and that is not taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Eventually, a list of necessary repairs is ruled on by the Department's inspector.  This is sent to the tenant and to the local authority and again anything up to three or four years may pass before the local authority eventually decides to carry out the repairs.  Again, further deterioration may have occurred but only the repairs set down in the Department's list may be done.  When the repairs are finished, who inspects the house to say whether or not they have been properly done?  The house is inspected by the engineer who, in the first instance, before the house was vested, said it did not need repairs.  In all cases his report is that the work is satisfactorily carried out.  In view of the fact that he felt, perhaps months or a few years before, that no repairs were needed, I think it is more than ridiculous to suggest that he is the right person to judge on whether or not repairs should be carried out.</P>
    <P>I suggested to the Minister some time ago that that system should be changed and he agreed with me that it was not a good system.  It should be changed now because it is worse than stupid to allow it to continue in those circumstances.  The fact that the Department's inspector lists substantial repairs would suggest that the local authority engineers and their officials have not been doing their job properly. If the house were properly repaired in the first instance, there would be no necessity for major repairs at a later stage.  I know the tendency is to say that the tenant will be vested&mdash;&ldquo;It is going out of our hands and we will get out of it as easily as we can.&rdquo; That is not right and this is something which should and can be dealt with by the Department.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the fact that the worst housed section of the community at the present time are the small farmers.  I agree.  Even in County Meath, where they have made great efforts to provide houses for themselves, the small farmers appear to be badly housed.  In County Meath, the council have up to recently built cottages <Col N="483" /> for farmers of up to £20 valuation. That is more generous than in most other counties, certainly more than in the Minister's county or in the counties of the west.  I am glad there is a suggestion that something can be done to assist the farmer to improve his house.  I would suggest that the quicker this regulation is put into operation, the better for all concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the question of amenity grants.  There is one at the present time before the Minister from my own village, and I hope he will deal with it quickly and generously. It is for a park along the seaside resort. It has been approved by Bord Fáilte and is awaiting sanction.  This was originally a swamp and it was not quite the entrance which one would expect to find at a seaside resort.  The local authority have done work on it but it still looks bad.  We are anxious to have something done before the summer season gets into full swing and I should be glad if the Minister would do something about it as quickly as he can.</P>
    <P>I know quite a number of applications were made for amenity grants by local authorities for car parks beside churches.  Something happened. I do not know whether an error was made by the local authority, the Department of Local Government or somebody else.  But it is true that most of them seem to have been referred back to the local authority and then referred to the parish priest, with the result that he feels there was nothing which could be done about it. He was told that a grant was available, that a grant was forthcoming, and there was nothing he could do.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have a look at this matter.  This is a type of amenity which should be provided. There are far more cars than there were in the country.  The roads around the churches are cluttered up with cars and it takes a long time to get them cleared away.  I suggest to the Minister that this is something which can be dealt with very easily. He should see that the Department deals with it now and not in six months' time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> As far as derelict sites are concerned, there seems to be an idea abroad that before the site is declared derelict, there must be some evidence that it is an eyesore.  I have had one or two instances which I know were dealt with in a most unsatisfactory way. One of them was a case of two houses in Navan.  I am sorry the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has gone away because he would be well aware of this case.  There were two old houses in Navan town which had been falling down for some years.  A young man bought them for a small sum of money.  The roof on one of the houses had caved in.  He cleared away the second one and built a decent house on the site.  He applied for an amenities grant.  In this case the houses had been cleared away.  The local authority engineers were aware, and the local town clerk was aware, that the houses had been in an uninhabitable condition and were an eyesore in the middle of the town.</P>
    <P>Despite that, the application has been crossing backwards and forwards from the Department to the local authority. No grant was paid.  Eventually it came to a full stop on the plea that the town clerk said that one of the houses could still be inhabited.  I went to the town clerk and asked him if this was so.  He said he would not like to live in it but the roof was still on when he saw it.  There is ample evidence from the engineer and other local officials that this was a derelict site.  It was cleared but no grant was paid.</P>
    <P>The other instance I have in mind is a case which has been going on for three years.  It has been going backwards and forwards between the Meath County Council and the Department.  I understand it is with the Meath County Council now.  It is three years since the person applied for the grant.  Somebody is responsible for holding up the grant.  There were two houses and an old store involved in this case.  One of the houses was a public house.  Despite the fact that it was falling down, it had been kept open until a new one was built because of the licensing regulations. The Department, because of the fact that it was open, said they could not <Col N="485" /> give any grant.  They said it could not be derelict when it was being used. That excuse was accepted, even though it was a very thin one.  The other house&mdash;a long rambling one&mdash; and the store had not been used for a number of years.  I cannot see why the Department or the Meath County Council cannot make up their minds and do something about this.  They could pay the man a small amount of money which he expected to get.  I know he could do with it just now.</P>
    <P>There should be a more open way of dealing with these difficulties of derelict sites if we want to encourage people to clear them away.  Awkward questions should not be asked of the people who are clearing these derelict sites.  They should be encouraged to clear them away.  I suggest that is not the type of encouragement which will lead to these matters being dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>I raised the question of group water schemes with the Minister this week. I am glad to say he gave me an assurance that if the situation was as I suggested, he would have further technical staff to clear up the backlog. I have not yet received the letter which he sent me but I suppose I shall receive it within the next two or three days.  It is a fact that a very substantial number of group water schemes which I know started have come to a stop mainly because the inspector called to see the people once and in some cases was not very encouraging.  He just went to the tenants, had talks with them and left it there.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look into this matter immediately.  The one thing which will discourage group water schemes quicker than anything else is this tendency to leave schemes in midair, when they have been started.  This is a matter which could be dealt with pretty quickly, if the Minister will look into it.  I am prepared to leave it at that because of the assurance he gave me the other day.</P>
    <P>There are three other matters I want to deal with.  The first is the question of libraries.  I think the grants for libraries apply only to the end of next year. Some local authorities do not seem to <Col N="486" /> be terribly anxious to avail of these grants.  There is the peculiar position where the Library Commission applies to the local authority for accommodation. The local authority tell them that that is not a matter for the Library Commission.  I wonder if there is anything the Minister can do to bring home to the local authority, if the matter is brought to their notice, the onus is on them to have a library building provided.  After all, most of us agree the library is the university for most young people who are not able to afford a university education.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to an investigation which he has initiated into the system of rating.  While we would all welcome some way of keeping rates at a reasonable level, at the same time I hope the Minister does not fall into the trap of thinking that the only things to be rated are the buildings in which people live.  That can easily happen because many people feel that if we re-value the houses and re-value the shops, then everybody will be happy.  Of course, everybody will not be happy.  I suggest if the Minister is to do this&mdash;I quite agree with him about it&mdash;it is not something he can rush into.  He will have to take a good long look at it.  There is something else besides re-valuing.  If you do this in the towns and villages, the people who make their livelihood from farming will be asked to pay a disproportionate share of rates and that is undesirable.</P>
    <P>The final thing I want to refer to is the fire services.  Most of us would want to pay a tribute to the people who are engaged in the fire services throughout the country and the fact that they are prepared to give of their free time to put out fires which are almost always the result of carelessness.  It is the type of service which does not get the appreciation it deserves.  It certainly does not get the compensation which many of us believe it deserves.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister notified the local authorities they were to carry out an investigation into the type of buildings which provided dormitory accommodation. I suggest to the Minister there is another type of building which he <Col N="487" /> should pay attention to, that is, dancehalls. There are dancehalls or ballrooms, or whatever you call them, which are licensed to hold 2,000. Streams of people are brought in from other places and 6,000 patrons are packed into a small place where you cannot even move.  In my opinion, that is a death trap.  The Minister should pay some attention to those and see the regulations and the conditions of the licences are carried out effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The one matter I wish to raise on this Estimate is the condition of certain parts of Dublin city, particularly the North-Central constituency.  For a long time the houses between Summerhill and Stoneybatter have been in a dilapidated condition because of their age. Many of them were slum dwellings. During the past 15 years or more, I know of the efforts that have been made by interested people and by local representatives to have that problem adequately tackled by Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>I must also admit that there were certain areas like Hardwicke Street and part of Dominick Street in which building eventually took place after delays.  This, however, was only scraping at the surface.  Many areas were left, and I remember particularly the late Colm Gallagher's efforts in regard to George's Place.  Still, nothing was done.  Then we had the tragedy in Bolton Street and later in Fenian Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After that, there was what I can only describe as a panic wave of activity on the part of the Corporation. If one travels that area now, one finds great similarity between it and the blitzed cities of Europe after the war. I am not exaggerating when I say that if you move from Summerhill to Stoneybatter now, you will find yourself wondering whether the area had been subjected to a series of air raids. Starting at Gardiner Street, you first of all come to the corner of Mountjoy Square where there are collapsed buildings, partially demolished.  You move across to George's Place where there is a demolished site with much <Col N="488" /> of the rubble still on it.  In between, there are isolated buildings in a decrepit condition and, some of them, unoccupied and boarded-up.</P>
    <P>You move into Dorset Street and in Upper Dorset Street, you will find a number of houses recently cleared which have either collapsed or have been partially demolished for safety reasons.  In that district, incidentally, efforts were made during the past ten years to have the population rehoused but nothing was done.  The area between Wellington Street and Dorset Street, bordering on Dominick Street, has been cleared and alone there stands the fire station.  I believe building there is about to commence but as yet there is no sign of activity.</P>
    <P>If you go down Bolton Street, you will find a number of collapsed or cleared houses.  Move a little further still, into Henrietta Street, and you find tenements which are not proper accommodation for anybody.  Despite creditable efforts by the inhabitants to live respectably in certain of those tenements, they are what can only be described as slum dwellings.  In North King Street, you would think the raiders were active again.  The corner of Church Street has collapsed and Blackhall Place, Queen Street, Henry Street are completely obliterated and the people gone.  The only buildings left in the Smithfield area are the industrial establishments, a few shops and a few houses.  If anybody challenges the accuracy of the picture I am giving, I invite him to come and walk through the area.</P>

      <P>It is understandable that when this crisis arose a year ago&mdash;it is only fair to say the extraordinary weather of that winter had a great deal to do with the rapid deterioration of those buildings; it was the straw that broke the camel's back and now the camel's back has been broken&mdash;there was panic.  The reason I am labouring the point now is that in my experience it is very difficult <Col N="489" /> for any public representative to get anywhere with the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am not a member of a local authority, I feel free to speak.  I am labouring it here because I asked questions in regard to this area during the week and I had already read the replies at local authority level.  I was very pleased when the Minister told me a week ago that 137 buildings would go up in the Dorset Street area and that work would commence within a month.</P>
      <P>In regard to the remainder of the area, one answer given was that a local inquiry must be held.  Another answer was that the Minister understood from the Dublin Corporation that no action had yet been taken by them to acquire the lands referred to in the question.  Still another reply was that the Minister understood from the Corporation that consideration is being given to the acquisition of the site mentioned but that a compulsory purchase order had not yet been made.  The last reply was that sketch plans for the erection of 90 flats at Constitution Hill had been received on 25th November, 1963 but the Minister was not in a position to say when the building of these flats would commence.</P>
      <P>There is an extremely serious problem in that area.  It is serious for the inhabitants, first of all.  There is a problem for the ratepayers who remain because of the probability of their having to bear an extra burden since the depopulation of the area means that the burden of rates will be distributed over a fewer number. There is a problem for the shopkeepers which was raised here yesterday by a Deputy.  It is a complicated problem and I am glad to hear Deputy Dillon say &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; because he will not mind, therefore, if I say it is a matter on which we should not try to make political capital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to these shopkeepers, we have got to face two facts.  The first is, admittedly, <Col N="490" /> the depopulation of the area.  I am with all Deputies who say that we should endeavour to maintain a minimum population, properly and quickly rehoused.  There is another problem in regard to the small shopkeepers, one for which this Minister is definitely not responsible.  It is the problem of competing against the larger combines, particularly the selfservice stores.</P>
      <P>I mention this to keep the thing more in proportion.  Still another problem can arise: the question of schools. I could go into all the details but it seems to me to be sufficient to draw attention to the problem as it is and to point out that there are sites there which should urgently be cleared and built on so that a proper balance can be maintained as between industrial allotment of sites and the provision of sites for dwelling purposes.  As far as I can see, there does not seem to be a ruling, overall, with the local authority. I have referred to the position of public representatives with the local authority. Now I want to refer to the position of the Minister and his Department with the local authority.</P>
      <P>I have always believed in decentralisation, I have always thought that good organisation demands a certain amount of decentralisation.  I wonder if, in the case of the local authority in Dublin city, we have not had too much decentralisation and too much leaving of it to the local authority with only, shall I say, a routine administrative control a lot of the way in the Department of Local Government?</P>
      <P>With the advent of the new managerial system, there is a change and, to my mind, it requires in the Custom House an active inspectoral staff.  For instance, if I may draw an analogy.  Take the old days when armies would have peace time which apparently they do not have now.  In most armies in the old days, there was a type of organisation comparable with social organisation.  It was usual to have an inspectorate-general staff which was a separate staff organised by the Minister responsible to see that, down the line, the various sub-departments were carrying out efficiently the jobs to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> I believe, in particular in regard to Dublin city, that there is an officer of fairly senior rank charged with the matters of Dublin Corporation and I do not wish in any way to reflect on the operations of that officer.  But the system has this weakness, as I see it, that it is a desk-bound link between the Minister&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;, I mean the Minister in his official capacity with all his immediate aids, the Secretary, and so on.  However, that is a desk-bound link which necessarily depends, so to speak, on the paper transit between local government and the Department.  I do not think that is enough, now that we have the managerial system.</P>
    <P>It is the fault, perhaps, of public representatives that it was necessary to bring in a managerial system.  I shall not go into the reasons: you will find them in the debates.  I am conceding that.  But when you have the managerial system and you have a system of, shall I say, a local government service which, of itself, should be subordinate but which, in other ways, has been elevated to the level of a Civil Service, there should be Civil Service control because mere desk-bound control is not enough.  It needs active physical inspection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Field work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Field work&rdquo; is perhaps a word.  I have no doubt that if such an organisation were available and there were inspecting officers to take charge of the area, perhaps we should have a more hopeful story today. I appreciate the difficulties that are there, and we must appreciate the difficulties that are there.  Ministers, nor officials, nor public representatives can wave wands and get things done. Nevertheless, I feel we should get more efficiency if we had the approach I am suggesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an alternative course. There is the putting in of an efficiency inspection; I do not know how far that goes.  When I say that, I am not reflecting nor do I wish to reflect on any personnel especially in the higher levels because the higher you go the more particular they become and the <Col N="492" /> more you run the risk of appearing to reflect on persons and I do not wish to do that in any way.  Nevertheless, in view of the housing situation here, I am forced to make the comments which I make in view of the state of it.</P>
    <P>Arising out of that, I should like to see the same tradition in the local government service as we have in the State service&mdash;it is a longer tradition, perhaps &mdash; of courtesy and realisation that, after all, everyone in the public service and indeed every one of us who are elected representatives in any capacity are the servants of the public and not the masters of the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a great danger on the local government front, down the line below the level of the State Service, that that might be forgotten.  I also know, of course, that the people down the line are up against pressures and sometimes impossible people.  Particularly in a matter where housing is concerned, we must make all due allowances. I make that remark because I had an experience more than a year ago that caused me to remonstrate at the way people were treated who were anxious when they were being thrown out of buildings and who were anxious at the way they were being dealt with&mdash;in the field, I should add. I suppose that will happen.  It happened down the line.  There is a need perhaps to show that this spirit and tradition of service, that is marked in the Civil Service, should be fostered wherever possible and that it will make for much better relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to the area about which I spoke&mdash;I have undertaken not to speak too long on this Estimate&mdash;I should like to suggest to the Minister that perhaps a look at the liaison or, shall I say, the method of tying&mdash;in his Department with the local authority&mdash;and I am talking only of the local authority I know and which has a very big area and a very big important task&mdash;might be a constructive way of helping to deal with this problem.  The advantage of a suggestion something on the lines of <Col N="493" /> the one I have made would of course be that it is a way in which policy can be followed up and directions given.  Very often the people as close to it as, say, the officials of Dublin Corporation who are harassed by a large number of other details would probably welcome priorities being sorted out for them, and so on.</P>
    <P>I think that one of the things perhaps that is wrong, when it comes to a problem of the magnitude I am talking about, is that it is expected, generally speaking, that all initiative will come back from the local authority.  That is quite right and a very proper principle perhaps for ordinary routine work.  However, when you are faced with an acute emergency problem, as we are now faced with in the area which I mentioned, some supplementary machinery is needed.</P>
    <P>At the time these things happened, the Minister took a very close personal interest in them and I know immediate action was taken on housing. Looking back on it, the extent to which people were housed in a short time was very creditable when one takes the situation as it was immediately before the Bolton Street tragedy.  The initiative also by the Minister and his Department and the others responsible for finding certain temporary accommodation was commendable and, by and large, has solved the problem of getting accommodation for the people affected.  There were people on the roads for a while but, by and large, it has been possible to deal with that side of the problem. The urgency of getting the sites organised is something that I do not think we can stress too strongly.  Possibly the legal machinery required at present may be too cumbersome, this public inquiry and so on.  I know grave difficulties arise for the Corporation in regard to clearing titles in some cases. The real trouble is about titles in many cases.  I suggest the matter is serious enough for us to take the bull by the horns.</P>
    <P>This housing crisis is something that should have been foreseen for a very long time in Dublin city by the local authority and, as far as I know, until the Bolton Street tragedy, progress was <Col N="494" /> very slow.  Every Deputy who speaks on this Estimate asks the Minister to take a personal interest in some local problem in his constituency.  I am very conscious when I say it that I am doing the same thing.  I know the Minister cannot possibly sit down and deal personally with all the problems that are put to him, nor does any one really expect it, but in this case I shall go a little further.  I have talked about one area that it is my business to know but I think there are other areas in Dublin city with similar problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>And elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The acute one arising from housing is the one I have mentioned, and in that circumstance I ask the Minister to consider organising something on the lines I suggested to him, something more than merely giving directions and getting reports back on paper.  Something more is needed to meet this situation.  Local representatives in the modern dispensation are limited in what they can do and there is a very definite limit to their powers and functions.  I have no reason to believe local representatives in Dublin have not been attending to their business: I know that many of them without distinction of Party have been very active in this regard.  I have only touched on the problem but I undertook not to delay the House and I must move on, but I ask that the problem be tackled.</P>
      <P>There has been talk about the provision of amenities such as swimming pools.  I do not know what is to happen the basin at Blessington Street but there are some areas like that in the Dublin North-Central constituency&mdash; which is the north city really&mdash;and it is important to keep a few open spaces and utilise them.  That should be borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of roads is one that concerns us in Dublin in a different way from the way it concerns the country Deputy who is either concerned with the maintenance of roads which are county roads or the development of arterial roads.  In Dublin, we have, essentially, the traffic problem.  I, for one, must compliment the Minister, generally speaking, on the success of <Col N="495" /> the recent traffic adjustments in the city.  All parties concerned have gone a long way towards solving the problem and it is for that reason I want to mention the widening of Church Street. There seems to be need for the provision of one or two more arteries. The widening of Church Street is something that has implications for the whole area, quite apart from the traffic problem, and I suggest that it should get urgent attention.</P>
    <P>The question of speed limits has been mentioned and again, by and large, speaking for the city area, the introduction of speed limits has been a success. If you take, for instance, as a typical road in between the small road and the main road such as the Bray road or the Great North road, the road to Dalkey by Merrion, you will find the traffic has uniformly slowed down to the 40 mph limit beyond Ballsbridge. It has certainly worked well there.  I join with the Deputy who made an appeal to motorists that if they are not driving up to the limit on such a stretch, they should drive in close to the kerb.</P>
    <P>There is one road in that vicinity&mdash; perhaps there are others in other parts &mdash;not adequately signed.  I am thinking of a 30 mph stretch along the sea coast, the strand road at Sandymount which I do not think has discs displayed. I think it is a 30 mph road but very many drivers seem to be under the impression it is 40 mph judging by the frequency with which you are passed when doing 30 on that particular stretch.  There are smaller patches unmarked in the city where there is not time to get beyond 30 mph.  I should like to suggest the local authority should be reminded that if there are long stretches of 30 mph roads in any parts of the city, they should be adequately signed and then adequately policed in the sense of reminding motorists.  If motorists realise what the limit is, they will co-operate when an appeal is made to them.</P>
    <P>My next point is in regard to traffic at O'Connell Bridge and Nelson Pillar. The suggestion I am making is expensive and I know it is difficult to make <Col N="496" /> pedestrians avail of subways but I think something could be done which would help the traffic flow, that is, the provision of pedestrian subways, say, at Nelson Pillar and at both sides of O'Connell Bridge but particularly on the Bachelor's Walk side.  The difficulty the traffic gardaí encounter at certain times there can only be understood by somebody who stands there to watch them.  I have plenty of experience of that area.  Pedestrians are impatient and interrupt the flow of traffic very seriously.  They must pass, of course, but it is almost impossible for the gardaí to control the pedestrian flow in the same way as they can control the vehicular flow.  I have seen as many as five gardaí at the crossing at the O'Connell Monument and they were still having difficulty with the crowds of pedestrians and the subsequent slowing up.  The new dispensation has brought remarkable improvements in that area but I feel that the situation will not be really satisfactory until some of the improvements I have suggested are made.</P>
    <P>A similar problem arises at the Pillar.  At both sides of the pillar, it is the pedestrian problem that has, over the past 20 years, really hampered all the traffic going into Earl Street on one side and Henry Street on the other. These are two main arteries and that is a suggestion I would make to the Minister with regard to them.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say is with regard to what I would term the blitzed area between Summerhill and Mountjoy Square and between Stonybatter and Blackhall Place.  When that area has been cleared and rebuilding is taking place, it will be necessary to strike a proper balance.  There is a certain amount of industry in that area and there will continue to be industry there.  It is an ideal place to have some industry and to have the people employed in that industry dwelling alongside.  There is also the question of the business premises in the area, whether shops or other services.  Lastly there is the traffic question.  These are the four interests concentrated in that place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> Certain isolated work is taking place there but what I want to know is whether there is, at this stage, a plan that can be acted upon.  I know that there is the old town plan but a new situation has arisen since the time that plan was drawn up.  That situation may not involve changing the principles of the plan but it may involve a complete revision of its details.  This revision will be the concern of the officials of Dublin Corporation, and do they know exactly what they are at?  The changes that have taken place in the situation in recent years make me wonder if there are not too many problems for these people to deal with and I would strongly commend to the Minister that he should examine the traffic situation in this part of Dublin from the building point of view.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that the conscience of Deputy de Valera and Deputy Corry are beginning to stir.  Deputy de Valera is mistaken if he believes that the present acute position in the housing situation is not due to political decisions.  I am not going, in the limited time which each of us has chosen to accept in this debate, to deal with the matter <i>seriatim,</i> but I am going to ask Deputy de Valera to take the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> in its most recent edition and look at the housing figures for the past seven years and then ask himself do they not constitute the solution of the situation which he describes as an acute emergency in the housing situation in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Let me recall to him that he and some of his colleagues, sitting in these benches in 1957, decried the then Government, of which I was a member, for having built too many houses in Dublin and had no tenants to put in them.  Deputy de Valera will remember participating in that campaign.  I regard it as the proudest boast that any Irish Government will ever be in a position to make since the State was founded that in 1957 there were too many houses and that there were not enough tenants to go into them.  I am proud of that fact.</P>

      <P>The conscience of Deputy de Valera and even the leathery conscience of Deputy Corry is beginning to creak.  I am glad to note that the Minister for Local Government, and he has a tough enough conscience, produces on page four of his statement a partial alibi for the housing crisis with which he finds himself confronted when he states:</P>
      <P>These figures give some idea of the rehousing programme which the country must face, apart altogether from the fact that for the first time in generations our population is on the increase with the implications that this involves for housing authorities.</P>
      <P>That statement is not true.  If the Minister refers to statistics, he will find that in 1951 the population of this country went up by 21,000.  Since then, the population has tended to recede.  I do not know what the present population figures are but I do know that this is not the first time in this generation that the population has increased.  It was increasing in 1951 and six years later we had more houses than tenants in the city of Dublin.  Today we are faced with what Deputy de Valera describes as an acute housing emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past seven years, we have gone from a situation in which we had more houses than tenants to a situation of an acute housing crisis and this in a period when Government expenditure has gone up from £108 million <Col N="499" /> to £215 million.  Yet we have an acute housing crisis, not only in Dublin but in the rural parts of Ireland.  That situation arises from the political Party decision taken by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1957 to postpone social investment for other forms of investment.  We told them then that any programme of public expenditure based on the proposition that you postpone essential housing investment was going to end up in tragic disaster.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of this House to one fact.  It is a fact and it shocks me that Dáil Éireann does not react more vigorously to it.  There are dozens of old age pensioners in this city at the present moment who are fixed with notice that they are to be turned out of their rooms and dumped in the Dublin Union because the Corporation are going to pull down the houses where they are living and they have no other place to put them.  Do Deputies appreciate what that means? Here are old people living in modest comfort in the rooms they have inhabited for the past ten or 15 years who are now told that the structure of the rooms in which they are located is, in the judgment of the Corporation, dangerous and they must go; that there is no place for them to go; and that they must leave their homes, go to the union, with no prospect whatever of the administrative authority ever being able to give them a home again.</P>
    <P>We see pictures of the Algerians in the outskirts of Paris and we recoil with horror from some of the Negro slums in the Southern States of America but the Algerians, at least, have whatever little structure they have been allowed to erect, which is their home.  The old age pensioners in the city of Dublin are now being cast out of their homes and being told that for the remainder of their days they must reconcile themselves to being the anonymous inmates of the Dublin Union.</P>
    <P>If I were a member of a Government who had to confess to that type of acute emergency in the housing conditions in the city of Dublin, I would be ashamed of my life and if I <Col N="500" /> were Minister for Local Government I would resign.  It is a shocking thing to preside over a Department and to be forced to admit to this House that these conditions obtain in the capital city of this country and that there is nothing effective he can do about them. He is trying to gloss it over but even the members of his Party, both from rural Ireland and from this city, have been forced to their feet, by the knowledge that they have, to protest that we are faced with an acute emergency in the housing situation and that it is vitally necessary that a solution should be found for it.</P>
    <P>I ask this question: What solution does anybody here propose for the old age pensioners who are now being sent to the South Dublin Union because there is no other place for them to go?  Outside of the Algerian slums in Paris, I doubt if there is any parallel for that situation in western Europe today, and that is a very shameful confession for the Government of this country to have to make.</P>
    <P>I regard the circumstances of these old people as being particularly grievous because they are faced with a dilemma without hope of deliverance this side of the grave.  But, of course, there are numerous other grievous hardships rooted in this housing shortage. There are the young married people who have no home to go to and who have been described by Deputy Corry in rural Ireland and in the city of Dublin.  There are all the other problems arising from the housing shortage, on the details of which I do not propose to dwell at present.  I prefer in the limited time which we have elected to accept for the debate on this Estimate to highlight the circumstances of the old age pensioners who have been ordered to the Union.</P>
    <P>I want to raise again a question which was raised at Question Time yesterday for the purpose of inquiring whether the Minister has power to remedy what seems to be a very manifest injustice.  I refer to the circumstances of the small shopkeepers who have been doing business in parts of the city of Dublin, very often in rented premises, and who have been <Col N="501" /> told that these premises are no longer safe and that the Corporation propose to pull them down and that the shopkeepers displaced are not entitled to compensation.</P>
    <P>I directed the Minister's attention yesterday at Question Time to the fact that many of these small traders, if they had the means to start proceedings in the courts, might compel the Corporation to limit themselves to taking down that part of the building which was unsafe, leaving them their shop and their little residential quarters at the back of the shop, but they have not got the means to initiate litigation to that end.</P>
    <P>I am informed that recently nine small traders in the parish of High Street in this city have been dispossessed. One of them, I believe, got compensation from a private firm. Seven of the shopkeepers in question lived at the back of, or over, their shop.  They have been evicted, not only from their shops but from the living quarters as well.  Five of these people were elderly women living alone.  Five of them depended entirely on their little business for their livelihood.  One of these, I believe, has got a stall in the Iveagh Market.  One of them received compensation from a private firm.  Three of these women are now destitute or at the point of destitution when whatever accumulated savings they have are exhausted.</P>
    <P>It may seem a very small matter to occupy the time of this House with a discussion of the circumstances of three destitute elderly ladies who have all their lives been proud of the fact that they were able to keep their heads high and to support themselves without depending on charity or being a burden on their relatives, but the fact is that they are evicted and, under the law as it at present stands, it appears they have no remedy and no claim to compensation.  I put it to the Minister that, if that is the law, it is unjust, and that if there are means within the law to avoid an injustice of that kind, then these women ought not to be denied the remedy they ought to have available to them for no better reason than that they have not got the capital to <Col N="502" /> initiate the appropriate forms of litigation.</P>
    <P>I invite him to look into this question with a view to determining whether he or, at his instance, the Dublin Corporation will not make reasonable provision for people who are otherwise destined for destitution and, after a long life of hard work and independence, are faced with the threat of incarceration in the South Dublin Union.  This specific problem is to me so acute and grevious that it is the principal topic on which I wish to address the House today.</P>
    <P>There are some other details on which I should like the Minister to comment when he is concluding.  He speaks of regional water supplies.  The history of that scheme of regional water supplies in rural Ireland is that we in the Department of Agriculture some ten years ago initiated the scheme under which any person wishing to instal water in his house or farmyard would get a grant from the Department of Agriculture of 50 per cent of the cost.  Under that scheme, a great many water supplies were in fact installed, mainly based on individual wells, but in some cases a co-operative effort located one adequate well from which three, four or five houses drew their supplies.  In due course, the Department of Local Government introduced a parallel scheme.  I think the present situation is that for water supplies designed for the house and sanitary purposes, the Local Government schemes operates, and for water supplies primarily provided to cater for the outoffices and farmyard, the Department of Agriculture scheme operates.</P>
    <P>In addition to these two parallel schemes, there are the regional water supply schemes operated by the local authorities and involving the laying of miles of water mains along the roads. I should like the Minister to tell us, as between the scheme as operated in the Department of Local Government for individual water supplies based on a well or co-operative water supplies where two or three individuals combined to dig the well and share its resources, what is the average capital <Col N="503" /> cost of such installations as compared with the average capital cost of individual installations based on regional water supplies.  I am informed that the average capital cost of the installation under regional water supplies is from 200 per cent to 300 per cent higher than the average capital cost of installations based on individual schemes. If that is so, I suggest to this House that the whole capital basis of regional water supplies needs to be reviewed and further consideration given to an intensification of the scheme of providing individual or co-operative supplies on the basis of individual schemes.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement, the Minister referred to the general burden of rates on property owners in small towns.  I am glad the House is awakening to the fact that the burden is becoming utterly intolerable.  It is a salutary thing that we have at last recognised that the burden of rates on agricultural land is becoming impossible to bear and that provision is being made to restore that burden to the level which obtained two years ago by direct Government grant to the agricultural grant.  The great danger is, in making that provision, that we should overlook the fact that the agricultural grant provides no relief to the small shopkeeper and householder in towns and villages up and down the country. These people are being driven with their backs to the wall by the evergrowing burden of rates they are required to pay.  The Minister says he is reviewing the question with a view to seeing whether what is now manifestly an inequitable method of raising local government revenue can be reviewed. I wish him luck in that investigation, and I hope he fully realises the acute urgency of finding a satisfactory solution.</P>
    <P>Some reference has been made to the traffic hazards of the roads on which we travel.  They are many, but I want to direct the Minister's attention to one which I consider to be easily avoidable and very grave, that is, the growing practice of using articulated lorries on the roads.  It is bad enough to have to pass with reasonable <Col N="504" /> prudence and care a large, heavily-laden lorry, but if you are called on to pass a large, heavily-laden lorry which is pulling after it a second swaying, heavily-laden trailer, the traffic danger involved becomes well-night intolerable.</P>
    <P>The plain truth is that since we started closing down the railways, the number of vehicles appearing on the roads has steadily grown.  I have never met anybody who has to drive any kind of vehicle on the road who does not agree that such vehicles constitute a greatly increased traffic hazard. There are only three or four types of traffic which employ these articulated vehicles, and I should say one of the largest employers of the system are Córas Iompair Éireann.  So long as they have a legal right to do so, no one can complain if they take advantage of that right; but I suggest to the Minister it would be no unreasonable hardship to require that the use of such vehicles on the public roads be prohibited and that if one wished to carry merchandise on the road, one would carry it in lorries under the direct control of the driver within the limitations at present prescribed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is high time they did. We ought to do it, too.  I heard one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies speak of the necessity of providing <i>autobahnen</i> in and out of the city of Dublin.  Everyone wants to see the roads improved, but there would not be any use for <i>autobahnen</i> in our conditions if reasonable limitations were put on the user of the roads.  I suggest it is unreasonable use of the roads to operate large lorries with heavily-laden trailers wagging behind them as we are at present doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the problem the Minister is confronted with in making the appropriate adjustments in respect of the 30 m.p.h. limit.  I remind him again that if these 30 m.p.h. limit signs are erected at unreasonable distances outside country towns, the only result is that people get into the habit of ignoring them.  The location of <Col N="505" /> certain of these signs urgently requires adjustment.  I think it is in Ballinasloe that you can drive three miles between the site of one 30 m.p.h. sign and the sign marking the termination of the speed limit.  Manifestly, that represents an excess of precaution and I think the inevitable consequence is that people will grow to ignore it.  I recognise the difficulty of carrying out a periodic review, and the Minister has made that plea on several previous occasions when this matter was raised. I suggest to him that the value of the limit is being seriously abridged by this confusion and it would be well worth urging on local authorities to consult forthwith with the Garda authorities in their areas to see if any anomalies of this kind exist so that those of which they are aware might be remedied without delay.</P>
    <P>I am very glad the Government are adopting the proposal we first submitted to the country to facilitate farmers building their own houses, but, as usual, in the process of implementing this proposal, all sorts of difficulties are being inserted in the scheme.  I want to suggest to the Minister that the sensible scheme for the effective resolution of the problem of inadequate farmhouses on small farms would be to provide that the farmer should get his grant from the Department of Local Government, his corresponding grant from the local authority, and that the balance of the cost of the house would then be made available to him by the Department of Lands to be charged on his annuity.  If possible, and I do not think it is impossible, the Department of Lands should operate as a building authority in relation to this scheme in the same way as the National Building Agency operates for other Departments of State which want building to be done.</P>
    <P>There are great advantages in a body of that kind, from the point of view of getting desirable plans for a particular kind of house and from the point of view of the great economies which can be effected and, above all, there is the despatch in getting the work done.  In rural Ireland at present it is extremely difficult to get small <Col N="506" /> contractors to accept individual small contracts, but, if you are in a position to offer a local contractor a group of 20 30 or 40 houses, then it is possible to get a team of men to work and do the job.  For a small farmer to get a person to build a house for him is very difficult today.  There are cases in which a small farmer, if he has a couple of handy sons, may perhaps be able to do the job himself.  That might be the best solution, but there is a great deal to be said for the other.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission is already equipped to act as a national building agency because it does build houses on newly acquired estates being divided and improved for farmers. I suggest to the Minister we should follow the example set by the Land Project when originally initiated.  That was that the application form was only half a sheet of foolscap and required no more than the name and address of the applicant and a statement of what he wanted done.  I suggest, if you really want to deal with the problem of bad housing on small farms, then the small farmer ought to be able to apply either to the Minister's Department or to the Land Commission, saying he wants a house to cost so much, within reasonable limitations, which, less the grant of £900, leaves a balance due of £1,000 to £1,200, or whatever it may be, which he desires to have charged on his annuity.  Thereafter farmers who want this work done in that way would be assured that the Land Commission, acting in the capacity of a national building agency, would build the houses for them and let them at the appropriate charge on the holdings until their share of the cost was finally discharged.</P>
    <P>We moved to refer back this Estimate because in a period when the cost of Government has gone up from £108 million to £215 million per annum, we have declined from the situation in which we had more houses than we had tenants to put into them to a situation which Deputy de Valera describes as an acute emergency in the housing situation in Dublin and which Deputy Corry describes as an acute emergency housing situation in rural Ireland.  Any Government who have to <Col N="507" /> plead guilty to that indictment are not fit to be the Government of this country.  I want to tell Deputy de Valera that in his charitable desire to acquit the Minister for Local Government from all responsibility, he has exceeded the limits of trespass on our forbearance when he asks us to say that this is a situation for which all sides are responsible and in respect of which the finger of scorn must be pointed at nobody.  I point the finger of scorn at him and his colleagues, and the Government he supports, because they should be ashamed of the fact that although they have doubled the national expenditure in the past seven years they have to admit that our people in the city of Dublin are faced with a crisis for which there is only one parallel in Europe, that is, the Algerians in the suburban slums of Paris.</P>

      <P>I wonder could we get some Coca-Cola on ice to introduce a little coolness into the debate? As a member of a local authority for a good number of years, I have sufficient experience, I think, to know the working of the Department of Local Government.  I could speak on this for hours on end, the good aspects <Col N="509" /> and the bad aspects of the administration of the Department, but, as it has been agreed that speeches should be limited, I shall not trespass on the time.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera said Dublin town is tumbling down.  I can tell him and the Minister that Limerick town tumbled down years ago and nothing has been done about rebuilding it.  In Limerick the problem is much more acute and of longer duration than the crisis that arose in Dublin last year. We have been dealing with falling down houses and fallen down houses for the past ten or 15 years.  Practically the whole centre of the city is now clear and, for some reason unknown to me, the local authority officials and the officials of the Department of Local Government decided they would leave this grand open airy space in the centre and go outside into foreign parts to build houses miles and miles away from where the people were originally housed and from where they worked.</P>
      <P>That situation has not changed, despite the fact that some six or seven years ago, after a lengthy argument with our manager and the Department of Local Government, we were told that we could acquire these acres in the city of Limerick which had been derelict for almost a generation.  For the past seven or eight years plans have been going up and down, and down and up, to the Department as regularly as the tide comes in and goes out in Donegal.  When all the details had been covered, when the quantity surveyor had given his bill of quantities, when everything was arranged and all the plans passed and agreed by the Department, and when we in the Limerick City Corporation had decided on certain types of houses and directed our architects and engineers to go ahead immediately with that urgent matter&mdash;after years it was agreed that the scheme would be carried out&mdash;after all that expense, listen to the folly of this.  Has it ever been beaten in the records of the Department of Local Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all that procedure, that waste of time and money, we got a demand from the Department to send up a soil test of the area.  What, in heaven's <Col N="510" /> name, are we doing, or where are we going?  After a struggle lasting ten to 15 years, we are faced with a soil test and we have to get people to come in and bore.  We have to get experts to bore the ground, and now it could easily happen that the whole scheme could be scrapped, and all our time and money go for nought.  I can remember an area where there were tenements five or six storeys high.  Now, suddenly the Department come along to stall this scheme for no other reason, to my mind&mdash;no apparent reason at any rate &mdash;than to set at nought the efforts of Limerick City Corporation.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Department 100 per cent for that.  I know there is indolence and inefficiency locally as well as in the Department.  I know our officials are complacent about these matters.  I know our officials fail to realise the urgency of certain matters. You have that in Dublin, in Limerick, and I am sure all over the country. Families have been housed in the workhouse in Limerick for years because there are no houses for them, and there is no sense of urgency on the part of Local Government or the Government in that regard for one reason or another.  House building is an investment and, like education, money should not stop its progress.</P>

      <P>If we want to hold our people, we must house and educate them.  That is as simple as ABC.  We all have to dig our own ditch as best we can.  No provision is made for newly-weds; very little provision is made for sub-tenants; and very little provision is made for overcrowding. We have so many condemned houses on hand that we have not yet come to the stage of housing those people.  We cannot house old people because we cannot provide the accommodation needed for old couples and single people.  That has been going on for years and years and years.  We have a certain number of houses on the way at the moment but it is nothing compared with the demands made to us as public representatives.  It is our duty to provide those things.  I do not want <Col N="511" /> to go into too much detail about houses or applicants in the short time at my disposal, but I want to give briefly a picture of the situation in Limerick today.  I have dealt with the city.</P>
      <P>In regard to the county, there is more indolence.  There is a dilatory approach, a come-day, go-day, it-will-do-tomorrow approach.  We have applications for tenant purchase lying on the files for five, six or seven years and nothing being done about them.  If you ask for something to be done, you might as well be looking for ice cream in the Sahara desert.  People frown at you if you ask them to get on with tenant purchases and cottage purchases. They are not interested, but the people who live in those houses are interested, and they are our first concern.</P>
      <P>In Limerick, we are in the unfortunate position that we have something like 344 holdings within the city boundary which are completely and entirely devoted to agriculture.  The holders are either market gardeners or good-sized farmers who supply milk to the city. Unfortunately for themselves, they are within the borough boundary.  It is also unfortunate for us as borough councillors because we are at as big a loss&mdash; and perhaps bigger&mdash;as they are.  The law as it stands was introduced about 70 years ago in 1898, and was followed later by the City and County Management Act.  It provides that people living within the borough area cannot avail of the full agricultural rates reliefs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down a question to the Minister last week asking him would he review the situation, and the answer I got was that he had no intention of reviewing it.  However, we will be taking it up with him later in another way, and we might change his mind, and his whole approach to this matter. As it stands at the moment, these people are deprived of two-fifths of their rateable valuation, and the city council are deprived of a sum of money which is equivalent to a rate of 1/- in the £.  That is the disadvantage <Col N="512" /> we are at because of this Act.  It is a stupid Act.  It is out-of-date and it is about time it was reviewed.  The farmers or market gardeners and the local authority are both losing as the matter stands.  I ask the Minister to give that a second thought.  It is a serious matter and it will have to be rectified one fine day or another.  If it has to be done, let it be done as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the roads question, we have to provide within the council 50 per cent of the cost of whatever road repairs we do.  We are not classed as county roads for the amount of grants given for county road improvements.  For the life of me, I cannot see the difference between a road within the city boundary and a road outside the city boundary. Surely the same amount of traffic, if not more, is going over the city road? Surely it is being used by more people than the county road?  Why there is this discrimination I cannot understand. I believe that men whether they live one mile outside or one mile inside the boundary of any city or town should be treated alike and allowed the same facilities and amenities. This has all been handed down to us and it is time we faced up to the position with regard to roads and to other matters with which I shall deal.</P>
    <P>In regard to speculative building, this is a good thing, provided the builder is carefully watched.  I am not in favour of discouraging speculative building when it is well watched by our engineers and architects so that they can see that everything is properly done.  However, the situation arises when a scheme is finished that a road is left&mdash;if you could call it a road; it would not make a good boreen in any county&mdash;and the unfortunate people in these houses, in hail, rain or snow, have to push their prams and walk along these rocky, muddy places.  They come to us and we go to the council, and the engineers or the architects or the managers tell us that these are private roads and they can do nothing until they are put into proper repair and then they will take them over.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> I suggest to avoid all that, that before a spade is put in the ground to dig the foundations, the first essential should be to lay a good road.  In Limerick City Council, we are up to our eyes in trouble with these unfortunate people.  Your life would be in danger walking down some of these so-called roads with rocks and boulders sticking out of the surface.  You can imagine the position of the unfortunate married people carrying parcels and pushing prams over such surfaces. Nobody will accept responsibility; the council will not insist on the builder putting the road in proper repair and there is no law to make them get this done, but if the law prescribed that a road must be put down first and then passed by the local authority, it would make things much easier for people who go to the expense of incurring a 35 years payment on their houses.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to the matter of derelict sites in the cities.  I believe that a time limit should be fixed for the owner of a derelict site and he should be told to develop it or it will be taken over.  He should be given a reasonable period to do so.  Deputy de Valera has described parts of Dublin as being blitzed but I could bring him to Limerick and show him places where before there was ever a blitz, there were derelict sites.  They are still there and nobody is doing anything about them.  If we are to get into 1964 gear, we must approach this problem as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In regard to group water schemes, I want to repeat that a man in the country is entitled to at least as much, if not more, in regard to amenities, as the man in the city and urban areas.  We have unfortunate people travelling two or three miles daily to get water in all sorts of weather conditions.  The group water scheme is an ideal solution.  I am not going to enter into the question of costs but it is an ideal solution, provided it is put into operation.  We go to the trouble of organising these people. We get them together, very often with the local curate or the parish priest, and we encourage them to join in a scheme.  You may get a crank here and there as always happens, but <Col N="514" /> generally these people are full of enthusiasm.  Their names are taken and we bring out the inspector and he gets down to doing something or perhaps pretends to do something&mdash;I do not know which&mdash;but I always go on results.  He explains the position to the people, what levy will be placed on each person and how much the scheme will cost and agreement is more or less reached.  Then we hear no more about it.  Where the scheme goes after that I do not know but I do know the people are crying out for water.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of urgency and I should like the Minister to make a more definite statement than what we have heard about the provision of water.  The provision of water is more essential in the house than the kitchen table because you can always eat but you are badly off if there is no water in the house.  People, as I say, may have to walk two or three miles and then find that a cranky neighbour will not allow them into the field to get water and they have to go as far again. That situation should not arise in 1964.  Having given the Minister my views, I would ask him to give Limerick one minute of his time and consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the local authorities over which he has jurisdiction will do their job.  Anybody who cares to take note of the planning which the Minister has initiated will see that there is no shortsightedness at headquarters level, but once it leaves there it seems to die a natural death. What is needed is a comprehensive plan for every town and village.  For years, elected representatives had sat <Col N="515" /> back and have watched the ebb and flow of life and all they have ever attempted to do is meet the urgent day to day requirements.  No planning appears to have been done.  We read from the Minister's speech that there is an obsolescence rate of something like 8,000 houses a year.  I am convinced it is even more than that, that is, allowing that the life of a house is 100 years.  I do not believe the life of a house is 100 years or that the type of house that was built 100 years ago would last 100 years.  This programme of housing development is one in which provision must be made for the building of 10,000 to 12,000 houses per year to offset obsolescence as well as for what is necessary in an expanding economy and with improved living standards.</P>
      <P>This lack of planning at local authority level is evident not alone in the capital city of Ireland but throughout the length and breadth of the country.  We heard Deputy Coughlan say here that Limerick City has neglected this side of planning.  Dublin city and county seem to have neglected this side of planning and the same is equally true of every town and village in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coughlan referred to the control of speculative builders.  I wonder if Deputy Coughlan is fully aware that when Limerick Corporation or any other local authority gives a loan over 35 years, one of the normal requirements is that provision is made for the future development of the roads or, alternatively, the roads and services are fully developed before the loan is given.  If Limerick Corporation is not doing that, it is lacking in its duty.  I have never seen money being granted by way of loan without adequate provision for the development of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon boasted of his activities during the glorious years of the reign of the Coalition Government. He took pride in the fact that thousands of houses were built and they were lying idle.  The work he now takes pride in was a disaster during those years he was in Government.  I vividly remember when houses were <Col N="516" /> being built but not being paid for. There was no money to pay for them. Today I think it can be said there is no shortage of money.</P>

They said there were more houses than people to occupy them. Why?  The people were leaving the country.  There was an economic depression brought about by Coalition mismanagement.  Their budgetary policy was inadequate and the money was not available, either in the private or the public sector of the economy.</P>

      <P>No planning was done.  Consequently Dublin city today finds itself without the sites planned and developed to build houses.  Now because of the improvement in our economy and the rise in the standard of living there is an abnormal demand. The Minister will have to introduce measures by which this can be met quickly and adequately.  When the Minister places the present replacement requirements at 10,000 houses, I want to say the problem will not then be solved.  It will then be necessary to build 10,000 houses a year to cover obsolescence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speech made by Deputy de Valera could not have been made years ago.  Dublin Corporation did not make any plans for the replacement of derelict and worn-out houses.  There are all over the country in every town and village worn out houses.  The local authorities are not living up to their responsibility of planning for their replacement.  There is little planning at local authority level.  Can anybody tell me of a local authority in Ireland that has laid in a pool of land fully developed?  Can anybody tell me of any town or village in Ireland that has <Col N="517" /> a site developed for 30 or 40 houses? There is not one.</P>
    <P>I remember where the reverse happened. In my own town of Tubbercurry, a compulsory purchase order was made in respect of a five acre site; an architect was employed and the site was laid out for 28 houses.  In 1957 they decided there was no need for houses in Tubbercurry.  They withdrew the CPO and let the thing go.  That is the type of negative planning that has been going on.  We wait until the crisis is upon us.  We wait until the unfortunate person's house has fallen down and then we say: &ldquo;We will build a house for him.&rdquo; Five or ten years elapse before plans are brought to fruition.  I appeal to the Minister to use all his powers to ensure that every local authority lays in a supply of land which is developed and serviced.  If the land should lie there for 20 or 30 years it is always a good investment.  Once the site itself is selected, to plan the houses is a relatively short job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">

    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Johnny might be just as neglectful as any but Johnny sees what ought to be done, and I say, for goodness sake, let us do it. The present state of our economy calls for the maximum effort in the planning of houses throughout Ireland. The Minister has introduced during the year several positive factors.  One was the increase in respect of farmers' new homes fully serviced and up to a <Col N="518" /> very high standard.  I welcome that heartily and I know it is having the desired effect throughout the country. The provision whereby the Land Commission will grant a loan of up to £500 on a farmer's holding is, by and large, being well received.  In adverting to that, I would again refer to Deputy Dillon's remarks about saddling the farmers with the cost of building the house which may be £1,000 or £1,200.  I should like him to say to what holding it would apply and what would be the annuity each year on it.  Farmers are naturally conservative people and one of the things they do not particularly like is heavy rents or heavy charges on their land.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to refer back to the need for examination of the housing problem in my constituency in Sligo-Leitrim. Every day I come across unfortunate, marginal farmers whose houses are in terrible conditions. Despite representations made to the local authority, procrastination would appear to be the order of the day. For this reason, I welcome the new provisions whereby the local authority will provide a house, where the land holding valuation is £5 or under, at a weekly rent of 7/6d.  I welcome this provision.  It is needed very badly and I hope it will be followed up with the necessary instructions to implement it quickly.  A further provision was brought in under section 5 of the Housing Act of 1962.  I have endeavoured as far as I can to push the local authority in Sligo-Leitrim into implementing this Act.  Efforts are being made towards this end in some cases.  This useful piece of legislation, which was introduced in 1962, should be used to a greater extent by local authorities.  It should be used in the marginal areas of my constituency.  I know that where there are poor people living in small dwellings, it would give them habitable houses, and that is all they require for the remainder of their lifetime.  It is no use making plans unless the local authority take effective steps to implement them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other provision, of which I have not seen much result in my constituency, relates to old people's homes.  This is an <Col N="519" /> admirable provision for grants for old people living alone, perhaps in isolated places and with nobody to look after them.  Again, I do not know what percentage of them are being put into effect, if at all.  The Minister in his brief referred, I think, to 46 which have been dealt with.  I would ask the Minister to emphasise to local authorities the need for an extension of this service.  If I remember rightly, the Minister hoped, when he introduced it, that various societies and charitable organisations would undertake this work.  I think he ought to issue a more up-to-date announcement pointing out that this facility exists and should be availed of.</P>
    <P>Before I leave housing, I should like to mention the maximum loan given under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act which has been raised to £2,250.  I should like to have this raised to a figure which is more in keeping with present day building costs.  I do not believe £2,250 is adequate.  Very few homes, having regard to land and building costs, can be built below £3,000.  Having regard to the fact that the limit of salary by which people can come within this provision is £1,040 a year, I should have thought that the Minister might possibly have taken 2½ times this figure, which would bring the maximum loan to £2,600.  I think this is a more realistic figure than that contained in the Minister's announcement.</P>
    <P>The minimum price of development sites in the city and county today is anywhere in the region of £500 or £600.  I am well aware, as is the Minister, that the building costs of a fully serviced house in town or country are in the region of £2,000 or £2,400, and it would need no imagination to bring that figure to £3,000.  By deducting the Government subsidy of £275, a qualified person, that is, a person with an income not greater than £1,040, would require to deposit a sizeable sum in order to be able to purchase a house under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  I would again ask the Minister to review that position.  It is true that the state of our economy is such that in the private sector adequate money is readily <Col N="520" /> available for the financing of housing. However, if the problem is to be adequately solved, greater activity is needed under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another facet of the Minister's Department, the question of water supply.  I need say nothing about the obvious need for a good water supply throughout the country.  The Minister has done his duty in encouraging the local authorities to prepare their plans. Many of them have prepared their plans but there is lack of activity in the construction of the schemes.  It would seem to me that very little is being done at all and I would ask the Minister to look into this aspect of it.  In Sligo, several of these schemes have been approved or are at the final planning stage, but few of them are under construction.  One is being completed in North Sligo and I should like to see the others pushed ahead.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to speed up the construction of the Lough Talt water supply scheme.  It is true that renovations and repairs are being carried out at Kilmachtigue, near Aclare.  Modern sanitation facilities have been installed but because of lack of water, none of these facilities is capable of being used. I have been asked by the residents and by parents of the children to bring this matter up as one of urgency.  At the present moment there are no sanitary facilities at all at the school there, because there is no water supply available. The Reverend Manager there and the teachers, in conjunction with the planning of the water supply scheme, got this service installed but because of delay in appointing the contractor, there is a hold up.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look into that matter and devote some attention to Sligo and Leitrim generally in the matter of water supply.  The town of Ballymote has a bad water supply and there is delay regarding the Carrick-Banagher scheme and its construction. I have had complaints from the residents of Ballisodare and Collooney about the shortage of water.  There have been complaints in Tubbercurry about the water supply.  The scheme <Col N="521" /> which was built many years ago in these towns is overtaxed and is not adequate.  I would ask that all the water supply schemes in those towns be reviewed and something done about them.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to raise.  The Sligo County Council installed a sewerage scheme in the villages of Gurteen and Bunninadden. The householders in those villages were asked to connect up themselves. Some of them, who had the money, did connect up at their own cost.  Subsequently, the cost was found so heavy that the county council decided they would give further facilities and they supplied the service to all those within the boundary.  I would now ask the Minister to bring some justice to this area, that the people in Gurteen and Bunninadden be compensated for the work they did.  It is grossly unfair that those who make the sacrifices and do the work they have to do subsequently find themselves caught out. We should treat all people equally or we will bring about the position where if you do something hastily, you will be sorry.  If you do not do it, the county council will do it for you.  It is a bad precedent to bring about.  I would ask the Minister to consider these few people&mdash;there are ten in Gurteen and five in Bunninadden&mdash; who incurred this expense.  They have been told that they will not get any refund of the moneys they have paid.</P>
    <P>I now want to speak about the roads.  Generally speaking, the amount of money being spent on the roads throughout the country is evident. The improvement in the roads is also very evident.  The progress being made in this work is remarkable. The more progress is made the greater demand there will be for further progress on other roads.  One can foresee when all the roads will be well and truly done.  However, there are areas where the roads have been left over until the end or else have been forgotten.</P>
    <P>There is one area in particular I want to refer to, that is, the area around Monasteraden and Mullaghroe. The roads around that area are generally in bad condition.  The potholes <Col N="522" /> are filled with sand but occasionally they are very rough.  I asked the county council to see to it that these roads were made more usable but it did not have any general effect. The people who are ratepayers in that area come to me and ask me to do something about it.  When I cannot get some satisfaction from the county council, I have to bring the matter up to the Minister here.</P>
    <P>I also spoke to the Sligo County Council last week regarding the diverting of a grant from the Boyle-Collooney area to some other section. I want to inform the Minister that there is concern in Ballinafad and Castlebaldwin about this matter.  They have been waiting for the improvements which were to be brought about in the area.  They would like to see the money being spent on those roads.  I hope the Minister will not transfer that money to any other area.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying that the Minister can be very proud of his planning and the initiative he has shown throughout the year to meet the many urgent calls upon his Department. I think he has left no source untapped.  He is doing everything possible to encourage greater planning throughout the whole country.  I hope he will arm himself with the necessary authority and power to see that better planning for the future is done.</P>
    <P>It is my considered opinion that the day of diminishing population in Ireland is gone and that our population will increase in the years to come.  It is no dream at all to say that in 50 or 60 years' time, it could well be that the population of this country will have increased by 100 per cent.  If we do not plan now for that increase, then whatever troubles we have now will be multiplied tenfold in 60 or 70 years' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMSheridan" hpid="Mr. Sheridan Mr. Sheridan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like most rural Deputies, there are a few points which concern me both as a member of Dáil Éireann and as a member of a local authority.  Unfortunately, in Longford and Westmeath, the constituency I represent, through whose fault I do not know, we are very poor as far as industry is concerned.  Therefore, not <Col N="523" /> alone are improved roads very necessary, because of the very heavy traffic conditions at the moment, but as a means of employment since we have scarcely any other means of employment in those counties.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say in Westmeath this year we have got very increased main road grants, which in itself is a very good thing.  More people are employed, I would venture to say, at this period and during the past winter, than have been employed on road works for a very long time.  I should like to remind the Minister that the local authorities are very glad of the increased grants&mdash;the very generous grants, I should say&mdash;towards the main roads.  I would impress on the Minister that he should look at the county roads.</P>
      <P>There is a point I should like to make in connection with the road works.  When work in progress on main roads is finished in one section and has to be continued in another section, the men have to be lorried about from one section to another.  In certain areas there is unemployment, while in other areas there is full employment or over-full employment.  As well as that, some of what we call country roads, or county roads, are in very poor condition.  I think you will find this in many other places in the country as well as in my constituency. I would ask the Minister to look into the points I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all glad to know that relief is to be given on the rates and that they will be pushed back to the 1956 and 1957 level.  There is a point I should like to make here which I think has been made by other Deputies.  The people living in small towns and in large towns, who are in a small way of business and the people who are ordinary house dwellers and living on little investments in property are certainly in a bad way because of the ever-increasing rates.  I should like to refer especially to the small business people in those towns.  This country at the moment is very much inclined to follow the pattern of other countries with such things as cattle marts, supermarts <Col N="524" /> and every other kind of similar combination.  Whether those combines are good or bad for the trade of the country, or whether they give better value to the consumer or not, they certainly do not help the small business people, especially of the towns.  Therefore I urge the Minister to review the position in towns, big and small, throughout the country.  I know he is big enough to interest himself in it.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to indicate in his reply what his attitude is to the provision of swimming pools in inland towns which are far removed from the sea or from lakes.  In most of them there are no swimming facilities for young and old.  I suppose the local authorities have a responsibility in this respect, but I would value the Minister's view on the problem.  I refer particularly to towns such as Athlone, Mullingar and Longford.</P>
    <P>On the question of housing, every Deputy, whether of the Government Party or on the Opposition benches, must have welcomed the provision of housing loans this year by the Land Commission in conjunction with the Department of Local Government.  The only fault I have to find with this scheme is that the £500 provided is too small.  After all, the Land Commission are a big State body and in this matter I submit they have not gone far enough.  The percentage charged on these loans cannot be faulted: it is at least twice as advantageous as the charges sought by the local authority who, because of administration costs, asks for a quarter per cent higher than the banks.  I suggest, however, that the amount of this Land Commission loan should be at least doubled.  Then it would enable farmers to go a long way towards building their own homes.</P>
    <P>Many allegations have been made here against both the Minister and the Government.  I am not a member of either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael and do not wish to become one, but I must honestly say I do not think very many of these allegations are justified.  As a member of Westmeath County Council in 1956, I had to apply for grants for various people throughout my area <Col N="525" /> but found that the county council could not provide the moneys because they were not forthcoming from the Department of Local Government. Today, the only real grouse we have against the Department is that they are too slow in sanctioning schemes for cottages and town houses.  I would ask the Minister to have consideration of these plans expedited in the future.</P>
    <P>Still on the question of housing, my visits to the Department are generally in reference to appeals on behalf of some unfortunates in rural areas who have gone about reconstructing their houses or building new houses.  These people are not solicitors or teachers. Many of them are slow to read and understand plans properly.  They are slow to employ local tradesmen.  Often they find that when the work has been completed, it does not conform fully with the Department's plan and then the trouble begins for the Deputy whose area is affected.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the only defect is that the drop in a lean-to is not at the right angle or that the window frames are not of the proper measurement.  The Deputy appeals to the Department to get money for the person concerned. The local merchant and, perhaps, the contractor are waiting for their money. To avoid such trouble I suggest to the Minister and the Department that a clearer explanation of the plan be given to the applicant for reconstruction or building grants.  Sometimes the engineer just shoves the plan under the door or through the window, giving no explanation of it to the unfortunate applicant.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be congratulated on the drive and energy he has displayed in the campaign for road safety, for his appeals at Easter and on other occasions.  One big problem drivers of cars from the country to Dublin face at night has to do with the lighting of large lorries.  Their front lights, of which there are sometimes four, are all right but there is no indication as to the width of the body.  There are no sidelights on the body and in the darkness it is impossible to gauge the width of the vehicle.  I suggest that inadequate lighting of lorries in this respect <Col N="526" /> should be made a major offence.  I do not drive very quickly&mdash;I try to take as great care as is possible&mdash;but many times I have been fooled almost to the point of death by these vehicles.</P>
    <P>I wish to lodge a complaint against the sites chosen on the outskirts of towns by the millionaire oil companies. They are only small sites for filling stations, but they are usually near towns and villages.  I cannot see what advantage these filling stations are and everybody who has spoken about them publicly has complained about the scarcity of sites for housing nowadays. In fact, many urban areas are being extended to provide housing sites within the urban districts.  I know of two special cases, which I can lay before this House or point out to the Minister, where two companies had filling stations erected which will be a big block to those places ever being developed as building sites.  The filling stations are on main roads and are built on what I would call excellent building sites.</P>
    <P>We all know that filling stations, where cars and trucks are rushing in and out, are certainly not adding to the value of the property in those places.  Whilst I know that the people concerned have to get permission from the local authority, I would ask the Minister to step in here and to take a firm hand.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher spoke about planning ahead.  He seems to think that the population of this country will increase by 100 per cent in time&mdash; I hope he is right.  He said we should plan ahead: I agree with that.  However, this is one little instance where we could plan ahead and it is something which I would ask the Minister to knock on the head at once.  There can be no such thing as planning ahead if we allow those people to come in and put tanks under the ground and erect filling stations.  We cannot plan then and we can do nothing about it.  Those people are no charity whatever.  Let them go out the country and erect their stations on main roads far removed from those places which are valuable as building sites.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> I am probably one of the Deputies who give most annoyance to the Minister by way of letters, appeals, personal approach and so on.  I have always found that he used his energy to the limit in looking into every case individually and I congratulate him on that.  He is doing a good job.</P>

      <P>I have always felt I was not a thin-skinned person and that, in fact, I was even-tempered and quite well able to stand up to the political give and take of this place. However, I confess that my patience wore rather thin as Deputy Gallagher was speaking.  I do not think I have ever listened to such pompous rubbish as he spoke about the progress of housing in this country and about who is responsible for its shortcomings.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious that Deputy Gallagher has never looked at the figures.  It is also quite obvious, as he confessed himself, that he takes no part whatever in local government.</P>

However, he never looked at the figures.  If a man in business never looks at figures, there is something wrong with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera and Deputy Corry had complaints to make about the progress of housing.  I have in mind, now, the speeches by Deputy Corry, Deputy de Valera and Deputy Gallagher.  One would think that none of them knew that Fianna Fáil had been in office in this country for 26 out of the past 32 years and that, in those 26 years, they never approached the record set by the alternative government in their six years of office.  These are the figures and anybody who tries to brush them aside and to talk as Deputy Gallagher talked this morning is simply not facing facts.  Enthusiasm is one thing but Deputy Gallagher's brand of <Col N="528" /> politics makes nonsense of human intelligence.  I got hot about it because I felt that he had no contribution to make and that, in such circumstances, it would be better if he had not tried to make one.</P>
    <P>It is almost a cliché, I suppose, that the Minister's Department is closer to the citizen than any other Department of State.  The other Departments are remote but this Department is virtually on the citizen's doorstep.  It has more power to restrain the citizen or to help the citizen than any other Department.  Of course, it reaches most closely into local government life through the activities of local government bodies and the intimate contact citizens have with local representatives.</P>
    <P>This Estimate debate could be called the parish pump debate.  In fact, in his speech, Deputy de Valera underlined that.  He confined his remarks altogether to the particular problems of the streets in his constituency.  The parish pump is a very important thing. I want to congratulate the Minister on his approach to one subject in which I have considerable interest, namely, planning&mdash;I do not mean planning quite in the sense Deputy Gallagher meant it but in the sense of ordering the scene in which we live. Because I am interested in it, I realise that others are not very interested in that matter but rather in housing or expenditure on roads.  However, I suppose these three matters&mdash;housing, traffic and planning&mdash;are the main burden the Minister and his Department carry.</P>
    <P>So much has been said about housing and so much has been repeated that there is not much point in going over the ground again.  We know that our inheritance was an ugly one.  We inherited it from the British.  Our people were housed in savagely bad conditions.  I have said before and I say it again that it is probably quite a good thing for us that we escaped the industrial revolution in this country because less harm has been done. However, we are not making enough progress.  The slums in our cities&mdash; those areas referred to by the Deputy from Limerick and Deputies from all <Col N="529" /> sides of the House&mdash;are a measure of that good impatience that is in all of us.</P>
    <P>The Minister might yesterday have conveyed the impression to the House that the rural problem is greater than the urban problem.  None of us thinks that this is so.  If I have misread the Minister I should like him to understand that that is the impression I got from his speech.  I think the real urgency of housing lies in the three major cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>After all, a great deal of progress has been made in rural housing over the past 30 years but the slums in our cities are testimony to our real failure to do the job.  I believe we have made extraordinary progress but I think that if a drive were organised and all the usual delaying factors were smoothed out we could probably get rid of the serious conditions in the urban areas within a period of eight to ten years.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are current problems. There is a shortage of certain kinds of tradesmen.  There are priorities because of activities in other kinds of building.  Then there is the race against obsolescence.  If the Minister's figures are correct, they are very frightening.  They indicate that we shall probably have to earmark £16 million a year to keep level with obsolescence.  That is a pretty grim prospect.  There are other types of expenditure that cannot be related to the actual house because when you take people out of the heart of the city and transport them to housing areas on the periphery, the twilight remains, these ugly areas of dreadful dilapidation to which Deputy de Valera referred in such scathing terms, such as parts of old Dublin around High Street, near the historic centre of the city, and parts of the cities of Cork and Limerick that are in the same condition. They have that after-the-airraid look.  Because of the urgency of putting people into houses, these scars have now lasted over a generation.  It is the next task to which we must turn. We have torn the hearts out of the cities and nothing but decay remains inside.  Very special measures must be taken to replace these areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> Flat building is expensive and tenants generally dislike living in flats. Even before they have any experience of it, they tell you they do not want to go to flats.  But flats have advantages, one being if they are sited on the old centre from which the population have been evacuated, they are near their work and transport costs are considerably reduced.  Many other costs also come down.  I believe it would be good sense for us to make sure, when we have dealt with the urgent problem and put roofs over the heads of people living in slums, that we take a long look at what is left and make sure the area does not remain dilapidated and that Deputy de Valera does not have a case to make about the dreadful conditions in north Dublin, or a case to make about dreadful conditions in some parts of Cork or Limerick.</P>
    <P>A great many things hang on this: old city parishes die; churches lose congregations and shops lose their customers.  There is a great deal of tragedy about it.  Deputy Dillon referred to many shopkeepers in Dublin city who are to be evacuated because their premises must come down.  They certainly have a case for the civic conscience to consider.  I understand some of the larger business people in this area are receiving compensation for disturbance while very small people are just being told to get out.  That fits the pattern of how we humans conduct our affairs; if a man is big enough to kick up a row, we listen to his case but if he is a small person, we tend to brush him to one side.  That is something our conscience should be troubled by.  The good thing to do, if a rapid movement is on the way to get people out of the slums, if the new areas are prepared, is to start reconstructing flats and get the people back into the heart of the cities.  Otherwise, the interior of the city becomes a dead place.  It would be quite possible to change the depressing features of these areas of which Deputy de Valera complains when this building has been done.  Small parks could be laid out and plenty of trees planted to give an attractive appearance to places now desolate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> We must not forget that very old people frequently live in these slums, the remains of their families who, perhaps, have married and gone.  They now live in modest, unsatisfactory conditions and I think every local authority in its housing schemes should propose to allocate some of its funds to provide small dwellings for very old people.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to proposals to which the Minister referred and which local authorities are now discussing, the provision of schemes for tenant purchase.  These apply in rural areas where labourers' cottages have been purchased by the inhabitants.  Cities have become very large landlords.  In Cork city, the situation is fantastic. Half the population of the city is now made up of Corporation tenants.  That is a very ill-balanced civic unit.  It would be very desirable if these tenants could get every encouragement to become owners.  The City Manager in Cork has produced a scheme which he says has not yet received the sanction of the Minister.  I spent some hours examining it this week and it seems to hang together well and it is sensible and fair.  It takes account of the length of tenancy and the age of the house.  The terms of purchase are not onerous and I ask the Minister, when the proposal comes from the Corporation, to sanction it with as little a readjustment as possible so that there will be no delay in having it carried out.</P>
    <P>Probably other speakers have referred to this in regard to repair grants&mdash;the inspection and control by the local authority.  This is largely automatic; they do not actually inspect but pay the grant when the Department advises that the grant has been sanctioned by them and that their part has been paid.  The case is being made that there is not sufficient inspection of these repair jobs. Last year and the year before, I asked the Minister if he would consider it more sensible to employ the local authority to have their engineer or architect inspect the work.  They are on the spot.  I do not want duplication <Col N="532" /> and I think the technical officers of the local authority would probably be more competent because they are nearer and also because of the time factor involved which I think would mean grants would be paid more rapidly.  It seems wrong that the local authority should automatically have to pay one-third of the repair grant without even looking at the work that is proposed or allegedly executed.</P>
    <P>Traffic is probably the second most important matter the Minister must consider.  In the rural areas, Ireland is still in the enviable position of having plenty of room for traffic.  The cities and towns provide our main problem. Our cities have been slowing up.  The recent rearrangement of the movement of traffic in Dublin and Cork has shown a considerable improvement.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question would appear to imply that the services of district medical officers are available to eligible persons only during the hours of normal dispensary sessions.  This, of course, is not the position.  Besides attending dispensary sessions, a district medical officer is obliged to attend eligible persons in their homes, where the nature of the illness so requires, and he is also required to attend emergency calls received on behalf of such persons at any time.  The instructions on the general medical services cards issued to elegible persons by the Dublin Health Authority make the position in this respect clear.</P>

There may be a period of three years or more between the initiation and the completion of a scheme, even where the administrative and legal procedures and the building operations are carried out without any avoidable delays.  The proportion of time occupied in each such procedure and operation is, however, likely to vary as between one scheme and another.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The proportion of time which would be saved in actual building operations in this country by the use of system building methods would depend on circumstances, such as the particular system used as well as the factors affecting the site of a particular scheme and the area in which it may be located.</P>
      <P>I understand, however, that the application of certain industrialised building methods to the erection of dwellings in certain other countries has enabled the time for the erection of the superstructure of the particular type of dwelling erected to be halved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second part of <Col N="535" /> the question there are a number of time consuming procedures related to the acquisition of sites, preparatory planning and documentation for contract purposes almost all of which must be followed in sequence.

It is the use of prefabricated units and in the context in which I am answering the question, I am dealing with the prefabrication of the superstructure. Prefabrication is used in various operations in this country. Joinery work has been going on for years and there is also the prefabrication of the doors and windows.  It is not a question to which there is a ready answer from any particular source.</P>

The general position is that the grant for farmers and agricultural workers is calculated at two-thirds of the estimated <Col N="538" /> cost subject to the statutory maxima of £100, £120 and £140 respectively for houses containing three, four and five rooms after reconstruction. The grant in other cases is calculated at the rate of one-third of the cost subject to the same statutory maxima.  Where the cost of reconstruction exceeds £300 for a three-roomed house, £360 for a four-roomed house or £420 for a five-roomed house, expenditure in excess of these amounts is met in full by applicants, even where full supplementary grants are payable.  Where supplementary grants are not payable the point at which the applicant begins to meet 100 per cent of the excess cost occurs much earlier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned, I had been discussing the growth of the traffic problem in the country and the fact that in rural areas we were yet free from trouble because our road surfaces were lengthy and in good condition and that it was, indeed, very attractive to tourists to come here and to drive.  There is a good deal of room.  We can take a great deal more wheeled traffic on our roads yet.  Of course, that creates problems in the towns and cities because in the towns and cities we are rapidly approaching the conditions of the cities and towns in much more thickly populated places.  In Dublin, Cork and such centres, traffic was grinding to a standstill.  The recent changes in traffic direction have made an improvement which I hope will last for some years yet, but with the growth of wheeled traffic, it is quite obvious that the city streets cannot contain or take the amount of wheeled traffic that will attempt to use them and we will eventually have to face the position where certain areas in all towns and cities will have to be designated solely for pedestrian use.  There is going to be objection to that, as there is in Ireland objection to every innovation, but we will have to face that and eventually some centres in every urban district will have to be reserved entirely for pedestrian traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the drawbacks about the praiseworthy attempts to improve driving conditions in the towns and more thickly populated rural areas has been the failure of most Irish drivers to obey the indicators for lane traffic.   Lane traffic is a very quicklyacquired, intelligent way of regulating traffic movement but quite a number of Irish drivers make no attempt whatever to obey the lane dividers and the <Col N="545" /> lanes are being used incorrectly by them.  If they obey the lane arrows and drive in the proper lane traffic, movement will be very much improved. In this regard and in regard to many other facets of use of the roads by wheeled vehicles television and newspaper advertising should be used more than they are used.</P>
    <P>I often wonder why in country roads when our engineers were devising the road surfaces, they had not found it possible to incorporate a white or light-coloured material of some kind in the road.  Any of us who drives on the black tarmacadam type of road on a wet night knows how hard it is even with the most powerful lights to see the road and when you run on to a road of lighter colour, made of concrete, or an old dust road, at once the lights become 100 per cent more efficient.</P>
    <P>It should not be beyond the skill of our road engineers to devise a surface which, as well as having its normal and good properties as a surface to carry traffic, should also have a surface which would not absorb but would reflect light, which would make the roads at night a safer proposition for the driver, particularly in wet weather.</P>
    <P>The signs indicating recent changes in traffic control are incompetent and insufficient.  Some of those signs should be sited so that they will be on a level with the lights of the car or a little above that, so that the driver can see the sign and signal being given to him.</P>
    <P>Of course, the gravest danger on our roads are those who use ordinary pedal cycles.  They never seem to realise the dreadful danger they are in and the regulations compelling them to carry a light are honoured more often in the breach than in the observance.</P>
    <P>All old drivers would want to be made aware that there is a great number of new drivers on the roads this year because they are attempting to meet the provisions which require tests.  If they have taken out licences early this year, they can drive for the remainder of the year before undergoing a test.  In the meantime, they are <Col N="546" /> all learner drivers and they do not all carry plates and we would all do well to take heed that there are many beginner drivers on our roads this summer.  We should all take care, in any event.  The Minister should be gratified, as we all are, that the Whitsun sheet was a very clean one and that probably the injunctions on television and the newspapers by the Minister are having effects.</P>
    <P>I want to agree very fully with what has been said about the use of articulated lorries, that is, vehicles with trailers, on our roads.  In at least one country in Europe, Italy, the owners of these lorries have been given notice that after so many years, the use of these vehicles will be prohibited on Italian roads.  If we have taken the trains off the rails, we should not allow them to be put back on the roads. They are very dangerous vehicles. Even if they probably provide economies of some kind for carriers, they provide very great dangers to road users as well.  I could not agree more fully than I do with what Deputy Sheridan said about the rear lighting of heavy vehicles of this kind&mdash;that the lighting should indicate clearly the complete width of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>Another subject, which has not been referred to so far, is the discharging of diesel fumes from ill-kept diesel engines in narrow streets.  If we were strict about that, we might find that the cigarette was not altogether the guilty party in creating conditions which might lead to an increase in the incidence of cancer.  Another matter in the same line, for which the Minister would have responsibility, is the pollution of the air by certain factories. In the city of Cork and other lowlying cities, it is quite a problem. The growth of industry brings its own disabilities.  It should be possible to compel all factory owners to have properly washed smoke emitted into the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>I want to get on to the consideration of a subject in which I am deeply interested and in which, I am glad to know, the Minister is very interested also&mdash;the planning of the place in which we live.  It is my pet subject, and I am very glad the Minister is also enthusiastic <Col N="547" /> about it.  The attractiveness of the place in which we live has effects far outside the immediate effects.  The principles involved are elementary: first, cleanliness and tidiness; secondly, reasonably good taste in the decoration of buildings; and, thirdly, the preservation of as much natural character as possible in urban places.</P>
    <P>The shame of dilapidation, to which Deputy de Valera referred this morning, is something that should trouble us all.  Of course, a great deal is due to our history.  In the smaller towns the impact of the Tidy Towns Competition has been something remarkable. It is one of the most useful projects undertaken in my time.  It just shows that if the paint brush is used on one premises in a street after a while all the others have to follow suit. Now, some of the towns and villages are a pleasure to drive through.</P>
    <P>Nothing satisfies me more than to learn of the growth of paint sales in Ireland.  I suppose it is a matter of private human rights that a man should have the building he occupies in whatever condition he is permitted to have it in.  But in what condition is he permitted to have it?  Has he any right to deface the local scenery with the gross ugliness of advertising we sometimes see in goodish buildings in the urban scene here?  I know of some areas in Cork city where the return walls of buildings have been hired out to advertising contractors and great, ugly advertising is permitted to be painted on them.  That is something to which we should strenuously object.  We seem to have checked the efflorescence of the billboards in the country areas.  Where planning authorities are stringent in the urban areas there is considerable control over the kind of billboard that may be erected.  We should all strive to keep that kind of thing out of sight as much as possible.  After all, as far as the advertisers themselves are concerned, if nobody can use these things, nobody loses and nobody is at a disadvantage. But it would be deplorable if the roads leading from our towns <Col N="548" /> and cities became as the roads leading out of some continental towns and cities.  We have a duty to prevent that spoliation of our landscape.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have a look at what happens when a man decides he is going to give his place a facelift. The present Tidy Towns movement encourages many people to do this.  But they find then that the Valuation Commissioners come along and the valuation goes up.  The Minister ought to have a look at this and satisfy himself that this is not a contradiction of what he is trying to do.  There should be no increase in the valuation unless there is an increase in the cubic capacity of the premises.  If a man tears down dilapidated old fittings and puts up a contemporary or modern shop front, he should not be penalised.  It really means we are paying a premium for dilapidation.  If this change could be made in the law it would be a great help towards improving the urban scene all over the country.  Let us not penalise the improver, as we are doing now.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to refer to is the changing of place names.  Sometimes, in a frenzied outburst of patriotism or may be religion, we change place names in this country.  It often happens that this is the result of some &ldquo;eloquent Dempsey&rdquo; on the local council and the rest being too shy to say they think the change should not be made.  Even if the names sought to be changed represent the names of our old oppressors, at any rate they are the footprints of history and should be left there.  Keep the new names for some new street or edifice. We should not be in any hurry to change things.  History is being written for thousands of years.  Let us leave the indications of the past there.  It does not mean we are giving any approval of some of the activities of the people so commemorated, but in this way is the history of the country delineated.</P>
    <P>We are still not planting enough trees, particularly in the urban places. Very positive encouragement should be given by way of free grants to the planting of trees in city places.  As I have said previously, there is a great <Col N="549" /> deal of monotony in modern housing, particularly local government housing but often private schemes as well&mdash; these ugly rows of concrete cubes one after another, without any attempt to relieve them by a green tree or an open space.  Wherever there are beauty spots, particular attention should be given to trees and making sure they are not run down or ugly.  May I refer in passing to the proposal made about the Grand Canal in Dublin?  It would be a dreadful thing if anything happened to replace that very pleasant and charming part of Dublin by anything like a concrete car park.</P>
    <P>There are people in local authorities who see nothing wrong in doing that kind of thing and one of the jobs of the Minister and his Department is to educate such people into a realisation that what they are doing is very wrong. Wherever there is water on the Irish landscape, it is a very important part of the scene and we should ensure that these waters are kept on the landscape so that those who visit us will see for themselves that we make the most of our natural amenities.  For pity's sake, do not put concrete roadways over streams, rivers and canals.  That is a frequent proposal.</P>
    <P>The same argument applies to our beaches, to the cleaning of them and the checking of erosion.  It is possible to do the latter in many ways but there is only one good way, that is, by exercising the utmost good taste in the erection of breakwaters.  If we could get rid of the ugly shanties that disfigure our seaside places, it would be a great step forward.  Too often outside our country towns one finds the town dump.  I do not know why the dump is always just a field into which the stuff is thrown without any attempt being made either to cover it or to hide it.  Trees planted and the rubbish hidden behind those trees would be an improvement on the present position.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will bear with me if I refer again to the work of the ESB and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in erecting great ugly poles in the middle of streets and towns and housing areas.  They should be compelled to bring these heavy wires for <Col N="550" /> telephones and electric power in by the backs of the houses if they cannot face the expense of putting them underground.  They have disfigured many charming parts of Ireland with their activities.  We should not condone that and I shall certainly keep on objecting so long as I am here.  I have a good deal of sympathy with Deputy de Valera's proposal that there should be an inspection squad in the Minister's Department to keep an eye on all these activities.  The inspectors could go to a district and if gentle hinting did not succeed, they could put the heat on in order to convince local authorities they are doing wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister's greater Dublin plan under which he proposes to make an effort to control all developments is a sensible and desirable one.  I take it that within a radius of 50 or 60 miles, a proper relationship will be preserved between the rural and urban scene.  I hope that in the near future we shall have the result of the application made by Cork to extend the city boundaries.  That extension is a necessary development because there are a number of things that should be done but cannot be done unless the city embraces a larger area.  It is possible with cities like Dublin and Cork, with large residential and large industrial areas, to have the cities both good looking and busy.  The important point is that the area should be large enough to bear the burden of the kind of control and direction needed.</P>
    <P>The local government elections will take place next year and it is desirable that the result of the application for an extension of the area&mdash;I do not know whether it will require legislation&mdash;should be known in good time because there will necessarily be a larger electoral area and arrangements will have to be made to reconstitute the kind of corporation that now administers the affairs of Cork city.  We should try to ensure an end to the ridiculous system under which 70, 80 or 90 names appear on a ballot paper.</P>
    <P>The real danger the Minister has to face, and all of us who are interested in local government, is that the everincreasing burdens placed on local <Col N="551" /> government&mdash;health, housing and the growth in salaries and wages&mdash;means that the important local government work is being neglected.  There is a lesson to be learned perhaps in the fact that the Custom House is now overshadowed by Liberty Hall.  Salaries and wages have tended to rocket in the last three years.  We should always remember that money values change and the danger is that desirable expenditure is curtailed and those who want to have things done in their areas have to fight to get them done.  There are a great many Philistines around, and very often in ratepayers' organisations. They tell us we have a duty to the present but I think we have a duty to the future to make sure that the organisation of our towns, cities and rural areas is both competent and good looking.  If we get impatient sometimes, then it is easy to get impatient.  Deputy de Valera asked the question this morning, talking about the Dublin Corporation: &ldquo;Do they know what they are at?&rdquo; I think they do and I believe the local authority of which I am a member know what they are at although the red tape, the necessary controls that must be exercised, seems to make the process of doing the work of local government very slow and results are sometimes very disappointing.  There is a continual battle against inertia. Results are slow but I am pretty sure that, if we all get down to the job, results will come in the end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be brief. Deputy Dillon implied that emigration had reached such a heavy figure since 1956 that there was no housing shortage. In fact, the population of Dublin has increased since 1956 and up to 1961 by 13,300.  Present indications are that it has since increased by a further 6,500, making a total of 20,000 requiring on an average 5,000 extra houses.  Better economic conditions for workers, together with the needs of the already existent population, have tended to place a strain on the Department and the Dublin Corporation. I make the point to keep the record clear.</P>
      <P>We in Kerry are grateful to the Minister for the many reforms he has brought about, particularly in the housing situation.  Certainly this new scheme of building houses for people with a valuation of £5 and under has been very warmly welcomed in Kerry. It is a pity the Minister could not find some other means of having the houses erected in Kerry because we have a backlog of 600 houses.</P>
      <P>Recently at a conference the engineer told us the maximum rate of building cannot exceed 150 houses a year.  Therefore, it will take four years to deal with the present backlog. With the new scheme, we should get another 1,000 houses, but it is a pity the Minister did not get his own organisation to work on it because he has the engineers, and he has a housing section.  With the present rigid regulations, we cannot see the Kerry County Council making any serious impact on that position.  However, it is a job for us in Kerry and we will do our best to try to resolve the difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main purpose in rising to speak was to deal with the question of road grants.  In Kerry we find ourselves in a very difficult position in view of the fact that there has been a reduction in the county roads grants and that the railway grant which operated there <Col N="553" /> for years has been withdrawn.  On two occasions, the county engineer has said that the Department have insisted on channelling all the tourist grants into the arterial roads.  That is a most serious position.  It will affect us in Kerry for a long time because only 66 per cent of our entire roads are dust-free, which leaves 34 per cent of our roads, and particularly the mountain roads which give access to our scenic attractions, in urgent need of attention if we are to improve the tourist industry.  Without doubt, if the tourist industry is affected in Kerry, it affects the whole country.  There are small narrow roads where motor cars find it difficult to travel, and two cars cannot pass each other.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister at this stage to have this position reviewed and to give us the grants for our county roads which are of scenic value, and play an important and major part in the tourist industry in Kerry.  I do not think there is absolute necessity for the big arterial building we have at the moment.  If there were an absolute necessity for it, I am sure an arterial grant would have been given to the county, but it has not been given, which denotes that it is not a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In Kerry we are trying to organise every section of our people into maximum productivity by way of tourism, fishing, and agriculture.  We need to have these small roads attended to immediately.  I ask the Minister, if he can, to make a special grant available to help us, and also to have the tourist grants channelled into the small roads, because I think it necessary that should be done.  Some of the roads which need to be done are the road from Incharoe, Glencar to Cloon; the road from Anagar Bridge to Dirreen, Aghatubrid and Cahirciveen; the road from Ventry Church to Dunquin; the Caher road, Castlegregory to Aughacashla; and the Staiguefort road.  All these roads need immediate attention.  I ask the Minister to do everything possible to channel the grants into those roads.</P>
    <P>In the small towns small shopkeepers are being put out of business. <Col N="554" /> They cannot do any repairs because if they do, their already high valuations will be doubled.  Those people make roughly £300, £400 or £500 a year out of their shops.  Legislation should be brought in to help them because they are an important part of the community, and they get very little out of any grants that are going.  The Minister should bring in legislation at some future date to help that type of person.</P>
    <P>I want to express to the Minister the thanks of the people of Kerry for the job he has done towards alleviating the lot of the small farmers who are in no position to help themselves.  That is an innovation, and it is a worthy scheme, and I want to convey the thanks of my constituents to the Minister for bringing it in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall emulate the last speaker in trying to keep my remarks as brief as possible so that other Deputies can take part in the debate.  At the outset, I want to say it seems to me that the time has been reached when we should consider a radical overhaul of our whole system of local government.  That system is now built on mistrust.  There is a lack of trust in the elected representatives on the local authorities.  Their powers have been whittled away.  They have little real power, although they may exercise some influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lack of trust in the officials of the local authorities because they are subject all the time to the Department of Local Government.  Their initiative is curbed and their activities circumscribed by the requirements of our present legal framework, which requires practically everything to be referred back to the Department of Local Government.  There is a lack of confidence in the Department of Local Government on the part of the Department of Finance, because everything has to be then transferred to the Department of Finance for final sanction. So our whole system of local government which has developed over the years in a pragmatic way, without any clear principles involved, is built on this lack of trust.  Responsibility has become diffused, with resulting in <Col N="555" /> efficiency, and resulting delays of which we are all aware, and necessary progress is retarded.</P>
    <P>Why should it take perhaps three or four years for a compulsory purchase order to be considered by the Minister and his Department?  Why should the housing drive in the city of Dublin be held up because, as the City Manager stated recently, it may take five years between the time a compulsory purchase order is first considered until it is in effective operation, and sometimes double that length of time, and all sorts of sanitary works and development works which are initiated at a local level are delayed and hindered? It is not, I believe, from any malevolence on the part of any official but because of the system which has developed over 100 years and which breeds inefficiency, encourages delays and retards progress.</P>
    <P>We have had a remarkable example of this in relation to the housing situation because in fact the Minister has power to delay housing but he has no power to initiate it, and over the past few years there have been one or two statements by the responsible Minister wishing that local authorities had done more but deploring the fact that he could not do anything further.  Surely that is an example of the whole situation which calls for a radical overhaul of this system of local government which has developed over the years?</P>
    <P>It is, of course, to be expected in this debate that a considerable amount of attention should be given to the problem of housing.  It is not unique for us on this side of the House to raise the problem of housing, this year or last year, or the year before that for that matter.  The problem of housing has been raised by us every year since this Government took office because we were pointing out, particularly those of us from the city of Dublin, what was happening and it is not with hindsight that we now refer to the difficulties in which the Corporation find themselves.  We pointed out in past years, and before the houses started to fall down, that a housing crisis of very serious proportions was <Col N="556" /> developing.  I wish that the apparent sense of urgency indicated in the Minister's speech yesterday had been evidenced some years before but it was absent and remarkably absent.</P>
    <P>I want to give a quotation which I have given before and for which I make no apology for repeating because in this quotation we find the answer to the whole housing problem in Dublin and elsewhere.  It is taken from the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> November, 1958 and it was in paragraph 7 of this Programme, which is the official Government policy, that their policy of allowing a decline in social capital investment was set out. The paragraph reads:</P>
    <P>The social capital investment of past years has given us an &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; of housing, hospitals, communications, etc., which is equal (and in some respects, perhaps, superior) to that of comparable countries.  What is now required is a greater emphasis on productive expenditure which, by increasing national output&mdash;particularly of goods capable of meeting competition in export markets&mdash;will enable full advantage to be taken of that infrastructure and in due course make possible and, indeed, necessitate its further extension.</P>
    <P>Here is the vital part&mdash;</P>
    <P>The expected decline in social capital expenditure in the coming year will afford an opportunity&mdash;and underlines the necessity&mdash;of switching resources to productive purposes.</P>
    <P>So it was expected in 1958 that social capital investment was going to decline and that was clearly indicated to mean housing, and housing not just in Dublin but throughout the whole country declined.</P>
    <P>One would not think it was the same Government that issued that statement and then yesterday through the responsible Minister referred to the fact that there were now 70,000 houses outside Dublin and Cork that were unfit, and 30,000 of those totally unfit.  Recently we spoke about economic planning.  That is what we criticised the Government for.  This <Col N="557" /> is just a lack of planning.  As I say, the sense of urgency which perhaps to some small extent was apparent in the speech yesterday was absent in other years.  As I said also, we have raised this matter in other years.  In July, 1961, in the debate on the Minister's Estimate, this matter of housing was raised and on 6th July, 1961, in volume 191, at column 478 of the Official Report the Minister said that:</P>
    <P>... the last four years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that was the last four years of his Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>have made a radical change in the situation, and that the serious situation in which we found ourselves in the latter part of 1956 and the beginning of 1957 is now gone.</P>
    <P>So that in 1961 the view was that the serious situation of four years previously had gone and things were more or less all right.  Again I make no apology for quoting the figures for housebuilding in Dublin: 1,564 houses were built in 1956-57 and 392 were built in 1961-62.  When I say &ldquo;houses&rdquo;, I include both flats and houses.  The year 1956-57, according to the Minister, was the serious year, the year in which the difficulties arose and in 1961 they were all right.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary to labour the situation in Dublin now.  It is appalling. The social conditions in which thousands of our people are living are a disgrace to a Christian community. We have old people who do not understand why, when they have been living for 50 years in one flat in the middle of the city, they suddenly find themselves in a barracks.  We have old people who may be more fortunate and get an offer of accommodation and then find themselves at the top of an old decrepit slum dwelling owned by the Corporation and known as substandard in the Corporation's terminology.</P>
    <P>These are the things that are happening. We have families split up, husbands and wives split up and their marriages broken, sometimes irretrievably, because of the housing situation. If we are angry and concerned about <Col N="558" /> these things, it is because we have them and we know these problems every day of the week and we have been raising them and trying to get something done and have been failing.</P>
    <P>I do not want to enter into any argument with any councillor, any member of the Corporation as to the responsibility of Dublin Corporation for this, because, as I have said before, it is not the responsibility of the Corporation; it is the result of Government policy, bad planning and inadequate examination of their affairs.  This is why we criticised the Government and why we are criticising them now. Anything that can be done to improve the housing situation should be done. I was present at a debate a few weeks ago in which a representative of the Government said that one of the things that were holding up the housing drive was the shortage of technicians and skilled craftsmen.  I should like to know if that is so and it would be important for the Minister to inform us whether or not the housing drive in Dublin and elsewhere is being held up because they cannot get the craftsmen, carpenters, plasterers and other skilled men who are needed.  If that is the fact, and may be it is the fact, then obviously something drastic must be done about it.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why we should be erecting fine office buildings for ourselves outside these walls, if, in fact, we are taking the skilled craftsmen away from where they are more urgently needed.  This year there are proposals for extensive building by the Board of Works of Government offices and public works of one kind or another.  They can wait three or four years, if necessary, so that we can have the men and resources allocated to where they are urgently needed.  If we cannot get them from the public sector, then we should ensure that the private sector building is such that luxury buildings and offices are not erected if they are taking manpower which is urgently needed in other parts of the economy, particularly the housing of the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    <P>This is commonsense.  If the Parliamentary <Col N="559" /> Secretary who said that the other day was wrong, if, in fact, there is no shortage of skilled workmen and a shortage of manpower is not holding up the building drive, what I say does not matter, but if in fact it is so, then surely the Minister should ensure that we stop building a block of offices for the Department of Social Welfare and stop further work by the Board of Works on erecting offices and other types of unnecessary buildings until this housing problem has been dealt with.</P>
    <P>There are at present 500 applications in Dublin from newly-weds, 1,000 people who have recently been married and who want a house from the Corporation.  They have nowhere to go and they have about as much chance of getting a house from the Corporation in the next four or five years as they have of flying to the moon.  What about old people?  It seems to be extraordinary that the problem of old people has been ignored.  We have certainly built flats and houses but we make only 20 or 30 available in a year for single old people, families of two, two old people living together or an old person and a son or daughter.  All this sort of planning requires urgent consideration and our criticisms of the Government are all the more real because we have raised them time and time again and have got nowhere.</P>
    <P>One of the measures that could be taken to ease the housing situation is in the realm of house purchase schemes.  A great number of tenants of the Dublin Corporation would like to buy their own houses.  A great number of would-be tenants of the Corporation would prefer to go into a purchase house.  The difference between their weekly repayments by way of mortgage, interest, rates and the rent which they would pay to the Dublin Corporation is not all that great.  A large number of them would willingly bear it but one of the things people cannot get is the deposit in order to allow them go into a house purchase scheme, and for the sake of £100 or so, they become tenants of the Corporation instead of owning their own houses or, <Col N="560" /> alternatively, they go on to the waiting list.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that, if necessary, interest-free loans should be given of the deposit so that this legal formality&mdash;because in many instances that is all it is&mdash;can be overcome. If houses could be provided under the purchase scheme without the necessity for this deposit or if a scheme could be devised by which it could be given to intending purchasers, this would alleviate the pressure on Dublin Corporation.  It would not cost the Government very much and it would make a great deal of difference to the persons concerned and to the housing problem generally.</P>
    <P>Planning in the city of Dublin has been deplorable.  The planning of new housing estates that have been created has been deplorable.  Reference was made here during Question Time to the situation in Finglas where there are now 14,000 people living in a new housing estate with nine shops and it has taken years and years of pressure to get these extra shops built.  There were no playing fields provided, no library provided.  There is no proper medical centre.  We talk of community centres but there is no such thing as a community centre.  There has been one library built on the north side of the city of Dublin since the war.  There is a site in Cabra which has been there for 20 years and when you ask what it is for, you are told: &ldquo;That is for the library&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The provision of amenities for the citizens has been deplorable.  One responsible member of a tenants' organisation said to me: &ldquo;It is a degrading thing to be a tenant of the Corporation.&rdquo; He was not being unduly sensitive or unreasonable.  He was stating the fact that these tenants in the Corporation areas find themselves in great difficulty when they come up against the officials, not through any fault of the individual official concerned but because of the system they are operating. These tenants are at a great loss for the amenities they seek in the outer areas of the city.</P>
    <P>There are many other things I should like to discuss but I shall leave <Col N="561" /> them there because of the shortage of time, but it does seem to me, as has been pointed out before, that the Minister's Department is one of the most important Departments in the State. He has circumscribed himself by the laws under which he is operating.  He has no power to get the Corporation to build houses.  The Corporation's exercise of the power to build houses is delayed by the Minister's Department through the system under which he functions.  The local representatives who are elected have themselves no power to get the houses built, apart from the influence and pressure they can bring to bear.  The whole system, which this housing crisis has brought to light and which many other aspects of local government illustrate, is one that needs to be radically overhauled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister is to look into the question of rates because, especially in the counties on the western seaboard where the rates are high, the people who have not got the minimum valuation find it very difficult to pay these rates.  Therefore, if the Minister could look into the whole question he would have the gratitude of the people on the western seabaoard.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be very pleased with the success of the water supply schemes.  In my county anyway, in Kerry, it is very difficult all the time to spot people wanting extensions.  At the beginning when the piped water schemes were mooted, many people said: &ldquo;We have always drawn water from the well; we do not want piped water.&rdquo;  Now when they see piped water and their friends can turn on a tap, they come to the county council in a deputation imploring them to extend the water to their areas.  I think that is a very good sign because nothing is so useful in a house as a supply of water by turning on a tap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get to the housing question, a greater number of council houses have been built this year than in previous years.  They are well designed and they all have water and sewerage.  The housing situation has been greatly relieved by the number of people who are building their own houses.  The <Col N="562" /> Department of Local Government draw up the plans.  I think there are something like seven or eight plans for people who want to build their own houses.  I should like to ask the Minister if he could have more plans available for those people, and not to have the plans so elaborate.  I am always glad when anyone anxious to build a new house is prepared to build according to the Department's plan, if he is borrowing money.  These people are certain, if they build under a Department plan, that they will not be turned down.  I often find instances where they get into difficulties with the architect who designs the house.  The application goes to the Department and it is found that something is wrong. Then it is sent to the person who is to build the house and he is told to have it rectified.  Then it goes to the engineer or whoever designed the house.</P>
    <P>All these things take time and the person who is building the house gets agitated because the contractor is waiting to start building work and somebody else in turn wants him to build, and so on.  That is why the plans sanctioned by the Department are very valuable.  However, some of them are very elaborate and many people who are not so well off find them so elaborate that they would prefer to spend a few more pounds and get a local person to draw up the plans. If, in the case of three-roomed and four-roomed houses, the Department would draw up more plans, I think they would find a ready sale for them.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to roads, about which my colleague, Deputy O'Connor, spoke.  I am particularly interested in one arterial road, the road from Cork into Kerry.  It is a very important road.  It leads into Killarney and Kerry generally, which is, I suppose, the principal tourist area in the country.  One part of this road becomes flooded at Glenflesk.  This is a serious problem because the water often rises to six feet, with the result that no car can travel through it.  Unless a notice is put up at Macroom, 20 miles away, a person who does not know the road goes on to Glenflesk and then has to go back 20 miles.  There is no other <Col N="563" /> roadway.  There are no roads over the mountains and this is the only way by which a person can come into the Kerry area.  The Minister will soon be asked for a major grant for that road as it will have to be re-aligned.  It cannot be raised because it would have to be raised eight feet.  It will have to be re-aligned and I hope the Minister will give it very sympathetic consideration because it is an important road. It is not so much a matter of the stretch of road, but the expense involved because it has to be cut through a high hill.</P>

      <P>I listened for a while to Deputy D. Costello.  While I am prepared to admit that he is an able young man, and I am sure we could do with more like him in the House, when it comes to a subject about which he only reads, then I hold he is appealing to an ignorant audience. I am not ignorant on these matters, but others may accept what he says. That is why his leader, Deputy Dillon, is always harping on things about which he is ignorant.  He knows the people outside are equally ignorant about this subject and that he has a good chance of putting it over on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall get down to the business of how many houses this Government has built.  Provided the money is given by the Government, I do not think the building of houses is the responsibility of any Government. There is a housing committee in every county and it is they who initiate the building.  It is they who decide that houses or flats should be built and it is from the housing committee the ball rolls.  Building is initiated nowhere else but in the housing committee and, so long as the money is there, there is no hold-up. As I said before, and as can be proved, the only time there was no money was during the last years of the Coalition Government.  At that time the banks lent the money and they said they had no money to lend.  It was because of this shortage of money that 1,200 workers were dismissed in the last year of the life of the Coalition <Col N="564" /> Government.  One-half of the men employed on preparing ground for future development were sacked.  That was the position.  So long as the money is there, the whole responsibility is on the local housing committee.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention some figures and then I shall pass on to what I have to say.  I have the official Dublin Corporation handbook of 1964.  It states that the number of dwellings handed over in 1953-54, from March to March, was 1,922.  These were handed over, goods delivered.  That was due to the efforts, if you like, of the Fiánna Fáil Government.  I do not consider it a matter for any Government but, if you like to put it that way, it was thanks to the work of this Government that that number of houses were handed over.  In 1956-57, that is, the last year of the Coalition Government, the number dropped to 1,564.  In the following year, 1957-58, the number dropped to 1,021 and in 1958-59 it dropped to 460.</P>
    <P>Now, it must be remembered that it takes two years to build a house.  It takes a year for site development and for planning and another year for the plans and tenders to be advertised and accepted.  Therefore, it takes two years to build a house.  If one examines the problem in that light, one will see the arduous work involved in handing over 1,922 dwellings in the year the Coalition Government took office.  The fact that so many houses were built and handed over in that year was due to the work of the Housing Committee and of the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government. The number dropped to 460 in 1958-59, due to the lack of planning in 1956-57.  Therefore, there was a complete collapse in the years following 1957.</P>
    <P>There are ten Fine Gael members on the Corporation who can dispute that if they wish.  I suggest that we should forget who built what and get down to arguing why we have a problem at all at the moment.  It is said of politics that the more often you say a thing, the more you will be believed. Fine Gael say this as often as they can and I shall contradict them as often as I can, when I could be much <Col N="565" /> better occupied saying something constructive.</P>
    <P>I am told by the dangerous buildings authorities that there are 129,786 dwellings&mdash;not houses but family units &mdash;in the city.  Of these, 22,204 dwellings had been built by 1860.  One-third of those would be tenements, more than 100 years old.  The rehousing of those 22,204 families was as much a problem of the Coalition Government and the Cumann na nGaedheal Government as of the Housing Committee or the Fianna Fáil Government.  It was a problem for the State from the time we won our independence.</P>
    <P>The fact is that all Governments and successive Corporations neglected this problem.  They allowed the tenements to grow old from neglect.  Whether they built houses or not, they did very little about the demolition of those 22,000 dwellings which has been built before 1860.  Consequently, the Corporation of this year are trying to do the work of Corporations and Governments of the past 42 years, and we are being kicked on the shins for trying to do the job which was the responsibility of previous Corporations, previous Governments, from the day the State was founded.</P>
    <P>I suggest that 200 of these old houses should have been demolished each year since 1922.  Had that been done, there would not be so many houses for demolition now, completely unfit for human habitation.  We are now doing the work of the slackers of 40 years.  We cannot house at once all the families on the waiting list.  Unfortunately, they must suffer for a while because of the slackers who were on the job during the past 42 years.</P>
    <P>I have the figures here.  Despite the fact that 22,000 Dublin families had been living in tenements of more than 100 years of age, in 1956-57 only 25 of the tenements were demolished.  In the past year, we have demolished 800.  In a nutshell, the dirty work which should have been done by the slackers during the past 40 years has been thrown over on us.  We realise we cannot house all the families on the waiting list and living in dangerous buildings at once, <Col N="566" /> but for the work we have been doing, the members of the Housing Committee deserve gold medals and a month's holiday on the Riviera.</P>
    <P>During the past year, the Housing Committee met 33 times and no meeting was shorter than three hours. Fine Gael should be ashamed of themselves. Recently a group of six members from the Housing Committee went to the continent to inspect system building.  Not one of that group was a Fine Gael member because none of the Fine Gael members attended meetings. There was a little &ldquo;nark&rdquo; later and one Fine Gael member was picked from the City Council, not by the Housing Committee.</P>
    <P>I hear all this tripe from Fine Gael and you must excuse me, Sir, if I get excited.  This is the capital city and we naturally have countrymen coming up here.  We do not go down the country&mdash;they come to us.  One-third of the people living in Dublin are from the country and we will have a housing problem while we are looking after the whole country.</P>
    <P>Despite this, I do not believe there will be a housing problem here in two years because of our planning and our development work.  We can expect that 500 houses a year will be erected two years hence through system building and traditional building.  Why are so many families looking for houses at once?  We in the Housing Committee have had to do the backlog of work neglected by the slackers since 1922.  As well, it is a fact that can be proved that during a period of two years, there was a rush out of this country.  In 1959 and 1960, there was good money to be earned in England and there was a rush over there of Dublin families.  People were able to earn £20 or £25 a week in overtime. Because of that rush, no one would take a house.  According to information given to Deputy Ryan by the housing manager, in a given day there were 170 houses vacant at that time. The ratepayers were in a panic over the cost of maintenance of those vacant houses.  You could not give houses away at that time.</P>
    <P>Then something happened in England. The Rent Restrictions Act authorised <Col N="567" /> land owners to treble their rents, to charge £5 and £6 a week for a single room.  Our people who had left began the march back.  Since 1960, 1,000 families have returned and 3,000 families who would normally have left did not go, probably due to the prosperity at home.  Between the 1,000 who came back and the 3,000 who did not go, the crowd coming up from the country and the backlog of work which the slackers of the past 42 years left to us, we in the Housing Committee deserve gold medals and a month on the Riviera for the work we have been doing.  Instead, we get kicks on the shins from ignorant people who know no better.  It is all based on the policy that the public do not know and therefore that a lie will serve as good as the truth.  I shall rebut what they say all the time.  They say it does not matter, that they will say differently again and the crowd will believe them.</P>
    <P>On the tinker question, I raised the problem on the Estimate for the Department of Education, thinking it was a job for that Department.  It has been made the responsibility of the Department of Local Government.  The Minister for Local Government has been asked to provide sites for tinkers.  I wonder whether it is better to provide sites in that way or to send the children to industrial schools and by that means end the tinker problem.  I believe in the latter proposal.  I do not think that having sites around the cities will do anything but worsen this tinker problem. It certainly will not end the ignorance of the children and the wholesale begging and fighting that goes on from one end of the day to the other.  Why it should be permitted to continue in this civilised age I do not know.</P>
    <P>I was in Templeogue the other day and a horse and cart came along filled with rotten rags and mattresses and five children under six years of age were sitting among all the dirt.  One child had a mass of sores on his face. They were tinkers.  This is what we permit.  I believe there should not be sites without the other side of the question being examined.  All those <Col N="568" /> children should be compelled to attend school.  They should be made attend an industrial school and taught a trade there as well as being given an education.  When that is done, I believe that those people may have a different outlook on life.  They may then want to live normally and to take a municipal dwelling.  We put quite a number of them into dwellings but they ran out of them.  Of course, because of their ways, the neighbours will not hear tell of them.  I should like something to be done about this important matter.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister not so much to press for the provision of sites as to deal with the problem in an effort to arrive at a permanent and satisfactory solution.  I do not want to see the problem perpetuated.  These tinker children should be put into an industrial school.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary thing that I have had reason to appeal to the Minister for Education to allow a couple of children out of an industrial school.  They were taken into custody for no reason other than that they left their school at the age of 14 and did not wait for the end of the school term. If the Minister for Education is prepared to go so far with children who have had a normal education as to put them into an industrial school, it beats me why children can roam around the countryside in rags, begging and ignorant and loitering around publichouses. The Minister's responsibility is to provide sites but the whole question should be re-examined.</P>
    <P>Members of the Corporation feel that a local authority should have power to spend certain moneys on the repair of old dwellings so that the number of dwellings being demolished might be lessened and we would have a breather, so to speak.  The practice at the moment would appear to be that if a dwelling needs serious repairs, the owner is so informed.  Unless he indicates within a week that he will carry out the repairs, a demolition order is sought.</P>
    <P>In a great many cases, the owners have not the means because nowadays repairs are costly.  When an owner of limited means compares what he is <Col N="569" /> asked to spend with the value of the tenement or building, he will not agree to do the work and that is the real reason so many houses are being demolished.  In nine cases out of ten, the owner got a notice saying that certain repairs were to be carried out by a certain date and because the owners said they could not afford to have repairs carried out, and took no action, the Corporation had then to follow up with a demolition order and to remove it all.</P>
    <P>It would ease the problem somewhat if local authorities had power to spend a couple of hundred pounds to remove the danger, if it is not serious.  In some cases it may be very serious but in other cases an expenditure of a few hundred pounds would remove the danger.  It seems that local authorities have no power except to prop up a place.  They have not power to spend money on other people's property.  If a landlord refuses to carry out repairs, in my opinion, it is an admission that he is prepared to accept demolition. There should be some legislation whereby the local authority would have power to take possession and not to pay the owner anything except site value because the building will be demolished.</P>
    <P>The local authority should have power to spend, in moderation, a few hundred pounds which might extend by another five or ten years the life of the building and thus ease this terrible problem with which we are faced.  So long as the owners refuse to carry out repairs the Corporation have no alternative but to get the demolition order. That is the real reason there are so many demolition orders this year as compared with other years.  In any other year, they took chances.  They knew the dwellings were bad but they took chances because they were trying to house the families on the list.  However, because houses fell, the dangerous buildings people refuse to take any more chances.  That is the problem.</P>
    <P>Councillors cannot interfere with the dangerous buildings inspectors who say, in effect: &ldquo;That is coming down; you will blame us if the house falls&rdquo; and public representatives can do nothing <Col N="570" /> about it.  We raised the question a number of times: &ldquo;Why not go in yourselves and raise a few hundred pounds for the work?&rdquo; The answer is that there is no power.  If some legislation were rushed through, we might save some of the houses for another five, ten or 15 years, which would give us breathing space.  All we want is time.</P>

      <P>I want to say a few words about road safety.  I know the Minister has given a certain amount of thought to this subject.  The road safety campaign should be stepped up considerably.  The Press, radio and television should be employed to a greater extent in this connection. If the Minister and his colleagues, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, had a conference on this question, I am sure that he and the Minister for Education could work out a system whereby a certain amount of time would be allowed each week or each month in the national schools for the teaching of the rules of the road to children.  I know a number of teachers who are very good at this work but they have a very extensive curriculum to cope with and it is not easy to fit it in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Driving through my constituency, I find that 9.30 a.m. and 3 p.m. are literally nightmare times.  There are children on the right and on the left.  When one is about to pass them, they dither and then scurry across at the last minute.  It is not fair to the drivers or to the children.  I am appalled when I open my paper each morning to read of those who are killed on the road. Appeals have been made to people to drive carefully.  I feel that many road accidents are caused by sheer bad manners and speeding.  Why is it that a normally well-mannered man or woman forgets his or her manners when sitting behind a wheel and drives madly around the country?  The Minister should have conferences with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, about this matter and the penalties should be stricter for dangerous and careless driving.  Perhaps that is not a popular thing to say but the number <Col N="571" /> killed in this small country every year is appalling.</P>
    <P>We were asked not to speak at great length because of the number of Deputies who wish to contribute to this debate but I should like to mention the problem of water and sewerage in my constituency.  The regional water scheme is progressing very slowly.  It is a shocking indictment that, after 45 years of native Government, there are still so many people in the country without water.  Perhaps the trouble lies in the fact that the Minister and the members of his Department are practically all men. If he were a housewife and had to run his house for a fortnight without water, he would then give top priority to water and sewerage.  Life in the country is difficult enough for a young housewife with a couple of children, but without water, it is practically impossible.  I do not blame them for emigrating to Britain.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the group schemes are progressing so slowly. There are a number of schemes in my constituency.  I do not want to mention them individually.  The initial work has been done.  People have spent time and energy on making the drains and on doing all the initial work, but the schemes are now held up at both local and Government level.  This is a pity.  When people go to the bother of getting together and organising group schemes of this sort, they should get top priority in the Department.  I appeal to the Minister to look into this matter.</P>

      <P>In his introductory statement, when presenting this Estimate, the Minister dealt at some length with the question of housing, by both private persons and the local authorities. We were all pleased to hear that the preparation of the new Housing Bill is well advanced but I think it is very unfair to leave people in doubt for so long.  The old Act expired last October.  It is now June and we have not yet had a continuing Bill.  The Minister, of course, announced the main proposals for increased housing grants for farmers, those who are <Col N="572" /> anxious to build and those who have actually built, but many of these people are not assured by statements from either Ministers or county managers; they want to know what the law is and apparently there is no law at present covering the payment of housing grants for farmers at the new rates.</P>
      <P>The Minister also announced that housing grants will be paid to those who started work on or after 1st October 1963, and, where there was any doubt, the person concerned was asked to make an affidavit.  That is an invitation to commit fraud because if there is any doubt, I have no doubt when, according to the affidavit, the work would start.  It is not fair to put such temptation in the path of applicants.  A similar way and one that would avoid fraud would be to pay grants at the appropriate new rates to those who received no Government grant or instalment of such grant on or before 1st October.  In County Galway some years ago when we were left discretionary power in this matter by a Housing Act, we decided on that policy and so avoided affidavits or declarations from people, many of which we had very good reason to suspect were not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister recently announced in regard to private building that he was prepared to increase the maximum allowance that could be borrowed under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts from £2,000 to £2,500. That is a move in the right direction but if there is no increase in the income limit of £1,040, he is offering loans to people who will be unable to make repayments as a result of the income bar.  If you borrow £2,250 from a county council and your income is in the region of £1,000, you will have to pay back more than one-sixth of your income in loan repayments and charges.  That is the principle governing differential rents&mdash; that no tenant should be asked to pay one-sixth of his income in rent.  You are now making loans to people who will be asked to pay more than one-sixth of their income in loan repayments. That is completely divorced from reality and the Minister should <Col N="573" /> have a hard look at the income bar he has set because money values and income limits are changing from day to day and there has been a ninth round wage increase.</P>
    <P>The same applies to supplementary grants for those who are covered by the £832 income limit.  Those in receipt of £832 who are otherwise qualified for supplementary grants are debarred by statute from receiving them.  That figure was introduced with the last Housing Bill and there have been several income modifications since then.  That figure should also be reconsidered and adjusted upwards.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister has been encouraging local authorities to purchase suitable lands and develop sites to help people requiring sites to build their own houses.  Great difficulties are arising in the purchase of sites. In my town which was once described by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon, as &ldquo;a remote settlement in the west of Ireland&rdquo;, housing sites are costing up to £1,150.  That is no incentive to anybody to build his own house.  Over the past couple of years, the Minister, by circular letter and public statements, has encouraged local authorities to buy suitable land and develop it and then let, lease, or sell sites to private individuals.  Many local authorities are not taking advantage of that concession.  Only quite recently we availed in Galway of our powers of voluntary purchase.  The Minister should encourage more of them.</P>
    <P>A new feature the Minister recently announced is the scheme whereby farmers with a land valuation of under £5 will be housed at the expense of the local authority.  I note in the Minister's statement he proposes to make that concession applicable to houses or cottages built by local authorities on or after 1st of October last.</P>
    <P>Coming to the question of local authority housing proper, there are one or two problems which were briefly referred to by the Minister and with which I want to deal.  The matter of the vested cottage has been brought officially to the notice of the Minister <Col N="574" /> by the General Council of County Councils and by resolutions passed at local authority meetings.  Many county councils find it very difficult to regain possession of vested cottages that have been vacated, particularly when the owner dies without leaving any heir or when the owner leaves the country and nobody knows where he is.  It is impossible, particularly in the type of case I have mentioned, to serve statutory notice for recovery on the owner of a vested cottage and consequently the cottage becomes derelict and falls into ruin.  This is very hard on people living in the locality and waiting to be housed if they see the derelict house there for a long period. I ask the Minister, when he is introducing the new Bill, to take cognisance of this matter which has been brought to his notice already by others.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of making purchase orders to encourage people to buy out their own cottages.  The procedure at present is loose, involved and cumbersome.  Part of it consists of the publication of the vesting order notices in money order offices in the county towns which must be done twice.  When there are, as in Galway, over 100 money order offices, that publication on two occasions is a deterrent to the local authority to encourage the people to purchase their cottages. Consideration should be given to that matter in the preparation of the new Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the 1936 Housing Act, it is possible to get permission to build extra accommodation on to a cottage but the people are prohibited from mortgaging their cottages for that purpose. When families go to secure the financial aid which they require to build another house on their plot of land, they find that they are precluded from mortgaging that property.  That matter could also be dealt with in the new Bill.</P>
    <P>I was rather amazed to hear Deputy Mrs. Hogan-O'Higgins asking the county councils and others to go ahead with water supply schemes, particularly in County Galway where many of the supporters of Deputy O'Higgins' Party opposed such schemes two or <Col N="575" /> three years ago in common with the reactionary groups in the farming organisations who, at the time, came on deputations to Galway County Council and asked us not to go ahead with schemes of this kind as they would make our council bankrupt.  It is a change of heart which I also welcome.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the group scheme.  This old chestnut is trotted out on all occasions as a substitute for water supply schemes.  There has been only one group scheme brought to fruition in Galway in the past two years.  It is very difficult to get people to join together to seek financial aid for such group schemes. One of the critics once said to me that in parts of rural Ireland the people would not join in the saying of the Rosary, let alone join in a group scheme.  The group schemes are all right if you could get the people to band together in them but who is going to maintain them?  The ultimate responsibility falls on the county council.</P>
    <P>My colleague rightly stressed the importance of the road safety campaigns conducted by the Minister twice in the past year and also by the Safety First Association of Ireland.  The Minister for Education, when introducing his Estimate, referred to the fact that he had set up an interdepartmental committee consisting of representatives of his Department, the Department of Local Government and the Department of Justice.  Beyond that reference to the establishment of that committee, I heard no more about it but the old system which obtained in Dublin when I was teaching here 20 years ago could be revived with advantage.</P>
    <P>In those days, a member of the Garda Síochána who was trained to give lectures to children called once or twice monthly to the national schools and addressed the pupils, telling them about the rules of the road and how they could and should protect themselves going to and coming from school. For some reason that was discontinued. It certainly does not take place in the country schools.  In all my years teaching <Col N="576" /> down the country, I never had a Guard come in and tell the children about road safety.  That is something they could find time to do.  If they can collect statistics about tillage, about sheep dipping and all the other matters, surely some time could be found to help to save human lives and to start the children off on the right way.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Department and the local authorities generally on the wonderful improvement that has taken place in our main roads over the past few years.  In Galway, we are justly proud of our roads but other counties have roads which are just as good.  The Minister referred to a survey that is in progress for the reclassification of roads.  That is long overdue because many roads which in the past were regarded as secondary roads have now come into prominence for one reason or another.  I have in mind the road from Gort to my home town which, prior to the development of Shannon Airport, was rightly regarded as a secondary road.</P>
    <P>Since the airport became popular all the traffic to and from the north of Ireland, Monaghan, Donegal and some of the western midland counties has to go through Loughrea.  This road could now be classed as a main road and should so be classed so as to get the 100 per cent road grant. I would appeal to the Minister to use his good offices with a view to having the preparation of the new Housing Bill speeded up so as to provide redress for the few anomalies I have mentioned in regard to loans and supplementary grants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBarron" hpid="Mr. Barron Mr. Barron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barron</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most annoying to hear people who are not members and who do not know what is happening coming in here and criticising the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation.  I understand that even to-day a Deputy referred to the few Corporation members who are attending to the work of housing in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The City Manager will soon be retiring.  From the time that he was appointed Housing Officer, in 1948 or 1949, up to the time that he was appointed City Manager, four-fifths of the work of slum clearance in Dublin <Col N="577" /> had been done and one-fifth remained to be done when there was the unfortunate incident in Bolton Street. That incident was due to the fact that the Corporation has not power to see to it that any landlord who takes down a house has proper people in charge so that there would be no danger to the workers and no danger to the house beside that which is taken down.</P>
    <P>People have come in here to talk about the housing situation in Dublin. When people were put out of dangerous buildings on the north side of the city and would not take places in Finglas, but preferred to remain on the street, the Deputy who spoke here this morning about the few Deputies who are also members of Dublin Corporation who were here to speak on housing in Dublin, was the very first who, without knowing anything at all about the matter, got into the Press for the purpose of publicity.  It is most annoying to hear this kind of talk, which is solely for publicity purposes. With Deputy Sherwin, I am a member of the Housing Committee.  We are present at practically every meeting of the Housing Committee.  Since I became a member of the Corporation 14 years ago, I have missed only half a dozen meetings of that Committee.  I know what is happening and what is being done.  It is most annoying then to read newspaper comments or to have to listen to people condemning the Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>At the present time, Dublin Corporation is able to house families of three and over from dangerous buildings. The only difficulty is in housing single persons or couples.  There may be single persons living alone.  There may be childless couples.  There may be a brother and sister.  There may be two sisters.  At present the Corporation are not in a position to house such persons. They have done something in the matter.  They bought 200 caravans in order to ease the position.  In every scheme now 25 per cent of the dwellings will comprise either one or two rooms.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that members, in their own time and at their own <Col N="578" /> expense, attend the Housing Committee for fun instead of to look after the needs of the citizens.</P>
    <P>It just happened that those houses fell&mdash;the one in Bolton Street because of the reason I have given, and the one in Fenian Street because of the frost and rainy season followed by great heat.</P>
    <P>What have we done since?  What are we doing now?  Because of those incidents the people in charge of dangerous buildings will not take the risk and the responsibility of allowing people to live in dangerous buildings. Houses that could remain standing for another six, twelve or 18 months are being demolished.  I know a few of them that were closed six months ago which are still standing and the Corporation cannot do anything about it for the simple reason that they have no power to spend money, as Deputy Sherwin said, on private property.  If we as a local authority had power to do that, the position would be eased considerably.  I do not know if that power will be given or if it can be given.  When I asked about it on a former occasion I was told that we could have compulsory purchase but the procedure of compulsory purchase is very slow.  It takes two or three years before you can get the property.</P>
    <P>When houses are condemned and the landlords are not able to spend money on them they are bought up and small factories are built on the sites, whereas if the Corporation had the power they could demolish the houses and rebuild on the sites so that people could live in the city.  If that were done, attendances at schools and churches in the city would be maintained and shopkeepers would have a way of living.  In the case of shopkeepers, their overheads remain the same, their rates remain unchanged but their customers have gone to housing schemes on the outskirts of the city. If something were done along those lines it might be of help to the city.  I would prefer to see the houses that are demolished being rebuilt for the accommodation of people rather than that small, twopence-halfpenny factories should be built on these sites.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider in the <Col N="579" /> near future the question of giving power to the Corporation to take over immediately any of these houses, apart from houses that come under the name of dangerous buildings, but houses condemned as unfit for human habitation, so that the Corporation could demolish them and build on the sites.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to delay on the part of the Housing Committee and the Corporation.  I can say that there has been no delay at any time on the part of the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation or on the part of the council.  But, as I said on a former occasion, it does happen that there is delay in the Department.  The Department may not have sufficient officials.  I do not know.  I would suggest that if the professional men attached to the Corporation and the officials could meet their opposite numbers from the Custom House and discuss and determine plans, a great deal of time could be saved.  In fact, in the present emergency time was saved by cutting red tape.  The officials of the Corporation went down to the Custom House and it was arranged that contracts could be given to builders at the same rate as they had contracted for other work.</P>
    <P>There has been a Commission on Itinerancy.  We in the Corporation supported the plea that a site should be set aside near the city, where water and sewerage could be laid on, and that itinerants would be put in there when they came to the city.  The itinerants are in the city for only about three or four months of the year.  They are travelling around the country the rest of the time.  It is disgraceful to have the officials of the Corporation hunting them from place to place.  That should be stopped. I would ask the Minister to give the Corporation the authority to provide a site for these people.  Let them go in there under proper control when they are around the city.</P>
    <P>People avail of grants to repair their homes, but where there is no increase in the size of the dwelling the valuation should not be increased, but it is being increased after several <Col N="580" /> years.  I know several people who applied for the grant and who went to the Corporation and asked would the valuation be increased.  They were told it would not, but after seven years it was increased.  I should like the Minister to look into that matter.</P>
    <P>I do not represent a farming constituency but I do not think that should prevent me from saying something about farmers.  When a farmer has a stake in the country if he wants to build a house, a hayshed or outoffices, instead of getting a grant, he should get a loan free of interest or at one per cent.  There is something about grants I do not like.  I would prefer to have people stand on their own feet and be independent.  If they get money, let them pay it back and be the owners of their property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised to hear a Deputy from Longford-Westmeath thank the Minister for the increased road grants to his constituency for the coming year.  Far be it from me to begrudge increased grants to any constituency, but there is an obligation on me to point out the reduction that is taking place in the grants for Leitrim.  Unlike most other counties, Leitrim is made up of small farms.  There are 10,900 holdings in the county, and of these 10,000 are under £20 valuation.  I am sure the Minister will agree that today no farmer can exist on a valuation of £20 unless his income is supplemented. The only means he has of supplementing his income in that county is by road work.  Unfortunately, we have no industries, with the exception of one small one in Carrick-on-Shannon.</P>
      <P>It surprises me that last year's road grants were reduced by £8,800.  In 1962, our total road grants were £164,000; in 1963, they were £164,000; in 1964, they were £171,700 and in the current year they are £162,900.  That is a reduction of £8,800.  That means there will be less employment for the small farmer who is dependent on this employment for his existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone is the reduction that much; in fact, it is a slight bit more. In 1962, the wage was at the rate of <Col N="581" /> £6 16s. a week; in 1964 it was the same rate; but this year the rate is £7 10s.  This means that, with an increased wage and the reduction in the road grant, there will be much less employment for the farmers in the country.  Even at this stage, the Minister should look at the situation to see if it would be possible to give some grant.  For the past number of years we received a railway closing grant of £40,000.  That has been completely wiped out.  On a number of roads work has been started and half completed, because we have no money available, due to the withdrawal of the grant, to complete the work.  I would appeal to the Minister to restore the £40,000 railway closing grant.</P>
    <P>Unlike Dublin, in my constituency we have no great housing problem. Some Deputy said that 7,000 people were looking for houses in Dublin. Unfortunately, all the people who would be interested in getting houses in my constituency have emigrated, and the figures will prove that conclusively. However, we have a few problems in regard to housing grants. Some time last year the Minister increased housing grants to farmers by a substantial amount, but it surprised me and others that he did not increase the reconstruction grant.  As I said, my constituency is made up of rather poor people.  They cannot afford to build a new house, but with the aid of a reasonable grant from the Department, plus a supplementary grant from the local authority, they would be able to reconstruct their houses.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider giving increased reconstruction grants.</P>
    <P>There were a good many applications in my constituency from people who reconstructed their houses using either galvanised iron or asbestos sheeting.  The strange thing is that some of them have got grants and others have been rejected.  I admit they might have used the asbestos without the permission of the Department, but there would not be a great number.  I would appeal to the Minister to look at the files again and see <Col N="582" /> if he could give them some grant to help them pay their debts.</P>
    <P>I had a rather interesting experience the other day.  A man&mdash;not a farmer&mdash;told me he let a contract for the building of a new house at £2,875. Before the contract was signed and before the turnover tax was introduced the contractor came back and told him he would have to get another £130.  He agreed to pay the £130 but, before the work commenced, the wage increase of 12 per cent came along and the contractor came back for another £240.  That raised the cost of the house from £2,875 to £3,245, a total increase of £370 due entirely to the attitude of the Government, to say nothing of the substantial increases in the cost of building materials.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the house because there are other speakers to follow me, but I should like to repeat that I believe the Minister for Local Government should compel heavy vehicles to have some type of red light at the front box of the lorry just behind the cab, clearly visible to oncoming vehicles at night.  If my memory serves me correctly, the speed limit for heavily laden lorries is 35 miles per hour, even outside speed limit areas.  Last Thursday on my way home I followed a seven ton lorry carrying at least three tons.  It was travelling at about 60 m.p.h. Desperately strong action should be taken in these cases.</P>
    <P>The only other matter to which I wish to refer is the burden of rates. Farmers get some relief and we can all rest assured that they will be looking for further relief because they are finding it very difficult to meet the burden of rates.  People in towns are having a very rough voyage, particularly the old age pensioners who are trying to eke out an existence on their meagre pensions and pay rates. Some form of subsidy should be given to these people.  The small business people particularly the family grocer in the west who carries on a mixed business, is finding competition very keen because of supermarkets, and so on; the margin of profit has been substantially reduced <Col N="583" /> while the overheads have substantially increased.  The Minister should have a look at the amount of rates these people are paying and try to give them substantial reliefs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not detain the House very long but there are one or two matters on which I feel I should comment.  The Minister at the commencement of his speech gave the number of houses completed by local authorities during the past year as only slightly higher than the previous year. This is very disappointing.  I noted one or two matters in the Minister's speech which give ground for hoping that in the coming year the position may improve.  I note the Minister's personal intervention in the matter of holding consultations with building interests in relation to the adoption of new techniques and new systems.  I also note with particular interest his intervention in the matter of speeding up the building of houses in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Coming from a constituency in which there is a deplorable housing situation, it is only natural that I should have something to say on this particular problem.  On several occasions over the last two years I have referred here to the shocking housing situation in Limerick city.  I regret to say the position is even worse than it was last year or the year before. I do not want to be accused of exaggerating the position.  I believe in having facts and figures to sustain my argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in Limerick may be seen from the report on the housing of the working classes in Limerick city, a report produced some months ago at the request of the Limerick City Manager.  A survey was carried out of the needs of the city.  It was found that there are 1,335 families in need of rehousing.  In addition, there are 900 dwellings which are occupied but which are unfit for occupation.  We have a situation then in which roughly 1,400 families are seeking houses. What is the progress?  Some weeks ago I asked a number of questions including one seeking information as to the number of houses built by <Col N="584" /> Limerick Corporation in the financial years 1962-63 and 1963-64.  The Minister informed me that in 1962-63 50 houses were built by Limerick Corporation and in 1963-64 101 houses were built.  I have figures going back to 1956-57 when 200 houses were built.  In 1958-59 no houses were built.  In 1959-60 175 houses were built and in 1960-61 180 houses were built.  In 1961-62 no houses were built.  In the past six years a total of 434 houses was built in Limerick giving an average of 72 houses per year.  It is quite clear that, if there is not a substantial improvement in the annual output of houses, we will never solve the problem in Limerick.</P>
    <P>On 6th May I asked the Minister if he was satisfied with the progress being made by Limerick Corporation towards the solution of the housing problem and whether he would consider introducing emergency measures to deal with the problem.  At column 1137 of volume 209 of the Official Report the Minister said that he was not satisfied with the progress being made by Limerick Corporation and, with regard to the second part of the question, he said: &ldquo;I am not clear what the Deputy has in mind by emergency measures but I am very willing to take any steps open to me to assist the housing authority in overcoming their problems as quickly as possible&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Following publication of that reply the matter came up for discussion at a meeting of Limerick Corporation. Very strong views were expressed.  On the one hand, we have the answer given by the Minister that he was not satisfied with the progress made by Limerick Corporation and, on the other hand, we had the Corporation under the impression that they are not responsible for the position.  What is happening is that the blame is being passed from Limerick Corporation to the Minister and his Department, and back again.  In the meantime we have 1,400 families in urgent need of housing.  I ask the Minister to take immediate action, to do what he did in the case of Dublin Corporation, to exercise whatever powers he has to try to get this dreadful situation in <Col N="585" /> Limerick remedied.  I do not know whether it demands an inquiry or an investigation or whether consultations and round-table discussions should take place between the local authority and the Minister and his officials, but I urge the Minister to take action.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to group water schemes.  I have referred to these schemes on previous occasions on this Estimate.  I am one hundred per cent in favour of them.  In fact, before my entry into this House, I was closely associated with the organisation of those schemes.  It is only fair that credit should be given where credit is due, and credit should be given to Muintir na Tíre for pioneering this idea.  It is an excellent means of providing water for rural homes.  In the number of schemes with which I have been associated, we have not come across any insurmountable problems. There is one weakness in the matter of the organisation of the group schemes, that is, that there is possibly a need for more guidance from the Department.  There might perhaps be a case for appointing extra organisers to encourage local groups to undertake the work and to explain to them what it is all about.  I have certainly found&mdash;and I think it is the experience of Muintir na Tíre and every organisation which undertook the organisation of group water schemes&mdash;that where there is proper guidance from the beginning, and where proper advice is forthcoming, there is no difficulty whatsoever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been quite an amount of talk about housing during this debate.  We must look at the housing position on a constructive basis.  The Department have taken two years, 1961 and 1962, as a base.  Let us take the number of grants given in 1961 and in 1963.  Exactly double the amount given in 1961 was given in 1963.  In that way we see the concrete results of the grants given by the Department.  People have availed of them.  They are an incentive.  People have been encouraged to use them.  I always feel we should encourage people to do something they would like to do themselves.  When a person <Col N="586" /> has repaired an old house, it seems to give him and his family an uplift. Their environment is improved.  The Minister and his Department are to be complimented on giving these grants.</P>
      <P>In my constituency a large number of people are building their own homes.  A few years ago, they would have been thinking in terms of looking to the county council, but now they can buy plans from the Government Publications Office, designed by the Department of Local Government. Those plans are practical and quite easy to follow.  They have the added advantage that people can build their houses where they like.  Possibly there is a snag in getting a plot, but in the past year the Minister has permitted the subdivision of vested cottage gardens and that has provided sites for new houses.  The county councils are to build group schemes but in the country people like to live by themselves because they have always done so. They can get loans under the SDA, from the bank, or from any of a number of other sources and they can have a house for practically the same price as they would pay in rent per week if they got a house from the local authorities.  When people have provided their own homes, they feel they have achieved something.  They are much happier because they have the house they wanted and they have selected the site.  They have had a choice instead of just taking the luck of the draw.</P>
      <P>The new farm grants have been a tremendous incentive to the farming community.  In quite a number of cases, the one thing the small farmer could not provide for himself was a home.  These extra grants of up to £900 are a fair incentive to him to go ahead and build his own home.  No one will begrudge the small farmer getting a bigger loan or a bigger grant than anyone else in the community. His home must be near his holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite a number of skilled workers who went away to England in the past ten years are coming back.  I have had numerous requests from them about building new houses.  Many of them come back and rent a house or <Col N="587" /> stay with their parents while building their own house.  When they come back there is a ready source of employment in the building trade which is every bit as good as they can get abroad, particularly in England, and there is no Irishman who would not prefer to live at home than to live away from his native shores.  In that way the new housing grants are an incentive to people to come back and build their own homes.  That is concrete proof of the work that has been done by the Department, and their foresight over the past years.</P>
    <P>There are always a few criticisms one can make of every Department.  A Department is the same as ourselves &mdash;none is perfect.  I feel that town planning appeals are unnecessarily held up in the Department.  I would not mind delay of two or three months but at times it could be a year and some machinery should be devised to speed them up.  Where county councils are initiating a building scheme, such schemes are held up for too long. Deputy Sherwin said that it takes two years from the time a housing committee initiate a scheme until the houses are built.  In the country it is taking much longer than that.  We would be quite happy if it were a matter of only two years but very often it runs into four, five or six years before the houses are built.</P>
    <P>I see a great future for group water schemes and this is an aspect of the Minister's Department which I think could be pushed more.  Possibly more publicity could be used in this regard. It was very interesting to see the RDS exhibition this year of the group water scheme&mdash;I do not know in which county it was&mdash;providing water for a number of farms and homes in the particular area.  I think the difficulty is that people are afraid that if the electric pump fails or something else fails the whole scheme will fall down. If that fear could be overcome, there would be a large number of applications for group schemes.  They would snowball in the same way as applications for housing grants have in past years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> The schemes can be provided cheaply and they help to develop a community spirit as they get the people to come together and work together. We all know that there need be no such fear of a breakdown because usually the ESB looks after the pump, while in the case of a reservoir the chances of any failure are very remote. If in years to come piped water schemes are developed, they will link up with existing schemes.  The cost of a group scheme to the individual is far smaller than if he undertook a scheme himself.  I know people who have put in their own water schemes and received a grant and it cost them a lot more than if they had joined with their neighbours.  These schemes can run for up to one mile or a little more. I am interested in one scheme which runs for about a mile and a half and takes in 35 houses.  It is that type of effort that we would like to see.</P>
    <P>One aspect of housing which I omitted to refer to is in regard to SDA loans.  I am glad to see that the Minister is increasing the limit from £2,000 to £2,250.  He has realised that the cost of building houses has increased in the past year.  One aspect in which I should like the Minister to interest himself is in relation to county councils giving an SDA loan who always undervalue the house.  I have never seen a contractor building a house for the value which the county council architect put on it.  They are inclined to reduce the value by roughly 5/- a square foot less than a contractor could do it.  That is on average but it is often a lot more.  My feeling is that the county council are safeguarding themselves so that the loans will not be too high.  In some cases it is hindering the good work the Department have been doing, and if a more accurate value were ascribed to the house, it would be better because it is often difficult for those people to provide the ten per cent which they have to put up.  Reading the Act it seems grand but the manner in which it is put into operation is another matter.</P>
    <P>In regard to roads, we have seen what is possibly one of the first dual carriageways in the country being laid in my constituency.  The sooner it is <Col N="589" /> finished, the better, for it will certainly speed up traffic out of Dublin and certainly be of great benefit to all motorists travelling on it.  Another point is in regard to the taking over of roads by the county council.  I do not know how this matter can be overcome. These roads are going into rural homes.  The people in the homes have been there for generations; they are the backbone of the country, and something should be done, possibly by way of grant to the county council, to have these roads taken over.  There may be quite a number of families living on them and it is often difficult to get them to come together to provide money to have them taken over.  It is terrible to think of the conditions of these boreens, particularly in the winter months.  I have been down quite a number of them since I became a Deputy and I was amazed to see their condition.  The Department might consider some means whereby they could encourage county councils to take them over and thus give these people a decent approach to their homes.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to thank the officials in the Minister's Department and compliment them for the courteous manner in which they have dealt with my inquiries in the past year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If I deal with housing in Cork city again this year, as I usually do, I should like the Minister to realise that anything I say about housing in Cork is not really in particular but is of general application and applies to Limerick, Dublin and other centres with large populations.  The figures the Minister gave yesterday indicate that, no matter how far we have progressed, we have only scratched the skin of the problem which confronts us.  Frankly, from the regularity with which we have to stand up here to implore the Minister to encourage more local government building, I feel there is not the proper disposition in the Minister's Department. It is all very well for the Minister to say it is a matter for Cork Corporation, for Limerick Corporation or Dublin Corporation.  I think it <Col N="590" /> is a national problem.  It is a fundamental responsibility of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I believe if the Minister threw the same industry into encouraging local government building as he has into other things that are very praiseworthy, like the road safety campaign, we would not have to complain here year after year about the shortage of houses in our respective constituencies.  This year we built only 280 houses in Cork. A while ago Deputy T. O'Donnell had to complain about the fact that houses are not being built in his area.  In case there is any complacency about the fact that we built 280 houses in my constituency of Cork city this year, I want to remind the Minister that previously we built 490 houses in one year.</P>
      <P>The great difficulty about Departments or ministries is that they deal with these problems as statistics.  They are told from Cork city there are 1,500 families still awaiting housing. The Minister and the Department clap themselves on the back and say they have already housed 7,000 families or, worse, they thump their chest and use the very same words.  The situation is that there are more than 1,500 families looking for houses in Cork because so far the only statistics we have are those relating to people who are deemed by the local authority to be eligible.  The young people who are following the natural law of life, who are hoping to get married and settle down and rear families are not at the moment eligible for local government housing.  When that is considered as an aspect of our Christian society I often wonder if it would be more appropriate to put the adjective in inverted commas.  The Christian ideal is that the family is a fundamental unit of society.  A young man and woman settling down in married life should get every encouragement from the Minister and the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We pride ourselves on having got rid of the slums.  We have done no such thing in the city of Cork.  I do not know but I believe the situation is the same in Dublin.  What we have done is this: we have driven people out to what were formerly good <Col N="591" /> addresses.  We have done away with one slum to create other slums, with this very important difference, that we give them slum dwellings at what are known as flat prices.  In the city of Cork, people are paying as much as £2 or £2 5s. a week for what are undoubtedly slum dwellings.</P>
    <P>I know some other members of our Party wish to speak before the Minister gets in.  I merely want to point out the history of these houses in the better class districts.  These were houses which were built for better class people, for professional classes, and so on. They were big three-storey houses with an attic.  These people always had one or two servants and somebody to walk up the stairs and make the beds.  These houses have been converted into five, six and, in some cases, seven flats.  Would the Minister consider this?  When these houses were built&mdash;and they are still in the same condition&mdash;one bathroom was provided, maybe an outside toilet as well; one hallway was provided.  The whole planning was on the assumption that one unit of society would live there.  Now there are four, five or six families occupying these houses and mothers have to carry one baby in their arms and another in their womb up three or four flights of stairs, leave the pram and bring it up afterwards with the assistance of the husband.</P>
    <P>That is not hearsay.  That is not a figment of my imagination.  Those are the facts as I know them myself. Those are the facts as the Minister should know them.  The Department deal with the matter of houses in this country as a matter of statistics, one, two, three, four or five families, instead of getting somebody to etch in the fundamental tragedies that lie behind the statistics, to etch in the facts that are a standing reproach to the Minister and his Department and maybe a standing reproach to the local body to which I belong, the Cork Corporation.</P>
    <P>I had hoped we were getting down to a realistic appraisal of the situation in Cork Corporation a few years ago, when we built, as I said, 491 houses <Col N="592" /> in one year and 391 in another year. I believe that is the death of any incentive in the Corporation because we felt that we had done so well we could rest on our oars.  This is no time to rest on our oars.</P>
    <P>I want to bring to the Minister's attention as briefly as I can some quite important matters.  The Minister already appreciates there is a shortage of tradesmen in the building trade in Cork.  I believe there is a shortage of tradesmen generally.  Would the Minister consider what should get priority in the matter of the use of skilled tradesmen?  Is it more important, for instance, that luxury hotels should be built in Cork or that this House should be extended than that families living in the circumstances I have described and to which I can testify, should be properly housed? Eventually the Minister will have to make up his mind on this matter.</P>
    <P>I know these tradesmen are free to go where they like.  However, if the Department were to make it clear to tradesmen that in the Cork Corporation, the Dublin Corporation and various other bodies where direct labour schemes are in operation there would be continuity of employment over a long number of years and at no stage would their employment end suddenly, we might be in a position where we would not lose tradesmen to other undertakings.  If that does not succeed, some other measures should be taken.  What the measures are I do not know.  I have various suggestions myself but the Minister should take cognisance of this problem.  The shortage of tradesmen should not be allowed to interfere with the building of local authority houses.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer is of general application as well as of particular application to Cork city.  There is a tendency nowadays to provide car parks on the sites of what were originally working-class dwellings. These dwellings were taken down and acquired and I am quite certain they were acquired for the purpose of building other dwellings there. It is most important that the original intention of the local authority and the Department should be adhered to. <Col N="593" /> In these areas where there are car parks there are plenty of schools and plenty of churches.  Development costs would be at the very minimum. I commend that suggestion to the Minister and I would ask him to attend to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>): On every Local Government Estimate, one finds the Minister talking about the large amounts of money he is giving to each local body and, as usual, he has colleagues on the far side of the House who stand up afterwards to praise him for being a very generous fellow.  All these subventions which local bodies receive are in large measure an expression of the archaic monetary system under which local finances are run, that is, the rating system.  Our rates are based on valuations made over 100 years ago and in many cases these valuations have been spread out over a number of years. In some places revaluations have taken place.  Furthermore, the value of many of these properties has completely altered in the years past.  As a measure of value in the modern sense, many of the figures are completely obsolete.</P>
      <P>The main difficulties about rates based on the valuation system is that they are not properly related to the capacity to pay.  They are not related either to the family income or the family expenditure.  That may not matter so much perhaps to a man with a large income living in a small rated house.  He has perhaps no family and his main taxation may be income tax. However, it may mean a lot to a medium sized or large farmer.  It is probably his sole taxation system and to him a rating system which is not properly related to his income can be unjust and, in his eyes, would naturally seem unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the farming community in general, over the past ten or 11 years, their rates have steadily climbed.  Some assistance has been given in the last few years by way of rebate relating to agricultural land, but that was the last measure taken to relieve the mounting difficulties of the <Col N="594" /> farming community as regards rates. If you take the income of the four major classes of our society, you will find, for example, that in 1953 the domestic income from wages and salaries amounted to £218 million whereas in 1963 it had climbed to £370 million. Profits from agriculture and fishing in 1953 was £107 million and in 1963 it amounted to over £123 million. Similarly, industrial profits in 1953 were £26 million and in 1963, £48 million. &ldquo;Other income&rdquo; in 1963 was £54 million and in 1962, £87 million. In other words, there has been a considerable expansion of the income of other sectors of the community, whereas the farming community income has remained almost static and yet, in so far as county rates are concerned, they have continued to pay the major share of these rates.  In spite of the subventions given to them by way of agricultural grants, the farming community have suffered as against the rest of the community down through the years, both in respect of their income and in respect of rates.</P>
    <P>That is one aspect of it.  I know they get employment grants and food and housing grants but these are all <i>ad hoc</i> measures.  In short, if you examine the position at each county council meeting, it will be clear that the rates are not struck at the county council meeting but are struck down through the years.  Various meetings are held and various propositions are agreed to and money is passed.  Consequently, at the annual county council meeting, a figure is presented.  In other words, rates become an arbitrary levy on the community and the Minister for Local Government comes before the House and tries to level things out and introduce some kind of redistribution. He introduces his arbitrary subventions but there you have the unfortunate ratepayer trying to exist between an arbitrary levy placed on him by the local council and an arbitrary subvention coming to his aid from the Minister.  Altogether, it is an unsatisfactory system of taxation.</P>
    <P>There is a further difficulty with regard to rates applying between one county and another where there are great differences in valuation which of <Col N="595" /> necessity bring in very different incomes. Therefore, there is a danger, and it exists, of an inequality of surpluses when there is a poor county with less efficient services than another wealthier county.  Again, there are the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements of the Minister for Local Government trying to bring in a subvention for a tourist grant for the poorer county in order to try to give it equal services with the better off county.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the rating system as a form of financing services is inefficient.  It also introduces the question of valuation injustices.  If a man makes structural alterations in his premises without altering the size of the premises, his valuation may be raised.  It is raised irrespective of whether he is using the premises for business or for professional purposes. If a man is not using his house for business or professional purposes and he improves it without altering its geographical size, surely he has not increased his income?  Yet, in terms of rates, he has to pay more and if he is an income tax payer, his Schedule A scale is raised and he has to pay more there.  As regards rates, he is subject to increased payment, even though his income has not altered as a result of the alteration.  If he finally retires and occupies the same house, even though his income has gone down, he may still be subject to rising rates.</P>
    <P>I should like to appeal to the Minister to make some effort to introduce a more modern taxation system or, at least, to modify the existing system in order to make it more reasonable and more equitable.  I know it is not as easy to derate in this country as it is to derate in Britain.  As this is an agricultural country, rates are a fraction of our national revenue but it may be possible as an <i>ad hoc</i> measure to pin down our rates as regards counties to agricultural profits and pin down the urban rates to wage and salary income, or gross national product or some such figure.  It is quite unfair to allow so imperfect and inequitable a tax charge to soar as it has been soaring during the years in such an arbitrary manner. <Col N="596" /> Various methods have been suggested by which local bodies might get new sources of revenue.  I do not know what new sources can be given to them.  Water rates would mean little or nothing in my constituency.  Hospital charges, where people pay 3d. or 4d. a day, would not yield very much.  I do not think you could raise revenue from cottage rents.  Neither could you from entertainment tax, because the cinemas are not doing so well and the dancehalls, because of Government policy, are immune.  Perhaps petrol tax might do something, but how would you distribute such revenue among local bodies&mdash;how would you assess the percentage each should get?  I understand a group in the Custom House are examining the general position, and the Health Services Committee appointed by this House may examine the position without doing anything to solve it. There may be some hope from the National Economic Institute who are also examining the matter.</P>
    <P>Because my time is limited, the only other point I shall allude to is a reply I got today during Question Time from the Minister.  I asked him whether he had received a report from the Tipperary South Riding County Council on the number of approved applicants for houses.  I asked him if he had received that report, when he had received it and the number of approved applicants there were awaiting houses.  The Minister, in his reply, said:</P>
    <P>I have got no record whatsoever from Tipperary South Riding County Council showing the estimated needs of housing in its area since April, 1956, when the number was 230.</P>
    <P>The Minister may blame the county manager or the council or anybody he likes, but I am blaming him.  He, a responsible person, acknowledges here&mdash;I had to put down this question twice, wording it differently in order to get the information&mdash;that he has had no information about housing from the Tipperary South Riding County Council since April, 1956.  This is an appalling admission.  It is an admission of absolute negligence on the part of the Minister and the Department. They may be negligent in the Tipperary <Col N="597" /> South Riding County Council, but surely the Minister was in a position to find out the number of approved applicants there were.  I got that information about housing conditions at a meeting of the county council.</P>

He told me today he has had no report whatsoever from Tipperary South Riding showing the estimated needs of housing in the area since April, 1956, when the number was 230.  I do not for a moment believe this is the sole instance; a number of similar questions have been asked by Deputies in the past few weeks and the reply he gives invariably is that the information is not in his Department.  Today he frankly admits the information has not been furnished.  I hold no brief for the South Tipperary County Council. They should furnish the annual housing report.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief and hope I am not interrupted.  I must refer to Fianna Fáil policy in relation to building.  They are content to build luxury hotels for tourists and to wine and dine in them with the tourists, but they are not prepared to build houses for the unfortunate people who are badly in need of houses.  In my town there is serious overcrowding.  Young families have married into their parents' homes and the other sons and daughters in exile cannot come to stay at home during their holidays.  That is the unfortunate position&mdash;people who would like to rear their children in Christian surroundings cannot do so.  I do not see any hope of their being able to do so in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>The policy of the Government in relation to housing in my town has been to build 40 houses there.  I challenge the Minister to refute that.  He has been responsible for the building of 40 houses in a town where his predecessor had hundreds built.  While such a situation exists, there is little hope for the people on waiting lists.</P>
      <P>I suggest the Minister should put his mind to easing the burden of rates on town dwellers.  There have been rate remissions for farmers and I suggest it is time something was done in respect of townsmen.  There is also a problem for townspeople because of differential rents.  The Minister should investigate the position and see that the same conditions as regards rents apply to towns as to county council administrative areas.  Otherwise, because of the increasing cost of living brought about by deliberate Government action, I can foresee wholesale evictions because of tenants' inability to pay their rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I speak of the housing needs of places in my constituency like Mervue, I cannot help but suggest <Col N="599" /> that the scheme on which millions will be spent in rebuilding this House should be deferred and the money spent on building houses for the people who need them.</P>

      <P>The Deputy does not have to tell me anything about it. Deputy Jones mentioned group water schemes and others.  Then he said they should be chlorinated in order to make the water purer, and so on.  The cost would probably be considerable and it would not be likely to be effective in many cases.  When we are investigating sources of supply for group schemes we insist that a potable supply of water is available.  Further than that I cannot go at this stage. Unless the Deputy has some particular cases in mind which he feels could meet up with the additional cost of chlorination in general, I would not insist that it must be done in all cases.</P>
      <P>Some Deputy mentioned that the increased grants for farmers for the erection of new houses should be extended to all workers.  These grants are a special facility for the farming community, particularly for the less well off farmers who have been passed over in all the housing drives throughout the years because they could not avail of the grants held out to the community as a whole and who are not of the disposition to seek to have houses built for them by the local authority on a rental basis.  Indeed, in many cases, the local authority would not provide them for them.  In providing increased grants, I am treating these people as a special category which demands special attention from the Government and the Exchequer. As such, these grants have been raised by 50 per cent above those available to the rest of the community.  Further than that I am not prepared to concede, at this stage, at any rate.</P>

    <P>Deputy Jones mentioned fire standards in connection with commercial dance halls and pleaded for greater safety.  The inter-Departmental Committee's Report on Revised Standards which have been drawn up has been received and copies of these revised standards have been issued to all fire brigade authorities.  The local fire brigade authority are consulted by the local authority when planning permission is sought for a building of that <Col N="601" /> type.  I have no doubt that the proposer of a project for a commercial dance hall is made fully aware, in advance of building, of the actual standards required and fire prevention precautions that must be taken in order to make the hall an acceptable place to be licensed by the court and to be allowed by the local authority to be used.  If there is any laxity in this matter I should like it to be known that it cannot be tolerated.  I am glad Deputy Jones mentioned it.  If I find from any source that proper fire standards are not being insisted upon by any local authority we shall have something to say to the local authority concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. Lynch complained of the extension of the length of vehicles now permitted on our roads from 30' to 36'. Other Deputies mentioned that trailers are a dangerous development and should be abandoned.  With regard to the extension to 36' that we have fairly recently inaugurated, it is in keeping with our practice in recent years to adhere to and to follow the international conventions that have agreed, after discussion, on the various standards and usages that may be permitted on our roads and the types and sizes of vehicles that should be allowed on them.  It would probably be a retrograde step to think in terms of banning these vehicles from our roads and making the size of vehicles smaller in view of traffic developments which have been taking place here over a long number of years.  I have in mind, particularly, the great volume of heavier traffic now leaving the railways for a number of years past.  That move has become accelerated.  If at this stage&mdash;in the middle of the stream, as it were&mdash;we were to say: &ldquo;You may not use the larger vehicles that are available to you for road transport&rdquo;, I do not know how our freight would be hauled in the greater part of our country.</P>
    <P>Swimming pools have been praised and condemned and, of course, there was the catchcry that we do not want swimming pools until we have enough houses.  I do not suggest that local authorities should down tools on <Col N="602" /> housing and concentrate on swimming pools but this is one of the types of community service which our local authorities feel they are obliged to give our people.  When money was not available for it, there was a terrific hue and cry that money should be made available for it.  For a number of years it was held that, until we got further ahead with our water and sewerage schemes, money should not be made available to our local authorities to provide this particular amenity.  Now that it has been provided, I would point out that on many occasions I advocated such a grant assistance scheme.  We now find these Jeremiahs coming in here and saying we should leave this project aside as, until we have coped with our housing, we do not need swimming pools.  We need both.  I do not see why, in quite a number of cases, our local authorities cannot go on with both and give this very desirable amenity to our people, particularly to our young people.  Not only will it improve them physically but it will also make them better equipped to look after themselves when they wander far from home and go swimming in other places and not only save their own lives but maybe help to save other people's lives, all too many of which are still being lost unnecessarily each year in swimming tragedies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry is concerned about industries which are not able to have workers near the factories.  Unfortunately, over the years, there were far more workers available in this country than we had factories for.  It seems to me to be an indictment on those who have chosen the sites for factories that they are short of workers before they are really starting.  The National Building Agency is described by Deputy Corry as reintroducing landlords and shoneen landlordism in its worst possible form in giving houses to industrialists who he feels will have no sympathy for our people.  He says they are not even like the landlords of old because the fellows concerned are foreigners, from different European countries.  It is a lot of cod to talk in that way.  The services of the National Building Agency are available <Col N="603" /> to these people if they are concerned about getting houses for their workers. If those houses are not being provided or are not likely to be provided for a considerable time, if they are prepared to commit themselves to paper for the total repayment of the cost of the houses needed for those workers, the National Building Agency is there, funded by the Government, to give them that service, a service which is being availed of.  I can see nothing wrong with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crotty complained&mdash;he never does anything but complain&mdash;about the arterial road grant in his county. It takes a bit of complaining to complain about an increase but he complained that while the arterial road grant was increased from £30,000 to £90,000, the county road grant was cut to some extent.  Deputy Crotty and other members of the House who may think they have a grievance in this matter should be fully aware that this is the third year's allocation based on the new formula made known to every local authority in the country three years ago under which, as the local authorities succeed in having more than 50 per cent of their county road mileage dust-free, then for every percentage over and above that their grant is cut by two per cent.</P>
    <P>The point should be made that there are counties as low as 25 per cent dust-free and we want those to be brought up as we want a uniform standard throughout the country.  We have only a limited pool of money for the various road demands and as the number of miles that have been improved increases&mdash;remember a county road grant is an improvement grant and not a maintenance grant&mdash;it follows that the mileage to be dealt with will become less and less each year.  For instance, in Kilkenny they have made striking advances in recent years, not only due to the road grants they have been getting but due to the increased amount of money made available to them in recent years and furthermore due to the fact that on average throughout the country in recent years, by the introduction of new methods of <Col N="604" /> treating county roads, it is true that it is now possible to improve over two miles of road for the cost of one mile five years ago, despite the increase in costs in the meantime.</P>
    <P>All that comes into this complaint of Deputy Crotty's inasmuch as Kilkenny has gone quite a long way towards achieving a completely dust-free mileage and they are really getting the same treatment in regard to their county road moneys as every other county and as every other county, including Kilkenny, has got for the past three seasons of allocation.  Why that should be regarded now as a matter to cause an outcry about I do not know because the fact is that I have gone out of my way to try to ensure that no county would actually have less money for roads altogether than it had in the previous year.  That includes even the special railway road allocations which were made and which ceased after a five-year period. They were not cut off as some Deputies alleged.  Special assistance out of public funds was provided for counties which made a case in respect of these roads.  These allocations have ceased in some counties this year and I have tried by various means, including increasing arterial road grants, to balance matters up and leave these counties as near as possible to the position in which they were last year.  In the great majority of cases the total moneys allocated are greater this year than last year and last year's allocation was greater than that of the year before and the year before that again.</P>
    <P>Arterial roads and main roads we have heard quite a lot about.  We have been told wasteful expenditure is taking place.  I want to say again&mdash;it does not seem to matter how often I say it; we seem to get the same complaints here&mdash;that while proposals are sent up to my Department for sanction by road authorities, with the knowledge of the elected members of the authorities, they have been given a special say in the matter for the past five years or more which entitles them to say if they are not satisfied with what their county engineer proposes. They are welcome, and are invited, to put up alternative proposals.  I ask <Col N="605" /> those who are complaining today about unduly costly jobs being done on the roads: how many of the local representatives have availed of this offer from me and my Department over the past five years?  How many of them have availed of it this year and how many of them have come in to prove the points they are making here about wasteful expenditure on their main and arterial roads?  I have no knowledge that they have made this uproar in the proper way through their council and have submitted any scheme to me to counteract what they regard as wasteful expenditure and until I get that from those who make those allegations in this House, I think the allegations are a bit hollow.</P>
    <P>For every mile of unimproved county roads in the entire country today £120 is being allocated as against £80 a few years ago.  That, added to the improved methods which give twice the amount of work for the same amount of money, will be readily understood to mean that we are in fact progressing very rapidly with the county road programme and at the same time, facing up to the other work we must face if it is not to cost a great deal more in the immediate future, the improvement of the main and arterial roads.</P>
    <P>Some people have asked what plans we have for arterial roads and roads generally.  I have made it clear over the past few years that we are doing a traffic survey all over the country to find out the volume of traffic using the roads so that we may be in a position scientifically and practically to assess the needs of the road network. Until that survey has been completed&mdash;that has not yet been done&mdash; I cannot say that we have any new plan.  But so far as arterial roads radiating from Dublin city are concerned, without waiting for the final figures of the volume of traffic using these roads, it is quite obvious from the manner in which they are choked with traffic in recent years that we must proceed with them even before we get the final figures which I think will confirm that work on these roads is absolutely urgent and cannot be delayed much longer.  In fact, work on <Col N="606" /> some of the roads radiating from Dublin has been delayed too long.</P>
    <P>When I hear people talking about that, as some Deputies talk of it, saying we shall have to do something about it, it really makes me rather cynical because I remember back in the days of 1947 when they were offered £500,000 which was put in reserve for them but which they have not in fact yet spent on the jobs which were intended to begin the programme of arterial road improvement in respect of roads leading to and from Dublin.  Notwithstanding that, we are now glad to get the co-operation of these same people who would not lift a finger to spend this money in the past. The fact that they did not co-operate then will not in any way take from the assistance they can expect from me and my Department.  We are all with them in trying to make these improvements as quickly as possible because they are too long overdue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never a question of finance.  As the Deputy knows, it was held up by a political ramp and I have now informed those concerned to <Col N="607" /> come along as quickly as possible with their plans because this matter is rather urgent.  Deputy Dillon questioned the wisdom of the regional water supply schemes when, as he asserted, such good work can be done by group schemes and he asked for the comparative costs of each type of scheme.  That is probably a question which was asked in all good faith but it is one which is impossible to answer. The two schemes are not comparable in any way whatever.</P>
      <P>The regional scheme is a scheme laid down not merely to provide water for the immediate needs of the community but it must be planned to meet in every foreseeable way any possible development and increased demand up to 50 years ahead.  Whether everybody along the line takes the supply or not, we still have to be prepared for potential additions if they come in later on. As matters stand, the overall cost per house of houses served by these regional schemes would compare unfavourably with the cost per house for a little scheme developed in somebody's back garden where a well may be dug or where one exists and where there may be natural gravitational fall. It is obvious that there is unlikely to be real comparison between the two methods of approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implication of the question would seem to be that if there is a big difference in cost between the two systems we should take the cheaper one.  That is a fallacy because water is not available everywhere and it has got to be made available at a pretty high cost in some cases by the local authority in order that those who are unfortunate enough not to have their own supply can enjoy the essential service.  In order to give these people such a service the local authority has to step in and do it for them and in such case the cost per house per scheme cannot be fairly compared with the cost of any group scheme serving two or 32 houses and which does not have to have regard to the additional matters that would increase the cost of a regional scheme.  The group schemes are only concerned with providing a sufficient supply for the <Col N="608" /> immediate needs of those concerned. That is the only intention of the group and they are free of the necessity of planning ahead to the day when they may want five times the amount of water.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan wishes to have the grants under the derelict sites scheme increased and Deputy O'Sullivan of Cork questions whether the overall provision under this heading is adequate. In so far as we can calculate on the demands we have been receiving for grants under this scheme in the last financial year and with a little addition for any extra demand there may be this year, we think that the provision is adequate.  It may be a little less or a little more.  But we hope our provision is not too high and that all the money we have provided will be sought for these very desirable schemes.</P>
    <P>There was mention by Deputy Tully of a grant application being refused in Navan town and I take it he was speaking about a derelict sites grant. If the applicant had applied before the work was done I believe that he would have been entitled to the grant but it is quite obvious that this is a service for which prior approval must be obtained before a grant can be paid.  Unless we have official knowledge by way of notice of what it is proposed to do we cannot calculate what the work is likely to cost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>You would never know whether it was there or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question of an application for a derelict sites grant about which we are not being sticky. It does not work out that we can pay grants for something we do not know about before the job is done.  We have to account for the money we spend to you-know-who and just saying that the fellow has said that he did the work and that it has cost so much is no excuse for us as far as the spending of the money is concerned.  We have been lax in the application of our schemes in general but we are not interested in paying out money unless we know the work has been done.  We would wish that everybody applying for housing grants would do so in advance of building and we would appeal to the <Col N="609" /> community, through the members of this House, to apply in advance of starting the work and get approval in advance.  We find difficulties in the payment of grants that could have been avoided had we known what it was proposed to do and what the work would cost before it was done. We never refuse anybody merely because they have done the work before they apply but it would help their applications if they sought approval before they started on the work.  That must apply especially in regard to the derelict sites scheme because we do not know anything about the old site and how much it took to remove it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coughlan remarked in regard to the group schemes that there was not sufficient contact with the people and that the local representatives should keep more closely in touch.  I have appealed for many years that members of local authorities should interest themselves in these matters, that they should see what they can do in any particular way to help and that they should become leaders in this matter of organising group schemes.  I am all with Deputy Coughlan when he says that the local representatives should have more contact with them.  I look to the local representatives.  I have asked them on several occasions not only to keep in touch but to be the sponsors because of their unique position in the communities they represent.  Knowing the situation from the councils' point of view, knowing where the public regional scheme will go, knowing at this stage from the blueprint what areas will not be served, they are in a specially privileged position to go into a townland or two townlands or to a district and to say: &ldquo;Look; if you wait until the council's scheme gets here, you will be very old.  Why not get together and do a group scheme; connect up at some distance with the line that will pass by or take some local source?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to local councillors to regard this as something they can do better than anybody else.  Without their active assistance, the group scheme cannot be tied in to the overall <Col N="610" /> regional scheme system in the country in the way we had hoped in order that the greatest possible number of people can get piped water at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan, again from Cork, mentioned interminable delays in payment of housing grants.  All I can say in this case is that Deputy O'Sullivan does get in touch with my Department on average probably as frequently as most other Deputies.  I am not aware of any interminable delays in the payment of grants in his area.  I am not even aware at this stage, having heard him complain about the situation, that there is any undue backlog of inspections to be carried out or payments to be made.  If such a backlog does exist, it is certainly not known to me and that goes for almost any other area. That is not to say that in the payment of grants and the handling of grants and instalments of grants, over probably anything up to 40,000 payments in a year, we cannot slip up and do not slip up but I do say that this charge of interminable delays in the payment of grants is not one that I will generally accept as giving a true picture of the administration of these matters in my Department at this stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Declan Costello in a short statement really wades in, as I have heard him wade in before, quoting from the same document, the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> from which he has abstracted certain passages which would indicate the provision of capital for social matters, social building, and so on, which would include housing.  Of course, he works it down that it really only applied to housing and suggested that in that first Programme it was the intention of the Government to reduce such capital and, therefore, that it was their avowed intention to reduce building progress in the country.</P>
    <P>Despite the criticisms that may have been made, despite my own feeling about the fact that we are not doing enough in this regard and have not been doing enough for some little time past, the figures of the amount of money used in this direction do not bear out what Deputy Costello has based his case on.  Nor, for that <Col N="611" /> matter, does it augur very well for the likely success of his new Fine Gael mystery programme which, incidentally, stems from the same argument that he has been using here, for the very good reason that his argument is based very much on the false premise that we have been cutting down on capital for these various social services.</P>
    <P>Let us take 1957-58 in so far as these services are concerned.  We find that at the time of the emanation of the first programme the amount of money spent in my Department for the various services I am responsible for, including houses, was just over £9 million.  We find that the total amount spent up to 31st March last for the year 1963-64 is not, as Deputy Costello would lead us to believe or infer, lower than £9 million but, in fact, has increased to £13.945 million.  If his programme is as solid as is the basis on which he has rested it, God knows, it will be little better than the last policy which we saw, which was dug up in haste and flashed around the country in the hope that it would save the day in the two by-elections that we recently had in Cork and Kildare.  However, that is Fine Gael's problem and it is not for me to worry over the manner in which this has been arrived at.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish mentioned here that he would wish to see a copy of the introductory speech and, of course, went on to say that he would probably prefer not to see a copy of the closing speech.  If things were to be balanced properly the two should be sent out.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can take it home with him in that way, so.  In so far as that is concerned and in so far as the suggestion that this might be useful to local authority members is concerned, I shall certainly consider the idea and if no members of the House take objection or exception to the circulation of it to Deputies, if we can do it in any way rapidly, I certainly would have no inhibitions about doing it, particularly on being invited to do it by a Deputy who, whether he <Col N="612" /> is of the Opposition or not, certainly is not of my own Party and certainly cannot be said to be biassed in his request.  There may be something in it that could be useful to members of councils and, as I say, I will consider that, if there is nobody in the Opposition, that is, if it is still across there, who does not want this done.  If anybody says &ldquo;no&rdquo;, I will not do it but if nobody says &ldquo;no&rdquo; I will do it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan-O'Higgins, for whose contribution I was not present, requested, as did some other Deputies, that we should step up Press, radio and television publicity and propaganda on road safety.  I cannot disagree with that but, on the other hand, many of those who advise me seem to think that if you plug something too long and too consistently it loses any appeal it might have had.  So, if at times we seem to have none of this propaganda and then a spate of it, it is generated not by mere haphazard guessing as to when we should go and stop but rather on a calculated basis that concentration can do good for a short period followed by a break, when discontinuance is likely to be better.  Personally, I am not altogether convinced that that is so, but up to the moment I have been guided by those who are in a fairly good way to advise as to getting propaganda across.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> Deputy Carty mentioned the delay in regard to the Housing Bill which, he says, leaves people in the awkward position of not knowing what they are going to do and that the legislation that was current has now gone out of date in regard to housing grants.  This latter statement is not true.  The law now in existence for the ordinary grants of up to £300 for new houses, and so on, is one which will not go out of date unless it is decided by this House to be out of date, which we have not so far considered doing.  Therefore, the law as it was up to the end of last March still continues unless it is changed by this House and the new Bill will be merely an addition to those sums for the farmers of the community of 50 per cent on top of the new house grants already obtainable.</P>
    <P>In so far as payment of these grants is concerned, as I said earlier, we do intend to pay these even in advance of the House actually passing the legislation and in so far as the supplementary grants are concerned we have made it known a considerable time back to the local authorities that they may rest assured that the intention to bring in legislation which will cover them for these payments will be carried out.  It is up to them whether they will, in fact, pay the additional supplementary grants before the law is actually passed.  I am not telling them to do it or not to do it.  I am merely telling them what we ourselves propose to do and, if they propose to follow suit, certainly, we will not take exception to it.  To prove that our intention is genuine, I may add that the money we would propose to provide during the year by way of increased grants is already provided for in the Estimates, and I do not think anyone would object if the local authorities followed suit.</P>
    <P>Innumerable other matters have been raised but, lest I should not have time, I should like to return to the main theme of the debate&mdash;the question of housing in general, with particular reference to housing in Dublin and other cities.  I listened to a great part of the speech of Deputy Sherwin this evening.  In case I have not time <Col N="614" /> to cover the matter fully, I would recommend Deputies to read his <i>résumé</i> of what has led up to the present overall position in regard to housing.  About 75 per cent of old Dublin is made up of a rotten core of decaying and absolete buildings. Somebody will probably say that this Government are responsible for that position.  These houses were substantially built and they do not become decaying and obsolete overnight.  We have been left a legacy over the past 40 years or more&mdash;to deal only with the period of native government&mdash; when nothing was done about the removal of these buildings.  The situation is more obvious in Dublin, although nothing was done in our other cities and towns either.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned here, without the proper emphasis, that what we lacked was proper planning.  I agree entirely. The Planning Act, which took a number of years to prepare and a long time to get through this House, had to be enacted before proper planning could mean anything.  Proper planning means not only drawing lines on a map; it means that we get on with the practical work of clearing the slums, which should have been done in the past.  I am not blaming the people of those days, because they had much to do rehousing the people and had not time to devote to wiping out these slums.  They filled their houses on the outskirts of the cities.  Priority was given to the people with the greater number in family.  The old tenements were left only partly derelict, unfortunately, because the old single people and the couples without children remained on in them.  Their numbers increased over the years.  The stage was eventually reached a year ago that what could only be expected of these old buildings happened&mdash;they fell down.  They should have been taken down and replaced, but the necessary legislation for that type of development was not then available.  It is only in recent times that even Deputies are coming to appreciate that proper planning is not merely a question of providing houses for people. If we are to get on with the job, we must face up to the fact that 75 per <Col N="615" /> cent of old Dublin is in a decayed and rotting condition.</P>
    <P>If blame is to be apportioned for this situation, there is no Party who can wash their hands and say it is not their fault.  This has gone on over the years.  If the tragedies had not happened, I do not say the situation would have continued; but certainly we would not have had this change of mind on the part of Deputies who are beginning to see that an overall plan does not merely mean lines on a map but the practical work of clearing these houses, closing them up and not allowing them to be reoccupied as they were in the past.</P>
    <P>If we are to make real progress now, we must set about a proper planning programme.  We must not only do as we did in 1948&mdash;assess the number of houses immediately needed&mdash;but we must get down to finding out the number of unfit houses in every region. We have been doing that for the past four years through our housing survey. We must add to that a projection into the future&mdash;of course, it must be guesswork&mdash;on certain guiding principles. Adding the two together, we can say that for a minimum period of five years this is the number of houses to be done and this is the amount we are prepared to spend on the redevelopment of our cities.  We cannot go on willy nilly, as we have in the past, without having regard to this overall plan.</P>
    <P>In order to make progress, there must be a proper plan.  There must be a practical approach.  We must not only draw new maps, but we must do the practical, difficult and costly job of wiping out these old buildings and replacing them in a better way. We must disperse our people into new areas, if necessary; bring some of them back to the old areas, in order to make those areas relive; and not go on with this &ldquo;blitzing&rdquo; of the centre of our city, denuding it of population and leaving it, so to speak, a derelict centre.  I do not say that purely on sentimental grounds; on good economic grounds we cannot afford to have the centre of any city, <Col N="616" /> which costs a great deal in services such as roads and so on, lying idle. The greater number of hours it is used out of the 24 hours, the more economic it becomes for us to redevelop it.</P>
    <P>Unless we are prepared to do that, think in terms of clearing whole blocks at a time and rebuilding them to a proper plan based on a scientific and economic approach, then the sooner we forget about falling buildings in Dublin city the better it will be, because that is a heritage to which many have added.  I am not blaming anyone in particular because many are responsible for the accumulation. Those who lived through the days when those areas were being cleared left the buildings standing to be occupied by elderly single and married people who were not regarded as a first priority for new houses.  That is why we have this accumulation of buildings falling down and this accumulation of elderly people who one would now think, listening to some of the speakers here, were dragged up out of the ground by some malevolent force in the Government Party.  They have been there for years.  Their number has been added to over the years.  It is only when the buildings started coming down that we seemed to become aware that we had a job on hands which had been started but had never been completed properly.  That is why the rotten hard core is still there.  That is why there are still people living in these old condemned tenements.  They were not housed when they should have been and, in the interim, they have been forgotten. That is what we should remember when we talk about the need for more building, more development, more housing.</P>
    <P>It staggers me to hear the Leader of the Opposition boast, as he has boasted in the past three years on every occasion when this Estimate was before the House, how delighted he is to be able to stand up here and say that his Government built more houses in Dublin in 1956 than were needed. Does it ever occur to him in his waking moments that there is only one way of looking at that position?  Does <Col N="617" /> it never occur to him that the real situation was that, because of the activities of the Government then in office, the position was not that they had built too many houses but that they had too few people to occupy them?  And one may legitimately ask them where had these people gone. Even allowing that the boast is true, which I do not admit for a moment, how was it that this self-same Government, who could boast of building too many houses in Dublin, were not even aware of the thousands and thousands of unfit houses throughout the country? How was it they did not even try, as I have been endeavouring to ascertain for the past four years, what the number of unfit houses was?  If they want to boast about building too many houses, then let them also boast about the other situation.  Why build too many in Dublin when there were thousands too few in the rest of the country?  There are 70,000 unfit houses throughout the country; 40,000 of these can be repaired at an economic cost.  Of the remaining 30,000, there are 25,000 in rural Ireland utterly unfit for human habitation.  It has taken four years of prompting, pushing, probing and stabbing local authorities to get the figures which have made it possible for me and my Department to assess the problem as it exists.</P>

      <P>The money that goes into local authority housing comes out of the Central Fund.  A great part of it never comes back to the Central Fund.  Over the years the two-thirds subsidy has been the rule rather than the exception.  Yet, people get up here and say to me and <Col N="618" /> to the Government that they have competent personnel to plan this, that and the other, and they should be allowed to get on with the work.  With whose money will they get on with the work?  I have to account for the money to the Department for Finance, the Department of Finance has to account to the Government, and the Government to the country.  Yet, we are told we should leave all to these people down the country.  One would think local funds were standing the cost.  By and large, it is the Central Government that stands the cost and it is the Central Government that must be satisfied to some degree as to what is being done with the money spent.</P>
      <P>The only thing that sickens me in the Department of Local Government is that it takes so long from the time one disseminates the idea, gets it back from the local authorities, and gets it really under way so that one can see results.  That takes years and years. Believe me, it is more frustrating to me than it is to many members of local authorities.  I only wish the situation were different.  I only wish I were in a position to do some of the job that now falls on the Dublin Corporation. It is 12 months now since that Corporation was in my Department and I assert that, if the position were different, I would be a year ahead to-day, and that goes for every housing authority in the country and their housing problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not say this in order to cast any reflection on local authorities.  I was a member of a local authority. I know what members have to go through.  I know the delays, delays one cannot avoid unless one is prepared to take or give dictatorial powers.  If we are not prepared to do that, then we must put up with the time lag.  The timelag is more frustrating to me than it is to anyone else because I know what could be done and I know what should be done.  I know there is no lack of money.  Yet, it is not being done.  That is what gets under my skin particularly when I am pilloried by all Parties and pushed and prompted to have more schemes, more houses, and get more done.  I should love to do that.  If I had the money I dispense <Col N="619" /> to local authorities and the power to do things, I could get things done much quicker.</P>
    <P>That brings me to my final point. In Dublin and throughout the country generally, there is a very definite shortage of skilled labour.  It is all very well for people to say that we should stop building luxury hotels, or the office block outside Leinster House, stop building everything except houses for the ordinary people.  That happened in 1956 and then housing stopped completely.  If you squeeze out certain facets of building, then you can stop everything except ordinary housing. We must try to keep both going together and the more of both we have going together, the greater the demand will be and the more we will have available to us by way of finances to get on with building.  Once one restricts, one kills building, as it was killed in 1956-57.  What we have to do is supplement it.</P>
    <P>There are systems available to us, such as pre-fabs, which produce a finished product either by way of flat or house comparable with the best built by traditional methods in this or any other country.  We can have that system here tomorrow if we really set our minds to it.  It can be restricted to a certain limited number of houses for a given short period of time so that there can be no question of its being introduced in order to usurp skilled workers thereby putting them out of work.  That is one thing I will not stand for and one thing those associated with our unions can be satisfied we will not tolerate.  We can have that system tomorrow.  It can do a fast job.  It can give an excellent product.  I believe it is the only way in which we can really get to grips with the demand for housing at the moment.  If we do not do it, then all I can say to those local authorities who will not go along with it is that they can stew in their own juice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> On the last occasion I had come to deal with the question of commercial transport.  I found that whatever success lay with CIE in the field of commercial transport largely stemmed from the monopoly conditions which the 1958 Act provided.  Those monopoly conditions appear to have been pretty extensive.  I want to quote now from the &ldquo;Economic Research Institute, Paper No. 13&rdquo;.  The heading to a paragraph on page 6 is: &ldquo;The Licensing and Freedom of Commercial Vehicles&rdquo;.  I now quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Restrictions on the use of commercial vehicles employed on transport for reward date back to the 1933 Road Transport Act which was aimed at protecting the railways from competition and to enable them to secure a substantial share in road transport for hire and reward.  The latter aim, however, has only been partly fulfilled.  The Act prohibited, save under licence, the carriage of goods for reward by mechanically propelled vehicles except within certain exempted areas which, since 1944, have been within a radius of 15 miles from Dublin and Cork and within a 10 mile radius of Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  Licences were granted to existing hauliers in 1933 (and in 1944 when certain areas were removed from exemption) on the basis of their original vehicle fleets with certain restrictions as to the weight of the vehicle operated, the radius of operation, and on the <Col N="622" /> commodities carried.  Licences could be transferred or continued by near relatives of the original licensee provided that he lived in the same district but virtually no new licences have been granted to new entrants other than some issued for special traffics, e.g., turf, milk and cream, newspapers, on the grounds of inadequacy of transport.</P>
    <P>Under the same Act the railway companies were empowered to buy either by compulsion or by agreement, the licences and businesses of their competitors, which they have done on a substantial scale, having acquired some 387 of their larger competitors.</P>
    <P>At Table 8 of this bulletin under &ldquo;category of operator, rail companies, including railhead collection and delivery&rdquo;, it gives the number of concerns as three, and the number of other operators as 890; the number of vehicles, rail companies, 879; other operators 1,090; tonnage carried, rail companies, 3,327; other operators, 2,257.  It goes on to give livestock carried and vehicle miles run.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The members of the House are entitled to ask what will happen if there is a very marked deterioration in the position.  My answer is that the Government have made certain assumptions as with all future planning. These are that:</P>
    <P>(1)  It is hoped that the Board, supported by the entire staff, will induce more efficiency and retain existing traffics.</P>
    <P>(2)  It is hoped that the railway will gain traffic from the growth in the general economy.</P>
    <P>(3)  There is recognition of the fact that the huge staff of CIE will and should receive increases of remuneration applicable to the whole economy and that future increases as a result of the advice of the National Industrial Economic Council will be based on national productivity growth on a basis clearly set forth by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> This is the one I want to come to.</P>
    <P>(4)  No doubt the staff and management will recognise the special characteristics of the railway finances, the dependence on 20 important customers and on courteous punctual service.</P>
    <P>To me that is an amazing paragraph. Maybe I am misinterpreting it but it suggests to me that CIE are dependent on 20 important customers.  That is what is written here.  It is amazing that in this monopoly system, and with the implementation of the powers they are given, they are now talking about their business being limited to 20 important customers.  That does not bespeak the efficiency with which the Minister would like us to gather this concern has been operated.</P>
    <P>It brings me to two tentative conclusions. First, if that is all they are able to do, we might just as well completely relax control on private transport.  After all, if CIE are not to be a solvent concern any more, why not let them operate in full competition with private commercial haulage? The deficiency will have to be paid one way or another.  I believe the time has come when these restrictive practices on commercial hauliers, which have proved to be ineffective as one of the means of making CIE a solvent proposition, should be removed. Should we not ask ourselves: &ldquo;Should we not abolish these practices and give the private hauliers more competition with CIE?&rdquo;  The position cannot be worse than it is.</P>
    <P>The second tentative conclusion one is driven to is in regard to the whole question of State companies.  We are all familiar with the Minister's replies to various questions arising in regard to different concerns of which he is in charge.  He seems to be unfortunate in that he has a number of concerns over which he has no direct charge and time and again he has come here to say: &ldquo;I cannot answer that question; you must write to CIE&rdquo;.  If we are accepting the idea that CIE is no longer going to be a solvent company, that is cannot be run on the same lines as <Col N="624" /> the ESB, for instance, then the time has come when there should be more direct control by this House so that any Deputy can get up and ask a question and the Minister will not be constrained to say that he cannot give a reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support strongly the case made by Deputy Hogan in relation to the transport of livestock in particular.  It is, in my view, essential to the livestock industry that there should be a much freer movement in transport.  The haulage of livestock in something which to a phenomenal degree depends on the individual care and attention that is best given by the man who owns his own lorry.  It is without question the experience of those who have livestock to be hauled that the individual will give a very much better service than that given by an organisation which must have regard for its own needs.  CIE of necessity have to run what one might call a continuation service, and if anything happens, as I have seen it happening on occasion, to one of the earlier runs, then the effect is that the later cattle destined for the Dublin Cattle Market from my constituency do not go at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I want to say&mdash;and I have informed the Chairman of CIE that I proposed to say this&mdash;that only last week I had a most unfortunate experience in relation to CIE on the Cork train which I mention not for the purpose of grumbling but for the purpose of publicly ventilating something which I hope, because of its ventilation, will be stopped once and for all. I travelled to Cork a week or ten days ago on the early morning train, travelling first-class.  The carriage was filthy and had not been brushed or dusted. The floor was filthy in the sense not of being oily or muddy but covered with papers and empty cigarette cartons and the ashtrays were full of old cigarette butts.  The booking arrangements in relation to that train were not exactly happy.  I do not care much about that, but unless we can make certain that our transport vehicles of every sort are scrupulously clean, we need not expect anything from the <Col N="625" /> tourist trade.  It is not merely a matter for ourselves; it is a matter in particular for the tourist trade.</P>
    <P>It so happened that on that morning I saw several tourists coming into the carriage.  They were polite enough not to say anything in my hearing but the manner in which they looked at the carriage was eloquent testimony to their thoughts.  I might also add that I made it my business to point out to the ticket inspector the condition of the carriage.   He agreed with me but did not appear to be as upset as an official of CIE should be in those circumstances. It did not matter in the least to me but it certainly was a very bad advertisement for CIE and it will be a very serious deterrent to our tourist trade if we cannot ensure that all our transport vehicles are scrupulously clean.  While I may have many differences with the Minister, I think he will agree with me on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate has ranged over a very wide field and it will take me some time to deal with all the points which were raised.  I think I should speak in detail in view of its importance to the life of the community and of the many charges made not only against CIE by some Deputies but also against me as the Minister in charge of transport.  First of all, I should make it clear to those Deputies who spoke of CIE as though it were a monopoly that the only monopoly that exists in connection with CIE is the restraint on the number of public hauliers operating for reward who are permitted to circulate in the State. There is enormous and growing competition from private transport, from cars and privately-owned lorries of a kind which is taking place in other countries in Europe.  By no stretch of the imagination could CIE be termed a monopoly and not even a monopoly in the sense that the ESB is a monopoly, and rightly so, in our circumstances. The competition is terrific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the debate on this Bill, it seemed to me that Deputies were divided.  Some of them praised CIE services; others criticised some but not <Col N="626" /> all the services.  They criticised particular services which they felt were defective.  There was sufficient praiseworthy comment for me to say that I believe I have the majority of the House with me in thinking that the efficiency of CIE has greatly improved in the past five years and that the community receives a great deal of first-class service.  The fact that they are able to carry 85 per cent of their goods from any one part of the country to another within 24 hours is proof enough that their freight service is reasonably adequate to say the least.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies, such as Deputy P. Hogan <i>(South Tipperary),</i> spoke about CIE as a bankrupt, insolvent and incompetent organisation.  That is a gross untruth and has no relation to reality.  I have given particulars which show that in spite of the reduction in the length of railway lines by 621 miles back to 1,460 miles, the actual passenger mileage in the five years has remained fairly constant and the number of passengers multiplied by miles which they travelled, which is the generally accepted method of computation, has been generally maintained. Rail freight has increased by some 18 per cent during the period and road freight by over 90 per cent.  With all the private haulage available and with the licensed carriers in operation, it is hardly likely they would have attained that growth in traffic if they were an incompetent organisation and I do not believe it is a reasonable charge.</P>
    <P>Now I want to speak of the charges made against me and therefore against the Government in relation to the attitude I have adopted in the past five years regarding the progress CIE has made.  I have been accused of hypocrisy in that I should have known that transport never could be viable.  I have been accused of having backed a phoney prospectus, meaning the 1958 Act.  I may as well remind the House again that in the case of the 1950 and the 1955 Transport Acts, both passed under Coalition auspices, the Ministers there made statements, which I have already quoted in this House, in the belief that as a result, in the first case, of the reorganisation in 1950 and, in the second place, of an injection of <Col N="627" /> capital in 1955, CIE might pay its way.  I made it clear that I was not accusing them of hypocrisy, that although the Taoiseach was extremely careful, as I was, not to commit himself in 1958 to any statement that in his view at the end of five years CIE would no longer need the £1,175,000 of subsidy I was not charging the two previous Ministers with hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>The reason I was not so doing was because of the complete absence of cost accountancy in railway companies, because of the attitude of mind which has been common all over Europe of treating the transport concern as a kind of traditional service and because Deputy Morrissey, the late and respected Deputy Norton and Deputy Lemass had not the kind of knowledge or the information available which would make it possible for them to predict the future one way or another. As I have said, I did not accuse them of hypocrisy.  I could just as well say they were less realistic than the Taoiseach. I have not said so but in the circumstances it is absolutely wrong to charge me or my predecessor with hypocrisy over this in view of the generally optimistic talk that has always been associated with the discussion of transport legislation in this House.</P>
    <P>It is true that on the Second Reading of the 1958 Bill, as it then was, the Taoiseach himself was extremely cautious, stating he hoped CIE could do the job but pointing out that very few railways in Europe paid.  The other more responsible Deputies in the House were mildly pessimistic, particularly Deputies such as Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;I do not want to quote them at length&mdash;who, should I say, was not too hopeful and not too pessimistic. He did not laugh at the Bill's financial terms and say: &ldquo;They will never do it.&rdquo;  He said he thought they would have a hard time doing it and that it might be possible that in 1964 we would be coming along to the Dáil with more legislation seeking more help for CIE.  The attitude of the responsible Deputies on the opposite side was, perhaps, just a little more pessimistic than that of the Taoiseach, and <Col N="628" /> no more.  There is the position and I thought it should be recorded here.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins suggested I should resign my position as Minister because I had gone all out and expressed the hope that CIE would pay its way. I congratulated them on every stage of their progress, even though I did not in one single case say I believed that the CIE Budget would be balanced at the end of the period.  He talked about Fianna Fáil having the habit of talking about a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow.  Perhaps that is one of the things we could be accused of and we make no apology for it.  We say: nothing venture nothing win.  We in this Party believe more than anyone else that the Irish people are capable of doing things as well as or better than other people if given good management.  As long as I am in charge of any State company which is going through a process of reorganisation I shall encourage them to the limit.  I shall make no apology for exhorting CIE to take advantage of the capital made available and of the newly-found freedom in relation to charging rates with a view to doing their utmost to gain traffic.  In reply to Deputy Corish, I have no apology for, in his words, driving them as hard as I could to see whether they could not achieve solvency at the end.</P>
    <P>No Deputy, with the exception of Deputy Barry indirectly, referred to the reorganisation statement of CIE which was sent to all members of the House.  I defy anybody to say that was not a magnificent piece of work, that it was not a splendid piece of reorganisation, once the immense complexity of a transport system and the millions of items handled are recognised.  In view of the fact that CIE, like all railway companies, was living in a world where, from the point of view of the law, it would have only the horse as a competitor, the overhaul that took place during that period was splendid.  I am sorry that no Deputy thought fit to comment on it.  If Deputies had commented on the report in a critical way and said CIE should have done more or criticised some of the items in regard <Col N="629" /> to organisation and said they were exaggerated that would have been constructive criticism but there was no comment on the magnificent piece of organisation which is enshrined in that document which was sent to every Deputy.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to recount to the House the details of the document but it involved a great change in cost accountancy, a tremendous effort in establishing more productivity in the workshops, a reduction in costs, better organisation of wagon and coaching stock, the provision of better coaches, more comfort for passengers and faster trains.  Reorganisation also involved providing for the first time a modern sales organisation for the sale of traffic once CIE was placed in the position of being able to work and operate independently at least in regard to the rates that it charged.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why I continued to encourage CIE during the five years and to express optimistically the hope that they might achieve their objective was that I wanted to defend CIE against all the elements of conservatism that inevitably arise when anything new and drastic is being done to an organisation.  I wished to defend them from being attacked by all the people who would like to frighten the Minister or the Board of CIE because they were carrying out reorganisation for the general good which would have the effect of inconveniencing certain people, and rightly so, for the general good.  I wished to discourage all the pressure groups who wanted too much from CIE at other people's expense, people who perhaps in many cases would be pressing CIE to give this service and that service when it was unreasonable and would merely mean that one group of the community would be subsidising another and that the service requested was something the transport company could not be expected to give in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Then I did have to discourage that group in the community which exists in every country, who have such faith in a railway as a method of transport that any effort to close a railway they oppose vigorously.  Up-to-date concepts <Col N="630" /> in regard to the character of the transport of the country are unknown to them.</P>
    <P>The basis of CIE policy has been to maintain rail services for the longer hauls and for the faster runs.  Buses and lorries are more suitable in an area where more people can be served than by rail and where single handling of people and of goods is the most suitable form of transport.  CIE operate on that basis and they found naturally that the railways that were closed were so thinly used&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Where the average number of persons entraining at a terminal station is 50 and where the average consignment of tons of goods is ten, this is not a train service in the modern sense, but a bus or lorry service which travels along rails and stops frequently.  I might add that most modern transport administrations all over Europe have taken this same attitude.  Thousands of miles of railway line have been closed in country areas.  I have read in the report on Swedish railway reorganisation that the new policy of this modern State, which resembles strongly our own, has been to close a large number of railway lines for the same reason that we closed them here.</P>

    <P>I believe that if the rail tracks had been preserved on these lines and if I offered to reopen these terribly losing railway services and at the same time asked the House to vote £700,000, which would quickly become £1 million, the House would not vote the taxation required.  I should also like to make it clear that railway services have been closed in this country over a period of many years and that <Col N="631" /> even at a time when there was no analysis of rail costs and no complete examination of transport needs throughout the country.</P>
    <P>An examination undertaken in the Pacemaker Report on CIE shows that when there were few, comparatively speaking, private cars and lorries on the roads compared with what there are now, 528 miles of railway line were closed between 1924 and 1958.  The process of closing railway lines did not begin with the 1958 Act. This process has been going on slowly right from the time this nation became independent.  It was merely accelerated when a new attitude towards transport was taken and when the means of assessing the value of railway lines became known and when a modern attitude towards transport economics was adopted.</P>
    <P>There are the figures&mdash;528 miles were closed in the period previous to the 1958 Act.  Some of the railways closed since 1958 were replaced by as few as three vehicles.  If 6 per cent of the revenue of CIE in terms of goods carried could be replaced by 57 buses and lorries over a very large area of the country, I cannot help feeling that the policy of CIE was not in any way exaggerated.  Those are the actual figures&mdash;57 buses and lorries, with a few more, mostly from CIE stock at certain seasons, were required to replace the train traffic along 620 miles of track and the 200-odd stations that were closed.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that the modern policy with regard to transport is that railways are, first of all, used only where they get a reasonable amount of traffic.  They are for fast, long country services and the bus and lorry are considered more suitable for transport purposes in the scattered rural areas.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked by a number of Deputies on this, particularly Deputy M.P. Murphy of West Cork. He asked if the statement in the Pacemaker Report that 750 miles of railway line are wholly unprofitable is a fact, is it then true that if the statistics and the methods used in the <Col N="632" /> Pacemaker Report were available to CIE at the beginning of the period they would not then have closed some of the branch railway lines which were in fact closed.  In other words, did the cost accountancy method come so late that CIE made a mistake in that regard?</P>
    <P>The answer, I am glad to say, is no. The costing methods used for analysing branch line traffic were so conservative that when the Pacemaker Report was produced and when the eventual evaluation of every sector of line was recorded it was quite obvious that all the railway lines closed came within the debit position.  Moreover, there are still branch lines which are considered doubtful.</P>
    <P>CIE made that clear, as Deputies will see if they read my statement again.  They will find that whereas it was intended to maintain the main arterial system there are some lines still in question.  Even using the most modern methods of the Pacemaker Report, they are deemed to be losing money and are not contributing in any worthwhile way to the main arterial system.  I want to make that clear because the House has a right to know it.  If Deputies read my speech properly they would know that a mistake was not made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the House having facts about the closing of a number of railway lines, I gave at that time a great deal of detailed information on the lines that were losing money.  I gave the amount of the losses and the revenue from the lines and I made it clear at that time, because it was in the public interest to do so, that the Minister in charge <Col N="633" /> of any transport system in any country in Europe who continued to give information on the economics of every line in the country would simply create pressure groups of people who wanted this, that and the other at other people's expense.  This would not be in the interest of the company concerned. As it was a matter of public interest, a considerable amount of information was given at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Next I wish to refer to the suggestion made that I continued to be over optimistic as to the final result of the CIE reorganisation under the 1958 Act.  I have already indicated that I was determined to exhort CIE to do their utmost to resist the efforts of pressure groups who might have held them back in their progress.</P>
      <P>In fact I was in the position of not knowing whether CIE would be able to balance their budget in the end because of the complete absence of economic analyses within the organisation. This has indeed been reflected in Europe where only recently the International Railway Research Organisation began to assemble economic data which enable railways to engage in the science of transport econometrics after studying all these facts.</P>
      <P>How could I or any other Minister know in advance whether, having been given freedom to engage in package deals, CIE would be able to get £500,000, £1 million or £2 million worth of package deals?  Who could tell?  They might have got only £500,000.  In fact they got something like £1 million but at the time there was no basis of analysis by which I could tell whether they might be able to get £2 million or £2½ million in package deals which would have brought them much nearer paying their way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a fact.  There was at the time no traffic analysis of a modern kind.  We did not even know what were the comparative costs of package deal traffic by CIE and the costs of carrying the same goods by private <Col N="634" /> transport.  One of the difficulties CIE had was that the very able sales staff employed by them to go around the country found it very difficult to get people willing to engage in a cost comparison.  First of all the sales staff had to go to a great many firms and say: &ldquo;Will you allow us to do a modern costings on your transport establishment if you have not done it? We shall show you how much it is costing you to take your goods at a given time and over a given period from A to B or from B to C and we shall offer you a package deal at what we can do it for.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>CIE found in a great many cases that it was quite obvious it would pay the companies to continue their own transport.  In other cases they found they could do the job more economically. In some cases, for prestige reasons, because of the publicity value of using their own lorries and vehicles, some of the companies refused to accept package deals.  They preferred to have their own lorries even if it proved more expensive to them.</P>
    <P>We did not know at that time what the cost would be when this tremendous effort was being made to secure traffic.  It was impossible to tell in advance the results of CIE's competitive selling campaign, carried out for the first time on a modern basis in a transport service which had lasted for 100 years or more.  Then again, during a great part of the period, it was impossible to say how the economy would expand.  It took until 1959 for us to observe a very pleasant and startling growth in the national income.  We did not know, we could not know how much of the growth would be reflected in very largely expanded CIE sales.</P>
    <P>The transport services did expand but the nature of the new raw materials, where they were coming from and going to, how many of them would reach the larger towns, the seaports, how much processing of goods would be undertaken, was impossible to forecast. All we can say is that from 1959 CIE shared in the economy expansion. A number of international railway reports show that the growth in traffic in a railway does not follow proportionally the growth of national income. <Col N="635" /> That is partly due to the fact that there has been a reduction in heavy bulk traffic owing to the setting up of heavy industries near seaports and because of a reduction in the weight of finished goods resulting from the use of new raw materials and the increasing trend towards factory finished products of high value but often of low weight.</P>
    <P>Railway traffic forecasts are extremely difficult to undertake because of the changing pattern of industry, although they are now making a better effort at it.  At that time we could not make a very definite prediction in that respect.  I was quite determined, as long as this process of examination went on, to be optimistic and I shall be optimistic again if any State undertaking finds it necessary to engage in a similar reorganisation.  I shall go on being optimistic unless, in advance, I get the kind of information which would make it very much easier to predict what would happen and which might alter the character of necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>My final answer to this point is why did not the Coalition Government write the kind of Bill in 1955 that we provided in 1958?  Why did they not set in train the forces of reorganisation which would enable the proper analysis to be undertaken and some predictions made so that in 1958 we could have observed the situation and might have produced a different type of Act providing different arrangements for the transport services?</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Coalition for not having done it because all this modern analysis is so recent.  If I do not blame the Coalition for not having thought on the lines of modern transport econometrics and of the need for relating transport as a social service to the economics of the service, they can hardly blame me if during that five year period, with completely unknown quantities in front of me, I chose, and will always choose, to be optimistic in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Both the Beeching Report in regard to transport in Britain and the Pacemaker Report are very modern documents, acclaimed throughout Europe and elsewhere as such, so that the <Col N="636" /> whole of this new analysis, of this new method of book-keeping and accountancy, is something that will enable us in future at least to be more realistic about CIE than we have been in the past.  We are, all of us, jointly responsible for this rather traditional attitude towards the transport service.</P>
    <P>The next statement made was that I went on refusing publicly to accept the principle of a subsidy until I was forced to do so.  I make no apology for that either.  If I had hinted at any time during this period of evaluation, of reorganisation, that a subsidy would be inevitable, all the people would have been seeking subsidies and, not having to vote for the money, would have been howling like wolves at CIE's feet and it would have been impossible to carry out the reorganisation that was so essential.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I felt that as long as I could I should speak against the principle of an operating subsidy to cover the difference between current operating expenditure and receipts because I thought that would be a most undesirable form of subsidy, and still do, though I was compelled by circumstances to introduce this Bill. It does encourage inefficiency.  There is no question that it does encourage inefficiency in any organisation.  A deficiency subsidy is very different from capital grants.</P>
    <P>The rural electrification scheme of the ESB is subsidised by this House in the form of interest.  The repayment of capital for the subsidy to the ESB from my Department comes on the Estimate every year in this House. But, from the ESB's point of view, it is a once and for all capital subsidy that enables them to do the job well. It is very different from our saying to the ESB: &ldquo;You are losing £1 million on the sale of current and we shall pay you the £1 million this year.  You have lost £1 million and we shall pay for it.&rdquo;  Everybody fully accepts the difference between subsidies to cover current deficits and capital subsidies.</P>
    <P>Some subsidies are inevitable for services that are entirely social.  The subsidies given to maintain the price <Col N="637" /> of agricultural produce are, again, quite different.  We guarantee the price of a product to a farmer.  We are not going to farmer John Murphy and saying: &ldquo;It cost you so many thousand pounds to run your farm last year and you made £1,000 less.  Here is the money for you.  We shall give you £1,000 every year.&rdquo;  Psychologically, it is quite different to guarantee a price to a farmer rather than to provide him with a specific subsidy to cover a loss he may be making.  The two things are quite different.</P>
    <P>I very much dislike having to propose this subsidy.  It is necessary because an arterial railway line is essential to this country for a considerable time not only to take peak traffics but to provide transport for tourists; to undertake speedy express services for passengers and for freight because the road conditions are totally unsuitable in this country for high speed traffic and will be for many years; because of the cost of changing over and because of the social effects, in any event, of very large-scale redundancy even although the redundancy would result in full compensation at the present rates.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to point out that I hope and expect that CIE will prove to be one of the exceptions&mdash; there are others.  There are railways in Europe that are subsidised and that are efficient.  I hope CIE will join with them and with efficient State companies such as the ESB and will resist all the influences of a subsidy covering an operating deficit.  I hope they will be efficient.  I hope the staff will realise the position they now face. CIE should live not only within the subsidy but should try to dispense with some of it or use some of it for capital purposes in the next five years.</P>
    <P>I believe in the success of our people in engaging in new enterprises and in reorganisation.  We have a splendid tradition in regard to the operation of State companies.  The people manning them, the executives and staffs, are second to none in Europe.  I have every hope that CIE can avoid all the temptations that a subsidy offers.  I make no apology for having tried to resist it <Col N="638" /> as long as I could for the reasons I have given.  At no time during that five years was the sort of statistical information or analysis I desired available to me to show how far CIE could go in securing additional traffic with its newfound freedom.</P>
    <P>Next, I want to deal with those Deputies who spoke of the subsidy level and who asked whether it would be sufficient.  The subsidy of £2 million a year is based on a realistic estimate of the extent to which CIE can get by in its operations during the next five years.  Effective management, increased efficiency and the avoidance of waste are all assumed in that connection. It is based on a minimum realistic level and there is no margin for feather-bedding.  There is allowance for a reasonable increase in staff remuneration.</P>
    <P>During the period of five years, if CIE get into temporary difficulties, they will be able to borrow up to £2 million under the temporary borrowing clauses of the earlier Act.  But, in fact, they are obliged to break even during these five years.  It is not a derisory subsidy, as suggested by some Labour Deputies: it is based on realities.  Some unusual circumstances may arise that we could not foresee, but it is based on a realistic examination of the position.</P>
    <P>I hope the staff will be wise in relation to the part they will play in CIE. I hope they will realise the very heavy character of the subsidy and that while seeking good conditions and reasonable wages they will do everything to help the Board and to enable this House to view with equanimity the payment of the subsidy.</P>
    <P>As I have said, CIE are now in a position whereby they will be obliged to live on the £10 million.  I was asked the question whether some allowance was made for redundancy payments. The redundancy payments will now be made by CIE.  The whole of the £10 million assumes a certain level of redundancy to be met by compensation payments by CIE and that, equally, there will be corresponding economies.  CIE obviously will have to adopt a slightly different attitude <Col N="639" /> towards redundancy, now that they have to pay, whereas, when the State was paying, it was rather like the Government investing a capital sum producing an annuity over a period of years which resulted in a given level of redundancy being made available, the redundancy payments gradually decreasing as the years went by so that, if in the first year the economy effected was not equal to the redundancy payment, over a period of years, as the workers gradually retired, the final economy achieved was a net one.</P>
    <P>Under the arrangement now, no longer does the House vote the money for redundancy.  The character of CIE's negotiations in relation to redundancy payments will be different and the speed at which they effect reorganisation may have to change.  But that was all allowed for in connection with the total subsidy offered.</P>
    <P>As reported at column 1780 of the Official Report, Volume 209, Deputy McGilligan said he proposed that we bring public transport under the control of this House so that we shall be able to have an examination of even the day-to-day administration that is required.  I could not quite make out from Deputy McGilligan's speech whether he was definitely going to do that or felt like it because of his reaction to my Second Reading speech on the Bill. Deputy Esmonde did not definitely propose that but he said he hoped I would give sufficient explanations and make a sufficient statement which, from his point of view, would perhaps eliminate the necessity for moving such an amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan spoke equally tentatively in regard to this.  I should make it clear to the House that a great deal of the debate centring on the question of whether or not public transport should be brought under the control of the House was partly related to this endless controversy that takes place on the answering of questions in regard to the day-to-day administration of CIE.  The Coalition Government in 1950 provided in the 1950 Act that the Board should furnish to the Minister <Col N="640" /> such information &ldquo;as he may from time to time require regarding matters which relate to its activities, other than day-to-day administration, and which appear to him to affect the national interest.&rdquo;  That perfectly clear demarcation in regard to information supplied to the Minister is enshrined in the 1950 Act passed by the Coalition Government.</P>

      <P>In that connection there was a debate on the 2nd March, 1950, in Seanad Éireann when Deputy McGilligan was Minister for Finance, on the question of the matter of day-to-day administration of State companies. Speaking on a motion concerning State and semi-State companies Deputy McGilligan said&mdash;I quote from Volume 37, Column 718, of the Seanad Debate:</P>
      <P>... and I think that we would get very definite agreement here that if these concerns are to be allowed to run with any pretence of efficiency you cannot have day-to-day interference by parliamentary questions with day-to-day actions ....</P>
      <P>There has been a very large measure of general agreement in regard to that ever since.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting Deputy McGilligan and I am very glad to say that however we may disagree with the actions of the two Coalition Governments they did generally observe the tenor of Deputy McGilligan's principles as stated in the general debate in 1950.  There was then roughly the same number of State companies in operation, engaged in post-war work, as there are now.  The only new organisation has been the Shannon Free Airport Development Company so far as my Department is concerned. Bord na Móna and CIE and so on were operating then.  That was a clear declaration showing that this is not a question of Party politics.  It has been well accepted for a very long period.</P>
      <P>I think it is a pity, even though Deputies opposite may not respect me personally for one reason or another, that when they come to argue here about this question on the position of the Minister in relation to the Oireachtas and his position in relation to State companies and the information he gives, that they should not at least take the trouble to read two considered statements I have made and come to this House and take them to pieces paragraph by paragraph, if they wish to do so.  Not a single Opposition Deputy has referred to my speeches which I have indirectly referred to on a number of occasions during interlocutions in this House, as reported in Volume 191 of the Dáil Debates at columns 909 to 915 and again at some considerable length in Volume 207, columns 1518 to 1522.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> On the next occasion when we have a debate the Deputies should remember those references and take the trouble to read the Dáil Reports.  We might then be able to get somewhere because I made a considered statement on all this matter.  That is never referred to in the Dáil but in my view it completely answers the charges that have been made in this regard and completely explains the position.  It is very difficult for me to continue the argument when I consider I have made a complete statement on it already. However, I shall say a few more words about it.  I should first refer Deputies to an address by the Taoiseach on the position of State companies published by the Institute of Administration.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where the independence of State companies is regarded as essential.  Not only is this recognised in countries like our own that are not termed socialist but which you might describe as countries with a left-of-centre policy in general, but also in countries that have had labour administration for years.  The day-to-day independence of the State companies is jealously preserved for the reasons I have given.  There are 20,000 people employed in CIE and, human nature being what it is, anybody can understand that if every aspect of the day-to-day activities of CIE were to be subject to interference, it would simply cause confusion and inefficiency.</P>
      <P>We have what I call a regular system for dealing with complaints in my Department.  When Deputies ask questions about day-to-day matters, if they appear to be repetitive or numerous, I ask CIE for a report on all matters where there would appear to be either an absence of efficiency or where a programme of reorganisation does not appear to have achieved its rightful level.  I have conferences with the Chairman of the State company concerned. I meet the Board regularly and all these matters are discussed.  Repetitive complaints are dealt with expressly. If complaints from Deputies became massive I would regard that as being a matter of public interest and not a matter of day-to-day administration. For instance, if there were very numerous complaints about the CIE cattle transport service, and if these complaints came from all over the House that the service was not good enough, that would enter into the field of being something more than day-to-day administration and I would feel compelled to suggest to the Ceann Comhairle that it was not a matter of day-to-day administration but a matter of great importance.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can go on interrupting but the fact is that I have already given that as an example. There was a debate that lasted for 10 days on the proposed closing of three railway lines and during that debate I gave full information as to the reasons for closing them.  If I was now to be asked what were the receipts and expenditure for the first six months of 1964 for the line from Cork to Mallow I would regard that as a matter of day-to-day administration.  In fact, there has been a complete analysis of all these matters in the Pacemaker Report and I gave all the particulars in the debate on the closing of the West Cork railway.  It was quite obviously desirable and necessary to close it.</P>

The report of CIE is published yearly and the Taoiseach readily offered to the House that whenever they felt a State company was deserving of more comment and debate than was possible on an Estimate or a Bill the report of that company could be discussed in the House.  The running of the three railway lines which were closed were matters of day-to-day administration and could not be perpetually discussed here just as the operation of individual sectors of the ESB are not discussed here because these are matters of day-to-day administration.

      <P>Now I want to get back to the question of the running of CIE by a Parliamentary Committee. That is something that has been proposed in this House on several occasions but I do not know how it is to be done.  That Parliamentary Committee would need a team of highly paid experts to advise them and I do not know of any democratic country in which the transport system is run by a Parliamentary Committee.  They would have to know all about the costings and all the variable factors that are associated with the transport system.  They would have to have some method of comparison.  They would have to know how to establish the conditions and factors that make for different costings here compared with smaller countries such as the Netherlands or Denmark.  I do not know how they would be able to administer the affairs of CIE.  I do not think it would be possible for them to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that Deputies can charge <Col N="647" /> me with responsibility for all this.  I am responsible for the efficiency of CIE.  I am in constant touch with the Board of CIE and my officials have constant discussions with the staffs of CIE.  They discuss the capital programme, the requirements and we are close to them at all times while accepting that as a commercial concern they must have a degree of personal freedom.  I take full responsibility in this House for all the alleged misdoings of any State company and we can be defeated in an election if an election is desired to decide these matters.  That is the position now and that is how it is going to be in the future.  A Parliamentary Committee could not run CIE.</P>
    <P>If by any chance, I hope it will never happen, some State company was being so badly run that the Opposition became extremely vociferous about it you could not have a Parliamentary Committee discussing the matter here.  You would possibly appoint a committee of inquiry to go into the whole matter.  In 1957 we had here a committee of inquiry into internal transport, not because CIE was being badly run but because it was losing money and the House considered it essential to find out what could be done about it.  That committee reported.  The report, while excellent, was inadequate because of the lack of a comprehensive analysis of the running of our transport system and it was not a report on which final conclusions could be based.  My view on this matter is that the Minister is responsible for his Department before this House and that is why a Parliamentary Committee would be unable to work as far as the running of CIE is concerned.</P>

The Board have to use their own immediate judgment with regard to the services they are providing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, the only possible way of running CIE, at a price the country can afford, is to have a combination of economic services and certain services which are social needs and which are quite obviously losing money.  The Deputy can take this, that I stand on the Pacemaker Report and, having seen the list of losing bus services, I am prepared to believe that CIE is doing a pretty good job in providing bus services throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The next point that was made was in connection with the possibility, that may not eventuate, of an amendment to this Bill, which, of course, would involve a repeal of section 16 of the 1950 Act, which clearly prevented the Minister getting information on the day to day administration of CIE.  It would mean a repeal of that section of the Act.  The suggestion was made that Parliamentary control might be required because the subsidy of £2 million seems to be very big.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, as I think the House knows, there were always subsidy payments to CIE in one form or another. A great deal of capital has been extinguished over the years.  There have been advances to CIE which have never been repaid by them.  At a time when there were far fewer cars on the road, when wages were very much lower, when the value of money was higher, not only here but in the rest of the sterling world, about £11 million was paid to CIE and the GNR. Between 1949 and 1958-59 about £11 million was paid in the form of subventions of one description or another. So, if you look at the £2 million in <Col N="650" /> relation to the changes in the value of sterling over the last ten years, it is not so vastly an excessive subsidy in relation to what was paid before as to suggest that Parliamentary control is needed in order to have supervision over the subsidy.  I wanted to mention that because it seemed to me to be of importance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan asked whether the interest and sinking fund payments are included in the 2 million.  The answer is that they are.  He also asked about depreciation in CIE and whether in connection with the £6 million capital to be spent in the next five years, CIE are providing for depreciation.  The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I was asked by some deputies what term I give the railway system.  The Government have decided that there should be a railway system in the foreseeable future and that the railway should be properly preserved and properly maintained and improved so that it can compete with the ever-growing competition from other forms of transport. I could not say what would happen if there was some kind of financial emergency or if there was some dramatic and catastrophic change in the fortunes of CIE.  No one could predict what would happen under those circumstances but, as I have said, it is the decision of the Government to maintain the arterial railway system of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been some rather incomplete analyses of subsidies to railways prepared by international railway organisations.  The comparison of subsidy is not very definite because of the different conditions. In some cases there are different methods of accounting and, of course, there are charges arising from war conditions. If we take the ratio of income to expenditure in a number of European railways for the year 1962 to 1963, the average ratio of income to expenditure for nine or ten railways was one to 1.13.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak of income. The ratio goes up above CIE, which is 1.24 for the railway alone.  It varies upwards and downwards.  There are figures of 1.23 and 1.33.  All I am trying to show is that the CIE subsidy is not an enormous figure by European standards; but a fairly high figure and the subsidies that have to be paid in some cases are much lower.  One of the difficulties, as the House knows, and as I have already indicated in my first speech is the fact that, unlike many European railways, there is no massive transit traffic and practically no carriage of coal or ore on CIE, which provides many railways with a great proportion of their profitable traffic.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies suggested that railway fares are at present very high. CIE offers a great number of low price fares on excursion days, return fares of various descriptions, special fares in special trains.  Railway fares have gone up.  The basic fare has gone up by 46 per cent since 1953 and the earnings of workers have gone up by 78 per cent in the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some other facts that might be of interest to the House showing how CIE combatted for five years against a great number of disadvantages. One of the disadvantages which I think has not been fully appreciated is the great length of even the present largely arterial railway line, in relation to the income of the country as a whole.  I think this is regarded as a viable statistic which is of interest.  The number of miles of railway line per £1 million of gross national product in 1962-63 were: Ireland, 1.8 miles; United Kingdom, .65; Netherlands, .57 and, a country which includes a great many poor people, Italy, 1.13.  For historic and other reasons, the mileage length, in relation to the country's income, is still large.  The present restricted mileage is 1,460.  The number of miles of railway line per 100,000 of the population shows the same position: 51 miles per 100,000 of the population in Ireland; <Col N="652" /> in the United Kingdom, 33; the Netherlands, 17; Italy, 27.</P>
    <P>Then there is a figure which I am sure would be of interest to the House. The only way I know of realistically measuring the number of private cars in a country is to compare the number of private cars per £1,000,000 of gross national product.  The only factor which indicates the social determination of a people to own motor cars is to compare the number of cars with their income.  This is a recent figure&mdash; 1963, number of private cars per £1,000,000 of gross national product&mdash; Ireland, 287; the United Kingdom, 246; the Netherlands, 205; Italy, 256. That shows that because of the scattered character of the population in this country, because of the almost complete absence of villages as in Europe, because of the number of small farms, the Irish people are quite determined to have what is for their income a huge amount of private transport.  At the same time, except in the Dublin and Cork city concentrations and some other town areas, the number of cars in relation to the mileage of roads shows a comparative absence of congestion, which further encourages the purchase of private vehicles.</P>
    <P>I mention that particular figure because it is of importance in estimating the position of CIE.  I do not think anybody could have foretold in 1958 that there would be this tremendous increase in the private car population. It is still going on.  I do not think anybody could have said positively that the Irish people would decide to purchase private cars on that very high level basis in relation to their incomes. It is one of the difficulties CIE have to face, as other countries have to face. In fact, there are figures I will not bother to give the House that show, taking it large and wide over quite a number of countries in Europe, the proportion of goods and passengers taken by rail in the last ten years is steadily diminishing.  Therefore, all railway companies to some extent are facing these difficulties of the growth of private transport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>When did they discover <Col N="653" /> that?  Not today or yesterday.  The Minister was told it in this House, but he did not believe it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am ignoring the Deputy because he did not choose to come here to hear me.  He is interrupting me in regard to things about which I have already spoken.  The Deputy is generally more polite in this House.</P>
      <P>Again, I will not give the details of the figures, but if you take the effort of CIE over a long period it shows that in spite of all these difficulties they have managed to retain a great deal of very competitive traffic, but the costs of carrying that traffic have inevitably grown.</P>
      <P>Next, I come to some matters of local interest.  Deputy Seán Dunne and Deputy Byrne referred to the city services in Dublin and said they were inadequate.  Of course, the whole problem of transport in Dublin is being complicated by the large number of private cars and other vehicles, by the sharpening of peak traffic due to the shorter working week and by the bunching of traffic which takes place in the centre of Dublin as in other cities and which results almost inevitably in the bus movements being irregularly timed as they move out to the outskirts of the city and when they come back again.  May I make it clear to the Deputies that additional buses put on in large numbers at peak time traffic would not solve the problem at all?  It would simply result in more bunching in the centre of the city, causing an encumbrance there.  The one-way street changes which have taken place in Dublin have resulted in fewer complaints to CIE, although naturally they still arise when people have to wait for buses in wet weather that have been held up and delayed because of centre city bunching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own belief is that sooner or later the hours of work will have to be staggered, not only in Dublin but in <Col N="654" /> many other cities.  That involves a great sacrifice of personal liberty in regard to the arrival times and departure times of various classes of citizens. But when you read the Buchanan Report on road congestion and realise that in the Empire State Building in New York everybody has to sign a lease in which they agree to arrive and leave at a specified hour, because it would cause utter chaos if they all arrived and left together, the idea of having some kind of voluntary staggering of hours of work in Dublin does not seem so crazy when we are beginning to have the same sort of congestion that would be inevitable in the Empire State Building unless they made that arrangement for the people living in what really is a very large community.  I mention that as a trend which seems to be inevitable in the future, although I quite realise the difficulty of bringing it about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE have already carried out motivation research in a number of areas.  The area managers have been undertaking this work.  May I pay tribute to their work?  As far as I know, they are very highly respected wherever they operate.  They have brought CIE into closer touch with the people.  They are able to make decisions in regard to services of various kinds and to suggest innovations in the patterns of service.  I have heard no complaint against them from anybody in the community and I think they are all doing splendid work.  They have been engaged in lengthy motivation research.  As a result of it they altered bus times and bus movements in Limerick to, I believe, everybody's satisfaction.  They have been doing that kind of work in Cork and Waterford also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as Dublin is concerned&mdash;this is the real answer to Deputy Byrne&mdash; I am told the area manager is going to provide a traffic control centre for bus movements in O'Connell Street.  He is going to decentralise the control of inspectors and keep them in constant touch with headquarters through a decentralised form of control.  They <Col N="655" /> are going to instal more time clocks to help buses attain regularity of movement. That, of course, will be accompanied by a further examination of the whole service.  That is typified by the particular examination they made in the Ballymun area, which resulted in a considerable amount of contentment to the people living there when the services and movements were altered to suit the majority.  Whenever a bus service is altered, however, it is always at somebody's disadvantage. The job of CIE is to see what they can do to satisfy the largest number of people.</P>
    <P>Now I want to make it quite clear that I have made a study of bus services abroad and the general city bus services here are of a very high standard.  The House can say I am wrong, but I take responsibility for CIE in saying that.  I believe the city bus services, particularly in regard to the number of people required to stand going to and from work, are of a high standard.  I am not saying they are perfect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan suggested in that connection that people would prefer to stand in buses as against having to wait or, not to misquote him, that CIE ought to consider that.  I think, if CIE really believed that a very large majority of the people living on the outskirts of Dublin would prefer to stand in a bus so that more people could be carried in the largest bus permitted to operate by the Garda, CIE might consider that.  So far as I am concerned, I asked them about this some time ago, about the advisability of workers standing in buses, with the idea that the workers might prefer it, and they might pay a lower fare.  I understand it has not found favour but I would hope that CIE would always consider that kind of idea if they thought it was likely to be popular.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that is the system in a great many countries in Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but as the <Col N="656" /> Deputy knows, a great many of the buses and trains in Europe are not specifically designed for standing. They are designed for sitting and standing and a huge number stand. What Deputy Ryan was thinking of was a bus specially designed in which people could stand almost entirely.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dunne and Deputy Byrne complained about the cost of bus services.  I have indicated already that the whole of the surplus of receipts over costs in the Dublin bus service, which is £380,000, represents .37d. contribution per passenger carried. That is a realistic figure and it means that, if the average person in Dublin goes 12 times a week on a CIE bus, the profit represented by those 12 journeys&mdash;we will not call it a profit; we will call it a surplus&mdash;is roughly 4½d.  Deputy Dunne spoke of someone who had to pay 25/- in fares.  The total surplus on that would be 2/-.  The position is, of course, different if you measure the estimated loss on the city railway services against the surplus on the buses.  The surplus on the buses is reduced by £160,000 and becomes £220,000.</P>
      <P>It is true that half the employees of CIE work in Dublin.  CIE provides a great deal of employment in Dublin and I do not think that the figure represented by a surplus of .37d. per passenger is excessive.  If you allow for the loss on the rail services, which should really be paid by the Dublin people, it becomes something very, very small indeed.  The only alternative is either to have the whole country pay more in taxes for the sake of the people in Dublin and raise the subsidy here by the amount of the surplus on the Dublin bus services or have Dublin Corporation take over the bus services and strike a large rate.  I do not think that is advisable.  I do not think it is a realistic proposal.  The fares on the Dublin city buses are broadly comparable with other bus services throughout Europe.  They are not necessarily either very low or very high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do hope Deputy Byrne will read, if he has not already done so, the Buchanan Report, which is regarded as a major study.  He will find in that <Col N="657" /> that the whole question of public transport is involved in the planning of a city and involved also in the new planning of a city.  CIE are in touch with Dublin Corporation in regard to all the plans that are being undertaken to deal with congestion and I am sure that, when the House hears the final report on Dublin traffic the enormous expense entailed in avoiding inconvenience to the public either through absence of parking or through difficulties in the movement of buses will be realised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin suggested that old age pensioners be given free tickets or reduced rates on the CIE bus services. I sympathise with that idea but I think it is better in the long run to channel advantages to the less well off in the community by raising the social services. I think the answer to that is that we hope to go on raising the social services so that the recipients thereof will be able to afford to pay the normal bus fares.  I do not think diverting subsidy in that particular form would be a good thing on the whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte asked about the future of CIE in relation to the changes that have taken place in the Six Counties.  CIE and the Ulster Transport Authority are in consultation and, if redundancy is involved, it may be taken that CIE will take a sympathetic attitude towards it.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies asked questions about the redundancy provisions. I have already dealt with redundancies in some detail.  I have pointed out that the redundancy payments voted by this House were wholly exceptional and it was made absolutely clear by the Taoiseach&mdash;I do not think I need quote his many references&mdash;that they would only be paid for a short period while a major reorganisation took place in CIE.  Indeed, I might even quote the late Deputy Norton who, as far back as 1955, hoped some of the redundancies could be met by transfer to other occupations.  Again, I do not want to suggest that was his ultimate view, but he was sufficiently optimistic to say that way back in 1955.</P>
    <P>Employment is buoyant in Dublin in some trades and occupations and in <Col N="658" /> some areas outside Dublin and we do not envisage a contraction in the road service of CIE.  We hope that, if there is a measure of redundancy in one direction or another, CIE will make satisfactory arrangements, first of all, with the unions for redundancy payments. We hope that a transfer of employment under present economic conditions may be possible.  May I make it clear that, if CIE have a particular agreement with a trade union in relation to road transport, this Bill does not break that agreement. It simply means that either the redundancy does not take place or that new arrangements have to be negotiated freely between CIE management and the trade unions.  I might add that the Congress of Unions proposals for severance pay are very moderate indeed compared with what this House has been paying under the 1958 Act. I only mention this in passing to show the very liberal character of redundancy payments under the 1958 Act, which, in turn, derive from earlier Acts in so far as railway employees are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Congress recommended there would be consultation between the trade union and the company concerned when considering redundancy and, if at all possible, alternative employment be offered, that appropriate notice be given and that one week's pay for every year of service be offered in the form of severance pay.  I dare say CIE would very much like to negotiate on that basis.  These were the general proposals but, as I have said, this is a matter for CIE, and there has been a long tradition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A question was raised in connection with examinations for clerical appointments to CIE.  The section alters the method of selection.  In all other ways they remain the same as provided for in the 1950 Act.  The present procedure whereby entrants to the clerical examination for CIE have to take some kind of written examination is totally out of date.  With modern accounting machines and the whole development of modern clerical work written examinations are not at all suitable and no other State company within my ambit has any statutory restriction whatever with regard to the appointment of clerical staff.  The position is that CIE are competing with other State companies to get suitable clerical staff and they are not able to get them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde asked if the Bill contained anything which affected the position in regard to the Rosslare-Fishguard service.  The only section of the Bill which is relevant is the one which enables CIE to be represented on the Board of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbour Company by officials instead of Board members.  That will be more convenient and they will keep in more executive touch with what is going on. As I have already indicated Rosslare is not being neglected.  Consultations are going on between CIE and British Railways through the medium of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company in regard to improvements in the service including access between the mainland and the pier.  I am glad to say that the new western regional manager of British Railways is taking a very active interest in this examination.  I am <Col N="662" /> hopeful that there will be a great improvement in the services and facilities available.  The traffic through Wexford, Waterford and the South, should thus expand.  It would be wrong to give details until the plan is agreed; and as Deputy Esmonde knows, that plan has to be sanctioned by British Railways and CIE.</P>
      <P>Technical questions are involved in the position of Rosslare pier as they always are involved in any harbour development.  As the Deputy knows Rosslare is not really a harbour but a pier sticking out into the sea.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry made some extraordinary statements about beet haulage.

The transport of beet is planned in advance in detail each year.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Donegan, I have had no substantial complaints in regard to the adequacies of CIE services for beet, wheat and barley haulage.</P>
      <P>I have no power to deal with individual hardluck cases as suggested by Deputy O'Donnell.  Further in reply to the Deputy, North of Ireland lorries cannot carry for reward down here.

      <Col N="663" /> There have been some remarkable increases in traffic because of the general growth of tourism and because of the fact that some of the bus services attracted a new class of tourist to the town even though there may have been some initial disadvantage from the closing of the railway.  Deputy Sweetman complained about the cleanliness of the main Cork rail services on one occasion.

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>Its purpose is to increase the salaries of all the members of the judiciary and as those Deputies who are good mathematicians will already have calculated, the new rates set out in section 1 represent percentage increases of 6 per cent for the Chief Justice; 10 per cent for the President of the High Court, Supreme Court judges, High Court judges and the President of the Circuit Court; and 12 per cent for ordinary circuit court judges and all district justices.  In all cases, the figures have been rounded to the nearest £5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases proposed will be readily recognised as constituting the ninth-round increase for the judiciary. As the House is aware, the ninth-round represents the emergence of a positive and comprehensive policy in relation to salaries and wages.  In accordance with that policy, the Government has already, with the <Col N="665" /> approval of the Dáil, given salary increases of 12 per cent to all the other groups who are paid from the public purse, including a not unsubstantial number of persons with salaries of the same order as those of most of the judiciary.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it would be manifestly unfair not to extend the benefits of the ninth-round to the judges.  There is, however, a good deal more involved than a sense of fair play; I am satisfied that the increases now proposed are unavoidable unless we are, by an act of default, seriously to disrupt the long established relationship in this field.</P>
    <P>By way of a brief example, let me take the case of a provincial district justice and a chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána on the maximum of his salary.  Down the years the salary of a district justice has always been substantially higher than that of a chief superintendent.  The chief superintendent, however, has got his ninth-round since the 1st of February this year, and the present position is that the district justice is, to an appreciable extent, less well-paid than the chief superintendent.  The increase now proposed for the district justice will restore their relative positions, though in fact the margin in the district justice's favour will have been narrowed.  This pattern indicates not only the necessity for the present proposals but also the reasonable basis which has been adopted.</P>
    <P>So far as circuit judges and district justices are concerned, the 12 per cent increase now proposed is a logical development of the action approved by the Dáil in relation to the other public services.  In the case of the judges of the superior courts, the present differentials in salary between them and the judges of the lower courts are such that existing relationships would be fundamentally upset if the increases were to stop short at the circuit judges.  Having considered all aspects of the matter the Government came to the conclusion that a modified ninth-round would be appropriate for the judges of the superior courts; hence the proposal to give them a 10 per cent increase, with the exception <Col N="666" /> of the Chief Justice for whom the increase proposed is 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains reasonable proposals designed to achieve these purposes. The total cost involved will be £18,900 in a full year.  I recommend the measure to the House for its favourable consideration on the ground that it proposes something which in present circumstances is unavoidable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give the reasons for our request to the Minister to defer this proposed salary increase. There is a certain difficulty in regard to the position concerning the judiciary.  In the past it has been generally believed&mdash;I recall the Minister making this case here&mdash;that salary increases for the judiciary are made on grounds which it is very hard to define.  For that reason, justification was made for the increases being given to the judiciary independent of increases given to other sections of the community.  The Minister made a case and established a point of view in regard to the making of salary increases in a certain category within our society.  Later on, he deserted that point of view and on the eighth round, he linked the increases then proposed with the increases which had been generally agreed upon for all other sections of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Minister intends to pursue that link so we are really in a new position.  The Minister's decision being so, we believe that if the judiciary are to be treated <Col N="667" /> in the same way as other people in society, if an attempt is being made to link a man with a salary of £5,000 or £6,000 a year to the man with an average of £7 or £8 a week, many people will find it difficult to justify any such nexus but the Minister seeks to do that here to-night.  I do not think anybody will hold that the three months' delay proposed here could impose any hardship on the upper echelons of the judiciary, the £3,000 to £6,500 group, and a fair case could be made for suggesting that in regard to district justices, the three months' delay could not impose any serious hardship.</P>
    <P>We should like to see the delay made in order to ensure that if we are bringing the judiciary into line with all other sections of the community in regard to the making of wage and salary increases, there will be a review of the whole system under which the judiciary is appointed and in that way that we shall try to establish in our society for the judiciary conditions and terms which we found desirable and so advantageous in regard to the rest of our society, the great majority of persons in important positions in our society.  The position of the judiciary is probably the most important position held by any group in a society.  The quality of the man on the bench, whether in the district court or the supreme court is of extreme importance to the welfare of the community because of the implications the quality of the judiciary has in regard to the personal lives and, in many cases, liberty of our citizens.  We believe that over the past 20 to 25 years a very good case has been made for ensuring that where professional or indeed other appointments are made, some form of independent commission should be available for the making of such appointments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to put to the House the reasons why we believe it is desirable to defer consideration of this Bill and its implications for a period of three months.  The Minister has made the case here that this is the ninth-round increase for the judiciary. My case is that if we are to treat the judiciary in this way, then we should extend this levelling up and down, whichever way you like to put it, all round.  If the judiciary are given substantial salaries, in the first instance, and substantial increases, as this is a substantial increase in regard to certain sections of the judiciary at any rate, then we know that the increases and the salaries are being given to men in whom we can have the highest confidence. In this way we are behaving in a responsible way in dealing with public money.  I do not believe the position should be allowed to continue by which the members of the judiciary are appointed to these responsible and very highly paid posts without some scheme whereby a fair assessment of their capabilities can be made.  This applies to virtually all other sections in relation to the making of professional appointments in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Minister on other occasions has suggested that the judiciary should be assessed independently and he has now, as I have said, established a new principle that they should be assessed at the same time and in the same way as persons in ordinary employment. We do not believe that, in view of the very undesirable manner in which the majority of the members of the bench have been appointed to their posts, except in exceptional cases, and the tradition since the formation of the <Col N="669" /> State of making judicial appointments on almost inevitably political grounds rather than on grounds of qualification, we are justified in the first instance in paying large salaries, or, when it suits us, linking these people to the ordinary conditions of life within our society and again when it suits us excluding them from the responsibilities and conditions to which other sections of society are subjected.</P>
    <P>Most of us accept this as a reality. We have adverted to it on a number of other occasions and we feel that as a significant change has been made here by the Minister, this is a good opportunity for the Government and the House to reconsider the whole question of the making of judicial appointments.  Having done that and having re-established the principle that appointments will be made strictly on the merits and the qualifications of the persons presenting themselves to become members of the judiciary, we can then assess the desirable salaries which should be paid.</P>

      <P>In the circumstances, I bow to your ruling, Sir.  I put that point of view to the Minister in order to see whether he is prepared to consider the position which exists and whether he will bring his proposals back to the Government and put this point of view to them.  This is a proposal which is not very urgent. Nobody will suffer hardship of any kind if the proposal is deferred.  We are quite satisfied that the time has come when this whole question of the position and the method of appointment of the judiciary should be considered. Having done that, if they merit the payment of salaries of this order in all grades, particularly the higher grades, then let the Dáil decide that.  We should make sure that salaries of this size are paid on professional merits alone and not on <Col N="670" /> political qualifications which in so many cases are virtually the sole qualifications which many of these people have when appointed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The point put by Deputy Tully was that the reasons for the amendment are set out in the motion, and that he and his colleague wanted to argue that for the reasons set out in the motion, the House should support the amendment.  That is as I understand it.  It is not my point of view but I can appreciate the difficulty in which the mover of the amendment is in not being able to discuss the motion.  It does not seem there is anything <Col N="671" /> to recommend the amendment unless perhaps, for the purpose of opening up another discussion.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Bill itself, it is certainly an eloquent commentary on the Government's management of the financial and economic affairs of the country that within two years of coming to the House and asking us to increase the salaries of perhaps the most highly paid public servants in the State, they now find it necessary to come back and ask the House to increase those salaries further in order to compensate the judges for the reduction in the real value of their salaries occasioned by Government policy during the past two years.</P>
      <P>When the last Bill was being discussed in the House, the Fine Gael Party opposed it.  We did so because it was introduced in an atmosphere of a wage freeze for everyone else but a substantial increase in salaries for the judiciary.  We made the distinction to which the Minister referred this evening between the lower paid members of the judiciary&mdash;the district justices&mdash; and the higher paid members, the High Court and Supreme Court judges.  These factors do not apply now.  The wage freeze and pay pause atmosphere in which the last Bill was introduced, that is, a wage freeze and pay pause for others, does not apply now.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is, as mentioned by the Minister, though he did not perhaps do it in so many words, that because of the increases in the cost of living which have taken place in the past two years, primarily because of the Fianna Fáil turnover tax, it is now necessary to try to adjust upwards the salaries of those who have suffered a reduction in the real value of their wages and salaries by reason of Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those reasons, I do not feel we would be justified in opposing this Bill on this occasion.  I do not want in any way to try to circumvent the ruling of the Chair, but with regard to the general question raised by Deputy Dr. Browne, I feel it would be right at this stage to state very briefly <Col N="672" /> that we in Fine Gael believe the situation must be maintained wherein the Government of this country are responsible for the administration of justice in this country and that that being so, the Government must have responsibility, in a responsible and reasonable manner, for the appointment of the judiciary after whatever consultation is necessary&mdash;that the Government must be responsible to this House, and through it to the country, for any appointments they make.  We believe that is the correct position to maintain and that it should be maintained.  I shall not say any more on the subject, but I feel that once the matter has been referred to, it is right to make our views clear on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  The best excuse for giving the judges and the other members of the judiciary the proposed increases in salaries is the fact that only Deputy Dr. Browne has opposed them in the House.  All types of allegations have been made against justices and judges in the country.  In all fairness, there is not a single word of truth in these allegations.  I have never heard anybody worth his salt get up anywhere and truthfully and fairly say that a justice or judge had been wrong in a decision.  It is therefore most unfair that any Deputy should rise to cast reflections on them.</P>
      <P>If we do pay them more, what will the extra amount mean?  It will mean very little, all told.  Surely we should be anxious to put those people in a position in which nobody can say somebody's sister should bring along a turkey or a duck to get them to give a favourable decision?  It is time we paid justices and judges properly so that these reflections could not be cast on them.  No matter what Deputy Dr. Browne or anybody else says, it is time we put our judiciary beyond that sort of thing, high above suggestions of bribery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister were to go even further and give them much greater increases, I would still back him in this very important matter.  We all know what is said throughout the country.  It <Col N="673" /> is very common to hear: &ldquo;See this man or that man and so and so can be done&rdquo;.  That is not true, as I happen to know.  We must get that attitude out of the public mind once and for all.  I congratulate the Minister, therefore, for having had the gumption to come in here with this Bill.  His proposal is only commonsense and right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I can speak freely because so far I have not found myself before any of these gentlemen and I hope I never will in the years to come.  What I am about to say is exactly what my Party think about this matter.  We are not opposed to paying justices and judges fair salaries.  What we are opposed to is paying or offering to pay people like them on a basis which up to now was not acceptable to the Government.  The Minister is on record as having stated when the last increase in judicial salaries was being voted that he did not feel there should be a connection between rates of wages and the salaries being paid to the judiciary.  It was a rather extraordinary thing, and I shall quote it for the Minister on the next Stage if he does not take my word.  I have not got the passage with me now&mdash;I have mislaid it&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now being asked to believe that the Government feel the wages or salaries, call them what you like, of the judiciary should be related to the wage rates which have been negotiated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the employers. Are we to accept that in future all wage increases granted on a national basis will include the rates of salaries which the judiciary will receive?  I should like the Minister to state that.  I honestly believe a principle is involved here, a very big principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> The Minister does say that the increases proposed will readily be recognised as constituting the ninth round increase for the judiciary.  It could not possibly be the ninth round.  I know &ldquo;the ninth round&rdquo; has now become a descriptive phrase rather than what it was for the workers, a ninth round.  In this case, I think the judiciary have received only a very small number of rounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, this is the fifth round for the judiciary.  Will somebody come along to-morrow and say: &ldquo;We are four rounds behind and we must make them up&rdquo; or does the Minister intend to put all the four together and make it a decent one?</P>
      <P>We are not talking here about a floor of £1.  We are not talking about £1 or 30/- a week increase.  Though the Minister says here that the Government did not approve for other types of Government employees an increase representing the ninth round, he is as well aware as I am that there are still some sections of Government employees who have not got their ninth round.  The Minister can take my word for it that they need it a whole lot worse than the judiciary do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Government, I am sure the Minister is anxious to see all the people employed by the Government paid as decent a rate as he is anxious to see paid to the judiciary.  If we are to accept that the whole question of the ninth round is to be the accepted thing, is it not extraordinary that it did not occur to the Government that social welfare recipients would also be entitled to something under the ninth round wage increase?  Why is it that they are so anxious to see that those who are being paid what we might call reasonably well get the ninth round while those who are getting very little are, in fact, passed over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, while it is not the Minister's <Col N="675" /> Department, might I suggest that a word in the ear of the responsible Minister and his other colleagues in the Government on this matter, if he feels so inclined, might have the desired effect?  I am sure the Minister knows that there is a certain amount of unrest in the country at the present time because of something people describe in various ways.  It is felt that some of the people sitting on the bench do not seem to be terribly particular about the work they are doing.  In fact, on occasions, the sentences which they dole out seem to be given either because of the fact that the justice or the judge has not got the time or the inclination to deal with the matter as justice would suggest or because he just does not know.  Now, in either case, I think it is just too bad but I do not think anybody here, no matter where they may come from&mdash;whether they may come from Dublin city or from Mayo&mdash;can raise their hands in horror and talk about insulting the judiciary and about the wonderful job they are doing and all the money they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party believe that the people who are responsible for the administration of justice are entitled to be paid an adequate salary but we also believe that they should do the job they are supposed to do. Last week or the week before last the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was asked a question by Deputy Desmond of Cork.  The question asked how many postmen employed by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are receiving an increase of £1, 18/-, 16/- and under 14/- under the ninth round wage increase.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs gave the figures which showed that nobody at all got the £1 and, as the figure dropped, they got up to thousands of postmen under 14/-.  He came across with the pat answer that those people are only part-time.  When I asked a supplementary question the Minister followed it up by saying that some of them were working only five or six hours per day, that they were part-time and, therefore, were not entitled to £1, the full benefit of the ninth <Col N="676" /> round wage increase.  But this is the only job they have and they are attempting to live on it.</P>
    <P>Is it not extraordinary that, here, nobody can suggest that those people about whom we are talking tonight work even five or six hours per day? Nobody has suggested that they should be cut down in their remuneration or in the amount of increase they get because of the fact that they do not work the full 48-hour or 45-hour week.  They must get the full benefit despite the fact that they are being offered an increase in wages under this Bill as large as some of those postmen are getting for their full week's work.</P>
    <P>The Minister can come back to me and say that there is a big difference between the work the judiciary do and the work of a postman.  Both of them are doing very important work, for which a very big amount of trust is required.  Both of them, in many cases, must depend on what they get from the State for their work to rear their families.  Yet, the distinction is made that one group, because they are at the lower end of the income scale, must be content to get their percentage rate according to the number of hours they work, not according to their weekly salary or wage, while for the other group it is quite all right; they get the ten per cent or the six per cent on what they are receiving over the year.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister for Justice whisper in the ear of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and tell him that he has discovered that it is wrong to try to break them down into the number of hours they work?</P>

      <P>I have no intention of debating it.  I wanted to make it clear that the amendment which we have in here&mdash;which is apparently misunderstood by everybody except the people who are moving it&mdash;is not the original proposal which the Labour Party put before the House.  It was only because we felt it would be possible to have both discussed at the one time, saving the time of the House in doing so, that this motion was put in this way.  I am most surprised that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle refused to allow the mover of the motion to explain what the actual intention was.</P>

      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle did not interfere with Deputy Dr. Browne when he moved the amendment.  It was only when he went outside the terms of the amendment and the Bill that the Chair intervened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>But Deputy Dr. Browne was trying to explain why the motion was put down in a certain way.</P>

      <P>Deputy <Col N="678" /> Dr. Browne was trying to explain the system of appointment of the judiciary and the Chair pointed out that the matter did not arise.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully might not be aware that the Ceann Comhairle was in the Chair when I asked the question at the beginning of the debate as to whether the motion was being taken with the amendment and the chair said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody is being very helpful tonight.  It is almost a quarter past ten.  I was under the impression that the amendment, which was moved by Dr. Browne, could be explained to the House because, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the House will appreciate, the proposal &ldquo;To delete `now' and add `this day three months' &rdquo; would require explanation. I was under the impression that the motion would be entitled to explain why this is so.</P>
      <P>I should also explain that the Labour Party were not aware that the motion would come up&mdash;although ordered&mdash;for discussion to-night and, in fact, the people who were to move and second the motion were not present.  One is out of the country on Government business and the other is ill, and we thought we could be facilitated by the Government in this case.  We quite appreciate that because of what happened earlier, it was not possible to have the matter deferred but we were under the impression that it could be deferred, and therefore would not come before the House at all.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Dr. Browne, whose name is the third on the motion, did agree to move it, it was with the intention of explaining what actually was in the minds of those who put down the original motion and why the amendment was worded in a particular way. Because of the fact that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle felt&mdash;I suppose, rightly, because he is the person to interpret what is right or wrong here&mdash; that this could not be done, I am sure the House appreciates the extreme difficulty in which the Labour Party have been put as a result of the refusal to allow the terms to be explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been proved that it was misinterpreted <Col N="679" /> by the speech made by at least one of those Deputies who spoke after Deputy Dr. Browne.  It is quite obvious that this was taken as a direct attempt to make a charge against the judiciary, an attempt to prevent them being properly paid and all the other things that go with it.  Nothing was farther from our minds but we felt, and still feel, that when the Minister said in his opening remarks that the increase proposed would be readily recognised as constituting the ninth round increase for the judiciary, it would require as much explanation to the general public as the amendment required to this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> There are very many people in the country who will not recognise this as the ninth round of wage increases and very many people&mdash;and one cannot blame them&mdash;only too anxious to point out that since the social welfare beneficiaries got 2/6 last year, the judges have got quite a sizeable increase.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
