    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Deputies will no doubt recall that in his Budget Statement on 14th April last, the Minister for Finance announced increases in the rates of non-contributory old age and blind pensions, widows' pensions and unemployment assistance.  This Bill is designed to give legislative effect to these increases and also to bring about some further extensions and improvements of both the Social Insurance and the Social Assistance schemes.</P>
      <P>I shall deal first with the Budget increases in Social Assistance, which it is intended will come into effect on 1st August next, and with the consequential extensions in the Social Assistance scheme.</P>
      <P>The increase proposed in the rates of non-contributory old age and blind pensions is 2/6 a week, which will bring the new rates of these pensions to 37/6d, 32/6d, 27/6d, 22/6d, 17/6d, 12/6d, and 7/6d, according to the means of the pensioner as set out in the table in section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase proposed in rates of unemployment assistance, which is dealt with in section 3, is also 2/6 a week, but this applies to both the personal rate of assistance and to the allowance payable in respect of an adult dependant. Thus the maximum rate of unemployment assistance for a married man with a dependent wife will be increased <Col N="699" /> from 47/6d a week to 52/6d a week in an urban area, and from 39/6d a week to 44/6d a week in a rural area.  The increase in the maximum rates of unemployment assistance automatically increases the means limit for assistance purposes and will thus bring within the scope of the scheme persons who at present fail to qualify for assistance because their means are slightly in excess of the limit.</P>
    <P>As regards widows' non-contributory pensions the increase proposed is again 2/6d a week for the widow herself.  As a result, the rates of pension for a widow with no dependent children would range from 36/- a week at the maximum by steps of 5/- down to 11/- a week according to the means of the widow.  A widow whose means were just outside the limit for 11/-pension would, however, get no pension even though the margin by which her means exceeded the limit might be considerably less than 11/- a week.  To obviate this and to follow the line adopted in previous years when a similar situation obtained in relation to either old age pensions or widows' non-contributory pensions, it has been decided to extend the scale of means and rates of widows' non-contributory pensions this year, so as to add a new rate of pension of 6/- at the minimum. This new rate is included in the table in section 4.  The introduction of this new rate will also save some widows whose means increase from losing more by way of pension than their increase of means.  For instance, a widow with two children whose means go up from £3 10s. a week to £3 15s. a week will not lose her 11/- pension altogether but will have it reduced to 6/- instead.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, this Bill, in addition to providing for the Budget increases, includes provisions for further improvements and extensions of the social welfare schemes which it has been found desirable and possible to make this year.  The first of these represents a completely new development in this country in relation to old age pensions, both contributory and non-contributory, in that it will enable allowances to be paid <Col N="700" /> as part of pension for qualified children. These proposals are dealt with in sections 5, 8, 9 and 10.  I have felt for some time and, no doubt, all Deputies will agree with me, that it is anomalous that a person approaching the age of 70 could be in receipt of disability benefit or unemployment benefit, which included an allowance for children, but that immediately on reaching that age and becoming entitled only to an old age contributory pension, no allowance could be paid in respect of the children apart, of course, from any children's allowances under the general children's allowances scheme.</P>
    <P>A similar anomaly arises in the case of persons in receipt of unemployment assistance or widow's non-contributory pension who qualify for non-contributory old age pension at the age of 70.  To remove these anomalies, the Bill proposes to provide for the payment of allowances to old age (contributory) pensioners for qualified children at the same rates as are paid in respect of persons in receipt of disability benefit, unemployment benefit or widow's (contributory) pension, that is, 13/- for each of the first two qualified children and 8/- for each additional qualified child, and for the payment in respect of qualified children of non-contributory old age pensioners of allowances at the same rate as those which are paid with widow's (non-contributory) pension and unemployment assistance, i.e. 10/-for each of the first two qualified children and 5/- for each additional qualified child.</P>
    <P>In addition to extending the scale of means and rates of pension on the non-contributory side section 5 will enable £39 to be disregarded in assessing means for pension purposes in respect of each qualified child.  The following example will illustrate the effects of this concession.  A pensioner with a wife and two young children, could, if he had no other assessable means, earn up to £3 10s a week and still receive the maximum pension payable in his case, £2 17s. 6d. a week as against £1 a week at present.  If his earnings did not exceed £9 a week, he could still receive a pension of the <Col N="701" /> minimum rate of 7s. 6d. a week.  It is estimated that these proposals will cost some £73,000 in a full year on the contributory old age pension side, while on the non-contributory side it is estimated that the cost will be some £158,000 in a full year.  Children's allowances under the general scheme will, of course, already be in payment in respect of the children involved, and the same qualification conditions will obtain in respect of the allowances granted as part of pension as obtain for the general children's allowances scheme and as obtain in respect of children under the other forms of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>These are, briefly, that the child is under the age of 16 years, is ordinarily resident in the State and is not detained in a reformatory or industrial school.  For a pensioner to be entitled to the proposed allowance in respect of a qualified child, the child must, of course, be normally resident with him or her and questions as to the normal residence of the child will be decided under the rules already made in relation to the general children's allowances scheme.  Deputies will observe that provision is made in sections 5 and 8 for the making of an order bringing these allowances into force.  For administrative reasons it would not be possible to bring them into payment concurrently with the Budget increases, but it is anticipated that my Department would be in a position to commence payment at the beginning of November next.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for two amendments of the social insurance scheme. The first of these relates to the insurability of pensionable teachers in the training colleges for national teachers.  These teachers are at present compulsorily insurable for all benefits under the Social Insurance scheme and pay contributions at the full rate where their remuneration is within the insurability limit.  Their position is, however, in reality no different from that of pensionable teachers in national secondary or vocational schools or domestic science training colleges for whom contributions at reduced rates, which reckon only for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes, are <Col N="702" /> payable.  Section 6 of the Bill, therefore, makes provision to enable the Minister to make regulations treating these teachers for insurance purposes in exactly the same way as pensionable national, secondary and vocational teachers and teachers in domestic science training colleges.</P>
    <P>The other amendment in relation to the social insurance scheme refers to the amount which may be paid by way of treatment benefit in any financial year and is dealt with in section 7.  At the present there is an overriding limit of half a million pounds on the amount which may be paid each year in treatment benefits.  Treatment benefit is now limited to dental benefit, optical benefit and medical and surgical appliances benefit, the appliances in question being, contact lenses and hearing aids.  These services are, in fact, provided under the Social Welfare Acts as a temporary measure pending the full implementation of the Health Act, and the amount which may be paid is agreed between the Minister for Finance and myself each year subject to the overriding limit. Expenditure on treatment benefit is increasing and it is feared that unless the overriding limit is removed the scheme might have to be terminated or suspended during the course of a financial year for lack of money. Section 7 proposes, therefore, to remove the overriding limit and leave the amount to be spent in any year to be agreed upon between the Minister for Finance and myself, the amount involved being, of course, approved by the Dáil as part of the year's estimates.</P>
    <P>I now come to two sections aimed at effecting improvements in the unemployment assistance scheme.  The first of these, dealt with in section 11, is intended to remove a cause of grievance arising from the existing provisions regarding the operative date of revised decisions or decisions on appeals concerning qualification certificates under the Unemployment Assistance Acts.  Its general effect will be to enable persons applying for unemployment assistance to be paid retrospectively or to be paid at a higher rate retrospectively where favourable decisions <Col N="703" /> revising earlier decisions have been given.  This will ensure that the time taken to deal with cases and to follow unavoidable administrative procedures will not detrimentally affect the amount payable to the applicant where his application or appeal is successful.  The amendment will also help to clarify the law in so far as it relates to overpayments of unemployment assistance arising in the converse situation where a revised decision results in a reduction of the unemployment assistance payable, and there has been fraudulent concealment of means. It is estimated that the annual cost of this improvement will be about £5,000.</P>
    <P>The second of these improvements, dealt with in section 12, is intended to give some relief to the persons who are employed seasonally as fishermen either working on their own account or on a share basis.  This matter has been the subject of a great deal of representations over the years.  Earnings from employment under a contract of service are not regarded as means for the purpose of unemployment assistance.  A fisherman working on his own account or on a share basis is not normally employed under a contract of service and, accordingly, any income which he derives from his fishing is treated as means.  He may thus be unable to obtain a qualification certificate without which he cannot get unemployment assistance, or his means may be assessed on such a level as to reduce the rate of unemployment assistance payable to him.  It has been represented to me repeatedly that this bears unfairly on these seasonal fishermen. The provisions of the section are designed to allow a proportion, up to an overriding limit of £80 a year, of the income derived from seasonal fishing to be disregarded in assessing a person's means for unemployment assistance purposes and this would have the effect of considerably reducing the impact of such earnings on title to unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>And finally on the Social Assistance side, in section 13, I come to an improvement which I have had in mind for some time.  This relates to the minimum age limits for widow's <Col N="704" /> non-contributory pension.  Up to two years ago a widow could not qualify for a non-contributory pension if she was less than 48 years of age unless she had a qualified child or children. If a widow with a qualified child or children had not attained the age of 48 years within six months after her last or only qualified child ceased to be qualified, she lost her pension.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1962, the minimum age in the latter type of case was reduced to 40. Since then I had the matter further examined and I feel that both of these minimum age limits can operate rather harshly.  The only real argument for them is that a widow without children should be in a position to provide for herself by working.  If she can so provide and in fact does so, the means test would ensure that her pension is terminated or reduced appropriately in accordance with her means. Circumstances can arise, however, to prevent such a widow from working, for example, incapacity for work, lack of suitable employment locally, domestic circumstances, which the minimum age limit cannot allow for.</P>
    <P>Section 13, therefore, proposes to remove the minimum age limits completely, thus leaving the question of title to a widow's non-contributory pension to be determined on the basis of the widow's need as measured by the means test and not on a minimum age limit fixed somewhat arbitrarily, which does not permit account to be taken of the widow's capacity for work or her financial or domestic circumstances. The cost of this concession is estimated to be of the order of £27,000 a year.  The maximum age limit for receipt of a widow's non-contributory pension will remain at 70, at which age the question of title to an old age pension, either non-contributory or contributory, arises.</P>
    <P>To conclude it might be helpful to Deputies if I were to summarise the cost to the Exchequer of the various proposals which I have outlined above. On the Social Assistance side, the total costs are estimated to amount to £1,290,000 in a full year.  All of this expenditure will fall on the Exchequer. <Col N="705" /> The annual cost of the proposal for payment of allowances in respect of children of old age (contributory) pensioners which will for the present all fall on the Exchequer, is estimated at £73,000.  The overall cost to the Exchequer will, therefore, be £1,363,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>I have much pleasure in recommending this measure to Dáil Éireann as a further step in the evolution of social welfare schemes which will meet the needs of our people and I would ask for expeditious and favourable consideration of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The increases being granted under this Bill apply to a number of social welfare recipients.  It seems to me that the general approach to pensioners, not only social welfare recipients but also State pensioners, is different from the approach adopted in relation to wage and salary earners under the State.</P>
      <P>The increases granted in respect of social welfare recipients, which the Bill proposes to implement, and which, as the Minister has said, were announced in the Budget, and the pension increases which have been granted under the auspices of the Minister for Finance, have all been implemented for a later date this year, either August, in some cases, or later in others.  It seems to me that that decision operates harshly in so far as wage and salary adjustments have all taken effect from last February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that over the years it has been the practice, for administrative purposes, to apply social welfare increases generally from August or maybe, in some cases, from an even later date.  That may have been reasonable enough where the increases were granted on the basis of a Budget decision which was announced as policy in the month of April or May but in this year circumstances appear to me to have been different.  The turnover tax came into effect in November last and started a very substantial rise in the cost of living.  In fact, the cost of living index figure for mid-May, which was recently published, shows that between mid-May, 1963 and mid-May, 1964 there was a rise in the cost of living index figure of 12 points, which <Col N="706" /> is a substantial rise, and that even since mid-February the rise was five or six points.</P>
    <P>The wage and salary increases which were decided earlier this year, as I have said, applied both to private employment and State personnel in the case of the Garda, the Army, teachers, Post Office staff and others as well as civil servants.  These increases applied from February.  That decision, making the increases applicable as from February, obviously was taken because of the increases in the cost of living which had occurred from November. Since then, certain further increases in taxes have been applied in the Budget but, at least, it was agreed, not merely by private employers but by the State, that increases in wages and salaries should apply from February.  In other words, they applied from the earliest date subsequent to the negotiations, and these increases were designed to compensate for the rise in costs due to the increases in clothes, food, footwear, and so on, and other increases arising out of the turnover tax which came into effect in November.</P>
    <P>On many occasions I have expressed the view that we should evolve here a system which, I understand, is in operation in certain countries in Europe, whereby pensions, whether contributory pensions in the form of State pensions or pensions or benefits under the social welfare code, should automatically rise on the basis of variation in the cost of living figure. Over many years we have accepted as part of a wage and salary policy that when the cost of living rises wage and salary adjustments are made.  These adjustments have been made on the basis of applications to the Labour Court in certain cases or by means of the conciliation and arbitration machinery for civil servants, teachers and State personnel, or whatever machinery is applicable to the particular category, but, by and large, the pattern is the same, that whatever increase in wages and salaries is applicable to one section, generally applies right across the board or, certainly, applies to similar categories in the public or private sector, with the exception of pensioners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> No section of the community has been more adversely affected by rises in the cost of living than pensioners in all categories.  In most cases pensioners or persons in receipt of social welfare benefits are incapable of earning much.  Perhaps some of them can earn a small amount but by and large they are people who are outside the normal categories in a position to earn an income for themselves.  Therefore they are unable to get the compensation which other sections can get.  They have a limited bargaining power because they have no trade union or other association or organisation to negotiate on their behalf.  For these reasons, it is generally recognised that pensioners, whether they are under the social welfare code, or are receiving pensions from State or semi-State concerns, or from private firms have not received adequate treatment.  We will have to evolve some system which would enable increases to be granted because if the cost of living rises for wage earners, it also rises for pensioners and it is generally recognised that the increases which have taken place in the cost of living, particularly in the cost of essentials, justify increases in wages and salaries.  Therefore the Government should have another look at this matter, and this applies not only to the services administered by the Minister for Social Welfare but to the general State attitude to this matter.</P>
    <P>In the past, a different approach was perhaps reasonable.  Prior to the last war, the approach was that pensions of one sort or another were paid on the basis of a proportion of the salary or wages at retirement date.  That was reasonable enough when the cost of living was constant and the value of money remained stable, but the effects of the war, the rises in prices since then, and the general inflationary tendency which has taken place, and which appears to continue without interruption, make it more and more difficult for pensioners to exist.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with a number of matters such as old age pensions, unemployment assistance, widows' and <Col N="708" /> orphans' pensions and the Social Welfare Act of 1962 which deals with sickness benefit.  One of the difficulties which arise when considering a Bill such as this is that it involves a great deal of research into previous enactments. Deputies and others are often consulted about the rights of people under these Acts and short of being a skilled lawyer with access to the various statutes involved, it is difficult to say what the position is, say, in respect to the means test for a widow's non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>The Minister endeavoured in his speech to explain the changes which are being made.  One change which would be an improvement would be to incorporate in the latest Social Welfare Bill the precise terms applicable to the different categories of pensioners.  Take, for example, section 4 of this Bill which applies to non-contributory pensions and increases the means an applicant may have before being disqualified for a pension. The section being amended is section 20 of the 1935 Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.  That section was amended by section 105 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952 which was subsequently amended by the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1962, so that there are four enactments, as far as I can see, involved instead of the position being restated in a single section which would make it clear what precise terms were applicable to an applicant at a particular time.</P>
    <P>The decision to end the minimum age limit in respect of a widow's non-contributory pension is one that commends itself to everyone.  This has been the subject of criticism for a long time and seemed to have no valid basis, and it operated harshly in a number of cases.  The Minister mentioned the figure of £73,000 so I gather that there cannot be a great number involved. Certainly the change is in the right direction.  Another change is in respect of national teachers.  This is dealt with in the explanatory memorandum.  As I understand the position, section 12 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952 provides that regulations may modify the Social Welfare Act in its application to persons employed as teachers in national <Col N="709" /> schools under the rules and regulations of national schools.  Section 6 of this Bill proposes to bring under section 12 the professional staff of the training colleges who train national school teachers.  I take it this amendment is made at the request of the teachers in order to reduce the amount of their contribution.  This exemption so far as I am aware also applies to civil servants, members of the Defence Forces and of certain authorities.</P>
    <P>Another change is in respect of treatment benefit and is to remove the ceiling of £500,000.  The Minister mentioned that pending the full implementation of the Health Act, this was being introduced as a temporary measure.  We would be interested to hear from the Minister what is intended in regard to the full implementation of the Health Act and if the full implementation depends on the consideration being given at present to the health services generally by the Special Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Labour Party naturally welcome any improvement in social welfare benefits or assistance and for that reason we give our wholehearted support to the Bill before the House.  I suppose it would be too much to hope we are going in the direction in which we should be going, that is, towards social welfare benefits without a means test.</P>
      <P>The Minister has suggested that in the Bill he is easing the means test but unfortunately the sections in respect of which he is easing it will not give very much relief.  For instance, I do not believe that, with present money values, it matters very much to somebody who has a couple of hundred pounds per year if he is allowed another 6/- per week.  The Minister may disagree with me there and may feel something big is being done when he is allowing somebody a pension of 6/-per week.  A sum of 6/- in 1964 is an extremely small amount and I fear the Minister is putting too much value on this concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice the Minister has agreed to remove completely the age limit for qualification for non-contributory widows' pensions.  Because it is already covered under existing legislation by <Col N="710" /> the means test, the age limit applies only to a very small number of people and usually people in the hardship category.  Therefore we are glad to see that this limit has been taken away. I would again appeal to the Minister, however, to see to it that the inspectors who go out to interview those people applying for non-contributory benefits stop the horrible habit they have of putting a value on very small quantities of vegetables or a small piece of land owned by some of these people.  Again recently I have had cause to draw to the Minister's attention a case where somebody who applied for a non-contributory widow's pension was ruled out because she was alleged to have an income of £12 over the amount allowed, and £10 of that was the value put on a useless piece of land attached to the House. Can the Minister imagine anything meaner than that?  The person who put that value on the land must have known that by so doing he was ruling out this unfortunate creature from benefit to which she was justly entitled.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister have a look at that matter again and have this practice stopped because anybody who goes out the country and looks at a derelict garden attached to a house and says the yearly value of that is £10 or £12 is talking through his hat. It is absolutely no value to the person living in the house.  I have on numerous occasions paid tribute to the Minister and his officials for the excellent and humane way in which they are carrying out their duties.  Let us not have a continuation of this one blot, because it is one thing which is bringing the Department into disrepute.  I do not want to have to refer to this again.  This is at least the fourth occasion on which I have had to raise it on Estimates or otherwise.  I shall be glad if the Minister will now deal with it so that it will not arise in this context again.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister has acceded to the request made by myself and other members of the Labour Party over the past 12 or 18 months to have children's allowances granted to old age pensioners who so qualify. The Minister was kind enough to say <Col N="711" /> here on one occasion in reply to a question that as a result of the representations made, he was considering the matter.  I am glad to see he has now done something about it, and even if he does not throw any bouquets in the way of the Labour Party for suggesting it to him, we welcome the inclusion of this provision.  It is rather a pity when the decision was taken that it could not be put into operation earlier than 1st November. That date is a long way off and it means that people who are depending on this allowance must wait several months before they benefit by it.</P>
    <P>This, of course, also applies to the widows and other people who will benefit as a result of the means test being relaxed.  Perhaps there is some reason we do not understand why it should take months and months to decide this matter and then several months before it can be operated. There must be a good reason for it or this long delay would not occur but it is rather a pity that the thing should be spoiled by people having to wait so long.  The amount of money involved is relatively small.  There are not so many people over 70 years of age who have young children.  There are unfortunately enough individual cases of hardship in this respect, of people who were drawing unemployment benefit or disability benefit and getting benefit for their children, but who found when they reached 70 years of age, that the only benefit they could get was for themselves and their wives.  This is a worthwhile provision and the Minister should get credit for putting it into operation.</P>
    <P>The fact that this also applies to contributory old age pensions is only right.  I previously paid tribute to the Government for introducing the contributory old age pensions.  I repeat that is an excellent piece of social legislation and we could go a long way on that road.  One of the things missing in this Bill is provision for the social welfare benefits section.  Apart from the old age pension, no increase is being given to the benefit section. I cannot understand the thinking of <Col N="712" /> the present administration on this point because last year when the increase of 2/6 was given to the social assistance section, I distinctly remember the Taoiseach, in answer to an intervention by me about the benefit section, saying that if the assistance section are entitled to 2/6, then the benefit section are entitled to twice that amount.  That is fair enough.  They got 5/-, although it was a couple of months later.</P>
    <P>Is it not an extraordinary thing that what was all right 12 months ago is not all right now, that when it is deemed the assistance section require 2/6 to compensate them for an increase in the cost of living of ten to 12 points&mdash; I think that is the reason it is being given to them; it puts a very low value on a point increase&mdash;the benefit section do not get anything at all?  I know the argument has been made that every increase in the benefits paid to the benefit section means a consequent increase in the cost of stamps to the insured person and to the employer.  I am a trade union official and I have never yet heard a working man or woman object to a reasonable increase in the cost of their stamps, if they knew it would be applied to the improvement of the conditions of their less well-off brethren.  If it goes to relieve people who are sick or unemployed, there is and has not been any complaint.  Even if the Minister felt he had to do what might be an unpopular thing&mdash;to increase the cost of stamps in order to increase benefits &mdash;I think he should do so because I honestly believe that the benefit section are worse off as a result of the last Budget and what went before it than any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cosgrave said, the person who was in a job was able to recover what he needed, or portion of it, in order to live; the assistance section get a halfcrown in August to pay for increases that have occurred since last November; but the unfortunate person in the benefit section gets nothing at all.  The Minister has slipped up badly in this section and I ask him to have another look at it, if at all possible, before the Bill becomes law because a very definite error has been made and it should be dealt with now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> As regards giving the allowances for children to those with old age pensions &mdash;the non-contributory people&mdash;and qualifying them for benefit, I assume it is something on the same lines as what is at present given to those drawing non-contributory pensions.  It will follow the same pattern, but while that is so, I believe it would be far better if the whole rotten system of means examination were removed.  Although fantastic figures have been quoted from time to time as to what it would cost to give no-means test social benefits, I think the Minister will agree that the cost of administering the present system is extremely high.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also introduced something with which I entirely agree. A person who applies for a qualification certificate under existing legislation cannot get any benefit until the certificate is granted, even though the investigation may take months.  He suggests there should be retrospective effect in this respect and that assistance should be paid from the date of application. Can the Minister do anything about the present system of investigating claims, because while it may be all right that somebody who applies for a qualification certificate eventually gets it and will now get whatever assistance he was entitled to from the date of application, he has to live in the meantime. The same applies to people who are applying for disability benefit and who for some reason have been disqualified from receiving it.  Where there is an appeal, I do not know what is going wrong but the Minister is aware because of questions addressed to him in the House and from his experience in his Department that month after month passes and the matter is still under active consideration.  I do not know where the mistake is being made or who is responsible but the Minister must carry the can here for it.  He should do something about it, and if there are not sufficient investigating officers to have matters dealt with quickly, he should have extra officers appointed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two other matters to which I wish to refer.  One is the question of the person who is working and becomes unemployed but because he has a smallholding on which he cannot live&mdash;otherwise he would not be working for hire&mdash;or has some form of income and because that is assessed at more than 6/8d. per day &mdash;that is the figure, I think&mdash;is not entitled to draw unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>It does not matter if he is a single man living on his own, who might possibly struggle along on 6/8d. a day, or a married man with eleven children, as in a case I brought to the Minister's notice a couple of weeks ago, who is also supposed to exist on that sum.  Surely there is something wrong there and it is time the Minister did something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter concerns the man who is deemed to be working for a relative.  We have cases of people who work for hire where they can get it and they stamp their insurance cards while working.  When they are fortunate enough to be employed by a relative, whether a brother or a brother-in-law, or somebody more distant, some nosey-parker from the Department goes along to investigate and decides they were not employed in the normal way, were not entitled to stamp cards and not entitled to benefit when dismissed. The Minister must do something about this, because if he does not, it means that people over the years who have been stamping cards are being deliberately robbed of benefit to which they are legally entitled.  It is all right for someone to hold an investigation and decide that Benny Smith is working with Tom Ryan who is his brother-in-law <Col N="715" /> but Benny Smith has been stamping cards with somebody else for the past 30 years, perhaps, and if he gets another job, he will be working and stamping cards with somebody else later on, but, because he has been working with his brother-in-law in between, he is ruled ineligible to draw unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter and there are many cases of it.  If the matter were investigated immediately and a decision given, possibly something might be done about it, but I have given one instance where the case was reported in December and the investigation officer has yet to investigate it, although it is now coming up to the month of July.  The man involved has five or six small children.  I do not know how he is expected to live.  Perhaps it is a way of getting the unemployed out of the country because on the last occasion I spoke to this man, he said that if he could get his fare together to go to England he would do so.</P>
    <P>Apart from this I think the Minister is dealing with his Department in an excellent way and we consider this Bill to be a step in the right direction, although a very small step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Tully, I welcome the improvements in the social welfare code announced in this Bill.  The Minister made his own case pretty well when the drew attention to the fact that up to now contributory and non-contributory old age pensioners very often found their position worsened when they reached the qualifying age for a pension because prior to that they were on disablement benefit or unemployment benefit and they received the allowances for qualified children.  It is certainly against all principles of respect and consideration for advancing age if, when you reach the age of 70, you worsen the position rather than improve it.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on taking that point of view in framing this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the question of changing the age for the non-contributory widow's pension, the reduction from 48 <Col N="716" /> to 40 and now wiping it out completely. It is an advance on the right line.  Our old type of legislation, whatever the reason for it, which imposed an age limit in the case of a widow was very wrong.  The Minister pointed out the reasons why it was wrong: that there were certain other factors, apart from children, that a widow without any child had obligations perhaps to relatives because of certain circumstances in which she lived which involved hardship for her by virtue of the clause which forbade her to get her pension until such time as she reached a certain age.</P>
    <P>Again, the agreement between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare whereby additional benefits are made for hospital treatment, appliances and dental treatment &mdash;the fact that additional money can be spent on these and that there will be no limitation of £500,000&mdash;is an advance.  I have always felt that social welfare benefits and our health services should be combined.  In fact, one is completely dependent on the other, and, as I said on the Estimate for Health only a short time ago, I believe one must work with the other because of the fact when a man is ill, he is inclined to hurry back to work, with consequent loss to his health because our sickness benefits are so low.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to put to the Minister in connection with the non-contributory widow's pension.  The qualifying figure under the Act at present is, to my mind, so small that it tends to induce non-contributory widows to remain idle rather than accept a job.  It roughly works out that you can earn about £1 a week and draw the full pension. There is very little work which qualifies for £1 a week payment.  Quite recently, I heard of a widow capable and willing to work who took up employment. When she did so, she was completely deprived of her pension. Her employment only barely equalled what she would qualify to draw as a widow with two qualified children. There is, to my mind, a very clear case of inducement to idleness in such cases.  It is ridiculous to expect a person to work for a week to receive <Col N="717" /> the same amount of payment as she would get by remaining at home.</P>
    <P>When we consider all the improvements the Minister is now making in the social welfare code, we must think back on all the hardships which must have been inflicted over the years since 1932 when the different systems granting benefits were amalgamated together and particularly since the system were brought under the Minister's Department. In years past, all these various difficulties and hindrances by regulations were brought to the attention of various Ministers for Social Welfare by Labour Deputies.  They did so because of the fact that they are working amongst the people and come in more contact with them, possibly, as trade union officials or as Labour councillors in county areas.  They are more likely to be approached in connection with these matters of health and social welfare than others.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on this advance in ironing out some of the many difficulties and objections there are to the social welfare code.  I should like to join with Deputy Cosgrave in suggesting that the Minister consider seriously a consolidating of the various Social Welfare Acts.  They should be incorporated in one Act, as nearly as possible, in order to give us at a glance the various provisions that now remain.  They have been changed so often over a number of years&mdash;practically every year there is a change&mdash;that it is almost impossible to follow the various alterations and benefits.</P>
    <P>I welcome the practice of the Minister's Department in issuing a booklet which in fact gives a complete report on the various qualifications necessary and the various benefits to be obtained from the different Acts.  I consider that booklet a wonderful help to Deputies and to anyone interested in giving correct information on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare. I suggest to the Minister that it should be immediately brought up to date by the inclusion, possibly in manuscript form, of a leaflet setting out the various benefits in relation to the alterations now proposed.</P>
    <P>As I said at the start, we welcome this improvement because we believe <Col N="718" /> it is an advance along the road to acceptance of the principle advocated by the Labour Party for years past and will be advocated over future years, that is, a general amalgamation of social welfare and health contributions by the workers, the employers and the State, without any means test.  Anybody who has any experience of non-contributory old age pensions knows that the means test is the biggest problem.  It conduces to idleness or to spending everything during lifetime because of the fact that if a person saves, a penalty is imposed.  If a person does not do either of these, he is induced to commit fraud and to hide what he has.  Everybody knows it is not looked upon as a crime if you defraud the State of the benefits that you believe you are entitled to.</P>
    <P>Whether it is a moral question of fraud in the sense of being morally responsible for doing something which is wrong, certainly it is a legal fraud. If you are found out you suffer the penalty for it.  Those who administer justice in these cases know in their heart there is no justification for the means test because the penalties are really of a very nominal nature and more of repayment of the benefits wrongly got.  This is usually done by the Department refusing to grant any further benefits until a sufficient period elapses to make up for the benefits that were wrongly obtained.</P>
    <P>If the Minister continues with his amending of the various sections of the social welfare code, as he is doing at the moment, he will in a very short time arrive at the stage where the means test, or that portion of it that is operated under the various regulations, will be so much reduced as to make the continued activities of the investigation officers unjustified.  It would then be more costly to enforce the regulations and to see that no fraud is committed than it would be to wipe out completely the means test. In fact, I feel we have pretty nearly arrived at the stage where investigation of any old age pension cases will possibly cost almost as much in the long run as if the pension were granted and the State got back, if the person had means, the money in <Col N="719" /> income tax or death duties.  When a person dies, the State could recover by some method, if that person had private means above a certain amount, the amount given in pension.</P>
    <P>In support of that, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the contributory old age pension group, because of increased employment in the country, will gradually reduce the number of those who qualify for non-contributory old age pensions.  At some time in the future, the non-contributory old age pension section will be reduced to so small a number that to give them a pension without a means test would not be as costly as it has been in years past.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will endeavour to ensure that local authorities, or health authorities, will not now take away from those people by way of reductions in either disability allowance or home assistance the extra money they receive under this Bill.  We have found in local authorities that immediately any improvements were granted in old age pensions, widows' benefits or contributory benefits, or any other type of benefit where additional money was given by health authorities under the social welfare code, these were immediately taken away by reductions enforced by relieving officers on the direction, I presume, of county managers.</P>
    <P>It was an ideal way to reduce rates somewhat, but reducing rates at the cost of the most needy people is not something that should be followed up or recommended by anybody.  I do not know whether the Minister has power in this matter but if he has not the Government have.  If the Minister has power, he should issue an instruction that the increase now received under this Bill should not be regarded as means to deprive people of additional benefits they are getting from the county councils or local authorities.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on this advance, and hope that he will in the future see eye to eye with the Labour Party in their belief that we should finally, and in the very near future, provide a social <Col N="720" /> welfare code linked with the health services when all Parties will contribute and where we will finish with this odious means test.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate at all this morning.  However, when I hear words of praise in relation to the legislation now introduced, all the hair I have left stands on end.  The only praise I can see which might be tendered to the Minister is on his speech which was circulated this morning, because of the fact that he has come back to realism. He decided, as we in the House know so little Irish as a group, to discontinue his practice of making a long &ldquo;spake&rdquo; in Irish.  He made his speech in the language we normally use in this country.  I shall have a chat with the Minister on this question any time he likes.  I should like to see the language promoted in a cultural way and not in the manner usual with the Minister here.</P>
      <P>Has this Parliament gone completely insane?  Are we praising a Minister? Certainly, Deputy Cosgrave did not praise him.  I was amazed at the Labour Party praising the Minister for an increase of 2/6 for the old age pensioners in a year when the Taoiseach arranged a 12 per cent increase in salaries, wages and emoluments generally.  Here we have people who, in my view, are the most needy in the whole State, and for whom, if you have a political heart at all, it must bleed.  I did not intend to intervene but I feel realism demands that I should.  Why should we congratulate a Minister who has given an increase of 2/6d on a non-contributory old age pension of 37/6 per week?  We gave ourselves £500 and we gave 12 per cent to civil servants, the gardaí and to people in all salary groups up to £1,500 a year and over £1,500 an agreed figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we completely happy about the present legislation in this country?  I do not want to be difficult or awkward but when I think of old age pensioners in Drogheda and Dundalk and how these people are treated, my mind goes back to an old remark current in the County Louth: &ldquo;May you or yours <Col N="721" /> never know the coldness of charity.&rdquo; It is true.  Charity is cold.  He is a very bountiful man, a man of religious charity, who can give this charity and at the same time not do it in a condescending way.  We gave the 2/6, and we have taken a salary increase ourselves, with which I agree.  At the same time, we have given 12 per cent increase to the entire Civil Service and have arranged it for everybody in industry.  This leaves me completely cold.  I should like to tell two stories in relation to the implementation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I knew an old lady, God rest her soul.  The local convent used to give her lunch every day.  The job they gave her was to look after the girls and see that they did not throw buns at one another.  In my view, that was charity.  An inspector from the Department came down and that lady was disqualified because the Reverend Mother could not say this was a charity.  Her conscience, shall we say, told her that she was morally bound not to say what I would say because my conscience was more elastic than hers.</P>

      <P>The Minister will get a note on this case within 24 hours. The next time he speaks on legislation in this House he will tell me, when I ask him, that what I said was true.  It is not so many years since a few unemployed men went out to Mullaghcurry racecourse and got 10/- each to stand at the jumps so that the children could not run out and be killed.  I shall send the Minister personally particulars in regard to the case about which I am speaking within 24 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reaction to this legislation is one of protest because, in fact, people who only have 35/- a week did not get their 12 per cent.  That is my view and I do not think there is any answer to that view.  If the Taoiseach goes out, and as a point of general policy, produces roughly one-eighth increase in salary for everybody and if this is adhered to by everybody involved, we are entitled to give at least as much, if not more, to improve the lot of these <Col N="722" /> people.  Here this morning we hear words of praise for this 2/6d.  Perhaps I have introduced a spirit of realism into the debate.  That was my hope and my desire.  The Minister will have my information within 24 hours in respect of the cases which he says never happened.  I shall not bandy about in this House the names of people who are dead now.</P>

      <P>I was surprised at Deputy Donegan's opening remarks. He grossly misrepresented the statements made here this morning by both Deputy Tully and Deputy Kyne. Listening to Deputy Donegan one would imagine the Labour Party are agreeably satisfied that the old age pensions are being increased by 2/6d. per week.  Surely everyone conversant with proceedings in this House and with the repeated agitation here and throughout the country by the Labour Party on behalf of these sections of our community knows quite well that that is not true.</P>
      <P>It was made clear from these benches during the Budget debate that we were completely and entirely dissatisfied with the 2/6d. per week.  The position is we are unable to force our views on the Government.  This is the best we could get and Deputy Tully and Deputy Kyne made it clear that we are thankful for small mercies and that we hope that in the not too distant future there will be a further review of social welfare benefits.  We believe the increases given under this measure are entirely inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> In fairness to both Deputy Tully and Deputy Kyne, it is not true to say that they congratulated the Minister on this increase.  They welcome the measure as a step, though an inadequate step, in the right direction.  I was surprised at Deputy Donegan because I regard him as a fairminded Deputy but he did try to misrepresent the views expressed by both Deputy Kyne and Deputy Tully.</P>

      <P>Not intentionally. I think it can be said that no two Deputies have agitated more vehemently for improvements in social welfare benefits than have the two Deputies who spoke earlier from these benches.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Department now on the good public relations which obtain.  People who make representations, whether they be Deputies or private individuals, always get a detailed statement, setting out why an application has been rejected, if it was rejected.  This is one of the most co-operative Departments in the State so far as obtaining information is concerned.  Once the Department is asked for a report the report is sent out with details of the case.  An applicant then knows why he has been refused and it is up to him then to ask for a review if he thinks the decision not justified.  That is very commendable. Unfortunately, the same good public relations do not exist where other Departments of State are concerned.</P>
      <P>It should be unnecessary but, perhaps, it is just as well to repeat once more that we in the Labour Party are not at all satisfied that 2/6 per week is an adequate increase for old age pensioners.  If we had our way I can assure you the minimum increase would not be 2/6 per week but £1 per week.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the depreciation in the value of <Col N="724" /> money, I fail to understand how any person could exist on less than £2 15/-per week.  I know one must differentiate between the different categories of old pensioners.  There are pensioners who live with their families and who are probably maintained <i>in toto</i> by their families.  Others are entirely dependent on their pensions and it is very difficult for them to exist on the present rate of pension.  There are many who dislike approaching local authorities for supplementary allowances. These people have worked hard all their lives and they feel it is degrading to have to approach local authorities for supplementary allowances. Consequently, they try to make do with the pension.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made some concessions in relation to the means test where non-contributory pensions are concerned.  He has made concessions in relation to people who get married late in life and whose families are relatively young.  The numbers who would have qualified children would, I think, be small.  However, there are throughout the country some people affected.  Not only does this measure enable them to get the pension but it also gives relief to the extent of £39 income in respect of each child.  That is a step in the right direction.  I speak now mainly in regard to small farmers whose children may be younger than 21, making it impossible for them to assign their holdings.  Because of that disability they were debarred from pension.  Henceforth they will get the benefit of the £39 relief in respect of each child and, if they qualify for pension, the rate applicable to the children will be the maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully said it would be desirable to go the whole way and abolish the means test.  I can see the difficulty confronting the Minister and his Department in doing that.  I appreciate it would take a very big sum to meet that demand, but I always hold that a good percentage of the money paid out in old age pensions goes back again to the Exchequer because these old people use proportionately more taxed goods than other groups in the State.  Every old age <Col N="725" /> pensioner likes his half-one and his plug of tobacco on Friday. He is using taxable goods. These are the only comforts he has the day he gets his pension.  Consequently, it finds its way back to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I would have had reason to congratulate the Minister if he had adopted the same position in regard to non-contributory widows' pensions. Picture the position of such a person who loses her husband, whether he was a farmer or a shopkeeper.  If her husband had been an insured contributor, there would be no difficulty because she would qualify for the contributory pension, but those who qualify only for the non-contributory pension are faced with difficulties. First, the pension officer assesses the income from the farm or shop for the preceding 12 months.  In the preceding 12 months, the husband was alive and was, possibly, working the farm on his own.  When he goes&mdash;sometimes with little warning&mdash;the position of his wife changes completely.  She cannot manage as efficiently as if her husband were alive to take control and do the work.  A widow is dependent on outside help, which is not taken into account by the Social Welfare officers to the extent it should be.  One can picture the position of a widow on a farm, having to depend on outside help to do all the farm work and, in many cases, to be responsible for buying and selling farm produce.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give the same concession to widows as he has given to old age pensioners by disregarding £39 of the income from the holding or shop in respect of each qualified child. At present, the widow is assessed in full and none of the money is disregarded except in the case of a non-qualified child who may have a share in the estate.  I would ask the Minister to consider my suggestion.  I think he will find it justified and that the extra cost would be warranted.</P>
    <P>We have had raised from these benches the question of an applicant for unemployment benefit whose income exceeds £2 per week.  Such people are being treated very unfairly.  You <Col N="726" /> have the peculiar position that a man deemed to have more than 6/8 a day may lose £1 a day benefit.  Naturally, what is likely to happen is that he will endeavour to reduce his income to less than the £2 figure.  The number of these cases I had from west Cork was not so great.  I found in all such cases that, as far as managing the small farm or shop was concerned, the wife was quite capable of doing it with the help of the children or a little help from the husband after his day's work.  These people were definitely available for employment if it were there for them. It is very unfair to strike a number of these people from benefit because the family income is deemed to be £2 a week.  Surely a man with six or seven children will not be expected to live on £2 a week?</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department has good public relations so far as correspondence is concerned but I believe it has little or no relations with other Departments. I have expressed the view here again and again that there should be much more co-operation between the Department of Social Welfare and, for instance, the Department of Lands, the Department of Finance and the Department of Local Government.  These three Departments give a good deal of employment.  When the Department of Social Welfare have on their list a number of applicants from a particular area in receipt of unemployment benefit, they should form some association with the Special Employment Schemes Office of the Department of Finance and say: &ldquo;We have so many men unemployed in this area.  We are prepared to subsidise their employment to such an extent, if you put up the balance of the money and employ these men.&rdquo;  That would be much more satisfactory for all concerned rather than that these applicants should be sent to exchanges.  I find in west Cork that men dislike having any recourse to the exchanges, if they can avoid it. They prefer to go out and earn their money and have full and continuous employment rather than go along to the Garda barracks to sign one day and go to the exchange the next day.</P>

      <P>The Chair's charges are without any foundation.  I am sorry the Chair found it necessary to interrupt me.  I shall depart to the last item I have in mind to raise on this measure, that is, the feeling throughout the country that old age pensions should be paid at age 65.  I know that that would be a very costly measure.  We have questions here in the Dáil occasionally as to the cost of paying pensions at 65 years.  There are two sides to the story.  We were told at one time that it would be in or around £12 million.  That would be the debit side of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most employees of public bodies and, in some cases, of private companies are pensioned off at 65.  Every State employee is assured of his pension at 65 years, the Garda Síochána <Col N="729" /> at 63 years.  County council employees get their pension at 60 years.  I cannot see any reason why the man who has to work out in the wind and the weather, on the road or in the field, or those who have to take off their coats to earn their livelihood, must continue until 70 years before qualifying for a pension, whereas people in much more sheltered positions are assured of their pension at an age not later than 65 years. Surely the people who do the spade work in this country, so to speak, should be treated in the same way as the other people?</P>
    <P>This Minister or this Government or some Government in the very near future must review the position.  We have some 50,000 unemployed.  If pensions are paid to people at 65 years, then those people retiring from active employment would make room for younger folk to take over.  Farmers and shopkeepers, and workers in classifications benefiting under the scheme, would make room for younger men and in the case of farmers' sons and daughters, it would promote earlier marriages, which is a desirable development in this country.  We all feel that the age of marriage is far too high.  Such a step would have many widespread benefits.  A reasonable percentage of the money would find its way back to the Exchequer through the consumption of taxable goods.</P>
    <P>I know that the granting of pensions at 65 years is a difficult matter. It cannot be carried out without coming to this House for additional contributions from the taxpaying public.  However, the advantages of such a scheme would far outweigh the cost and it would be only fair and just.  Why should the people concerned have to wait until 70 years of age? They do not have to do it in the immediate neighbouring countries and I do not see why they should have to continue to do it in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We should give the pension at 65 years when the pensioner is better able to enjoy it than at 70 years of age, when, in many cases, people are not able to enjoy the few years of retirement left to them, due to incapacity of one kind or another.  If the Minister <Col N="730" /> grants pensions at 65 years, he will establish himself in a big way in the minds and hearts of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose the Minister expects anybody over here or down the country to enthuse overmuch about the rather meagre allowances given by him.  Beyond saying that, I shall not comment on that aspect of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This is very important.  The people in receipt of the benefits for which this Bill legislates are the most necessitous section of the community.  They are the least of our brethren.  The Minister should do his very best to ensure that there will be no delay in dealing with any applications which come to his Department in respect of any benefits or assistances.  I know that there are a very large number of such applications and that most of them are dealt with expeditiously, but in quite a number of cases there are unwarranted delays. The Minister knows that himself.  Some of these delays I made the subject of Parliamentary Questions when the Minister very generously admitted that there were faults on his side.</P>
      <P>If the Minister could only realise the importance of these benefits which he distributes to people, he would make sure, no matter what extra staff he might have to engage to perform the work, that these delays would not take place.  I know the hardships involved as a result of delays in Dublin in dealing with such cases.  Consider a man with a family who has no money.  He can get no home assistance whilst his claim is outstanding.  He finds himself in great difficulties with local shops.</P>
      <P>I want to underline the importance of ensuring that no one case is overlooked, and that if a case is overlooked, it will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible when the matter is brought to the Minister's attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is an illustration of the tragedy of inflation.  Inflation always means that the rich grow richer and the poor poorer.  In the past 12 months, the cost of living in this country has gone up 12 points, as we <Col N="731" /> foretold it would.  That increase of 12 points in the cost of living relates very largely to the essential food, fuel and clothing of the people.  These are the things on which the old age pensioner depends for his existence.  We propose to meet that, in respect of the old age pensioner, by an increase of 2/6d per week.  In the same Budget in which we make that proposal, we levy on cigarettes and beer a tax, avowedly for the purpose of restricting consumption by raising the cost of those commodities. I know old age pensioners can live without cigarettes and beer, but what it comes down to is that we are giving the old age pensioners an illusory 2/6d, and at the same time, laying the soothing unction to our souls that we are improving the social services.  In fact, when all is said and done, the old age pensioner is no better off now than he was ten or 15 years ago, because he is poor, and growing poorer as a consequence of inflation.</P>
      <P>It is really a very tragic spectacle in our social services that in regard to our aged poor, we give them 2/6d and expect them to be grateful, and in regard to our young and able poor, we ship them out of the country as emigrants and forget them, and avow in this House that they are no concern of ours, that if they come back, we will look after them, but so long as they seek their living abroad, they must look after themselves.  From the point of view of the Government, that may be a comfortable attitude to adopt, but it is a tragic comment on the policy pursued by this Government of callously raising the cost of living, inflating the economy, and letting the poor bear the consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I often wonder if we are not allowing our arbitrary definition of the duties of the Minister for Social Welfare to restrict us unduly in the requisitions we make upon him.  I never believed the Minister for Social Welfare in this Republic was confined to the task of paying out social benefits provided by statute.  I have always felt the Minister ought to concern himself with poverty and adversity.  I do not think the Minister is entitled to sit in Arus Mhic <Col N="732" /> Dhiarmada and say: &ldquo;Let the poor people look for what they want.&rdquo;  I believe his duty is conscientiously to look for the poor, to find out why people are hungry, why people are losing their homes through poverty, why old age pensioners are shifted into the South Dublin Union, and what he can do to remedy their adversity.</P>
    <P>Anyone who is familiar with conditions in the city of Dublin, or Cork, or any large city in the country, knows of numerous old people, and, indeed, relatively young widows and other persons, who qualify for assistance from the community to meet the adversity that has come upon them, but who do not know how to go about getting the social benefits to which they are entitled if they knew how to bespeak them.  As I understand the code of social welfare, it provides that there shall be an old age pension, or a widow's pension, or a statutory pension, and if it is inadequate to provide the recipient with a modest standard of comfort, he is entitled to look to the municipal authority of the area in which he lives for whatever will bridge the gap between what he requires and what he actually receives under the statutory pension and benefit schemes enacted by the House.</P>
    <P>I have always felt it is an obligation on the Minister for Social Welfare to concern himself to see that there shall not be destitution among our people, and that anyone who is so afflicted should be sought out, the cause of the destitution ascertained, and effective measures taken to remedy it.  I was appalled to learn that in the past month over 100 old age pensioners in this city have been cleared out of their rooms and relegated to the South Dublin Union.  So far as I know, none of them has any prospects of getting out of the South Dublin Union again. Is the Minister for Social Welfare, who is primarily responsible for the poor and afflicted, to shrug his shoulders and say: &ldquo;It is no concern of mine&rdquo;?  Is he to say it is the responsibility of another Minister?  I do not think it is. I know the Minister for Local Government has a general supervisory function in relation to the local <Col N="733" /> authorities who provide housing.  I recognise that matters of housing fall within his ambit.  If a situation arises in which 100 old age pensioners are cleared out of their rooms, and shovelled into the South Dublin Union &mdash;and the Minister knows that those people are faced with the situation in which they have no prospects of ever getting out of the South Dublin Union for the rest of their lives&mdash;does he discharge his duties by saying: &ldquo;They are getting their pensions and that is all I care.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have argued very strenuously that it is not.  I used to say, and I still say, that if I were Minister for Social Welfare, I would not rest easy in bed if I believed people were hungry, or poor, or cold, and if I did not send someone to find out why they were hungry, or poor, or cold.  It might transpire that they had some mental deficiency, that they were not equal to the strain of living in the world and needed help and assistance to live comfortably.  It might be that they had no suitable rooms to live in, and that they were old, and poor, and lonely.  I have always argued that the Minister for Social Welfare should provide himself with some kind of investigatory staff to look into those questions and bring to his attention difficulties of that kind, whereupon he could charge his Department to consider the existing code to see if there were means of relieving those forms of distress.  If not, he could go to the Government and say: &ldquo;With all the statutory powers I have, here is a schedule of cases of which I can give the fullest details and which I have no power to help.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does it not seem that for the Minister to discharge his function, he must concern himself not only with those for whom provision is made under the existing law, but more especially with those who he discovers are not catered for by the existing law?  I am thinking more and more of who is responsible for the hundreds of old age pensioners <Col N="734" /> who have been shoved into the South Dublin Union with no prospect of ever getting out of that institution again in their lifetime.</P>
    <P>That is so grim a tragedy that I find it hard to accept and it appals me that in Dáil Éireann we should find ourselves philosophically shaking our heads and asking ourselves what can we do.  Mind you, I do not think that kind of problem arises in rural Ireland. If an old person's home fell down, neighbours would rally round and would provide some accommodation until the rest of the neighbours could repair the house, could do something to get those old people back into their homes instead of into the county home.</P>
    <P>Here in Dublin it can happen and nobody seems to care.  As far as I understand it, the Minister's approach to this is: &ldquo;They are not my responsibility. They get their pensions and if they are in the South Dublin Union, that is a matter for the local authority and I am not concerned&rdquo;.  I do not agree with that view.  The point I wish especially to emphasise is that the result of a rising cost of living is that those who are organised, powerful, can in some measure protect themselves, that the rich who have capital on which to operate can largely offset the consequences of a rising cost of living.  It is the poor who grow poorer.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear on this.  In regard to the aged, their standard of living falls; in regard to the young, a quarter of a million have fled from poverty in the past seven years.  We have this enormous army of old age pensioners whose standard of living is falling and who, in some cases, are being forced into public institutions because they have no homes to go to or at least no accommodation available for which they can afford to pay.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a specific point which has been mentioned in the House before respecting a relatively small body of people who seem to have got caught in one of these legislative log-jams that sometimes arise through parallel pension schemes, leaving a gap which requires to be filled.  When the social insurance scheme was first formulated, <Col N="735" /> for some reason best known to the Oireachtas the Garda Síochána were not required to stamp cards.  They have their own pension schemes unto themselves and there is a pension scheme for widows.  Now you have the strange situation that where a garda dies a relatively young man in his 40s or 50s and leaves a young widow, she is not entitled to a contributory pension under the social services.  She is entitled to a pension under the Garda Síochána pension scheme and it is just sufficient to disqualify her for a non-contributory widow's pension.</P>
    <P>If the Garda Síochána stamped cards, that woman would be entitled not only to the Garda pension under the Garda pension scheme but also to draw her non-contributory widow's pension.  I suggest to the Minister that either of two things should be done: one, the Garda should be included in the ordinary social welfare code by having stamps put on their cards for them by the Garda authorities, or two, it should be provided that a Garda widow's pension under the Garda Síochána code should not be taken account of in assessing means for a non-contributory widow's pension. I have had a number of cases of this kind brought to my attention in my time and I have never mentioned them in the House without evoking sympathetic reaction but nothing ever seems to be done.  I put it to the Minister that there is an obvious gap here in the social welfare code, one that he might very properly remedy by either of the devices I suggest.  If he has some better idea, I should be very glad to hear of it.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, glad that some part of the burden which has been thrown on the old age pensioner, the unemployed, the widows and orphans, is being met by the provisions of this Bill.  However, the fact remains they are being called on to pay out a very substantial part of the burden and as a result we witness the fact that by Government policy, the poor grow poorer while the rich grow richer, and that I most emphatically deplore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have very <Col N="736" /> much to complain about in the manner in which this Bill has been dealt with by the House.  I agree with Deputy Murphy it was rather unfair of Deputy Donegan in placing the interpretation he did on the contributions of the two previous speakers from the Labour benches.  I do not think any Deputy is satisfied with the present rates of assistance services.  I am not by any means complacent about them.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out on a number of occasions, this Government have in fact been doing considerably more over the years than keeping these payments in line with increases in the cost of living.  We have been implementing a policy of ensuring that social welfare recipients share in the increasing prosperity of the country.  It has been shown time and time again that increases given have in fact effected a slight, I agree, but nevertheless a relative improvement in the position of social welfare recipients <i>vis-á-vis</i> the cost of living.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave made the case that unlike the wage increases given in the ninth round, the social welfare increases being granted here have been granted from a date subsequent to the date of the Budget to which the increases were provided for.  He made the case that some of the increases in the cost of living resulting from the turnover tax developed from November last and pointed out these payments in social benefits do not come into effect until 1st August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is, of course, that increases were given in all social welfare schemes last year which in themselves more than compensated for increases in the cost of living due to the turnover tax.  The effect of the increases on the social assistance side which are being given in this Bill is to establish the position that since the imposition of the turnover tax, every grade of social welfare recipient has in fact got an increase of more than the 12 per cent which has been obtained by employed people.  As I pointed out in the debate on the Budget last year, with one exception, that of the contributory old age pensioners where the percentage is 11 per cent, which is slightly <Col N="737" /> less than the 12 per cent obtained by workers generally, the increases given to social welfare recipients are greater than 12 per cent and considerably in excess of the increase in the cost of liv-living. The increase in the cost of living since mid-February of 1963 is 6.875 per cent and the lowest increase given under any social welfare scheme is the 11 per cent in the case of a contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>I fully realise that everybody in the House would like to see larger increases given but we on this side of the House have to face up to the problem of providing the money for these benefits.  We have been implementing a consistent policy of ensuring that the social welfare recipients get a due proportion of the increase in the national income.  That is a more advantageous principle from the point of view of the recipients than the one advocated by Deputy Cosgrave in this debate of ensuring that their allowances increase in proportion to the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>With regard to the improvements being carried out in some of the schemes this year, Deputy Tully referred to the fact that in my opening statement, I did not give any bouquets to the Labour Party, the members of which have suggested some of these improvements from time to time.  That is true.  In replying to the debate on my Estimate last year, I did mention the fact that many improvements had been suggested to my mind by the contributions made from all sides of the House and I think that most of the improvements made on this occasion have been advocated from different sides of the House over the years.</P>
    <P>Deputies generally will admit, as the Labour Deputies did, that in addition to the gradual increase in the rates of payments under these different services, a gradual improvement is also being effected in the schemes themselves. There have been improvements in each of the past three years, and just as Deputies can see further improvements that could be made, I can see them also.  I am sure we have not reached the end of social welfare legislation in <Col N="738" /> this country and I hope it will be possible to bring in further improvements from time to time.  The individual improvements may be only of limited application but the sum total of them is that we are gradually evolving a better and more comprehensive system of social welfare.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to the question of the new 6/- per week rate of widow's pension which is being introduced and he criticised it.  I wish to say that we are not attaching any great importance to that but that what it does is to equalise the position of the widow who would otherwise receive no payment with the position of the widow who qualifies for a pension. In that case an obvious anomaly would arise.  This provision avoids that anomaly.  It does no more than and is not represented as doing any more than that.  My policy is to continue expanding the means scale in that way as the rates of benefit are increased, thus bringing in more people at the upper end for marginal rates and thus ensuring that those who qualify for the pension and those whose means put them just outside the means limit will have proportionately the same income. If we did not do that, anomalies would arise.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the demand from a number of the Labour Deputies that the means test should be abolished and I should like to know if it is the considered policy of the Labour Party that the means test should be done away with.  I find it hard to believe that if they really considered the question, they would find it a desirable thing to do.  It has been mentioned that to abolish the means test would cost a considerable amount of money but the money does not matter to me so much.  If I had sufficient money available for the abolition of the means test, I would not use it in that way.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the means test would cost a considerable amount of money.  In the case of old age pensions alone, it would cost £4 million.  It was mentioned by Deputy Tully that fantastic figures have been quoted in regard to the cost of removing the means test.  They are large figures but <Col N="739" /> they are not fantastic.  They are realistic figures and it is not true to say that the cost of the administration of the means test represents a considerable proportion of what it would cost to do away with it.  The total cost of the administration of the Department is under £2 million and the abolition of the means test for old age pensions alone would cost £4 million.</P>
    <P>If I had this £4 million available and decided to use it in this way, to use it to abolish the means test, it would mean giving all that money to people who at present do not qualify for an old age pension at all or who, because they have some means, qualify for a pension at a reduced rate.  It would mean a decision on my part to use £4 million for the benefit of people who are better off than those who qualify for the maximum at present.  If Deputy Murphy reads his contribution to the debate, he will see that he made a case for not doing this.  He emphasised the fact that there are some people who have no other means than the social assistance payments and they have to try to exist on them.  The abolition of the means test would mean utilisation of whatever money was available for people other than those to whom Deputy Murphy referred.  As I said, even if I had this money available, I would not use it in that way.  I do not think it would be the most equitable way in which to use it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points which were raised and, as I have said, the whole question of improvement of the social welfare system is continuously under review in my Department. The three Social Welfare Bills that have been introduced in the last three years show that we are gradually improving the system as a whole.  I acknowledge that many of the things that have been done have been adverted to on a number of occasions by various Deputies in the House, by the Labour Party and by Deputies on this side of the House and on the Fine Gael side.</P>

Deputies will realise that preparation for the implementation of this improvement was being made before Deputy O'Donnell spoke on the Estimate but I have no doubt that he referred to it before and I distinctly remember the late Deputy Dan Moloney referring to it year after year here and I am quite sure that many others also referred to it.</P>
      <P>Other points that have been raised and other improvements that have been advocated are very much in my mind also.  In regard to the question of the Garda widows, I agree that if the pensions that are provided by the Department of Justice for Garda widows are lower than the contributory widow's pension, something should be done through the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Justice to rectify that situation. If it can be more conveniently done by the Department of Social Welfare I shall endeavour to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, of course, many cases of hardship which are not covered by any of the existing social welfare schemes. If Deputies will examine the individual cases that come to their notice they will see, generally speaking, that they are cases of a type that it just would not be possible to cover in a statutory scheme which has to be of general application but there is a continuous <Col N="741" /> effort in my Department to make the social welfare services more comprehensive and, as I say, I appreciate that criticisms made here are helpful generally in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne referred to the booklet produced by the Department of Social Welfare.  That will be brought up to date as soon as possible.  In that respect also, I would recommend Deputies who are interested in social welfare to get a book which was published by the Institute of Public Administration lately dealing with the social assistance and social insurance services and which gives a fairly comprehensive review of the system as it is at the moment.  Perhaps a study of that book will help Deputies to make further suggestions as to improvements that are desirable.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for dealing so expeditiously with the Bill and I would ask them to agree to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to one aspect of the drafting of this Bill.  I recognise that it is not always easy in respect of this kind of social welfare legislation to be as explicit as one would wish to be but we can carry legislation by reference to extravagant lengths, making it extraordinarily difficult for Deputies really to determine what the exact effect of proposed legislation is and making it extraordinarily difficult to know what the position is hereafter because one is constrained to refer to a whole volume of legislation in order to determine the meaning of some of <Col N="743" /> the sections of this Bill.  Sections 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10&mdash;which we are now discussing&mdash;all refer to previous legislation. Section 9 says:</P>
      <P>Section 28A (inserted by the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960) of the Act of 1952 is hereby amended by the insertion in subsection (2) after &ldquo;section 26&rdquo; of &ldquo;or subsection (1) of section 27.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I recognise the problem of drafting legislation but that is a section which I defy anybody in the House to have the faintest notion as to what it means. We accept the Minister's word for what it does mean but if I rushed him now and asked him what the section actually does, he would find it difficult to answer without referring to a very carefully prepared brief.</P>
      <P>Section 10 reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The Third Schedule to the Act of 1952 is hereby amended by&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the insertion in column (4) of Part I (inserted by the Act of 1963) at reference number 5 of &ldquo;13,&rdquo; and</P>
      <P>(b)  the insertion in column (5) of the said Part I at the said reference number 5 of &ldquo;8.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and I would suggest to the Minister that where these sections by reference create a new situation, he should consider whether it might not be possible to repeal the relevant section in the previous Acts and present a longer section in the new Bill which would succinctly set out the situation as it now is.  Perhaps in the next Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, the Minister would consider that procedure and insofar as is practicable have new sections which would comprehensively cover what he wishes to cover and repeal the previous sections which under the procedure we are now adopting it is sought to amend.</P>

      <P>I appreciate very well the difficulty of understanding these things.  As Deputy Dillon said, I could explain what these things do because I have a comprehensive note giving the explanation but I fully appreciate that it would be much more desirable <Col N="744" /> from the point of view of Deputies if the Act in fact clearly indicated what each section does.  I am sure that that point is constantly before the minds of the officers of my Department in their dealings with the parliamentary draftsman, but these are technical matters.  In any case, I will have this examined to try to ensure that on future occasions it is clear what individual sections do and the effect they produce.  Certainly I realise the desirability of doing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said last Tuesday in the course of his introductory speech that in 1963 great success attended the efforts of the Industrial Development Authority to attract industry to this country.  He said that during the year 34 new industries had been attracted and each of them had foreign participation and that these new projects which had gone into production involved a total capital investment of over £7 million and had an employment potential of some 4,200 workers.  He also mentioned that during the previous year projects involving a capital investment of £10,000 and upwards numbered 44 and that the total capital investment of these was estimated at almost £9 million and the estimated employment potential ranged from 2,100 to 6,300. He mentioned other projects numbering 32 in course of construction and which would provide employment for about 8,600 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not approach the Minister's statement with the wild enthusiasm one would expect if one were to accept these figures.  I am not impugning the Minister's integrity or his belief in the statements he made, but I should like to draw to his attention the fact that the rosy hopes held out for many of the industries which he has assisted in all good faith have not materialised. One industry in the constituency adjacent to mine, in Bantry, was heralded as an industry which would give employment to 200 people.  I am referring to the Flatley industry.  There were photographs of the factory in the newspapers with the caption that 200 were to be employed there.  The situation at the moment there is that fewer than 20 people are employed.  I know that some eight or nine months ago, at most 40 people were employed.  We have all seen statements this week in <Col N="746" /> regard to redundancy at the Potez factory in Galway and I think the Minister will agree that there is some cause for scepticism on my part and on the part of the ordinary public regarding statements in respect of industrial potential.</P>
    <P>As a result of statements made here by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon, last week, on the Verolme Dockyard and in view of the statements made here last July when the Minister introduced the Supplementary Estimate for £999,000 for the same company.  I think there is an imperative need for further investigation of the organisation of the Verolme Dockyard Company.</P>
    <P>Following Deputy Dillon's speech here last week, the vice-president of the parent Verolme company in Holland, in referring to the sale of the ship &ldquo;Amstelhof&rdquo;, is reported in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of 19th June as saying that when the vessel was sold, the Verolme company suffered a considerable loss. This is a very remarkable thing because Lloyd's List and Shipping Gazette of 25th February last announced the sale and mentioned a figure of well in excess of £1 million being involved.  Lloyd's Shipping Gazette is not the sort of newspaper which engages in wild speculation.  The Minister will appreciate that anything it publishes is published as a result of investigations by qualified people in the shipping world.</P>
    <P>If we are to believe that the ship changed hands somewhere in the ocean at a figure of well in excess of £1 million, and if we are to add to that the figure of £350,000 which all the members of this House and all taxable citizens in the State have already contributed to the Verolme Dockyard, it is very hard to believe the statement of the vice-president of the parent Verolme Dockyard Company in the Hague.  However, if we are to believe the statement, another consideration arises which calls for the most stringent examination by the Minister because on 4th September, 1963, the week before this ship was launched, the Verolme company issued this statement:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> The ship will be delivered to her Owners at the end of the year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is, 1963:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and in service will be managed by N. V. Reederij, Amsterdam, who have secured a long-term charter of the ship.</P>
    <P>When a ship is let on charter, the charter must take one of three forms. The first form is a voyage charter; the second is a time charter; and the third is the demise or what is often called a bare boat charter.  The Verolme Dockyard, as in their statement, decided to let this ship out on a long-term charter. From that it can be reasonably concluded that this is the final type of charter I mentioned, that is, the bare boat charter.  In such a case, the cost of maintaining the ship in good repair, of keeping her in class with her classification society, the classification society of Lloyd's Register, would fall to the charterers who would also pay the cost of the bunker fuel, the cost of loading and discharging the ship's cargo and all port expenses.  In other words, the responsibility of maintaining the ship and paying all the charges devolved entirely upon the charterers as if they were the owners of the vessel. In addition, the charter hire rate would be determined by certain financial factors which the shipowners would have to take into consideration, such as the prime cost of the vessel, interest on money involved and, especially in the case of a long-term charter such as this, the allowance in respect of depreciation and wear and tear over the period involved.</P>
    <P>I do not know why, if the Verolme Dockyard found they had to sell this ship at a loss, they tore up this very valuable charter document which they themselves announced they had before the ship was launched.  If we are to believe what the vice-president said last Thursday in Amsterdam, that is exactly what happened.  These people had this very valuable charter document and they tore it up and sold the ship at a loss.  There is a duty upon the Minister to inquire from the Verolme Dockyard why exactly they did this, because it could not commend itself to <Col N="748" /> anybody as a sensible economic practice. I doubt if the ship was ever built for the Netherlands Freight and Tanker Company which was an offshoot of the Verolme company, and the Minister should ask the company if, in fact, this ship, the &ldquo;Amstelhof&rdquo;, was built for the Verolme offshoot or was built directly for the company which is now allowed to purchase it on its first voyage to Vancouver.</P>
    <P>It is a remarkable coincidence which should strike the Minister and possibly will strike the public, that this ship was named the &ldquo;Amstelhof&rdquo;.  Her name was predetermined naturally before she was launched and when prefabricated parts came to the Verolme Dockyard, they were imprinted with the name &ldquo;Amstelhof&rdquo; to indicate they were going into the ship in question.  We are told now the ship was built for the Netherlands Freight and Tanker Company and was to be managed by N. V. Reederij, Amsterdam. This company has a fleet of nine ships already and this remarkable coincidence emerges that each of these nine ships, like the &ldquo;Amstelhof&rdquo;, has the prefix &ldquo;Amstel&rdquo; to its name.  Lest the Minister should think I am misleading him, I shall give him the names: &ldquo;Amsteldiep&rdquo;, &ldquo;Amstelhoek&rdquo;, &ldquo;Amstelkroon&rdquo;, &ldquo;Amstelmeer&rdquo;, &ldquo;Amstelmolen&rdquo;, &ldquo;Amstelsluis&rdquo;, Amstelstad&rdquo;, &ldquo;Amstelveen&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Amstelveld&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the people who are alleged to have purchased this ship in the middle of the Atlantic would at any time have agreed to have a ship with the name, almost the trademark, &ldquo;Amstel&rdquo; built and put on the high seas unless they knew beforehand she was to be bought by them.  The Minister should inquire from the Verolme Dockyard how this amazing coincidence arose, if, in fact, the Verolme Dockyard were not building this ship for the company to which they now allege they sold it in the middle of the ocean for a sum which is looked upon by Lloyds as being well in excess of £1 million.</P>
    <P>Another matter I think the Minister should investigate is the statement of the vice-president of the parent Verolme company when he said in <Col N="749" /> The Hague on last Thursday, June 18th, that no orders could be had on the world market for the Verolme Dockyard and so it was decided to build a vessel in the Irish yards to the account of one of the Verolme companies. Is that the future of the yard, that it must go on taking in its own washing in order to survive and that it cannot receive any orders on the world market?  It is remarkable that the ship which is now under construction at the Verolme Dockyard, in respect of which we must give another £350,000, is being built for a company which was very recently formed.  That is not my opinion: I am quoting from an interview published in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of Thursday, September 12th, 1963 with Mr. Magnus Jones, who is assistant Secretary of Commerce of the Liberian Government and secretary of the board of directors of the national shipping line.</P>
    <P>The remarkable thing about the Liberian national shipping line is that it was very recently formed, according to Mr. Magnus Jones himself.  It was formed very shortly before September 12th, 1963.  That line, as I think was already mentioned here, is owned by three different interests.  The Liberian Government own 50 per cent.; Verolme own 25 per cent; and an Israeli company own another 25 per cent.  I am not a bit surprised that Mr. Magnus Jones mentioned on the same day that it was his first visit to Ireland and that he had been favourably impressed by the country and its friendly people.  Very few visitors here got the golden handshake Mr. Jones received when he arrived here to see the keel of his ship being laid.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to understand that I am not being deliberately obstructive in this matter but that I am in conscience expressing the doubts which must arise in the mind of any reasonable man when he regards this whole organisation.  I do not want anybody to stand up here afterwards&mdash; although I doubt if I can prevent them from doing so&mdash;and say I want to kill this industry which was founded in a constituency adjacent to my own and which gives much employment in my constituency.  I am sorry it falls to my <Col N="750" /> lot to speak on the matter at all and I would gladly forbear from doing so but for the fact that I feel impelled to speak by the facts which have been brought to my knowledge.</P>
    <P>When I think of the money which has been, or will be, made available to this company, I feel that many industries of a more durable nature could have been founded in my constituency and in neighbouring constituencies for half the cost and that they would now be giving more gainful employment of a more general type to larger numbers of workers.  We find many people in my constituency and in the constituency of some other members of the House who are here at the moment in this awkward dilemma, that they have acquired a skill in shipbuilding to the exclusion of all other skills and they will find employment in anything else impossible or at least very difficult to obtain, except in this highly-specialised type of shipbuilding which goes on in the Verolme Dockyard.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we are faced with the accomplished fact but I think the Minister should investigate to the fullest what I would describe as the extraordinary conduct of the Verolme Dockyard since it was founded.  The circumstances in which it was founded were rather adverse.  That was stated before on 18th July last year.  Most of us on this side of the House felt many other industries could be selected instead of shipbuilding in 1958 when the outlook for shipbuilding generally was at its very lowest.  We then doubted the wisdom of the Government's decision and everything that has happened since must tend to explode the myth in which many people believed that the Minister for Industry and Commerce at that time, now the Taoiseach, is the greatest industrial wizard of all time in this country.  I do not think any prudent man would have encouraged the setting up of the industry in question.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I might be permitted to mention at this stage and I should like the Minister to deal with it.  The Minister told us on 18th July last year that there would be a subsidy of £650,000 in respect of the first two <Col N="751" /> ships.  That would be an average of £325,000 each for the ships.  He went on, and as far as I can understand what he said, he said in respect of the following three ships, that is, the third, fourth and fifth ships to be built at Verolme Dockyard, there would be a commitment of £570,000 by the Government in respect of them.  I refer to the Official Report of 18th July, 1963 volume 204, No. 9 at the end of column 1390 and the beginning of column 1391 where the Minister says:</P>
    <P>The maximum commitment, which represents percentages reducing from 15 per cent to 10 per cent of the contract prices amounts in all to £570,000 for these three ships.</P>
    <P>The three ships he was referring to were ships three, four and five to be built at Verolme Dockyard.  If that were so, it would come out at an average commitment of £190,000 in respect of each ship.  If instead two of these ships will cost us £350,000 each, or £700,000, that is most disquieting. I may be wrong and I think it is a matter that the Minister should clear up when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>There was no doubt in my mind or in the minds of anybody on this side that the Minister indicated to the House that as the workers at Verolme Dockyard became more skilled, as more expertise became evident there, the subsidy required from State funds would be accordingly reduced.  That has not happened: the subsidy has gone up and that appears to be the situation.  I ask the Minister: must Mr. Verolme go on forming companies like the Liberian national shipping line to take in his own washing and build ships to keep him going in the Cork Dockyard?  If that be so, the sin lies on the head of the Minister. When the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is now Taoiseach entered into commitments on behalf of the State with Verolme Dockyard, he must have forseen the position or if he did not, he should have foreseen it, and if he did not foresee it, he has no right to claim that he is the industrial expert he claims to be.</P>
    <P>He should have foreseen the gloomy <Col N="752" /> prospect which now emerges for the dockyard.  From the beginning, it has been made very plain that it was an ill-fated venture.  I know, and I think the Minister knows, at least one other industry in Cork which is looking for assistance and which has been giving employment to quite a large number of people.  It has in recent times got something from a Government source. As far as I can make out, about £6,309,000 of the State's money has been made available to this venture, Verolme Dockyard.  This money could have given help to a considerable number of other industries.  You could have given employment, with this amount of money, to many more than the 850 people who are employed in the Verolme Dockyard.</P>
    <P>It was a sorry day when this venture was started.  I regret very much that the people who are employed there might find themselves, at some stage, with their employment in jeopardy or might find themselves in the position that they will have to offer themselves as workers of Verolme Dockyard, not in England, not in America but somewhere in Holland, Brazil or somewhere else to avail of the skill which they have obtained at our expense. That was another eventuality which should have been foreseen.</P>
    <P>I only hope at some stage that the hopes which the Minister held out here on July 18th last year in regard to the dockyard will be realised and that at some future stage it will become an industry which will be self-supporting and will give back to the people of this country some recompense for the immense assistance which has been given to it by the Government.  I should be horrified to see this industry closing down.  I should be equally horrified if every ship built in this dockyard results in a loss to the State of at least £350,000.  I should be still more horrified if the suspicious circumstances which surrounded the launching and the subsequent sale of the &ldquo;Amstelhof&rdquo; should follow every time a ship is built in the Verolme Dockyard.</P>
    <P>I have made a case which I think the Minister should answer.  The history of the Verolme Dockyard in time should <Col N="753" /> teach the Government a lesson that any industry of that nature should be very fully investigated, not alone before it is set up but all through its career.  I know and I understand very well the difficulties the Minister might find in that regard.  I have said this before, and I repeat it, that if there is a case to be made for it, any industrial organisation which receives assistance from this State should be in the position that its affairs can be openly investigated, or at least investigated by a Committee of this House.  Any ordinary industrial organisation which issues a prospectus, which goes into business and which obtains voluntary subscriptions from the public by way of shares and payment for shares has to answer to its shareholders for what it spends its money on.  It seems illogical to me and quite intolerable that an organisation which does not look for voluntary capital, such as is solicited in the prospectus of a company which does, but receives involuntary subscriptions from the pocket of every taxpayer in this country, should be in the position that its affairs cannot be investigated by anybody.</P>
    <P>Every citizen who pays tax in this country is an involuntary shareholder in the Verolme Dockyard and is an involuntary shareholder in every other company for which the State gives a grant.  The ordinary people are entitled to the same consideration as the shareholders of a public company enjoy.  I agree with the Minister that it might discourage certain organisations from coming here and looking for State aid.  If they do not want to come under the terms I suggest, I consider they are not worth having. Any company which is ready to trade decently and take decent advantage of the capital which is provided by the State should be in a position to say: &ldquo;Look, as far as we are concerned you can investigate everything we do down to the last penny and down to the last article we send out of our factory and you will not find anything wrong&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The very fact that the Minister says it is not in the interests of the company or in the interests of the State <Col N="754" /> that the private affairs of this company should be investigated is inciting every one of 57 different varieties of other companies to come into this country and to get hold of the people's money.  What is there to hide if the company is going to make good use of the money provided by the State? It has become a sort of convenience that such matters should not be investigated.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take the lesson of the Verolme Dockyard and the lesson of the vessel &ldquo;Amstelhof&rdquo; to heart and to make it quite clear to people who come in seeking our largesse that the money is being provided only on consideration that the company will be open to investigation by this House in the name of the people who sent us here.  In that way, I believe we will not have people who had perhaps been convicted in Great Britain coming over here and getting assistance from the State to form companies.  I believe we will still find some companies coming over here to assist us with their expertise and knowledge and we will get a better type of company coming over here than those who came here previously.</P>
    <P>Some of those companies made statements from time to time about redundancies and other prognostications and said that next year everything would be much better.  We have found in the past that instead of 200 people being employed in some of these industries in three or four years' time, there were only 20 people employed. If we take proper precautions with some of these companies coming in here, we will not have the Minister coming into the House saying there is likely to be employment for 600 workers when full production is reached.  We will not have him saying that the industry is only starting and 40 people are now employed.  After some time, we will not find that instead of going up, it went down to about 20 workers.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest for a single moment that when the Minister came in here last week and gave us figures about the potential employment in these companies, he was trying to deceive us <Col N="755" /> I am quite sure he had the figures correct but I would be very interested if this time next year he would make reference to volume 211, column 128, of the debates for Tuesday, 16th June, 1964, and told us what exactly was the position in regard to the figures he gave us last Tuesday.  I doubt very much if the figures he would give us then would have any relation to the actual figures he gave us last Tuesday.</P>

      <P>The wind blowing eastwards in previous debates on the Industry and Commerce Estimate in past years seems to have died down this year.  We were being swept into the Common Market in our discussions on this Estimate in 1962 and 1963, but the Common Market discussions seem to have receded very much in this year's debate.  We had assurances from the Taoiseach and from the Minister for Industry and Commerce not very long ago that we would find ourselves full members of the EEC in the not too distant future and that we would find ourselves members, irrespective of whether Britain joined or not.  It was contended from this, and I adverted to the fact on a number of occasions, that Britain's action on this question of entry should not, and would not, guide our action.  We have a longstanding tradition of dealing with Britain and we cannot lay that aside, and could not lay it aside and go it alone, as the Taoiseach said, into the Common Market.  It is agreed by the Government that, whether we like it or not, if in the future&mdash;and I do not think it will happen in the near future &mdash;Britain goes into the Common Market, we will act likewise.  If, on the other hand, Britain stays out, it is more than likely we will stay out as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was probably premature in dismantling the tariffs and protection set up for keeping our industries functioning.  Side by side with this question of protecting certain firms, we are endeavouring to make industries stand on their own feet so that they will be able to take their place in international markets.  We have on the other side of the picture, <Col N="756" /> the giving of injections to existing firms to keep them alive and going.  In the past we had discussions here on the advisability of keeping the St. Patrick's Mines in Wicklow in action.  It was contended in the House that more than 1,000 men were employed and that if several substantial injections were not given to this patient, there would be disemployment, with consequent hardship to these men and their families.</P>
    <P>Rightly or wrongly, the House agreed unanimously with the Minister that we should give three substantial subventions to that company.  From recollection, I think the total amount was £1¼ million.  That amount was in addition to the money invested by the State earlier in that concern.  Despite the three subventions, totalling £1,250,000, the company had to wind up.  It has ceased to exist even though these subventions were granted, which, we were told, would tide the company over its difficult period.  We understood there were brighter periods ahead and that if we gave this money to the company, everything would work out satisfactorily and it would stand on its own feet.</P>
    <P>Even though I come from County Cork, I must confess I am not very conversant with the Verolme Dockyard. I know it is giving employment to a number of people.  A grave doubt has been cast on that company in this House by speakers, and indeed by the last speaker who represents a constituency in Cork adjoining the Verolme Dockyard.</P>

      <P>We gave subventions in order to give employment and we were told that when our men became skilled in the art of ship-building and when productivity increased, the <Col N="757" /> company would be able to stand, if not completely on its own feet, with the aid of small contributions from the public funds.  It was felt here at the time we supported the granting of subventions to the Verolme Dockyard that these subventions would bring them over the stage when the men were not capable of additional production because of inexperience.</P>
      <P>Now we find there is a question about the activities of the company. I hope the statements made by the previous speakers are unfounded and I hope the Minister will have a complete answer to the assertions made from the Opposition benches on the integrity of the Verolme Dockyard. There is no doubt that the publicity arising from these statements, particularly the statement of the Leader of the Opposition, has raised doubts in the minds of people throughout the country.  I should not imagine that the vice-president of this company in Holland would make the remark casually that it was a storm in a teacup.  The Fine Gael Party have made serious allegations against the company, substantiated today by another member from Cork, Deputy Barrett, and I think there is an obligation on the Minister to tell us whether there is anything in these allegations or not.</P>
      <P>If this company is to be the same as the St. Patrick's Mines and if we give £350,000 to build a ship there, I think it should not be regarded as industrial employment but as a kind of relief scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we must address ourselves to this big question which came to the fore in past years of bringing in industrialists here from Germany, Britain and America in order to develop the country industrially and to provide employment for our people.  I supported Governments past and present, in their desire to bring in foreign industrialists to establish industries which would give much needed employment and which would help to balance our economy by exporting the goods manufactured.  In retrospect, we find it is not working out as satisfactorily as we anticipated.  I have come to the conclusion that the emphasis <Col N="758" /> should now be on developing industry at home with Irish capital and with Irish principals.  If we have not the technical know-how to do some of the work which industrial development entails, we should import that type of knowledge and pay qualified people who have that type of knowledge for their work.  I think it would be much more advantageous to pay these people substantial salaries in order to attract them here, if they have the particular qualifications needed for the development of our industrial arm, and let them be subject to authority here and subject to Irish management rather than hand them over full control, as happened in Cork and in Wicklow.</P>
    <P>I hope that, in future, the Minister's Department will be more readily at home to people who apply for aid for the establishment of industries.  When I use the term &ldquo;industries&rdquo; I mean projects by applicants who are anxious to develop small industries which may employ in the initial stages only ten, 12, or 15 men.  The Minister's Department takes too much note altogether, I think, of people who come along and say they will be able to employ 200 in the first year and, in the course of time, will be able to employ 600 or 700 men.  These anticipations are not borne out.  We should, as I said, be more readily at home to people interested in commonsense projects in small towns and villages.  If an industry starts in a small town or village, an industry likely to prove an economic proposition, that is a great help. If only ten men are employed at £10 per week, it means £100 per week to that small town or village.  I think that is a better development than these large industrial centres which the Government, and some others, hoped in the past to establish throughout the country.  We should concentrate more on the establishment of small industries.</P>
    <P>We have had several discussions in relation to local problems connected with industrial development in West Cork.  I make a special appeal to the Minister now to interest himself personally in the application of the Fastnet Co-operative Society, which is seeking a grant for the establishment <Col N="759" /> of a food processing factory in Skibbereen.  The Minister may be conversant with the position.  Through the initiative of local organisations, headed by the curate of the parish in which I reside, £33,000 was subscribed by local people towards the establishment of this factory.  I understand that the Sugar Company gave £33,000 also, making a total of £66,000.  I have been assured by the organising committee that if more local capital is required that capital will be available locally.</P>
    <P>I understand that some delays&mdash;I shall not say difficulties&mdash;have arisen in getting departmental approval for the money the committee have sought from Foras Tionscal towards the project. I hope the Minister will personally interest himself in this matter and, if any difficulty has arisen, that he will smooth out that difficulty and make the capital available.  I appreciate the difficulties of Foras Tionscal in parting with big grants to companies. I know they have to examine these applications very carefully and scrutinise them closely and diligently to ensure that the projects, if established, will prove sound, economic and lasting.  We feel assured in West Cork that this project would undoubtedly be a success.  The Sugar Company has given it its blessing.  We feel that a company established by local initiative and with local capital has a much better chance of survival.  I am aware all the technical problems surrounding this particular project have been dealt with in detail by the committee and the Irish Sugar Company.  I understand the latter are satisfied that the project is a sound one.  I hope the Minister will now give it his blessing and that the first sod will be turned on the site in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago&mdash;the Minister was absent at the time&mdash;I referred briefly to the factory which was established in Bantry.  As the Minister is aware, the factory is not employing the numbers it was anticipated it would employ.  In fact, the factory has met with a number of difficulties.  I expressed the view here that the State <Col N="760" /> should now step in and take over this factory, try to develop the industry, if that is possible, and, if that is not possible, to replace the existing industry with some other suitable industry. We have been crying out for industrial development in West Cork and we are sadly disappointed that the factory in Bantry should have been established on such a very, very sandy foundation indeed.  I am surprised that the promoter of this factory passed the qualifying tests, imposed by Foras Tionscal and succeeded in securing grants totalling £90,000.  I do not want to reflect on this man, but I believe it is imperative that I should, as a local Deputy, refer to this whole question of the availability of Foras Tionscal grants.</P>
    <P>In the annual reports I have read that the applications from west Cork, with three exceptions, I think, have been rejected.  In the latest annual report there were eight applications from west Cork, of which seven were rejected and one is under consideration. How, then, did a man devoid of personal qualifications, or financial qualifications, secure this substantial grant?  The position with regard to his English company, according to the reports in the Press, is that his liabilities exceed his assets by some £300,000.  It was stated that his liabilities were £500,000 and his assets only £200,000. I cannot imagine how such an applicant passed Foras Tionscal and got his grant approved.</P>
    <P>I venture to say that, had this debacle occurred in the neighbouring state of Britain, much as we may have to say about it at times, those responsible, including the Minister, would have had to resign from their positions. That seems to be a usual feature of Parliamentary life in the adjoining Parliament.  They go on the basis that a Minister is responsible for the activities of his subordinates and of the boards set up by him, so that when they make a blunder &mdash; as undoubtedly they did in this case&mdash;he should resign. I do not know what disciplinary action, if any, the Minister has taken. I do not want to be opening up any <Col N="761" /> sores in this matter.  We kept respectfully silent about it for more than 18 months in the hope that the State, having blundered, would step in and do something to develop the factory. When we found the number employed was steadily dwindling and that the State was taking no action, I felt it was imperative to refer to the matter in the House.  Indeed, local people were saying that there seemed to be a conspiracy of silence as far as this factory was concerned, inasmuch as it was not referred to in the House until I first raised it a few weeks ago.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with State participation in local industry.  Having regard to the exceptional circumstances surrounding the project in Bantry, I think the Minister should consider the matter.  False hopes of employment were raised.  The proprietors of the factory communicated with Irishmen in England and told them work was available.  Many people, particularly those in Bantry and contiguous areas, were very disappointed when they found their hopes dashed.  I am asking the Minister to step in and retrieve the position as far as he can.  I know it is not the policy of the State to step in and take over industrial development, but surely the Minister and the Department, with their many industrial connections at home and abroad, could find some industry to replace the one I believe has failed in Bantry?  This is something I do not like to refer to in the House.  It is a black mark against Foras Tionscal that a person so qualified could pass through their net without any questions whatever as to his capacity either personally or financially.</P>
    <P>In February, 1961, the Taoiseach held out great hopes for industrial development in west Cork.  He referred to the matter on no fewer than four occasions on that day.  He spoke at length in the House on the closing of railways.  He made it very clear that an obsolete railway system was a hindrance to industrial development.  He said that was clearly shown from the experience in west Cork, because when it was definitely announced that the obsolete railway system would be removed <Col N="762" /> there were several inquiries for the establishment of industries there.  I should like to know from the Minister what happened to these industries.  I shall quote only the relevant part of the Taoiseach's statement from the Official Report of 16th February, 1961, volume 186:</P>
    <P>To my knowledge, it is true that in the past efforts to induce industrialists into that area were hampered because of the impression which industrialists had, that if they established industries in the area, they would be pressurised by the Government to use a form of transport there unsuitable to their business. The industrial development that is now taking place in west Cork is unprecedented in the history of that area.  Is that not true?</P>
    <P>The obvious answer to the Taoiseach's question now, three and a half years afterwards, is that it is not true.  This unprecedented industrial development has not materialised.  However, there is an old proverb which says it is never too late to mend.  Since the Taoiseach made this statement, it is not too late to implement it, although it is getting rather late now three years afterwards.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
    <P>I have clearly shown that manufacturing industries have only begun to flow into that area since it was announced that the railway line would be closed.</P>
    <P>They must be invisible industries. Where are they?  Except for the Flatley factory, I did not see any flowing down so far.  We had the net factory about to open in Castletownbere, but that was miles and miles from the railway and would not concern the Taoiseach's deliberations in February.  As I pointed out earlier to the Minister, the factory we had great hopes of is delayed, and I understand the blame lies with the Department.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I hope the Minister will honour the Taoiseach's assurance by ensuring that this factory will open or that work will commence on it in the not too distant future.  I do not think there is much need for me to dwell further on the problem in west Cork. The net position is that the Taoiseach's <Col N="763" /> assurances to the House are not being honoured.  We have not got the seven industries he said we were about to have in the very near future.  Perhaps, a better way of saying it would be that his anticipations have not been realised.  I want to impress on the Minister the desirability of industrial development in the area.  It is not long since we had the election.  It was in October, 1961.  Since then the number of electors has reduced in west Cork by 1,200.  In fact, I think it was 1,251. The figures, as given to Deputy Sweetman, of the electors in this constituency in recent weeks indicate that there is a fall of more than 1,200 in the number of electors in the constituency of Cork South-West, which indicates that more than 1,200 have emigrated from that area.  That is a reasonable assumption.  We were hoping that, with the possibility of developing industries there, we might be able to arrest the trend.</P>
    <P>I do not minimise the difficulty of industrial expansion and development in west Cork.  There are many difficulties but I assumed, when the Taoiseach made a statement, that he had addressed himself to all aspects of the matter and was satisfied industry was about to flow into the area, that everything would shortly be rosy in the garden.</P>
    <P>I look to the Minister to interest himself personally in this development and to try to get a few industries there, particularly the one in Skibbereen, and to try to replace the closing of the flour mills in Clonakilty where about 25 men are out of employment. Generally speaking, the picture in west Cork is not rosy.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, employment on public schemes has reduced.  I know that that is no concern of the Minister. The picture in west Cork today so far as employment is concerned is not a very rosy one.  I ask the Minister to do all he possibly can to change that position.</P>
    <P>I do not want to refer to too many other matters.  I was surprised by the attitude of Deputy Gallagher that the only contribution from the Labour <Col N="764" /> benches to discussion here is one of finding fault with the Department, of criticising the Department for this, that or the other and, generally, that all these criticisms are without foundation. Does he think we should be a mutual admiration society?  It is our job to put forward the views of this Party and our individual views.  The criticisms we have to offer are quite constructive. The speakers from the Labour benches are the most constructive in the House. We point out the grievances of the people and suggest ways and means of combating the grievances.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should turn this House into a kind of mutual admiration society where criticism should not come from any quarter and there should be nothing but praise for the Minister whether or not he deserves it.  I am not in any way reflecting on the Minister.  Possibly he is doing the best he can but his work is not showing good results.  We must have more effort from the Minister and his Department if we are to improve the figures of employment.</P>
    <P>I shall not dwell on the figures supplied to us by Foras Tionscal and the amount of money spent to date since it was initiated in 1951.  The figures show that a sum of £5,100,000 was spent in respect of industrial development in undeveloped areas and that £3,300,000 was spent in developed areas up to 31st March, 1964.  We would require a break-down of the figures to indicate how much of this has been put into worthwhile projects and how much has gone down the drain.  I shall not hold up the House now by going into any aspects of that question but, indeed, it should be very interesting.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to instruct his officers in Foras Tionscal to be more responsive to applications from Irish people who are anxious to start industry here in a small way.  I am particularly interested in people who have capital and the other qualifications and who are anxious to start small industries which may give employment in the initial stages to only ten or 11 men.  When such people go to Foras Tionscal and the potential <Col N="765" /> of employment is mentioned I am told they do not get a good reception.</P>
    <P>We should be more responsive to local people who are anxious, with their own capital and with State aid, to establish soundly based small industries in their areas.  There is an obligation on the Minister to give encouragement to such people.  It is quite possible and likely that if such industries were established they would grow and give increased employment.  I am asking him, then, to be more responsive to such applications from people who are thinking about starting small industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>One reason why there are not industries in west Cork is, I would say, Deputy Murphy, when he allies himself with the anti-industrial Party in this House, with the Party whose whole policy&mdash;since I came in here, anyway, in 1927&mdash;has been a definite one of sabotage of any industry ever started in this country to give employment.  I have endeavoured at times to help out in Deputy Murphy's constituency.  On one occasion I appealed to Lieutenant-General Costello to send down the beet seed industry there.  He did so.  At the end of three years of wailing and moaning it had to be taken down to Deputy Tom O'Donnell in Limerick where it has flourished ever since.  It is just as well to look these things in the face.  When we have representatives like Deputy Murphy holding down progress in the constituency, we must look at the problem in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This history of anti-industrialisation goes back a long way.  I would take it back to the early days when the Leader of the Opposition came in here to us and made his first attack.  We know that every member of this House has been endeavouring to stem the tide of emigration in the western counties and in west Cork.  The very first attack made in this House by Deputy Dillon was on a little thread industry which had been established in County Mayo.  That was away back on 4th December, 1935.  He attacked that little industry in the county where he himself was born and he did not stop at that.  He pursued the matter for <Col N="766" /> three years.  Referring to the strength of the thread, the rottenness of the thread, and so on, Deputy Dillon did his damnedest to drive that industry out of Mayo.</P>
    <P>We can now look back at it from 1964.  It has survived the attacks of Deputy Dillon for 30 years, and is giving employment there today.  That is the kind of stuff you get from the people over there.  How often have I seen the people over there get up to rip and tear the products of Irish industries. I remember one person who used to talk about the pitchforks made in Templemichael in Cork.  He said it was very easy to break the handles.  I got so fed up listening to him that I had a manure fork made with iron in the handle, and I sent it to him and he wondered why he could not break it.  That was the only way to put a stop to the kind of stuff you hear from those people.</P>
    <P>Two months after I came into this House&mdash;that was back in 1927&mdash;we had a proposal that a 25 per cent subsidy be paid by the Government to Rushbrooke Dockyard to keep it going.  The Government of that day were not prepared to do anything to keep the 400 Irishmen then working in that dockyard in employment.  The result was that it was handed over to the vultures who sold it out for scrap. During the emergency I saw a ship with a hole in its side come into Cork Harbour.  It had to be filled in with cement to enable it to travel on.  Those are facts which cannot be denied.</P>
    <P>A dockyard is very sensitive.  We all know it is very hard&mdash;practically impossible&mdash;to have constant employment in a dockyard.  Deputy Barrett's friends in the Cork Harbour Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;have done very little, if anything, to help the dockyards.  The whole trade of Cork port is being done by two shipping companies twice a week.  A bonus by way of release from harbour dues is paid to them to take away our produce.  Not one of those ships goes into Rushbrooke Dockyard <Col N="767" /> for repair or overhaul.  They go over to Mother England for that.  The position is the same in regard to Irish Shipping, I am sorry to say.  The vessels required by that company are sent abroad for building and repair instead of helping to give employment in our own dockyards.</P>
      <P>I hold no brief for any foreign industry in this country.  I take the same view as the farmer who said: &ldquo;He is a very good man but you would need to watch him.&rdquo;  That is the way I look on all foreign industries in this country.  I am very happy about the ability of the Minister to keep his eye on them.  I object to the way every industry that is started in this country to stem the tide of emigration is attacked and vilified by people on the Fine Gael benches.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barry talked about barriers being pulled down and said that Irish industry will fall on its tail unless it gets subsidies.  We have proof of what Irish industry is prepared to do.  Four or five miles from Cork city, Martin Molony and Bros. Ltd.  are expanding their industry to employ 170 more hands, in spite of the way Deputy Barry wailed about the dread of the woollen industry.  The position is the same in Youghal and Midleton, in spite of what Deputy Barry said about the reduction in tariffs leading to wholesale unemployment. That type of thing goes on here month after month, year after year.</P>
      <P>First of all, there is the wail about the rising tide of emigration and about unemployment, and then there is the sabotage of our industries.  I am not forgetting, when Deputies opposite were in Government, helped, of course, by the Labour Party, what they tried to do.  I have a very good recollection of the conditions then obtaining in Irish Steel Holdings.  Their activities resulted in a reduction of 200 men in the employment of Irish Steel Holdings in a three year period.  They resulted in a deterioration of the products which were rejected throughout the country.  Irish Steel Holdings were told: &ldquo;You cannot use first-grade or second-grade scrap; you must use third-grade scrap.&rdquo;  The result was, of course, that one of our industrial geniuses, Mr. Christy Fitzpatrick, the general manager, got so disgusted with them that he flung the thing there and walked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now putting those industries back on their feet again, giving employment to our people.  The people to whom these industries gave employment are getting their confidence back in Irish industry and in the Government who helped to get the industries on their feet.  Still, these so-called Cork representatives come in here and seek to vilify and attack these industries. <Col N="769" /> They try to drive these people out of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned mainly about the problem of establishing industries which will utilise particularly the produce of our land.  In that respect, I should refer to the research work initiated by Lieutenant-General Costello and the resultant processing factories.  After three years of experimental work, we are now branching out.  As Deputy Murphy has said, considerable sums of money have been collected in Kerry, in west Cork, in areas such as Bandon and Midleton, for the purpose of pushing those industries ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> The construction work in the Midleton area is now at an advanced stage and it is expected the plant there will go into production in October.  At the beginning, that industry will give full employment to 100 to 150 people and if we succeed in our programme, in three years, there will be employment there for 700 people.  Apart from the income to the area, that will have the added enormous advantage of helping to arrest the flight from the land.  More than 500 acres in west Cork will be under vegetables, with an added income of roughly £500,000 to the farmers.  That should help to keep boys and girls, sons, daughters and workers, on the land.</P>
    <P>I hope that in Kerry, in Bandon and Skibbereen, factories will be ready to go into production this time next year. I have an assurance from Lieutenant-General Costello that today he could sell five times his present production of processed foods.  Yet we all know the rumours that have been sent around.  They say: &ldquo;Oh, they cannot sell; there is no market abroad&rdquo;.  All those whispers are part of an endeavour to sabotage the confidence of our people in those industries.</P>

      <P>I know what has been happening.  I honestly believe the Deputy has heard some of it as well. I am most anxious to see those industries forge ahead for the reasons I have given.  As I have said, in Midleton, the factory is at an advanced stage of construction and we hope it will be coming into production in October, with very welcome employment <Col N="771" /> for local labour and a market for the farmers' produce.</P>
      <P>I am perturbed about the industrial situation in other parts of my constituency. There is grave need for an industry in Fermoy and also in the area west of Mallow, right through Kanturk and Newmarket.  I am at present endeavouring to make contacts in an effort to get some sort of industry for that area because any town without an industry today is bound to go to the wall.  My main reason for intervening in the debate was to meet this bad-tempered attack that has been made simply because of the people's decision in the recent Cork by-election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any point in referring to some of the rather colourful statements of Deputy Corry except to say that his innuendo that all the inspiration and planning of General Costello and the Sugar Company could be aligned with his Party is rather amusing.  The record of his Party over the past three years in relation to the establishment of these food factories is something that Deputy Corry or any member of his Party would not wish to have discussed.  It was only after considerable representations had been made by persons of great standing outside Government in this country that a final decision was taken to go on with these factories.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a fact that has been highlighted by the figures for our trade during the first quarter of this year.  I quote from the <i>Irish Times</i> of Tuesday, 9th June, 1964 which states:</P>
      <P>Of the total increases of £18.3 million in imports for the first quarter of 1964 as compared with the first quarter of 1963, £13.6 million, almost 75 per cent was in respect of materials for further production&mdash; almost all non-agricultural.</P>
      <P>This points to the fact that if we are to expand our industry, and I agree that owing to our under-industrialised condition, we must do so, we must be careful to see that we do not produce a disequilibrium in our international payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> In the same article, it is said, relative to the first quarter:</P>
    <P>Increased exports of live animals, food and food preparations account for £8.4 million of the increase of £12.7 million in total exports between the two periods.</P>
    <P>In the first quarter of this year, we had very high prices for cattle which resulted in the selling of stocks to a considerable degree&mdash;to what degree we do not know&mdash;and it was this export that allowed us without serious disequilibrium in international payments to maintain our industries here.</P>
    <P>As I see it, we are so under-industrialised that we must expand, but in doing so we must proceed along lines that are safe lines, lines that will ensure that any jobs created will be permanent jobs, which will not be interrupted by periodic credit squeezes. I note from the figures supplied that the total employed in manufacturing industry is 167,000 and that the number employed in agriculture is decreasing from 400,000.  So we must start off on the premise that our industries, important as they are, and despite any improvement we can make, are less than half as important a factor in employment as the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>While we want to industrialise, we must do so in such a way that we will use the raw materials available at home or that for those we must import, we will be able to pay on the international markets.  The Minister will agree that there is great necessity for planning for expansion so that we will not damage the equilibrium in our balance of payments.  The incentives that were first given by this Party in the inter-Party Government, such as freedom from income tax on new industrial exports and the Industrial Grants Act, have been expanded by the Minister but greater incentives will be necessary in the future.</P>
    <P>There has been serious consideration of this matter by our Party and we have been studying for some time the position of France.  We readily admit that when they were getting down to this problem in France, they got such a vast sum from the International <Col N="773" /> Monetary Fund that we cannot compare our position with theirs.  At the same time, we believe that these now accepted incentives which we already offer, such as freedom from income tax on new exports, must be expanded and extended by other incentives, such as freedom from income tax and surtax for such industries as will conduct their expansion along lines which will be in concord with Government policy and produce the level of permanent employment which we all desire.</P>
    <P>There was no reason why we could not have resorted to the International Monetary Fund as the French did, if we knew where we were going.  The fact that a turnover tax has been introduced here, although we are pledged to remove all taxes on food, fuel, and clothing for our people, has brought about a breakthrough in taxation as far as we are concerned.  While we would not operate a turnover tax as such, the fact that there has been a percentage tax on the sales of all commodities leads one to believe that the Government are now in a position to remove some of the taxation placed on industry.</P>
    <P>In the PEP publication, under the heading: &ldquo;French Planning: Some lessons for Britain&rdquo; there is a paragraph in page 355 dealing with incentives which I quote:</P>
    <P>A considerable number of terms have been used to define the nature of French planning.  The point frequently made is that while French planning is &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; and &ldquo;indicative&rdquo; and not &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; or &ldquo;imperative&rdquo;, it does seek to direct the economy in a certain direction and it does have the machinery to make these preferences effective.</P>
    <P>If we are to plan our industrial structure and if we are to say in respect of the production of goods industrially from agricultural raw materials that we will give a 50 per cent remission of income tax, that is voluntary and indicative planning.  We must face the fact that in competition it is also obligatory planning.  If there are two industries doing this job and if one of them does it as the Government want <Col N="774" /> it to be done and where they want it to be done and uses Irish raw materials, it can avail of the tax concession or whatever the incentive may be, whereas the other cannot and, therefore, cannot complete.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, the opportunity for the Government, not only to give the incentive, but to make the incentive almost an obligatory matter and something that can help in the proper structure of industry so that we will not have this situation, which is quite dangerous, where for everything we export in the category of industrial exports we have to import a very large measure of raw materials, so that, in fact, it does not help to secure the equilibrium of payments which will allow the country to go forward in the way we would all desire.</P>
    <P>Therefore I would suggest to the Minister that he should consider the expansion of the two or three incentives that he provides into the type of thing I am suggesting.  He could, for instance, give a greater incentive by way of tax concession to industries involving a high labour content and industries situated where a high level of labour was available.  I am not suggesting that we should be so parochial as to insist on an industry being established where there was a high degree of unemployment rather than allow it to place itself in a more advantageous position but there is a happy medium.  If we could get this type of industry, there is scope for the Minister to produce the type of tax concession that we on this side of the House would like to see extended.</P>
    <P>The same is true in relation to the positioning of industries having a high labour content in places where there are natural resources and where services are available.  If these further incentives that I suggest were to be given, the Minister should indicate where the industry might be established. Transport is an important consideration. We are paying £2 million per year for five years to CIE.  That does not come under the aegis of the Minister for Industry and Commerce but if we do not plan so as to get the best value from the movement of <Col N="775" /> goods and so as to get the most out of the nationalised transport system, then we are not planning in a good or proper way.</P>
    <P>If we had this varied range of incentives, we could direct certain industries that otherwise obviously, if they would come here for these incentives, would be placed in what are now known as industrialised areas.  I do not like mentioning individual industries but every time I go out the Naas road and look at the Aspro factory, I say that that should be in west Cork because everyone knows that one lorry load of Aspros will remove all the headaches that may occur in Dublin for six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not suggesting that there are more headaches in west Cork than in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but there are more people in Dublin to have headaches than there are in west Cork. That is a particular industry the siting of which does not matter, whereas on the other hand I can quote an industrial fuel industry lost to Drogheda. The raw material was being imported as waste fuel from Britain.  The grant afforded would have been larger if the industry were based west of the Shannon.  In order to get the larger grant on which the whole thing hinged, this light article in terms of weight but very heavy article in terms of volume and of usage would have had to have been imported through Dublin or Drogheda, transported to Athlone and then transported back to Dublin.</P>
      <P>This inflexible type of incentive that we have been offering must be wrong. It is economic madness that where 10/-or £1 a ton is of great importance perhaps £2 a ton should be put on the end of product cost.  It is wrong that in a case where one lorry load will produce all you want for perhaps months, the factory should be placed right in the industrial centre whereas the nationalised transport organisation could have brought this one lorry load once a month and all our headaches would have been cured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> It is that sort of thing that is so important and that requires so much detailed working out and it is the sort of thing that we should not be able to come in and make political speeches about.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the constituency in which there is a by-election pending. There just is not any industry in it. Industries based there would have qualified for the larger grants.  It did not happen.  There is an extremely high degree of emigration from the west. The structure of the incentive system should have been such that certain industries among the number mentioned this year and last year as being set up could profitably have gone there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree but, leaving out the political aspect of it, is not that true?  Then there is the question of the Report of the Committee on Industrial Organisation.  I asked the Minister a question recently as to the number of redundancies there would be according to the report so far published.  The number is something around 6,000.  I think the Minister told us that there was an increase in industrial employment of perhaps 5,300 people.  At the same time, there were far more people off the land.  In the last two and a half years, 38,000 people have left the land. If we believe the Government's <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> there will be 66,000 people off the land by 1970.  In this context we are losing the race.  The time has come for more specialised planning, for a more complex system.  Every atom of my being reacts against direction.  The same applies to the Party to which I belong. If the Government are producing the plums, they, at least, should have the opportunity to say where and when the plums would be eaten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain situation has developed. The Minister has expressed his belief in the adaptation councils which have been set up.  I suggest that there should be representatives from the Department of Industry and Commerce on the councils so that they will not be merely rationalising councils as <Col N="777" /> a result of which there will be an increase in the number of redundancies being created.  When an industrialist is in competition, irrespective of his desire to do the job right, when he sits down with three or four of his competitors and they see that by producing one article at one point and another article at another point, they can rationalise production and the end product will be cheaper, almost invariably redundancy is created.  There should be on these adaptation councils a representative of the Government because there is on the Government a serious obligation to see that the maximum number are employed.</P>
    <P>If, for instance, there is a suggestion for rationalisation which would mean redundancy in a particular industry but which might be advantageous to the management, then the proposals will go through irrespective of the views of the trade union persons on the council but if the Government were represented there, in order to suggest a greater measure of expansion of a particular incentive, perhaps applicable to that industry alone, then there could come out of rationalisation greater expansion and something which we would all desire.  The Minister should think about this.  If he wants to make the adaptation councils more positive, this is the way to do it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the ports, it is quite impossible at the moment to get a fast turnover of goods in Dublin Port.  This is not criticism of the port istelf but the port is so crowded that this fast turnover of goods cannot be achieved. At the same time, there seems to be a tendency on the part of the Government, even on the part of the larger importers, to play Dublin Port against everywhere else.  There is a situation which seems to me to be quite inexplicable.  Take the case of American coal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will consider a scheme whereby blind pensions could be paid on a sliding scale, based on the degree of blindness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that the scheme suggested would show any improvement on the present system under which the normal occupation and the need of the claimant, as well as the degree of blindness, are taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there are some degrees of blindness which would prevent people carrying on their ordinary occupations and in such cases would he not consider that if he adopted the principle of the subject-matter of my question, it would be likely to meet the justice of the case more fully?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases such as the Deputy mentions, the full benefit is payable at the moment, subject to means test.  If the Deputy's suggestion were adopted, it could result only in the reduction of the pension in cases such as that.  At present 97 per cent of blind pensioners are in receipt of pensions at the maximum rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to the means test but to the degree of blindness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that, and, as I said, in cases where a person's vision is impaired to such an extent that it prevents him from carrying on his normal occupation, the full blind pension is payable, provided his means qualify him for it.  But the degree of blindness which precludes <Col N="789" /> him from following his normal occupation qualifies him for full blind pension at present.  If I adopted the Deputy's suggestion, the only effect would be that a smaller pension would be payable in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that they do not always get the blind pension and a great many people are prevented from carrying on their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If their sight is affected to the extent that they are unable to follow their normal occupation, they are qualified from the point of view of blindness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The progress of local fish landings is an important factor in deciding whether a grant from State funds towards the cost of improvements at this pier could be justified. The value of these landings has shown a downward trend in the past two years and was only about £800 in 1963.  I am keeping the landings under observation in the hope that they will improve this year.</P>

      <P>Teaching experience is not a requisite for marking examinations in this country or as far as I know, in any other.  The qualifications required are degrees or equivalent academic qualifications.  This year the same standards were used and persons with the same type of qualification were available.  It was somebody else who set up the idea that only teachers could mark examinations.  It was not I.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an opinion expressed by teachers but not accepted by educational authorities in this country or to my knowledge in any other.

      <P>It was given to them at their request because they had other qualifications.  It was never established as desirable or the right of these teachers to have these posts exclusive of anybody else.  It was given to a big number of teachers because they had the qualifications.  This year when the teachers withdrew their help, I had to seek people with these qualifications, and I succeeded in getting them.  Other members of the public have these qualifications as well as teachers.</P>

    <P>The respective rights of the ground landlord and lessee depend on the terms of the particular lease.  However, under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, the ground landlord may not unreasonably withhold his consent to a change of user or to improvements. In relation to a change of user, section 57 of the Act provides that the landlord may not charge a fine or an increased rent, other than his reasonable <Col N="799" /> expenses, except where structural alterations are involved.</P>
    <P>In the case of improvements, section 58 provides that the landlord is not precluded from requiring the payment of his reasonable expenses in connection with his consent.  Disputes between the parties concerning these rights are a matter for civil proceedings between them and not for official investigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I was discussing the case that presently exists at Dublin Port and I inquired whether or not anything was being done about it.  I was saying it is cheaper to tranship American coal at Rotterdam and send it to Drogheda or other small ports than it is to tranship it in Dublin.  This is because Rotterdam is the great port of the continent and has floating cranes.  I understand that 1,000 tons of coal can be transhipped from one of the big transatlantic vessels in a matter of hours.  Perhaps we have a wrong attitude to our ports.  While we know we require deepwater ports such as Dublin, we should provide facilities for transhipment to the lesser ports and so keep as much employment as possible at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that the ports in my constituency are not as prosperous as I would wish them to be, there are <Col N="800" /> developments which are not welcomed. Greenore was the subject of a little acrimony in relation to a factory which might have been built there a few months ago.  There, a container service was established between that port and Preston, when the dockers in Dublin refused to handle containers. Following that, the B and I set up a £125,000 crane to handle containers at Drogheda.  Immediately these developments took place, the men in Dublin decided they would handle containers. Are we to proceed in the development of our trade on the basis of what union members will or will not do and of what steps are taken in reply to them? Rationalisation is needed.  Industries will have to be put close to these ports. The incentive methods I have instanced are absolutely necessary, so that, if we cannot direct, we can at least encourage industry in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned Mín Fhéir Teo, a company to produce grass meal on the west coast.  When this company was first mooted, it was the subject of considerable acrimony.  A report was issued which is still true.  The total usage of grass meal in this country was about 8,000 tons.  Grass meal is used for its protein and carotene content, but the major cost is not grass but oil&mdash;the cost of drying.  Grass meal production on the continent and Britain has practically reached saturation point.  What you seek in grass meal can be got in other things.  For instance, vegetable protein can be got in soya beans and carotene can be got in synthetic form.  Grass meal had its impact on the sale of these other foods because of its colour.  Its sale is directed more to the person buying it than the animal eating it.  The Minister informed us we are about to produce grass meal in the west.  I can inform him that the people commercially producing grass meal from the lush grass of Meath and Kildare and from the airports at Collinstown, Baldonnel and Gormanston are put to the pin of their collars to exist.  This project was carried on, despite the criticism of it. Now, when we reach the point of production, we find saturation point is reached.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether there is any <Col N="801" /> parallel between this and the situation in relation to Nitrigín Éireann.  Let us face it.  This was a brainchild of the Taoiseach over a period of two decades.  Anyone who studies politics in this country knows three attempts were made to set up a nitrogen factory here.  One was to be based on turf as a fuel.  That was to be a type of nitrogen not acceptable to the Irish farmer.  Various other factories were mooted.  Eventually, the opportunity arose for the Taoiseach at Avoca.  I believe that in a situation where an industry is removed from a place, you must, if you are a democratic Government, try to provide other employment at that site.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House, we gave the nitrogen factory every support.  It is only right, however, that one should say what one knows.  My information is that when Nitrigín Éireann goes into production, in the first two years it will do well.  In fact, it may be in a position to sell at less than European costs.  At the moment there is some scarcity of nitrogen on the European market, but there are as many as four new mammoth plants under construction on the continent and in Britain. Within a few decades after the start of production in Avoca, the situation will probably be that our costs here, taking into account the size of the plant and volume of demand, will be far greater than they would if we could buy it from Europe.  We are, apparently, moving into the Common Market.  The whole concept was that we get the nitrogen at the economic price, plus an ordinary profit.  We agree it is necessary to provide employment in places from which industry has been removed.  If we were in power, we would have done the same.  It is a move to the left, if you like, which must be accepted.  But there is grave danger that the type of employment being provided is not the type to provide constant and enduring work.</P>
    <P>During the year the Minister set up Taiscí Stáit Teo.  This is the Government company that can give moneys direct to industries requiring capital. It has been used to provide money for the Industrial Engineering <Col N="802" /> Company, the holding company for the five companies commonly known as the Dundalk Engineering Works.  Right through the period following the abandoning of the old GNR works, we have given this venture every opportunity for success.  In my Party I have always promulgated the line that this was a job specifically for the Minister. It was his responsibility.  Our responsibility was not to impede it in any way. The Minister will agree he has had every opportunity to proceed with the provision of employment there, from where it was removed, just as happened in Avoca.  It is his responsibility to replace that employment.  One of the companies, Commercial Vehicles Limited, is doing extremely well and I feel it will attain the position of a real economic commercial undertaking, producing profits that will help the other companies.</P>
    <P>However, I suggest the Minister should consider the fallacy of closing up an industrial undertaking employing a thousand workers and opening up other companies.  I criticise only one feature of this operation, that is, that the Taoiseach sent down as managing director a friend of his.  Whatever his excellence or his mistakes&mdash;I do not impute either lack of excellence or mistakes to him&mdash;his competence for the job was under suspicion, and since he left, there has been a considerable improvement in the morale of the employees. The Government should have sent in the first place the man they sent in the second place.  Since he has arrived there, he has done herculean work.  I am deliberately not using names in this matter.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that if he introduced a Vote here to wipe out the losses incurred in the first year, he would have the support of this Party and, I suggest, the Labour Party.  It is not a good foundation from a business point of view to create a situation where every year the interest on money lent or money lost is being charged up against current trading profits and producing on paper a loss which can be criticised by either side of the House or by persons in industry outside who feel they have some whipping boy to whip.  The Minister would do a <Col N="803" /> great service, and would have the support of most Deputies if he introduced a Vote as I suggested.  Apart from anything else, it would boost morale among the employees.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has had difficulties in relation to two or three companies which I shall not name.  I submit that if there have been failures, they have been due to the Minister's and his Party's failure to involve the Irish people in industrial expansion. It is easy to say we have had industries from abroad.  In them, however, we have only a minority, from the point of view of Irish involvement&mdash; Irish involvement in most cases is only in name, not in capital.  In Irish professional and business circles at the moment, good profits are being earned.  You will find, if you are in contact with middleclass elements in most towns, people investing in the stock market largely in British stocks and shares, not in Irish stocks and shares.  We have not had enough Irish promotions to attract available Irish capital and there is accordingly an outflow of good Irish capital.  In other words, not only is Irish capital not coming in to buy land or to promote new industry but it is going out for investment in British securities.</P>
    <P>The Minister must therefore think seriously of more involvement of Irish capital in Irish investments.  The greatest wealth we have is, of course, our employees.  I know one industry whose managing director said to me: &ldquo;We are producing our goods more cheaply in Louth than in Stockport&rdquo;. I asked him why, and he replied: &ldquo;It is a simple matter.  You stand at 6 p.m. outside the factory gate and you look at the boys and girls coming out.  Not only is their physical standard high but so is their obvious mental standard so much better than among our employees in Stockport.&rdquo;  When I asked him why that was so, he compared the conditions of living, pointing out that the employees in Stockport had been for generations living in overcrowded conditions.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have this wonderful labour potential.  That is really what <Col N="804" /> matters most.  All we need is more involvement of Irish business people, as distinct from Irish industrialists, in the promotion of business here.  Our failure has been not to encourage greater Irish involvement in industry here.  That has resulted in an increase in industrial employment which is not keeping pace&mdash;and which will not in the coming decade, according to Government forecasts&mdash;with loss of employment in the agricultural field. As well as getting this increased Irish involvement in industry, therefore, the Minister must also get the realisation abroad that we have here what no other nation in the world has&mdash;the excellent quality of our labour potential. While increases in our industrial employment are satisfactory to some, it is nothing like what we are capable of achieving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It surprised me that when listening to Deputy Corry giving well-justified praise to what appeared to be the prize in his industrial firmament&mdash;Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann&mdash; Deputy Donegan did not point out it was a Cumann na nGaedheal Government who established Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  Admittedly, it has been greatly helped by subsequent Governments.</P>
      <P>I intervene in this debate because it is quite clear that we are moving into a most interesting phase of political development in this country.  As a leftist of fairly long standing, I feel it would be a good thing to consider the possibility of the devolution of industrial control here.  It is obvious that the struggle between labour and capital is an unending struggle which can be solved only under socialism. It is a struggle that must be carried out in a society such as ours in a more sophisticated way than in the younger countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We moved to the left in 1913, and in 1914, and there was another attempt in 1916.  It was abortive at that time but the struggle was then more simple and more clearcut.  The slogans on the barricades at that time were socialist ones but now the path towards socialism is more complicated than ever before.  That has been caused by the extreme astuteness of the other <Col N="805" /> side, the capitalist side.  It has always seemed to me that if those on the socialist side did as much profound thinking as those on the capitalist side have done, we might be much further on.  As far as the world is concerned, socialism is the predominant philosophy in most countries and we in this country are in a minority in the world.</P>
    <P>This has become a more sophisticated problem because of the remarkable adaptability of the capitalist industrialist over the years. The most powerful weapon which he has with which to slow down the evolution of the socialist society is the creation of the idea of benevolent capitalism, and the realisation that the wide-scale and fatuous advertising campaigns which they conduct can be recovered from the consumer.  The most recent realisation of the capitalists is that they can concede wage increases with a token struggle and that the cost of those wage increases can be recovered fully and often more than fully by price increases.  All these moves effectively cloud the reality that there is a struggle between the worker and the employer, the struggle for the product of the worker's labour.</P>
    <P>The wonderful thing about all this is that here we are at last considering how it is possible to site industry, how it is possible to force industrialists to put industries in the backward areas, to consider how we can make industrialists solve our emigration problem. I believe there are possibilities that a capitalist society can make some progress in this regard but only by the establishment of punitive taxation on the capitalist businessman on the Swedish lines.  That requires the existence of a socialist Government which will not be frightened to tax industry. They have been able to tax industry heavily and the fears of previous Ministers here over the years that taxation would frighten industry out of the country have not been realised in the Scandinavian countries or in Western Germany.</P>
    <P>These incentives Deputy Donegan speaks about, these remissions of taxation, are not essential for the development of industry.  If they are going to <Col N="806" /> develop industry in this country, they will do it irrespective of whether they get tax concessions or not.  If there are certain industries which can stand up against outside competition and make profits for them, they will start them and that, in my opinion, is a very good development.  We have tended to invite foreign businessmen to come here.  That is bad from the point of view that we should have been able to do this industrialisation ourselves.</P>
    <P>I have never known a Minister for Finance to say that he could not find capital whenever he wanted it.  Their loans are subscribed and oversubscribed. We know there is no shortage of labour.  We know there is no serious shortage of skilled technicians amongst our own people.  We have the skill, the capital and the labour, and I have never understood why we have gone all over the world, to Japan, America, Britain, France and Sweden, to import industrialists here to establish industries and to do work which we know quite well we are able to do ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that it was the Taoiseach's attitude, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the productive type of investment was the prerogative of private enterprise but that when it came to the public utility type of industry, the State was allowed to take up where private enterprise would not take the risk even where a productive enterprise, such as Bord na Móna or Aer Lingus, was concerned.  The fact that we have been able to create these fine industries, that they are staffed by men and women from our own universities and vocational schools, that the labour is the best in the world and that our products are as good as the best in the world has led me to the position that I cannot understand why Ministers have not said that this is as convincing an argument as they want to show that there is no branch of industry which we could not develop efficiently here using the land, labour and capital available to us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry has referred to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  That is an industry based on rural Ireland and it <Col N="807" /> has the tremendous advantage of having Lieutenant-General Costello, who is a strong believer in the expansion of activity in rural Ireland, who believes that we should hold the young people in rural Ireland and give them an opportunity of doing work at a reasonably satisfactory wage.  There is no good in complaining now but it seems to me that that is an industry that should have been started 40 years ago, that it should have been the first industry started in this country and it would be now a very much more flourishing and valuable thing to us than it is at the moment.</P>
    <P>That is all under the bridge and there is no good moaning about it but it strikes me as being likely to be the most significant development of the past 40 years&mdash;this development of Comhlucht Siúicre&mdash;because the CIO reports have shown that the trend towards the establishment of the other type of industry has not been satisfactory. The Minister tends to take the view that we have examined them; we found that virtually without exception &mdash;there are a couple of exceptions, the woollen industry and so on&mdash;they have shown themselves to have very serious failings indeed; that they are inefficiently run and badly equipped; that they have not reinvested in modernised machinery and in one way or the other have not really created a sound industrial infrastructure upon which one could create a socially just order in our society.</P>
    <P>I did not need the CIO reports to tell me that, because it was quite obvious from the fact that we have had to allow virtually one million people to leave the country in the past 40 years because private enterprise industry did not provide them with work; the jobs were not there.  The jobs were there for a handful of people, a lot of them young girls.  It seems to me that private enterprise capitalism did not feel any imposition on itself to create work.  It saw people going and did nothing to expand job opportunities during the past 30 or 40 years.</P>
    <P>I have said before, and I say again, that that seems to me perfectly reasonable <Col N="808" /> for private enterprise capitalism because it is not its intention to create prosperity.  Its intention is to create prosperity for the individual shareholders in the firm, the management of the firm or the owners, if it is a family firm.  That is its sole, narrow, sectional interest.  It is not concerned with the fact that there are 40,000, 50,000 or 60,000 youngsters leaving Ireland.  It does not matter to private enterprise capitalism so long as there are enough men to work their machines in order to produce for that small unit in our society.</P>
    <P>That has been the position over the past 40 years.  They have not created enough national wealth to give us the money to pay for unlimited scholarships for youngsters to go to the university, to go to secondary schools or to build enough schools.  We hear complaints from each Minister that he has not enough money.  If one asked the Minister for Health about something, he says he has not got the money; where is the money to come from?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling. In regard to the CIO reports, we have it clearly put before the Minister that industry here is practically universally inefficient.  We have repeatedly heard from the Taoiseach that the test of <Col N="809" /> the efficiency of an industry, the test of whether he would take an industry into public ownership or ask for State intervention in relation to an industry, was if it was doing a good job and, if it was not doing a good job, then his case was that he would intervene and would do the job that industry is not doing.  I should like to ask the Minister why is it that, having found in the most categorical way from these CIO reports that the private enterprise upon which the Estimate has been relying over recent years, is not doing a good job or a satisfactory job, he has taken no steps to see that there will be some form of State intervention? I believe, as I said, that there is no good in people talking about going to the left and planning and programming and all the other slogans that are now being bandied around in the political world here. I do not think anybody can seriously make any fundamental changes in the pattern of industry here until he accepts that there must be a very much greater measure of control on behalf of the workers and by the workers in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's position now is that 17,000 of the recent grants for the commencement of industries in this country have been grants to foreigners and approximately five or six of the grants have been grants for industries exclusively started by Irish people. Surely the Minister must be seriously concerned by that fact?  Surely he must appreciate that these people are not a bit interested in the welfare of Ireland, the welfare of our community; that they are not a bit concerned to try to establish an economy here where we will be able to give the various Ministers the money they need to create a socially just order in this society? Many of these people are people who have left communities in their own countries in which they have not got anything like a prosperous order.  We are getting a number of them from Britain.  Clearly, these people are refugees from the spectre of Wilson taking over later on in the year.  The main position is that our Government would sooner see these people coming in here than take over themselves, than take a greater interest themselves in the control of industry or the establishment <Col N="810" /> of further industries on the lines of the Comhlucht Siúicre industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister's position in this is particularly difficult.  I believe it will create for him one insuperable problem which might bring down his Government ultimately because of his failure to control prices and his realisation, apparently, that he cannot control prices.  He gave me a list of prices. There are approximately 250 items in the list and of the 250, there were six items in which there was a reduction in price.  All the rest went up.  They were meat, milk, household flour, potatoes, sugar.  Those commodities have gone up by five per cent or over. Other groceries are up by 4.8 per cent. Obviously these items in the cost of living figure are of the greatest importance to the housewife.</P>
    <P>There are other items which have gone up by extraordinary amounts. They do not seriously concern me but I should imagine that politically they are very important: beer and ale by nearly six per cent; stout by 6.7 per cent and cigarettes by 6.7 per cent.  I am not bemoaning those increases in price but it is significant that in relation to stout, and so on, one of the directors of the firm which manufactures most of it in this country said recently their profits this year would be greater than ever.  I am not surprised when they appear to be able to charge whatever they like for their products.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister if he has any intention at any stage of controlling prices.  As far as the public are concerned, they now believe that the last round of wage increases, the ninth round, has been completely eaten up by the recent price increases and they see these price increases going on at a time when the Minister says he does not propose to take any action, except in respect of one item, sugar, manufactured by a State company, the Sugar Company, because he thinks price rises are reasonable.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister intend to control prices?  Has he any plan?  Has he any figure at which he will say they may not rise any higher?  At that stage does he intend to step in and, if he <Col N="811" /> does, what action does he propose to take?  Can he give the public any assurance that there is a limit to the amount by which he will allow industrialists and other business people to increase their prices before he will step in?  It seems to me the greatest weakness of the Government's position is that the Government have to stand by and watch this development.</P>
    <P>I was referred recently by the Minister to the OECD journal on prices and profits.  I read it very carefully and I cannot believe that the Minister or the Government put that forward seriously as a policy statement which is likely to have any influence on the continued rise of prices.  The emphasis throughout the whole article was on the control of salaries and wages but no serious consideration has been given here, or in virtually any of the countries that contributed to the article, to taking action at any time, no matter what increase in prices goes on.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not appreciate that the trade union movement must act if it believes that the price rises have absorbed, and more than absorbed, the ninth round of wage increases and will then be in the position of being forced to press for a tenth round increase?  It is possible the Minister is acting in the belief that since there is a serious discrepancy between the wage and salary rates being paid here and those paid in Britain and in many other central European countries, we can allow quite a considerable increase in wages to occur yet before we find ourselves priced out of the European markets.  That may be at the back of the Minister's policies but should any demands be made by the trade union movement and the workers, I hope the Government will not oppose increases in so far as they must accept responsibility for permitting price rises to go on, at a time when all the company reports continue to emphasise the fact that, no matter what money they spend on their various schemes of insurance, advertising, price rises or whatever they spend their money on, profits and dividends not only stay firm but continue to rise. The Minister cannot continue to <Col N="812" /> tolerate that position.  Certainly he cannot expect the worker to continue to tolerate that position where he is asked to restrict his consumption or to restrict his income at a time when unrestricted profits and unrestricted dividends are being paid to people who make little or no serious contribution to the national economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister why there is so much apparent indecision or hesitation about this suggestion we have heard that we should have some form of association with the Common Market.  Some of us have believed all along that full membership of the Common Market was never a necessity and was, in fact, undesirable from our point of view, that associate membership was something which had such a flexible protocol that one could negotiate for the best of being associated with the European Economic Community and, at the same time, not have many of its commitments.  It looks again that some kind of loose association should be arranged between ourselves and the EEC, and I wonder whether any agreement has been reached between the Government and the recent French visitor that France would support us if we wanted to establish some sort of trade treaty with these people.  If there is such an understanding, when are we likely to hear about it and what will it involve?  Will it involve a continued reduction in tariffs or an alteration in tariffs and what commitments will it involve for us in relation to our trade with Britain?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach still seems to feel that the suggestion that we would not become full members is some imputation against himself, a suggestion that we do not have a completely viable, sturdy and independent economy.  Any child in arms could tell him we do not have that, even if we did not have the CIO reports to confirm the fact that we have failed here over the past 40 years and that our industries are, on the whole, very insubstantial things, particularly compared with the great and powerful industries of central Europe.  It surprises me that a man of the realism of the Taoiseach would not face that reality at this stage and <Col N="813" /> look for some sort of association with EEC, so that we could, if essential, retain our trading position with Britain and at the same time, have some trading position with EEC.  I should be glad if the Minister would clarify, as far as possible, the present position in that regard because it is a matter of the greatest importance to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of the confidence and optimism which the Minister tried to convey in his opening speech, I think it is well to recognise that there are a number of serious drawbacks in the official policy towards industrial development.  First, I believe there are far too many bodies dealing with industrial development and the promotion of industry.  We have the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Industrial Development Authority, An Foras Tionscal and the Industrial Credit Company.  Then we have the Department of Transport and Power looking after the Shannon Industrial Estate and we have the Department of Agriculture really in charge of the bacon and creamery industries.  This diversification of responsibility for industrial development is very bad.  There is definite evidence to show that at times it can prove frustrating and even discouraging to an industrial promoter.</P>
      <P>There is very little justification for this diversification, particularly when we remember that in the past few years, some of the functions formerly under the control of the Minister for Industry and Commerce have been given to the newly-created Ministry of Transport and Power.  All aspects of industrial development should be under the control of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  There should be greater co-ordination between the various bodies and perhaps an amalgamation of some of their functions.  With this division of responsibility in different State bodies, there is bound to be overlapping and duplication and, worst of all, a certain conflict can arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a good example of this recently in County Limerick where, over the past two years, an effort was <Col N="814" /> made to secure a milk-processing industry, and after 18 months or two years of effort, which included sending a representative to the continent and a visit to Newcastle West by a number of continental industrialists, finally, when a definite proposal was formulated, it was shot down.</P>
    <P>I have before me a report of a meeting which was summoned at Newcastle West after the news had been received that the proposal had been turned down.  I quote from the <i>Limerick Leader</i> of Saturday, April 18th:</P>
    <P>Mr. Ed. O'Connell, representing Newcastle West Development Association, said that for the past 15 months the Association had spent a lot of time and had even sent representatives to Germany with a view to the establishment of a milk powder factory in the town.</P>
    <P>Mr. E. O'Dwyer, Secretary of the Newcastle West Development Association, said the Association would have been saved a lot of time, effort and expense if they had been told of the position&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is the point&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>when they started their campaign for the milk powder factory 15 months ago or so.  There should be more inter-communication between the semi-State bodies and local voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>Mr. Kelly who attended that meeting &mdash;I think he represented the IAOS&mdash; said it was rather surprising that the Industrial Development Authority did not consult An Bord Bainne or the IAOS in connection with a project of this kind.</P>
    <P>That would seem to bear out the point I have been making, that there is far too much hopping from one authority to another and that much time and effort could have been spared if the proper advice had been given at the beginning.</P>
    <P>The second weakness that is very much apparent in our approach to industrial development is the absence of any rational planning or even coordinated effort for the development and expansion of food-processing industries. When we take into account <Col N="815" /> the many natural advantages which this country has for the production of high quality food products, when we remember our close proximity to the greatest food importing nation in the world and when we also consider the success of the Irish Sugar Company and An Bord Bainne in the north of England in recent times, it is an extraordinary state of affairs to find that the Minister for Industry and Commerce introducing his annual Estimate makes &mdash;if I remember correctly&mdash;hardly any reference to this aspect of industrialisation. The only logical conclusion I can draw from this is that now that agriculture seems to have been relegated to a secondary position so far as the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is concerned, the promotion of industries based on agriculture is not considered even worthy of the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Personally, I feel very strongly about this because I have seen the fruits of this policy in my constituency.  It is a constituency which has been traditionally associated with food-processing and the products of these industries have enjoyed an international reputation. At one time we had five bacon factories in Limerick city, while we now have only three, and in view of the recommendations in the report of the survey team which examined the bacon industry, we shall be lucky if we are left with one.  Side by side with that, we had creamery industries and we now have recommendations that this business be closed down.</P>
    <P>I think I referred last year on this Estimate to the necessity for coordinated effort and rational planning in the promotion of industries based on agricultural raw material.  Absence of such co-ordination is very difficult to understand and I sincerely hope the Minister will make some effort before it is too late to apply some type of rational planning to the whole business.</P>
    <P>I am also interested in the question of the location and size of industries. It seems to be accepted by the Government that it is only a waste of time to try to establish small industries in <Col N="816" /> rural towns and villages.  Recently, I took the trouble to do a good deal of research on this aspect of industrialisation. I was amazed to find that even in the most highly developed industrialised countries, the small industries in the rural areas still play an important role.  I wonder if the Government have examined fully the possibilities of small-scale industries in the rural towns.  As I have already said, other highly industrialised countries are not overlooking this important factor.</P>
    <P>In Great Britain, for example, there are a number of official or semi-official bodies especially concerned with the promotion of small rural industries. There is the Rural Industries Equipment Loan Fund, the Rural Craftsmen Workshops Loan Fund who grant assistance to small industries.  There is the Rural Industries Bureau for England and Wales which provide advisory service.  In Scotland, there is the Scottish Country Industries Development Trust.  Even in Northern Ireland, there is the Rural Industries Development Committee of the Northern Ireland Council of Social Services. It is interesting to note also that in the United Kingdom, in 1959, out of 55,000 industrial undertakings, 15,000 were employing only between 11 and 24 workers, 23,000 were employing between 25 and 99 and only 1,144 were employing over 1,000 workers.</P>
    <P>In the USA, 1951, 731,500 undertakings were employing 1,000 workers or less, and there were only 4,300 employing 500 or more.  In the Netherlands, between 1950 and 1956, over 100 medium-sized undertakings were set up in developed areas.  In France, the national regional and development planning approach there does not overlook this important factor of the small industries.  I believe the Government here have thrown in the towel and have given up all idea of trying to promote and encourage small industries. The results, particularly for rural Ireland, have been tragic.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting study on this question of the small industries for the rural community in the Journal of the Institute of Public Administration, volume 2, No. 4.  It is a study <Col N="817" /> carried out by Reverend Jeremiah Newman of Maynooth College in which he goes into detail regarding this question and the possibility of establishing small industries in our rural areas.  I quote from that Journal, page 17, where Professor Newman is reviewing various studies into this aspect of industrialisation.  He says:</P>
    <P>We would like to draw attention here to an important study by M. Marcel Laloire and published in October, 1961, in the <i>International Labour Review</i>.  Its title is &ldquo;Small-Scale Industry in the Modern Economy&rdquo; and it is an attempt to answer the oft-asked question whether such industry can survive and perform a useful function in the world today and if so what its place should be in the economic plans of the developing countries?  The answer given is of great significance for Ireland.  It is that, far from being moribund, small-scale industry is a dynamic force with a valuable role to play in the modern economy.</P>
    <P>As Professor Newman points out, his overall conclusion is that:</P>
    <P>from the economic as well as the social point of view, the establishment of small undertakings is often more valuable than the over-hasty establishment of huge industrial complexes, which no doubt look more impressive but draw off the labour force from rural areas and give rise to serious unbalance.</P>
    <P>Of course, this question of small industries for rural areas is very much tied up with what I was speaking of earlier, that is, the development of food-processing industries.  I am convinced that if there were a proper approach and a rational plan to this processing of agricultural raw material, it would be possible to have small-scale processing plants in many of our rural towns and villages.  I hope that some serious consideration will be given to this aspect of industrialisation.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to refer to, that is, the function, the role and the possibilities of local development associations.  There has been a remarkable growth in the number of local development associations <Col N="818" /> which have been established here over the past few years.  Many of these associations have done very valuable work in the matter of promoting and attracting industries to particular areas but there is a colossal wastage of effort.  Considerable amounts of money have been spent and in many cases the money spent by those associations has yielded very little return.</P>
    <P>I believe there should be much closer liaison between the official State body, the Industrial Development Authority, and the Local Development Association.  Indeed, I cannot refer to this particular question without recalling the late Senator Moloney who, to my knowledge, made several efforts in recent times to bring about this closer liaison between the IDA and the Local Development Association. The only way I can see that this could be done is that these associations should work more closely together. They could pool their resources and obtain the specialised advice which might be necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to the Minister's Department that the main bulk of our people look with hope and enthusiasm for the strengthening of our economy and the provision of full employment, adequate wage standards, and equilibrium in our balance of payments.  We look to the Department of Industry and Commerce for the establishment of new industries.  The assistance, guidance and advice of the Minister's Department are fundamental to the growth of our economy, if we are to reduce the incidence of unemployment and stem the haemorrhage of emigration. It is again to this vitally important Department that we look to to remedy the social disadvantages of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one is to judge by the history of events since the inception of this State, the facts are that the action taken by the various Ministers for Industry and Commerce has been totally inadequate to bring about the happy situation we have in mind.  The reliance on private enterprise, in the main, to absorb our unemployed has been an abject failure. Despite the advocacy of the Labour Party, the various Departments have <Col N="819" /> shown a reluctance and a hostility to intervene directly and establish the industries themselves.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made about the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  The Government give us to believe that this Programme from 1958 to 1963 was a great success and an achievement.  We have now launched the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> which will end in 1970.  The target set in the First Programme was the attainment of 100,000 jobs.  A degree of near full employment for our people and an era of prosperity was forecast on the termination of that five-year plan.  In the White Paper issued at the end of that period, the Government chose to pick out certain attainments but to ignore the overall fact that, in respect of the creation of anything like full employment, this First Programme was a failure.</P>
    <P>The Second Programme now forecasts the attainment of a growth rate which will mean an increase of 78,000 jobs by 1970.  This represents an increase of approximately 8,000 a year. If one analyses that figure, one finds it is less than half the number of jobs required to give anything like full employment. From the Labour point of view, it is extremely disquieting that, even if all goes well with this Second Programme, by 1970, we shall have an unemployment rate of three and a half per cent and an emigration rate of 10,000 persons per year.</P>
    <P>It has been an integral part of Labour policy and philosophy that the State should intervene directly in the affairs of the nation, that there should be positive planning at Government level to absorb our unemployed, to give a rising standard of living and to end the state of affairs in which we have been regarded as a vanishing race.  That intelligent, organised planning of our society is laid down in the constitution of our Party going back to 1912.  Therefore, it is nothing new for us to advocate that, where private enterprise is unable or unwilling to do the job, there is a moral duty on the State to create the circumstances, <Col N="820" /> establish the industries and put human beings to work.  As far as we are concerned, our most cherished asset is not the land, the capital, the machinery, the credit system of our country, or even its beauty, but its human beings. The Government who fail to absorb these persons into society are failing in their first duty.  It is the height of criminal folly that the resources of our country and the rich harvest abounding our shores should be so underdeveloped and underutilised and that the talents of so many of our people should not have been tapped and put to useful and productive work.</P>
    <P>It is a source of some gratification to us in the Labour Party that what we have been advocating down the years is now meeting with a response in other spheres and that intelligent, organised planning of our society is no longer regarded here as a dirty word.  More and more political Parties are vying with one another as to which will go farthest to the left in order that this principle be adhered to.</P>
    <P>Our main complaint with the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is that it is nothing more than a programme. It is merely an indication or a forecast; it is not a plan.  No concrete steps have as yet been taken to ensure by Government action that the targets set out will be achieved and that the plan in its entirety will become a reality.  The Government are relying mainly on advocacy.  They feel the most they can do is to advocate and entice. They are afraid to intervene directly in order to make the plan a success.  We reject this attitude of helplessness on the part of the Government.  We feel there is a duty on them to ensure that the plan is attained.  If I am regarded as carping or critical in respect of this Programme, it is only because I want to be constructive.  I want the Minister to take the necessary steps to ensure it is perfected and pursued to its final implementation.  At the termination of the plan in 1970, I do not want to see the nation again confronted with 170,000 emigrants as happened during the First Programme from 1958 to 1963.  I do not want to see the nation faced with a standing unemployment figure of between 60,000 and 80,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> That is the kind of planless planning we deplore.  Therefore, we in the Labour Party advocate the setting up of a national board to see that this Second Programme is implemented. We advocate that the targets set out in the Programme be raised, if need be, to ensure that the plan will be successfully terminated.  We advocate that the national planning board should consist of economic experts removed from interference of any kind from the Government and we suggest that there should be a second tier comprising all the facets in our society&mdash;industry, agriculture, the trade unions, and, of course, the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>It is only by such positive measures that we will be able to transform this Programme&mdash;this indicative forecast, to use economic jargon &mdash; into a positive plan.  In this Programme, we submit that the four per cent improvement envisaged will not even bridge the present gap between the standard of living here and that of the people of Britain and continental countries.  A revealing table in the Second Programme forecasts that the gross national product per head of the population by 1970 will be £360.  The same table reveals that the gross national product per head in Great Britain in 1961, three years ago, was £510.  It will be seen clearly, therefore, that though our relative standard will have improved considerably we will have done nothing to make up the leeway between the standard of life of our people and that of the people of Great Britain or the EEC countries by 1970.</P>
    <P>I have said that the present target in this respect should be raised, realising that there are certain difficulties involved, that radical changes in policy may be necessary.  We are prepared to see these radical changes take place if this plan is properly to be implemented.  When the First Programme was announced, the Labour and trade union movements pointed out the feasibility at that time of increasing the forecast growth rate of two per cent to a higher figure of something like four to five per cent. We were told by the Government then that we were unrealistic in hoping that <Col N="822" /> the anticipated growth rate could be improved on.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, the growth rate achieved in the period 1958 to 1963 was something like 4½ per cent.  Again at the expense of being told we are unrealistic, we suggest that the present anticipated growth rate of four per cent be increased.  We believe that by proper management of the affairs of the nation and the utilisation of the land, capital resources and highly-talented and adaptable labour force available, we can achieve a higher rate than four per cent.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to indicate what machinery, if any, he has established or what arrangements he has made to ensure that the targets and objectives of the Second Programme will be realised.  If it is the attitude of the Government that they can only assist, guide and persuade, then, in my opinion, this Second Programme will come to nothing.  We will still have to contend in 1970 with a comparatively low standard of living; we will still have to contend with a high degree of unemployment; and we will still have the spectre of emigration.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we in the Labour Party make no apology for seeking an extension of the public enterprise sector &mdash;that it be pursued with all vigour. We are proud of the attainments of the various Governments in respect of many of the State or semi-State enterprises. Today, much valuable, secure and remunerative employment is provided for thousands of men and women by such bodies as the ESB, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Bord na Móna, Irish Shipping and CIE.  In this respect I extend to the Minister my personal congratulations for any hand, act or part he may have played in the establishment or extension of these industries.  On them is conferred the badge of permanency, unlike the private enterprise sector in respect of which we have heard such alarming statements in the House as to the amount of public money expended by way of grants and loans to persons whose character and intentions were not of the highest calibre.</P>
    <P>There have been allegations that <Col N="823" /> substantial amounts of the taxpayers' money are being dissipated.  I do not lend my voice to that type of allegation, but if it is true, I suggest we should have the facts.  I should not like anybody to infer I would say anything to undermine any Irish industry giving good employment: rather would I support and applaud that industry and do all in my power to shelter and protect it, if only for the sake of those at present depending on it for their livelihood.</P>
    <P>I think it fair to point out that during the past 40 years private enterprise has failed miserably to do its job.  During that period, we have lost a million of our race through emigration. During the five years of the First Programme, the figure was 170,000 people.  Employment in this country today is lower than it was a few years ago.  If the Minister does not intervene directly to establish these industries, there is no hope for our people in a private enterprise economy.  Without doing the things which the Labour Party say should be done to perfect the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> the Government are merely hoping for a solution of our emigration problem without taking the necessary steps to attain it.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have adverted to the CIO reports and to likely redundancy in certain industries investigated by the Committee on Industrial Organisation. The revelations of these fact-finding committees were a source of deep anxiety to the industries involved in the investigations.  References are made in the CIO reports to the boot and shoe industry and there is also the report of the Footwear Adaptation Council recently set up.  As one who entered into this industry at a very tender age and who derived his livelihood from it for a long number of years, I have a natural interest in its welfare.  Up to now, it has been sheltered by way of quota protection.  It was a protected industry all down through the years and it now produces 97 per cent of the home requirements. The Minister and his Party may take <Col N="824" /> a large measure of credit for the development of many of these factories in the late thirties.  They helped in no small way to develop this industry and they did that by way of providing adequate protection against outside competition of an unfair character.</P>
    <P>That industry has grown in strength and prestige and it now employs 5,822 people in safe and remunerative employment.  There are 27 factories associated with the Footwear Adaptation Council and the production in this important industry now amounts to 7,000,000 pairs of footwear last year. The value of that production was £8,682,000.  The industry was able to export 1,000,000 pairs of shoes last year at a value of £2 million.  It can never be said that this industry abused the protection afforded to it.  Rather did it avail of every opportunity given to it to strengthen itself.  That is amply manifested by the high quality of the footwear produced, by the style and by the prices.  Profits in the industry were not unfair and certainly not abnormally high.</P>
    <P>My concern is that this industry is now facing a transition period which will determine whether it is to go forward or recede.  When the possibility of entering the EEC was a live issue some two years ago, many industries in which quota protection was in operation were advised that it would have to be dismantled and replaced by a tariff system.  The boot and shoe industry, being directly involved, agreed with the Department of Industry and Commerce that they had no option but to forgo the quota system of protection and revert to a tariff system instead.</P>
    <P>This advice of the Department was the best possible at the time because of the real possibility of our entry into the Common Market.  The chances of our entry to that Community have receded rather than improved, owing to the rebuff given by General de Gaulle to the British application.  No one now knows the true position.  We have had M. Couve de Murville visiting us here recently and there is now talk of some loose association with the Community rather than full or associate membership.  With the likely <Col N="825" /> change of Government in Britain and with the upsurge of Labour support there, there is a real possibility that Mr. Harold Wilson will lead the new Government of that country and it is widely held that there is no great anxiety on the part of an English Labour Government to enter the Community.  Again Ireland's chances will have greatly diminished.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, when there is no known prospect of our entering the Community, when we do not even have the advantage of association with the Common Market, it surprises me that the Minister or his Government should proceed to dismantle the protection of Irish industry, that they should continue to substitute tariffs for quotas, without being able to give us an assurance of reciprocal contracts with the EEC.  In these circumstances, it is the desire of the whole boot and shoe industry, the manufacturers, the trade unions and the adaptation council that the Minister should see that there will be no quick change from quota to tariff.  There is no doubt or ambiguity in the minds of the people in direct control of this industry that any quick change from a quota to a tariff system will have disastrous results, will cause dislocation of the industry and mass unemployment among operatives.</P>
    <P>The inherent fear is that no matter what tariff is fixed, there will of necessity be an amount of dumping.  This small market of ours will be used as a dumping ground for the producers of cheap and shoddy footwear all over Europe and the measure which was passed in this House last week, the Control of Imports (Amendment) Bill 1964, is, regrettably, inadequate to cope with the kind of dumping envisaged by this industry.  The kind of dumping which has been taken care of in that Bill is dumping from low-cost production countries, from faraway places, perhaps, like Japan, but we are concerned about dumping from countries closer to home, from the vast industrial towns of Britain, where one factory can produce twice as many boots and shoes as are manufactured by the whole boot and shoe industry in this country in one year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> I know the Minister, being responsible for nurturing and developing this industry over the years, will see to it that the result of the matter that now rests with the Industrial Development Authority in respect of arranging the tariffs on this commodity and the outcome of the negotiations between the British Ministry of Trade and the IDA will be such as to provide adequate measures of protection for the industry, especially as the industry has progressed so far.  It has been the first industry in this country to establish a joint board of conciliation and arbitration and has set a headline for all industries by reason of the harmony and good relations that such a board can achieve and has achieved.  At the behest of the Minister, it has been the first industry to establish an adaptation council and that adaptation council has reported and every Deputy has been furnished with a copy of the report.</P>
    <P>That adaptation council has made tremendous strides, despite the gloomy report of the CIO which indicated that the boot and shoe industry might expect by reason of the technological changes which the CIO personnel recommended to lose at least 1,000 operatives; that the new techniques and devices and technological changes recommended would bring about a reduction of 1,000 operatives without our entering the Common Market and that if and when we did enter, another 1,000 operatives would be lost through redundancy, having regard to the stiffer competition we will have to contend with.  That would represent 2,000 operatives out of a total labour force of 5,822.  That was the forecast, which was not merely gloomy, but was going to scourge out of existence one-third of the labour force in the industry.</P>
    <P>Despite these reports, that adaptation council had progressed with all speed and energy to readapting itself, to re-energising itself, adopting the most modern techniques and methods known to the industry in the world, and is rapidly gaining new strength for the kind of rigorous competition envisaged in freer trade circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of work yet to be done, as the Minister and his Department <Col N="827" /> well know, and it would be a great tragedy if at the end of this year, by reason of the matter now before the IDA, the transition from quota to tariff, anything was done to hinder or retard the great work of this adaptation council, speaking for and acting for the whole boot and shoe industry.</P>
    <P>It is my ardent appeal to the Minister today to have regard to the appeals made to him and the concrete and cogent reasons given to him by the representatives of the adaptation council by the boot and shoe manufacturers and the officers of the Irish Shoe and Leather Workers Union, who are gravely perturbed that the policy now being pursued is an erroneous policy and will bring about disastrous results in this industry if it is not arrested by the direct intervention of the Minister himself.</P>
    <P>I have been thinking over the history of events in this industry.  I know what redundancy and unemployment mean.  I know what a reduction in the quota or relaxation of protection can mean to the industry, particularly to the men and women who are dependent on it for their livelihood.  We have a vivid recollection that when the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, the present Taoiseach, for some reason best known to himself relaxed control of this industry in 1947, some two million pairs of shoes were dumped in this country.  The dislocation of the industry here was appalling, as the Dáil debates of that period, which I took care to read, reveal; unemployment was rife in every town where a boot and shoe factory existed.  I and my colleagues walked the streets of Clonmel for many months before it was possible to achieve again anything like full production.</P>
    <P>We have sad memories of the importation of some two million pairs of footwear in that year and the tragic events which followed.  Many of the people who were dismissed as redundant at that time were never again re-employed and many industries that went to the wall were never reopened.  I earnestly beseech the Minister, therefore, to see to it that we do <Col N="828" /> not have a recurrence of what took place in 1947 for the purpose of teaching the manufacturers a lesson at the termination of the second Great War in respect of the shoddy materials used during that period.  The attitude was that the consumer was entitled to a good quality commodity, a decent style and fair price, and rightly so. However, it was rugged for the workers that, in order that some people should be taught that kind of lesson, the workers should suffer the hardship and privation of near-poverty for such a considerable number of months until the protection was restored and the industry given a chance to accelerate and improve its position.</P>
    <P>From that moment, the industry has never looked back.  It has now achieved a high degree of efficiency. The extent of its export trade is an indication of the intrinsic worth of that industry.  Some £2 million worth of shoes were exported last year, not only to Britain, to which some 80 per cent went, but to places as far afield as America.  This then is an industry which is well worth caring for and protecting, and I hope the discussions taking place in respect of the substitution of tariff for quota will be watched carefully by the Minister, as indeed they will be watched in the intervening months by the captains of industry, by the captains of the trade unions and by the watchdogs of that industry in this House.</P>
    <P>In my contribution on the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> I omitted to mention that the implementation of this plan necessitates in very large measure a greater increase in tax revenue.  We do not begrudge an increase in taxation of this kind for the essential facets of our economy, to improve social welfare benefits, to make possible education for all our children, to give us the free health scheme to which we all aspire and, above all else, to accelerate the sluggish wheels of industry and to improve out of all proportion the growth rate of agriculture.  In respect of taxation, the philosophy of our Party has always been that it should be apportioned in accordance with the ability of people to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that if you will let me develop my point.  I was coming to this question of prices. It is a matter of deep regret to us of the Labour Party that the Minister has adopted the hopeless and helpless attitude of not being able to do anything at all in respect of the control of prices.  The attitude that competition will keep prices down is a lot of hooey and the Minister knows that well.  It is alarming in the extreme to think, as indicated in a reply to Deputy Dr. Browne recently, that in respect of the prices of some 250 commodities which the ordinary consumer uses every day, there has been a substantial increase.</P>
      <P>It has been said that this Government have a vested interest in this price question.  The higher the prices of commodities go, the more the Government will garner in turnover tax.  I would not wish to attribute such a callous motive to any Government. Neither would I wish to attribute to them a desire to acquiesce, as they seem to be acquiescing, in the dictates of vested interests in industry, trade and commerce by allowing prices and profits to spiral at a time when we know it to be the policy of the same Government to be very restrictive in respect of increases in wages.  The trade union movement is gravely perturbed at the indifference of the Government and their inactivity in respect of keeping prices steady.</P>
      <P>The formula for a ninth round of wage increases was achieved at national level for a two and a half year period, on the clear understanding that prices would be held steady, that there would be no appreciable increases in prices, that the ninth round increase in wages was to compensate for price increases up to that point, that it was to include a little extra to improve the standard of living and was not a licence to every exploiter, extortioner and profiteer to rampage around the country and rob the workers left, right and centre of this 12 per cent increase in salaries and wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this attitude is to continue of an abandonment of responsibility on the <Col N="830" /> part of the Minister, an attitude of helplessness in this sorry state of affairs, that competition will level things out, I do not think one can expect the unions, and certainly not the rank and file of the trade union movement, to accept the situation lying down.  The Minister may well expect, and all concerned need not be surprised, a further demand for improvement in wages and salary scales before very long more.  One cannot stand by and see the standard of living of our people dragged down, the wage increases recently obtained dissipated, without warning that it is the duty of some of us to see that the standard of living of our friends and colleagues in a trade union movement shall not be dissipated.  We shall see to it that what has been achieved in standards is maintained, irrespective of the consequences.</P>
    <P>Many members of the House have seen fit to refer to the situation in their constituencies in relation to the duties and responsibilities of the Minister and his Department.  It is to the Department one looks with hope and enthusiasm for the creation of employment for unemployed people, for boys and girls leaving school and for unemployed adult workers in cities and towns, and especially in rural areas.  I listened with great interest to Deputy O'Donnell when he pointed out the wonderful organisation and opportunities that other Governments make available to local industry in rural areas.  I regard my constituency of South Tipperary and West Waterford as, in a very large measure, underdeveloped. I know of no worthwhile industry established in any town there for many years.  There is a very high incidence of emigration.  Figures supplied to me by the Minister for Social Welfare recently showed that unemployment there at that time was higher than some years ago.  The area, to a large extent, is forgotten so far as establishment of industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that it is not a matter for him or his Department but for the <i>entrepreneurs</i> of industry and men of property and capital to provide the blueprint for industry and that the Department will provide the necessary <Col N="831" /> loans, grants, stimulants and aids; but it is no satisfaction to the unemployed and the potential emigrant to be told that.  I am concerned about the men and women of no property and it has been the theme of my speech that there is an obligation on the Minister, when he sees in that constituency that private enterprise is unable or unwilling to do the job, not to look blindly on the exodus and emigration from the area, and the high incidence of unemployment, without asking the State to intervene and see what can be done to change that state of affairs.</P>
    <P>In my native town of Clonmel, there has been no additional industry for many years, although a major industry is a dire necessity there.  There is no outlet for the brilliant young boys and girls from the secondary schools and I know for a fact that 90 per cent of them are emigrating because they have no hope, no security and no prospects of a future in their own town or county.</P>
    <P>At the employment exchanges, an additional 200 or 300 men are signing. In other towns of Tipperary, the future is also gloomy.  They have an aspect of despair.  Cashel, which had a Deputy in this House for many years, now enjoys the privilege of having two here, but I know as a young Deputy how inadequate we can be in winning industries for our town.  There is no industry whatever in the historic town of Cashel and I would say it has one of the highest emigration rates of any town in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In West Waterford, in Tallow and Lismore, the cry to their Deputy is: &ldquo;What can you do to bring us industry?&rdquo; We have gone from time to time to Foras Tionscal to put propositions to them but to no avail.  Unless one approaches that body with a positive blue print for an industry which is regarded by them as being not merely economic but has a manifest and sizeable potential, they are not interested.  I have heard, and I agree with Deputies who said, that if you had a different texture of skin, spoke with a different accent and had a different kind of cheque book, you might be received more cordially and <Col N="832" /> achieve greater results.  The ordinary Irishman going up with the best intentions has had a sorry experience.  The capital is there in abundance; the money will be made available.  There are many amenities to attract industrialists&mdash;rich arable land, water with good fishing, good roads, piped water supplies and an abundant labour force which is highly intelligent and adaptable and which could prove itself to be the best in the world if given a fair opportunity, but we have been as voices crying in the wilderness for a long time as regards securing additional industries.</P>
    <P>By reason of these trends and our experience and facts which cannot be controverted, we, in the Labour Party, have become more and more convinced that the State, and particularly the Minister's Department, must play a more vigorous and responsible part in initiating industry.  We must not rely on private enterprise because while our social philosophy regrettably is that private enterprise should be left to do what it can best do and that the State should not either hinder or retard them but aid and stimulate and co-ordinate their efforts, despite all the help and stimulants the Department has poured into the system, the system has proved an abject failure.  It therefore devolves on us to do what is wise and right and socially good and establish more industries of the kind I mentioned, such as the ESB, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Bord na Móna and so on. Only in that way can we stem the exodus of many thousands who are flying from rural areas.  As figures show, some 17,000 persons per annum are leaving rural areas for cities and towns, and also for Britain.  The Minister should see to it that the rural areas are no longer denuded of their people.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy T. O'Donnell who suggested many magnificent proposals which could be implemented in order to provide remunerative and secure work for the rural population.  Agriculture, of necessity, cannot completely absorb these people.  It has been proved, by reason of the introduction of many labour saving devices on the land, that the rural population are flying <Col N="833" /> away.  My appeal to the Minister is to take the initiative himself and not to have any fear when he embarks upon a State enterprise of an expensive kind to absorb our unemployed and to raise our living standards.  He will find a vast amount of support for himself throughout the whole nation.</P>
    <P>The nation is like a family.  The family, as is laid down in our Constitution, is the fundamental unit of society possessing inalienable rights. As in the family the least gifted, mentally and physically, share in the lot of the most brilliant and physically strongest and as in the family the resources and heritage of all are available to all.  Accordingly, we in the Labour Party say that every man, woman and child in this nation should be backed by the resources of the nation and guaranteed against poverty, want or insecurity.  Moreover, they should be backed by security against the spectre of unemployment and the haemorrhage of emigration.</P>
    <P>We believe that every citizen in our community should be backed by the resources of the State and that their individual powers should be backed by the powers of an organised nation. It is only in that way we can achieve the Ireland of happy homes which I feel we all aspire to.  It is only in that way we can achieve the equal opportunities enshrined in our Constitution and the social justice for which we all plead.  That is the kind of policy and philosophy we should seek to carve out.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to have regard to the wind of change, to take his courage in his hands and to see to it that the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is so organised and so backed by the resources of the nation and of the people that it will be a reality and we shall not have at the culmination of this programme in 1970, the spectre of the first plan, of 170,000 unemployed and a standing unemployment figure of 50,000.</P>
    <P>I have nothing more to say except to wish the Minister every good luck and every success in his task and in anything he does to improve the lot of the people of this country.  We in the <Col N="834" /> Labour Party extend to him our hearts and our hands in anything he does in that regard.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom comhgáirdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Aire agus leis an Roinn as ucht na h-oibre a dhein siad i rith na bliana.  Fear macánta atá san Aire.  Is duine é a thuigeann cúrsaí na Roinne agus tá an-thaithí aige ar obair na Roinne ó cuireadh i mbun na Roinne é.</P>
      <P>Tá athrú mór chun feabhais tagtha ar chúrsaí déantúsaíochta i gcomparáid leis an dóigh ina raibh siad roint bhliain ó shoin.  Go deimhin, tá spiorad nua sa tír.  Tuigeann pobal na hÉireann cad tá dhá dhéanamh ag an Aire ar son na tíre agus tá meas acu dá réir air.  Tá a fhios acu go bhfuil an tír ag dul ar aghaidh maidir le tionscail do bhunú.  Tá daoine as tíortha eile ag bunú tionscal nua in Éirinn agus is maith an rud é sin.</P>
      <P>Tháinig méadú i mbliana ar an méid daoine atá fostaithe sna monarchain. Tá 167,000 daoine ag obair i monarchain na tíre seo faoi láthair.  Is méadú 5,800 é sin ar an uimhir a bhí ann anuraidh.  De réir na bhfigiúirí a thug an tAire dhúinn tá 32 monarchain nua dhá dtógáil anois.  Is mór an deifríocht í sin i gcomparáid leis an scéal brónach a bhí le h-innsint againn sna blianta ó 1954 go dtí 1957 nuair a bhí na daoine ag teicheadh an tír amach gan dóchas nó airgead acu. Ba thráth é sin fosta nuair nach raibh airgead ag an Rialtas chun obair do chur ar fáil do na daoine.</P>

B'fhearr go mór leis an bhFreasúra na tailte móra féarach&mdash; beagán daoine saibhre agus a lán daoine bochta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is mar sin a bhí an scéal go dtáinig an Rialtas seo i gcumhacht.  Is cúis mhisnigh dúinn go léir an dul chun cinn atá déanta ón am nach raibh na <Col N="835" /> daoine sásta earraí a deineadh in Éirinn do cheannach.  B'éigin don Rialtas seo an dearcadh sin do leigheas agus san am gcéanna ionnsaí do dhéanamh faoi lucht an Fhreasúra a bhí ag innsint do na daoine gur fearr na h-earraí a bhí ag teacht isteach óna tíortha thar lear ná na h-earraí a deineadh in Éirinn.</P>
    <P>I was adverting to the fact that a tremendous change has taken place in this country since the advent of Fianna Fáil Government in 1932.  One of the principal planks in the Fianna Fáil platform was the need for the establishment of an industrial arm which would help to absorb the great numbers of our people who were beginning to leave the land.  Indeed, they have been leaving the land from the time of the Famine, not only here but in most European countries and, more recently, in America.</P>
    <P>The difference between this Party and the Opposition is that we have always admitted people were leaving the land but we have tried to remedy it, tried to provide the industry which would absorb the labour leaving the land because of the higher standards of living succeeding generations have been demanding.  It is easy to recall the campaign waged then, not by other countries but by people within our own country, against Irish-manufactured goods.  I venture to say that that campaign was more detrimental and more vicious than any foreign country could ever wage against the goods of another country.</P>
    <P>That opposition to Irish-made goods came mainly from the Fine Gael Opposition.  Those who went throughout the country trying to convince people to take shares in Irish industry, trying to encourage people to help establish industries in our towns, were labelled as people who should be shunned by the ordinary citizen.  It was said they were doing this work for their own benefit, that they had no other interest.</P>
    <P>It is, as I said, a great change to see the attitude nowadays to goods made by Irish workers in Fianna Fáil factories&mdash;I am not ashamed to admit <Col N="836" /> that many of the factories were started by this Government in their early efforts to establish a small industrial arm here.  We admit there was a measure of protection for a time and it is good to see now that we are able to produce goods which we can sell in competitive markets in Europe and indeed further afield.  Our goods now are equal, if not superior, to goods produced in countries with long industrial traditions.</P>
    <P>It is also good to see the change in people's attitudes.  No longer are they critical of our efforts to extend further our industrial arm.  If we had more faith in the ability of our workers and industrialists to establish and maintain commercial undertakings, we would be doing a great deal to help our people and to strengthen the national economy.  It is a shame in a country where we are trying to find employment for our people that any of our citizens should still show preference for some goods produced abroad, particularly when we have comparable and frequently superior goods made at home.</P>
    <P>As a prime instance, I mention Irish whiskey.  Still, many of our so-called patriotic people very often enter bars and, to the detriment of the distilleries, of the farmers who produce the grain and of the workers involved in the production, show a preference for foreign brands.  While everybody is entitled democratically to purchase what he wishes with his own money, I submit people should be more considerate in this respect, particularly when there is on offer an Irish-made commodity as good as, if not better than, the foreign brand.  In fact, I would extend this message further afield: if many of our exiles would ask for and show preference for articles produced in the motherland, they would be doing a great deal to stem the tide of emigration and to place the people who remain at home in good employment.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann could be used more effectively to get this message across to our people at home and abroad.  Usually if a politician says something like that, he is accused of approaching the subject from a political angle but if neutral <Col N="837" /> people, such as those engaged in television and radio, suggested support for home industries and home-produced goods they would be doing a good service.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on what he has done in procuring for us a stand at the World Fair.  I have spoken to a number of people who have seen it and, in their opinion, it is proving a fine shop-window for a small country such as Ireland.  Despite what people may say about the expense of this stand, I am quite sure it will pay handsome dividends in the years to come&mdash; that we shall receive many orders for Irish goods not only from Americans but from people elsewhere who have had an opportunity of seeing them on display at the World Fair.</P>
    <P>It is true that there is an abundance of industries in many counties.  In fact, in some counties workers have to travel over the county boundaries to get to work.  That may be because of geographical situations&mdash;proximity to seaports and such features&mdash;but there are many counties in which there is a great scarcity of industry.  Through the Undeveloped Areas Act, the Government showed recognition of the necessity to encourage industries in the poorer counties, in tourist areas.  In my constituency, for instance, one industry was financed to the extent of £187,000.  That was good policy because in Cavan we have good roads, adaptable labour and housing for most of our workers so that they can live at home with their families.</P>
    <P>I suggest that wherever possible Foras Tionscal should more or less lean over backwards to encourage people to establish industries in poorer areas where there are good workers and all the physical amenities necessary. There should be an official survey of each county, showing the number of people ready to take employment in these factories and giving their ages, qualifications, apprenticeship certificates and so on.  Therefore, when an industrialist came to this country, he could see the register for each county and this might be a factor in attracting him to a particular place.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister what is the <Col N="838" /> position regarding the survey carried out in my constituency by the American Ambassador Oil Company.  It is common knowledge that they found workable deposits of gypsum.  I understand that is a very rare commodity in Western Europe today and one that should be profitable on the export market.  If what I say is true, I trust no time will be lost in exploiting these deposits to the full and in trying to get a factory in the area as soon as possible.  I should like to thank the Minister for the assistance he has given me in the past two years in trying to attract industry to my constituency. Many Deputies try to get as many industries into their areas as possible. Nobody can blame us for doing everything we can to provide the country with an industrial arm, which would be of tremendous benefit to our people seeking employment.  Many of the people from my constituency supposed to be in wonderful jobs in England would be willing to return if they could get employment in their own county, even at less than what they are receiving abroad.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister and his Department on the wonderful job they are doing in making the people conscious of the value of an industrial arm to our economy and getting across to them the importance of buying the products of our own workers.  I sincerely hope that the wonderful increase in the number of new industries that has taken place each year since 1957 will be continued in the future. If it is, there is no doubt that we will be able in the foreseeable future to absorb a large number of our people still seeking full-time employment.</P>

      <P>The industrial policy of the Government would appear to be based on their economic programme which extends over a long term period to 1970.  The importance of the part to be played by the Minister and his Department in that period is highlighted by the fact that the claim is made in this programme that prosperity and employment must be achieved by industrial expansion.  I might add <i>en passant</i> that that is the exact view expressed by OECD.  I was wondering if whoever wrote this <Col N="839" /><i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> copied it out of the report of the OECD, because it is practically a verbatim reproduction of it from beginning to end.  Be that as it may, it seems to me that those associated with industry are entitled to a stable outlook for their long-term policy. From 1964 to 1970 is a period of six years.  Anyone who hopes to expand in that period wishes to know in what circumstances he may operate.  It would, therefore, be of great advantage to the House and the country if the Minister would indicate how that policy relates to two definite factors: One, our accession to GATT, and the other, our relationship&mdash;whatever it will be&mdash;with the European Economic Community or with any other international organisation.</P>
      <P>I understand that our application for membership of GATT is being made and that it is likely to be accepted. That means we will have to give to all the countries associated with it most favoured nation treatment.  Taking it that the greater part of our industrial exports go to the United Kingdom or to British Commonwealth countries, we would have to give the facilities we enjoy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the British market to the other countries concerned.  The only escape or operative clause as against that would be if we belonged to some international group, whether a free trade association or an economic group such as EEC.  It was for that purpose I tried to elicit from the Taoiseach the conditions under which he would consider it advantageous for us to pursue our application to the Common Market.  The reply was: &ldquo;I can see no national advantage in indulging in speculation on this matter.&rdquo;  I put in one or two supplementaries but was unable to get behind the mind of the Taoiseach and the Government on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me from that reply that we are not trying to get into EEC.  It may well be that the Minister could enlighten us on that matter.  It is of paramount importance to anyone setting his sights for the future in the industrial arena.  Is our aim subsequently to become full members of <Col N="840" /> EEC?  The Taoiseach has said that on many occasions.  That brings us back to the same question: where do we stand in relation to the United Kingdom market in view of the fact that the major portion of our exports are agricultural exports going into that market?  A clarification on this point is necessary.  We cannot have the best of both worlds.  We have to decide whether we are going to associate with a group of some sort and so protect ourselves against the most favoured nation clause, or are we going to go it alone and put ourselves in the position of opening our trade to the entire world?  Practically the entire trading world is a member of GATT.  Are we to throw our trade wide open to those countries?  That seems to be a point the Minister should elucidate in the House.</P>
    <P>I am not very much associated with industry myself but I have had inquiries from industrialists.  The Government are making vacuous statements. They say we are going to join the Common Market, that we are going to be full members by 1970.  There the matter stands.  That is not sufficient.  It is not sufficient for anyone investing large sums in industry in this country. The matter should be clarified as quickly as possible one way or the other.  The Minister is the only one who can do that in relation to his Department and I hope he will do it when he is replying.  There is also the question of whether we are as fully competitive as we were before the recent increases in the cost of fuel, power and other items, whether we are as competitive as we were before in the export market.  The Minister might also refer to that when replying.</P>
    <P>With regard to the over-all policy of the Government, is the Minister satisfied that the present industrial outlook is sufficient to achieve the objectives of reducing unemployment and emigration? The Minister comes from an urban constituency, a large centre of population, which is highly industrialised in relation to other parts of the country.  The major unemployment from which we suffer is to be found in the rural areas, in the smaller towns of rural Ireland.  There are several reasons <Col N="841" /> for this.  The primary one possibly is that people are seeking a better standard of living.  People emigrate to England and come home with plenty of money, while those who are living in rural areas are lucky if they can find a few shillings to jingle in their pockets.  Opportunities for employment in the rural areas are diminishing all the time.  There is a considerable siphoning off of people from the land which is happening everywhere.  The plan or programme adopted by other countries to meet this state of affairs where the agricultural employment content is falling is to set up rural industries on a small scale.</P>
    <P>I feel that is the reason the Government have failed to meet the situation here.  We have not been alone in the problem that our emigration is coming from the rural areas.  The people are leaving these areas and running to the big cities to seek employment.  When they do not get employment there, their road lies across the water where there is full employment.  The Department should take an entirely new look at our industrial situation.  I do not want to say anything against the Minister's constituency but it comes to mind that we have recently voted two sizeable dollops of money towards the Verolme Dockyard and to Irish Steel Holdings Ltd.  The latter industry is not in the Minister's constituency but it is in County Cork.  This type of industry is perhaps not what this country needs.  This is the type of industry which has not achieved the aim we want to achieve, to keep our people at home and employ them.</P>
    <P>These two sizeable sums of money voted to keep these industries alive could have been utilised in starting smaller industries, say, in west Cork, or in the rural areas of Cork, rather than in trying to build up major industries which do not seem to be a success and which will not survive if they have to face open world competition. The last speaker for the Labour Party concentrated on the question of State industries but I feel that over the years we have been making the mistake of trying to start major industries. I would suggest that the Minister interest Foras Tionscal, who seem to have the control of the setting up of <Col N="842" /> industries, to turn their attention in that direction.  I would suggest that instead of setting up these larger industries, they should set up eight or ten smaller industries, employing 30 to 50 people or even less, provided that they are based on Irish raw materials or on light raw materials which would not cost too much to import.  That would be better than the attempts at the grandiose schemes to which the Government are inclined.</P>
    <P>We are expending a tremendous amount of money in Wicklow in organising a fertiliser industry which may or may not be a success.  Fertiliser production is already an established industry in many other countries. Perhaps our venture will be a great success and perhaps it will not, but large sums of money are being put into it.  A large number of people are being concentrated in the area and a great amount is being spent on the building of the factory.  I wonder if that money will give a full and fair return.  If it were spent on siting industries throughout the country in our smaller towns and villages, it might give a more remunerative return and greater stability It would give us a chance of remedying the twin evils of unemployment and emigration from which we suffer.  We are the only country in western Europe still suffering from these evils.</P>
    <P>Many old-established industrialists have complained to me that they are in an unfair competitive position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the new industries.  If a person comes here to start a new industry, he can get a free grant; he can get money to build a factory and considerable remissions of income tax for a certain period.  That scheme was initiated under the Minister's predecessor, the late Deputy Norton.  I was in the House when that was done.  It seems to me that we have now got to a position where we have shown outside countries that we are prepared to industrialise here.  We have shown outside industrialists that we are able to give them the manpower, the know how, the personnel and the infrastructure requisite for industry.  Therefore, it seems to me that the older type of industries, many of which find <Col N="843" /> themselves in not as good a financial position as some of the newer industries and which are not getting the same help, should be enabled to obtain assistance from the Department or from the Industrial Credit Company or whichever body is responsible for these matters.</P>
    <P>The only help that an old-established industry can get from the State is by way of a grant of £5,000 or £6,000 for plant improvement or for technical advice.  <i>vis-à-vis</i> the newer factories, they are placed at a complete disadvantage.  The time has come for a review of that matter and the question should be considered as to whether we should concentrate to a greater extent on the older type of industries, having regard to the fact that they have carried over through a difficult period.</P>
    <P>There is in my constituency an old-established industry that could do with a considerable amount of assistance. Perhaps due to the fact that it has not been run on very modern lines, it is not in a position to compete in modern conditions.  It is essential that that industry should be taken over by somebody.  Although the industry is not as financially solvent as it should be, the market for the produce is still there and the old-established name of the firm still exists.  If, as is possible in this case, a team were available who would be able to modernise the industry, they should be in a position to go to the State and ask for the necessary financial assistance but they are not in a position to do so.  If it were a case of a brand-new industry starting here, without any tradition, without any industrial background in this country, they could go to the State and ask for, and get, financial assistance.  This old-established industry which, perhaps through lack of modern management, finds itself in difficulties and which is willing to be taken over by somebody else, cannot secure the necessary funds.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider the suggestion? The stage has come when this question must be reconsidered.  We have established the fact that we wish to industrialise, that we have the potential and have got to the stage where we are becoming industrially <Col N="844" /> minded.  It takes a nation some years to arrive at that position.  A number of our nationals have gone abroad and have been trained in business executive management and we are now in a better position to build our own industries based on Irish capital, of which there is quite an abundance, and based on Irish personnel, rather than trying to entice foreign industrialists to come here.  Many industrialists have come in here but have not remained permanently.  Perhaps the Minister would direct his mind to the few points I have raised and see if he could meet me in respect of any of them.  If he did so, it would be to the advantage of the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a protracted debate.  One would gather from some of the observations offered from the Opposition side of the House that our industrialisation programme has been a failure.  The contrary has been the case, as I hope to demonstrate in the course of my subsequent remarks.  No doubt, the gloomy forebodings that have been offered from the other side have been made in the knowledge of an impending by-election. I can only repeat what everybody, not only in this country but throughout the world, knows, that the Irish economy is going very well and that it is the intention of this Government to keep the movement in the right direction.</P>
      <P>It has been stated frequently that, given ordinary international stability, there is no reason why we, through our own efforts, should not continue to raise the standard of living in this country, to increase the employment potential and to ensure that the Irish economy will be as good as that of any country in Europe.  However, as I have said, the debate has been protracted and many specific points have been raised by Deputies and I prefer to deal with these specific points in so far as I can rather than indulge in generalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point was made by Deputy Cosgrave, to the effect that there was a multiplicity of bodies dealing with industrial matters, and industrial grants in particular, and this <Col N="845" /> caused delay through excessive consultation. This point has been made on previous occasions and I dealt with it when introducing the Industrial Grants Bill, in 1959, when the functions of the Industrial Development Authority in relation to grants were changed.  At that time, the Industrial Development Authority had responsibility for examining applications for grants under the Industrial Grants Act, whereas Foras Tionscal had responsibility for examination of applications for grants under the Undeveloped Areas Act. The Industrial Development Authority represented to me that they as a promotional body whose main function it was to encourage industrialists to set up new industries in this country or to expand existing industries found embarrassment, having attracted these industrialists, in subsequently having to examine their applications for grants.  They suggested that the grants legislation should be dealt with exclusively by Foras Tionscal for both Industrial Grants Act and Undeveloped Areas Act cases thereby leaving the IDA free to pursue their main function, the function for which, in fact, the body was set up, that is, the attraction of new industry to the country, and the preliminary examination of the applications before being formally presented to Foras Tionscal.  There is, of course, the Industrial Credit Company, whose function it is to provide loan capital for the advancement of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I think the activities of these three bodies are separate and distinct and that these activities justify their being handled by these three specialist organisations.  I do not think there is any unreasonable delay, or any frustration, for promoters in the examination of applications coming before any one of these bodies and, as many Deputies have pointed out, it is necessary that the proper examination of them should be carried out, regard being had at the same time to the fact that inordinate delays are not conducive to the implementation of our industrial programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, Deputy Corish and a number of other Deputies today remarked on the position of employment. The suggestion was that I dealt <Col N="846" /> with the employment position rather summarily in my opening statement. That was not the case.  I referred, first of all, to the subject of an increase in employment in manufacturing industry in the year 1963 compared with 1962, explaining that employment in manufacturing industry had increased by some 3.4 per cent during this period.  I went on then to refer to the question of increased employment in relation to industrial grants in respect of projects located in the undeveloped areas and I stated that by means of grants already approved, the employment in those areas will have increased by 12,000 people when these activities come into full production.  I went on to say that in the areas outside the undeveloped areas the corresponding figure was 16,000.  Therefore, the total employment which may be envisaged on the basis of industries which have or will have received grants from Foras Tionscal will amount to about 28,000 people, that is, on the basis of the applications already before the body.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite have been making reference to the decline in employment but it is very significant that in manufacturing industry, there was a fall in employment in each year of the last Coalition Government's term of office.  It went from 177,000 people in 1954 down to 168,000 in 1957, a total decline of 9,000.  We have heard repeated references to the fact that there has been in the past seven years an over-all decline in the numbers at work of over 70,000 people, but if we look at the statistics supplied to us in simple form in <i>Economic Statistics</i> published with the recent Budget, it will be seen that in one year, 1956/57, the last year of the last Coalition Government, there was a decline of some 41,000, leaving a decline of some 32,000 over the other six years of the seven-year period referred to.</P>
    <P>It is correct to say, as Deputy Corish said, that unemployment is slightly higher in June, 1964, compared with June, 1962.  However, one can get a more balanced view of the situation by considering developments in relation to employment in manufacturing industry <Col N="847" /> during this two-year period.  The number of people employed in manufacturing industry in March, 1964, was 171,600 compared with 159,600 in March, 1962.  Therefore, the fact emerges that in industrial employment, there has been an over-all increase of 12,000 in those two years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred also to the proposal in one of the CIO reports that development centres be set up, and suggested that nothing was being done about the examination or implementation of that recommendation.  I ought to inform the House that I established a committee to inquire specially into the matter of development centres and to report to me the measures that committee considered necessary to take in order to encourage the development of industrial activity in such development zones.  I do not have to tell the House how difficult a problem this is.  It is one that we have to approach very carefully, having regard to the fact that there is throughout the country a labour pool still unemployed and it would be difficult to select one area above another or one group of areas to the exclusion of others.</P>
    <P>The next point discussed to any great extent was the question of price increases.  The suggestion was made that I had been doing nothing whatever to attempt to control these increases. As I indicated in my opening speech, I have concerned myself with this matter for some time past.  I have already indicated in the course of statements in the House, by way of answer to Parliamentary Questions and otherwise, the scope of the investigations which my Department has carried out and the results disclosed by these investigations of price increases.  There is nothing to be gained by Deputies exaggerating what these price increases have been.  We saw one notable example of this exaggeration today from a source from which I did not expect it to come, from Deputy Treacy.</P>
    <P>The cost of living index figure indicating the consumer price index changes as between mid-February, 1964, and mid-May, 1964, shows an overall increase of some 3.9 per cent.  Deputy <Col N="848" /> Dr. Browne referred to the details of these increases which emerged from a Parliamentary Question he asked some days ago.  If I exclude beef and mutton in which there was, because of world conditions, a substantial increase in price, the increases disclosed by the publication of this new index have not been very great.  I need only quote at random from this list of over 200 commodities to which Deputy Dr. Browne referred: Wire mattresses, 2.73; table knives, 1.65; certain kitchen ware, 2.75; electrical goods, 0.85 and 0.54; footwear, 1.17.  By and large, the increase indicated by the mid-May figure has been no greater than 3.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>It was envisaged that following the negotiation of the ninth round of wage increases, there would be some increase in manufacturing cost.  The House will remember that the advice of economists available to the Government at the time indicated that an eight per cent increase in wages would be justified in the circumstances.  In effect, the trade unions won, and all credit to them for it, an increase of 50 per cent in excess of that, an increase of 12 per cent.  It was envisaged there would be some upward movement in prices as a result because manufacturers had to pay these increases and had to take account of them in the cost of their finished goods. It is, I think, now reasonable to assume that the upward adjustment of prices which was necessary to take account of this wage increase has been completed and that further increases from this cause need not be expected.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that a rigid system of price control should be introduced, and if I may repeat what I said on a number of occasions and in reference to the introduction of the Prices Bill, 1958, it appeared to be agreed on all sides that price control in ordinary conditions was not likely to be effective.  It was likely to be effective only in conditions of scarcity or when rationing was necessary.  At the recent annual general meeting of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, the members were addressed by Professor Busteed, Professor of Economics at UCC, and he said the same thing, that price <Col N="849" /> control was not practicable in ordinary circumstances.  Everybody knows that when price control was enforced here and maximum prices were fixed, the maximum prices tended to become minimum prices and, in fact, there may have been only one price.  We remember that when commodities were scarce and prices were fixed, black-marketing went on, but apart from that goods were freely sold in the open and there was only one price, which was the maximum price.  Therefore, in these circumstances, competition was not allowed to have free play.</P>
    <P>The Prices Act gives me certain powers to investigate the movement of prices and to effect controls where I consider it necessary.  I assure the House that I am continuing to keep a close eye on price movements and I have in fact increased the staff of the prices section of my Department to ensure that the work will be properly done.</P>
    <P>The question of our international trading arrangements was raised by Deputy Cosgrave and referred to in general by a number of subsequent speakers.  Deputy Cosgrave's suggestion was that we should review all bilateral arrangements and re-negotiate them, where necessary.  That process has been going on all the time.  As the House is aware, we have trade agreements with Germany, France and Finland under which these countries give quotas to certain Irish exports.  The trade agreement with Germany was renewed, following a review undertaken with the German Government at the end of last April.  Consideration is now being given to the review and renewal of the trade agreement with Finland and negotiations in connection with the review and renewal of the trade agreement with France are due to open on 6th July next.  As the House is, I think, aware, a French delegation will visit Dublin for that purpose.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of our balance of trade with other countries.  It has been said over and over again that the important thing for us to achieve is an overall balance of payments in our trade, and while our balance with particular countries may <Col N="850" /> be adverse, nevertheless, if we maintain an overall balance as regards our total imports and exports, including invisible exports, there is no reason to feel unduly worried about the situation.</P>
    <P>There is a special difficulty in this matter, as the House knows, in relation to our trade with the so-called State trading countries.  Two years ago, the House enacted the Restriction of Imports Act which gives the Government power, where necessary, to restrict imports from these countries so that they may be induced to achieve a more balanced state of trade with us by increasing the volume of their purchases from us.  The position in relation to a number of State trading countries behind the Iron Curtain is reviewed in the light of the volume of trade passing between us and them and I am considering at present taking action to restrict under the Restriction of Imports Act 1962, the volume of our imports from these countries.</P>
    <P>I may say that the countries in question have already been informed of the enactment of this legislation and what is proposed, and it has been conveyed to them that the question of the limitation of the volume of their exports to us will arise, unless they provide more extensive facilities for the importation of Irish goods to these countries.</P>
    <P>There is in all this the over-riding condition that Irish industry must be competitive and that with the restricted raw material resources we have here, we must look abroad to find many of these materials.  It is only fair that our manufacturers should be given the same opportunity of getting their goods at the best price as manufacturers in other countries, who are their competitors, have. Nevertheless, I am looking closely at the whole picture and I assure the House that the action I deem necessary in the best interests of the country will be taken as appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there any reaction from these countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There was, in a number of cases.  I could not specify what it was now.  This brings me to the point <Col N="851" /> made by Deputy Dillon who referred to the inflationary trend that he noticed and which is connected with our balance of payments position generally. I do not think it would be correct to say that we have any kind of a serious inflationary situation confronting us at present but that is not to say that I do not agree with the Deputy, and with Deputy Corish, who, I think, also made the point, that the situation requires constant review in the light of developments affecting expenditure levels.</P>
      <P>It is true that at present we have an excess of imports over exports, but when allowance is made for items of invisible trade, the margin between imports and exports narrows very considerably. I do not think the present deficit on current account in the balance of our international payments provides grounds for uneasiness.  The amount of the net deficit is not substantial and it must be remembered external industrial investment in Ireland, which is taking place at the present time, involves the importation of considerable quantities of plant and machinery which of course inflate import levels to a considerable extent.  In any event, I agree with the view expressed by Deputy Declan Costello in the House some time ago that a little inflation is a good thing because it provides a stimulus to the economy. The overall need arises to ensure that this stimulation will not be frustrated in any way and that there will not be any retarding of our economic progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much discussion took place in the course of the debate on our policy of tariff reduction.  Deputies Corish, Anthony Barry and Treacy questioned the wisdom of a policy of tariff and quota dismantlement in present circumstances. They expressed their apprehension about the ability of industry to adapt itself to the new situation which will develop.  There seems to me to be some misunderstanding about the programme for the reduction of tariff and quota protection for industry.  The actual position is there was a ten per cent reduction in tariffs on industrial goods on 1st <Col N="852" /> January, 1963, a second ten per cent on 1st January, 1964 and there will be a third reduction as of 1st January, 1965.  That brings the total reduction of tariff to 30 per cent of the rates which existed on 1st January, 1963 into effect on 1st January, 1965.</P>
    <P>These ten per cent tariff reductions are matched by the ten per cent quota enlargements.  Two of these ten per cent quota enlargements have already taken place and the third will be made with the third tariff reduction on 1st January, 1965.  At that stage it is the intention to review the policy in regard to tariffs and quotas in the light of the effects of the changes brought about by the adjustments made in tariffs and quotas since 1963.</P>
    <P>The future policy in relation to protection may be influenced by the necessity to continue to provide a stimulus for industrial re-adaptation and achievement of an increasingly higher level of efficiency and competitiveness in all sectors of our industry.  The present policy of tariff and quota dismantlement is carefully worked out and it has been initiated because of the desirability of reducing the level between the Irish tariff rate and the tariff rate applicable in west European countries generally.  So, in the event of our achieving membership of the European Economic Community itself, we would not find ourselves obliged to undertake tariff reduction on a scale which might then be beyond our capacity.</P>
    <P>A further and equally compelling reason for the policy of reducing tariffs for industry is the desirability of providing for it a stimulus for the achievement of higher levels of efficiency and the adaptation of methods needed for the re-adaptation of our industries.  I have no doubt of the ability of industry to cope with the situation as I have outlined.  I am supported in that view by the fact that the tariff reductions made up to the present have had no adverse effect on the level of our imports.</P>
    <P>It is not right for Deputies to say that the situation which is developing will provide opportunities for low-cost countries to exploit our market here. Deputies will recall that the week before last I introduced legislation, <Col N="853" /> which has yet to come before the Seanad, providing for amendment of the Control of Imports Acts, designed to provide the machinery at our disposal for the limitation of imports from these low-cost countries.</P>
    <P>Arising out of this, of course, I naturally come to the question of our membership of the EEC and GATT. The House is aware our application for accession to GATT has been renewed.  It is at present before the GATT authorities and it is hoped that our application will be successful.  I think it is necessary in the main, because of the commencement of the Kennedy Round negotiations, whereby GATT countries will be expected to reduce tariff levels and to give the benefit of any reductions within their countries to other member countries. It is not possible for me to say at this stage what our final terms of acceptance will be.  I do not think many other countries know what the effect of the Kennedy Round reductions will be on their particular position but it is hoped that as a result of the increased momentum of the Kennedy Round, the international trade of member countries will benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister leaves GATT, is he in a position to give any indication of the probable date of the acceptance of our application and when he expects to be in a position to give us this information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say to any close degree.  The Deputy is aware of the present occupation of the GATT authorities with the Kennedy Round. We sent an observer delegation to the Kennedy Round discussions.  During the time they spent in Geneva, they had consultations with the GATT authorities.  If I may make a conjecture, it is possible our application will have been determined in or about the time of the ending of the Kennedy Round negotiations.  I am not in a position to say when that will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the European Economic Community, it is of course true that our application has not been actively proceeded with, following the breakdown of the British negotiations for full membership.  We find in full <Col N="854" /> membership the opportunity that will help both our economic arms, industrial and agricultural.  The House is no doubt aware of the reasons why we have not sought membership of the European Free Trade Association. The reasons are simply that at the time of the establishment of this body, we had already gained, as far as Britain, our biggest trading partner, is concerned, the advantages that Britain's other partners in EFTA would get over a period and also because it did not take any account of agricultural goods.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made that the uncertainty of our position in this respect is not conducive to industrialists making plans for the future.  No matter what trading association we belong to, the net effect will be that, as a result of the Kennedy Round, tariffs may be removed as between these different trading blocs and third countries.  Therefore, it is imperative to ensure our tariffs will not be at such a level at the time these concessions are granted throughout the world as to make it impossible for our industrialists to survive.  It is for this reason we have embarked on the present rhythm of tariff reduction and, at the same time, have embarked on schemes for the adaptation of industry by way of special grants and other incentives through technical assistance grants and otherwise.  No industrialist is under any illusion as to what will be necessary as far as his industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy referred in particular to the footwear industry.  I share with him the admiration of what that industry has achieved over a number of years, but the fact remains it is protected by a quota.  That quota is subject to review, on the application of either the British interests or the Irish interests, by the Industrial Development Authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Once the revision starts, it is the duty of the Industrial Development Authority to examine the case made for the reduction of the quota.  Ultimately, they must replace that quota by tariffs, which will give reasonable protection to the Irish industry and, at the same time, provide a reasonable opportunity for the British industry.  There is participation by the management and trade unions concerned in the adaptation council for this industry, and I am well aware of the efforts they have made.  I can only assure those people who feel their interests might be affected by replacement of the quota by tariffs that I will keep very much in the forefront of my mind the necessity of preserving the employment of the 5,500 people engaged in the industry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne referred to the industry in another context when he referred to the report of the CIO survey team.  He mentioned that there would inevitably be some disemployment in the industry through the ordinary reduction of protection.  I should like to point out that the CIO report also envisaged, as a result of the improved efficiency of the industry, that this disemployment could be more than offset by the employment likely to be gained as a result of increased export markets.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne seemed to advocate greater taxation of industry&mdash; that industry could afford to accept greater taxation and that that would generate more public moneys to be spent for necessary social purposes. It is true that taxation of our industries is less than the average taxation of industry throughout Europe&mdash;but it is not very much less.  I doubt if in present circumstances Irish industry could suffer more taxation.  Certainly, as far as attracting new industry to the country is concerned, that would be a difficult problem for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne also said it was <Col N="856" /> not necessary to bring in foreign capital and technical know-how in order to expand our industrial economy.  There are more reasons than attracting capital and technical know-how for the present programme of inducements for foreign industrialists coming to this country. There is the very important consideration of markets.  Many of the industrialists who come here have already established markets in different parts of the world.  As an industrialist said to me one time: &ldquo;Any fool can make the product, but it is a different matter to sell it&rdquo;.  That is becoming more and more difficult at present.  One of the principal results of our continuing to seek industrialists from abroad is the advantage of the access to the markets which these industrialists already have.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised the question of St. Patrick's Copper Mines and what the present position is as far as the disposal of the property in Avoca is concerned.  As the House is aware, following a specialist study on the mining operations in Avoca, this report was made available to interested parties.  Tenders were invited from these parties.  A number of offers have now been received and are at present under consideration.  As soon as that consideration is complete, a decision will be made in regard to the future of the mine.  I do not think the House should expect me to comment in any greater detail at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully and Deputy Kyne raised also the impact of Mín Fhéir Teoranta on the present grass meal market.  Mín Fhéir Teoranta was established following the findings of a second investigating committee in 1958.  The company was given a capital subscription of some £200,000. This sum was devoted entirely to capital development.  There was no question of subsidising in any way the output of grass meal from this factory. The principal purpose, apart from the production of grass meal, was the rehabilitation of peatland in the West and the provision of employment in that area.  Since the re-establishment of Mín Fhéir Teoranta, there have been a number of expansion developments in the private sector of grass meal production. <Col N="857" /> It is very difficult to understand why these private companies now say that, because of the impact of Mín Fhéir Teoranta on the market, they have had redundancy in their own undertakings and have had to close down some of their operations.</P>
    <P>The Mín Fhéir factory is going into production only this year.  They do not intend in any way to avail of price cutting or reduced wages to get an advantage over the private operators. The prices they are quoting are the current market prices.  In addition, they are seeking outlets that have not been tapped before.  I received representations direct from the Irish commercial grass meal producers.  They were interviewed in my Department earlier this month and advised that the best course to adopt would be to consult with Mín Fhéir Teoranta and Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, who have an interest in grass meal production, so that with the co-operative approach they could tackle the industry's problems as far as the disposal of output is concerned. Arrangements have been made for a meeting between the Irish Crop Driers Association which, I think, is the principal organisation involved, and the directors of Mín Fhéir Teoranta in the factory in Mayo.  I expect arrangements will be made for them to meet the Irish Sugar Company people also.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister implying they will come to some price fixing arrangements?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of price fixing.  The main purpose, as I should like to see it, of this meeting is to seek other outlets.  Mín Fhéir Teoranta have found other outlets and have made contacts for the disposal of grass meal to the new sources now open to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to the Industrial Engineering Company, Limited, of Dundalk.  He admitted there was a special problem there.  I maintain the position I have always held in relation to that company. Certain moneys were advanced to them through the Industrial Credit Company. One main company and five separate <Col N="858" /> subsidiaries were set up for the employment of several hundred men who would have lost their jobs in Dundalk were it not for the initiative taken by the Taoiseach as Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1957.</P>
    <P>Some mistakes were made early on. It is difficult to avoid mistakes in undertakings such as this.  As the House is aware, the Great Northern Works, as they then were, in Dundalk formed the main depot for servicing and replacement for the GNR system. Several hundred men were employed there, and Lord Glentoran announced in 1955 his intention to scrap a considerable part of the GNR system and to close down the Dundalk works.</P>
    <P>Nothing was done in the intervening years to see what alternative employment could be secured or what alternative arrangements could be made in Dundalk.  The closedown occurred suddenly in 1957 shortly after the change of Government and the problem was thrown into the lap of the Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I hope the problems, and they are many, facing these different industries will be solved and that continued remunerative employment will be provided for the former GNR workers and those since recruited by the Dundalk company</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the non-availability in our pavilion at the New York World Fair of Guinness's stout and Harp lager.  I do not know whether Deputy Dillon has been in a pub recently, but he would be amazed at the tremendous variety of Irish-made lagers and beers available in pubs in every part of the country.  Guinness are making a special effort to promote the sale of Harp lager in the United States but it would be difficult for us to pick out any manufacturer of lager in this country and give him special facilities in the Irish pavilion.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the question of space enters it.  When we decided to establish a pavilion in New York it was anticipated that best results would be forthcoming from a national display rather than a trade exhibit. Accordingly, our exhibition there is on the basis of a national display.  This <Col N="859" /> has meant that only a limited amount of space is available for such facilities as the supply of refreshments, and only on a modest scale.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, Irish coffee is supplied without any brand name being applied to the whiskey used. Other countries evidently considered it preferable to utilise a greater proportion of their space for trade exhibits and for the provision of a wide variety of refreshment facilities. For that reason, in a number of pavilions like the Danish one, facilities were made available for the sale of lager.  If, as I said, it was decided that the national advantage would be best served by utilising the greater proportion of the space in the pavilion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I make two suggestions to the Minister?  No. 1, I suggest that he reviews the position in regard to beer and lager and, No. 2, that he invite the brewers for consultation as to whether or not agreement could be arrived at on a planned exhibit of Irish lager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the problem. The problem is one of space.  I have consulted with those placed in charge of the pavilion, and those who have the concession for the sale of Gaelic coffee, and discovered that there were real difficulties in so far as the provision of space is concerned. The pavilion is only 12,000 square feet.  It is limited to a budget of £300,000&mdash;a million dollars&mdash;provided by this House and compared with the exhibitions of other countries it is a very modest one.  Accordingly, it is difficult to provide for everything people would want.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, the exhibition has attracted quite a number of favourable as well as unfavourable comments, as I expected.  I knew that certain things in the exhibition would appeal to some and not appeal to others.  I have taken some trouble to check some of the favourable comments and find that in a number of international publications such as <i>Time</i> magazine, the Irish pavilion has been very favourably commented on.  If I may quote from the <i>Toronto Globe and Mail:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> It is modern but simple; it is suggestive but civilised; it did not cost very much but that is something which is not typical of the New York World Fair.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of other favourable comment of that nature.  If we had had more money, the situation would be different but our budget was modest and we had to cut our cloth according to our measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it the decision to exclude lager is not irrevocable, if ways and means can be found without spoiling the amenities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured of that.  I am quite interested and I was anxious to see it provided. I thought the result might be an opportunity of making some money and advertising Irish lager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If an acceptable plan is submitted, will it be considered on its merits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Now I come to the matter that seems to have hit the headlines more than any other in the course of this debate.  I refer to Deputy Dillon's charges about the payment of subsidies to the Verolme Cork Dockyard Limited.  Deputy Dillon referred to the subsidy arrangements for the third and fourth ships in the company's programme and he said that the third ship, the &ldquo;Amstelhof&rdquo;, was built for the Netherlands Freight and Tanker Company with which the Verolme Cork Dockyard Company was associated.  He said that shortly afterwards this ship was sold for the price of roughly £1 million and that a subsidy of £350,000 had been paid in connection with this ship.  He then referred to the fourth ship being built for the Liberian National Shipping Line and went on to say that another subsidy of £350,000 was being paid in connection with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a Deputy comes into this House and makes charges of a serious nature against somebody outside, whether an individual or a company, charges based on information he has not checked, or on information he knew, or ought to have known, was incorrect, such charges can only be <Col N="861" /> described as irresponsible.  But, when these charges are made by the Leader of the main Opposition Party, they can more properly be described as reprehensible.  That Deputy Dillon was not sure of his facts emerges from his request to me, at the conclusion of his contribution, when he asked me to advance some correction of what he had said when I was replying.</P>
    <P>In July, 1963, I introduced to the House Supplementary Estimates to defray the cost of subsidies proposed to be paid to the Verolme Cork Dockyard Limited in respect of five ships, the first five ships to be built at that dockyard.  I do not propose to go again into the merits of the case for those subsidies since the House accepted the principle of the subsidy at that time.  I take it that neither Deputy Dillon, nor Deputy Barrett, who also made reference to this matter&mdash;or indeed Fine Gael&mdash;is now raising the principle of the subsidies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We asked to have it referred back for inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that I would not go into the merits of the subsidies, but as a result of world conditions in the shipbuilding industry, almost every country in the world, including countries with a long-established tradition of shipbuilding, like the United States, Canada, Britain, France, West Germany and Sweden, subsidies in one way or another their shipbuilding industries, in many cases to a far greater extent than we have done here in the case of the Verolme Cork Dockyard.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that the great majority of the 850 workers in the Verolme yard at Rushbrooke did not have the traditional skills and had to be trained.  Their productivity in the early years could not be expected to match the productivity of subsidised competitors in other countries.  We now have at Rushbrooke one of the most up-to-date yards in the world and a cadre of specialised workers whose productivity is fast increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When introducing the motion for the subsidy on 18th June, 1963, I gave the House the pattern of payments of the subsidy which will be on a reducing <Col N="862" /> scale for these five ships.  The first ship was built for Irish Shipping Limited and the second for a Canadian company for use on the Great Lakes of Canada.  Deputy Dillon's charges and Deputy Barrett's references today were in connection with the third and fourth ships.  The third ship was built for the Netherlands Freight and Tanker Company Limited and the fourth, which is about to be launched shortly, was built for the Liberian National Shipping Line.</P>
    <P>At columns 1390 and 1391 of the debates at that particular time, I said that the subsidy for the third, fourth and fifth ships would range from 15 per cent to ten per cent of the contract price, amounting in all to a maximum subsidy of £570,000 for these three ships.  In replies to questions when winding up the debate, I repeated the rate of payment of the subsidy on these three ships.  Deputy Dillon was present at the time and he knows that there could be no question of paying £700,000 for two of the ships.  He knows that the total amount voted by the Dáil for the third, fourth and fifth ships could not exceed £570,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett referred in particular to this maximum subsidy for these three ships and Deputy Dillon must have known that the maximum subsidy payable was £570,000.  I therefore accuse Deputy Dillon of making these allegations recklessly and in conflict with the facts as he knew them himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How much is the subsidy with regard to these three ships?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bit late for you to ask that now.  Why did you not ask it before you made that scandalous statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that no subsidy has yet been paid either on the third or fourth ship.  I hope Deputy Dillon will have regard to that.  At this stage it would be useful if I explained that there is in existence a financial committee to handle the computation of the payment of the <Col N="863" /> subsidy on these ships.  That committee, which has the advice of a consulting naval architect, is well qualified to deal with the financial and constructional aspects of the building of these ships and all the necessary measures are taken to see that the ships are sold at a price in line with the level of prices of ships produced by shipbuilding yards elsewhere in the world.  There can be no question that excessive subsidy payments will arise and the maximum subsidy on the third ship may not exceed 15 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place, I did not interrupt one Deputy in the course of the debate.  It is not easy to reply to a serious matter like this.  I do not think any Deputy could claim that I interrupted him in the slightest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is perfectly true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>And I had to listen to hard things.  The maximum subsidy is 15 per cent in the case of the third ship.  That maximum is, as I have said, considerably less than the <Col N="864" /> £350,000 Deputy Dillon says was paid. Not only that, but as a result of the increasing efficiency of the yard, the subsidy that will be payable, which is yet under consideration, will be considerably less than the maximum allowed.</P>
      <P>My Department was well aware of the fact that the Netherlands firm, the Netherlands Freight and Tanker Company Limited and the Liberian National Shipping Line Limited have associations with the Verolme Cork Dockyard.  I do not see anything sinister in a situation in which such an association would exist, especially if the facts are well known to me and to the persons who had a responsibility in connection with the subsidy arrangements. While I do not profess to be aware of the circumstances in which orders were placed, it would not be a matter for surprise if the directors of the Verolme Cork Dockyard Company were to influence its associated companies in the placing of orders for ships.  Such arrangement would be of substantial benefit to the dockyard and would provide considerable local employment.  This procedure is, in fact, quite common in present day shipbuilding and shipowning activities.  If Mr. Verolme, as a member of a shipping company, requires a new ship, he will, of course, look for the keenest price possible at which it can be built. That was done in the case of the &ldquo;Amstelhof&rdquo;.  It was operated on charter by the owners and then an offer was made and accepted for its purchase.  This was in the interests of the Cork dockyard because its effect was to make another order possible and so ensure continuity of employment in the yard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon's reckless allegation, unfortunately, received very wide publicity in our national newspapers, but, more unfortunately, it received very wide publicity in the world Press also. If the purpose of this attack was to secure narrow political Party advantage, then I think it was despicable.  It is most damaging to our national industrial development programme, particularly when it took the form of ridicule with which Deputy Dillon embellished his inaccurate and unreliable <Col N="865" /> case against Mr. Verolme. However, this is not untypical of the Fine Gael traditional approach to industrialisation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, Deputy Barrett today made a reference that I was very disappointed to hear him make.  He said in relation to the Verolme Dockyard that it was an ill-fated venture from the very beginning.  I would not like to believe that that description was calculated to undermine the morale of that yard or to undermine the confidence of the customers of that yard in its viability or in the product that it can produce, but, unfortunately, that is the effect it will have.</P>
    <P>This, of course, was typical, as I said, of much of the Fine Gael attitude to industry.  In the past they opposed the development of the airport at Shannon and when they came into power in the first Coalition, they closed down the service and repair workshops, sending hundreds of skilled Irish workers to the far corners of the world to find employment wherever they could.  As well as that, they sold off the transatlantic liners which, in view of the success of our transatlantic operations subsequently, obviously would have been in themselves a tremendous success at that time.</P>
    <P>In the first Coalition period also, they prevented the expansion of our cement industry, an expansion which was authorised only when Fianna Fáil resumed office in 1951.  They scrapped the grass meal development scheme in their second period of Coalition Government and that was revived when Fianna Fáil came back again after a Coalition period.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael Deputies have opposed in one way or another the establishment of an airport in Cork, of the nitrogen factory in Arklow and of many other State-sponsored and State-assisted industries that are now giving useful employment and bid fair to become a considerable and desirable asset in the economy of our country.</P>
    <P>One of the most recent efforts of this nature was the attack on the Potez factory in Galway, the implication, that has, unfortunately, again, received wide publicity and has been amplified by the local press, being that all is not well with that industry in Galway.  I <Col N="866" /> only hope that this most recent example of trying to undermine the shipbuilding activities at Rushbrooke will not damage or hinder seriously the shipyard itself or our whole industrial development programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett suggested this morning that the subsidies are increasing instead of being reduced in the Verolme Dockyard.  I am very happy to tell him that the subsidies provided for will not be used up to anything like the extent authorised by the House and that, therefore, the productivity and efficiency of the yard is increasing.  I feel that the workers who are now employed in considerable hundreds at the Verolme Dockyard, which is progressively becoming more efficient and more competitive, will leave nothing undone themselves to offset the damage that has been done by this attempt to undermine the security of their employment.</P>
    <P>It is very clear to me that this much-publicised move to the left of Fine Gael is only a facade which the reactionary elements in Fine Gael will throw aside as quickly as Fine Gael themselves threw aside the comprehensive policy hastily devised before the recent Kildare and Cork by-elections. I only hope that for the sake of the future of the workers of this country and for the sake of the expansion of industry, people with that mentality, with that record of objection to and harassing of industries, will never get the opportunity again of controlling the industrial destiny of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I overlooked the case made by Deputy Murphy about the Flatley company.  This industry was established in west Cork with the aid of a grant of £90,000 of which Foras Tionscal approved in January, 1960. Of the grant approved, approximately £68,000 has been paid against a total expenditure of&mdash;I do not like to go into too many details&mdash;more than double that amount.  The factory commenced production in 1961.  After the payment of the grant and after the factory commenced production, reports indicated that the Flatley company in England were facing certain difficulties. Notwithstanding these reports and without the knowledge of any difficulties, Foras Tionscal sent an accountant, a man with specialist knowledge, to the factory in Britain to examine its accounts and to examine the product <Col N="868" /> before the grant was approved.  In February, 1962, the Flatley company of Salford went into liquidation and subsequent events are known to the House.  The factory in Bantry has not reached anything like the employment envisaged for it but it is still in production. The company in Bantry is a separate company registered in Ireland, and it is solvent.  It has difficulties, by reason of the problem in Britain, of working capital but I can assure the Deputy that Foras Tionscal is keeping a close eye on the situation.</P>

Neither the Government nor Foras Tionscal are empowered to take over these factories.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I pointed out that these amendments were designed to deal with the situation of tenants who were removed from premises they occupied as dwellings or as business premises.  I pointed out then that there were three different types of case.  One is the case of the premises which is purely a dwelling and under the Rent Restrictions Act, I pointed out that a tenant <Col N="870" /> was entitled to compensation on his application to the court and that the amount of compensation he could get was laid down under that Act.  Where a local authority sought possession of a dwelling, the person was entitled to appeal to the courts and get compensation as laid down and in such cases the compensation was three years' rent.</P>
      <P>I pointed out also that a certain amount of property, particularly in built-up areas, is of an old type and might be regarded as slum property. Sometimes people say that compensation of this nature is high but that is thinking in terms of the value of the present site becoming available to a landlord.  However, as regards the tenant, his entitlement to compensation was limited by the Rent Restrictions Act of 1960 to three years' rent. Consequently in the case of a certain amount of this property it was bought cheaply and rented cheaply and the compensation therefore would not be very large.</P>
      <P>The second type of compensation relates to the case of the person occupying premises as business premises.  The question of compensation arose there because under the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931, if a landlord sought possession of a premises used for business purposes he could say that the granting of a new tenancy, even in cases where a lease was expiring, would not be suitable and conducive to good estate management but the premises used in these cases would not be subject to control under the Rent Restrictions Act of 1960.  The question then of compensation in this case is one which we suggest should be determined by the court and for that reason we seek to have inserted, before subsection 9, a new subsection which would lay down that the type of compensation payable in such cases should be determined by the circuit court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Town Planning Act was before the House on a previous occasion, we argued that in quite a number of cases the amount of compensation awarded by an arbitrator, other than somebody acting in a judicial capacity, could well be, and has been, very <Col N="871" /> misleading and very much under value. For that reason, we cannot see why the services of the circuit court which is available and has much experience of dealing with these matters of compensation should not be used, certainly in regard to the type of case we are dealing with at present.</P>
    <P>When we reach the amendment the Minister had in mind concerning compensation of a certain type for people disturbed in this matter, it should be put beyond doubt what the amount of compensation will be and that it should be determined under the process by which it has been determined up to now in this type of case.  We have two Acts dealing with this matter and we believe that getting a judicial decision would be the normal process, fair to everybody, and, accordingly, I urge that the amendment be accepted so that a person seeking compensation will have the protection of the circuit court in the determination of his case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing we should clearly understand is that there is no provision for such compensation in any other code passed by the House but one might be inclined to ask here why should there be a question of compensation being provided for a tenant only in cases where the local authority actually has put the tenant out because the building in which he happens to live is dangerous.  There does not seem to me to be a great deal of sense in this proposal.  The precedents we have do not dictate that it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see substance in the arguments about the whole matter of compensation, particularly when in the following amendment provision will be made for what we might regard as the hardship cases.  In that event I think it is an improvement on what was originally before the House and by providing it in the form of an official amendment, I felt it would in fact meet any difference of opinion we had in regard to looking after certain people who may be put in a rather awkward position at present because there is no power whereby the local authority, even if they want to do so, could give any sort of grant or <Col N="872" /> assistance to tide people over or in some way make up for the disturbance and try to alleviate any hardship imposed on them.</P>
    <P>Taking these things into consideration, I do not really see the need for this amendment.  There is no real precedent for it and I do not think there is any question that we should deal specially with this type of special case when in fact the same thing as is proposed in this Bill applies, for instance, where a house is acquired under the Housing Acts or, say, for road widening.  I do not see why there should be any different code established for cases that may come under the legislation we are now proposing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I was listening to a lawyer when I heard the Minister speaking.  He seems to think we could not do anything because we had not a precedent to do it.  I thought it was the lawyers who relied on that sort of argument and I was surprised to hear it from the Minister because I do not think he can boast of being a member of the legal fraternity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is a good thing to understand the basis for the references of lawyers and I am afraid that has escaped the Minister.  There is no provision in the 1890 Act for compensation in relation to business premises for the simple reason that that Act gave no power to Dublin Corporation to demolish business premises at all, although indeed the power has been used in the past year to demolish business premises.  It is only recently there has been a judicial decision which clarifies the issue and interprets the Act to show that the only power in relation to business premises, and which is exercised here, is that where the wall of a building is dangerous, to require it to be fenced in and made safe.  It does not give any power to protect persons from having the whole building demolished. It has been done without compensation. This amendment seeks to <Col N="873" /> remedy a wrong which is improperly done.  We believe the amendment by Deputy Jones is worthy of support because we seek to recover the compensation from the owner of the property.  The owner of the property should pay the compensation because the owner of any property is under an obligation to maintain its structure.</P>
      <P>If the owner of the property believes the structure is dangerous, then he should not let it.  If the owner of a property believes it is likely to become dangerous within the letting period, then he should not let it.  If the owner entices or permits people into dangerous premises or a building which is likely to become dangerous, then the owner of that property should pay compensation.  The degree of compensation which Deputy Jones seeks is not great.  If a building is so dangerous as to require demolition and to require people to be evicted from it, it is probably in a most profitable zone of a city or a town.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that many of these properties are much more valuable as vacant sites, clear of buildings, than they are with tenants in them.  Quite substantial profits can be made by demolition of structures certainly in the centre of Dublin at present by selling them for site value only.  Deputy Jones seeks to recover reasonable compensation which is no greater than three years' rent.  Indeed that would not in many cases even compensate people for the disturbance which they suffer.  A serious problem has arisen in Dublin over the past year, and will multiply over the next few years, where small shopkeepers who are evacuated from premises in the centre of the city, in the poorer quarters, are unable to find any other shopping position.  It is not a question of giving people compensation so that they can go to equivalent premises because equivalent premises are becoming scarcer on account of demolition of old buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not consider the Bill as drafted takes that into account.  An amendment by the Minister at a later stage leaves it to the discretion of the local authorities to assess whatever they consider would be adequate.  It <Col N="874" /> introduces all kinds of questions which would not be in the mind of valuers in court.  It is not because of any desire to bring these cases into court in the hands of lawyers that these amendments are moved.  I want to say, in case anybody is under that apprehension, that there would not be much profit for those engaged in representing people seeking compensation.</P>
    <P>The amendments by Deputy Jones would in practice work out better and they would provide for the recovery from the people responsible of some degree of compensation.  The burden of collecting compensation should not be put on the local authorities.  We consider the burden of paying compensation should be put on the owners of property who have let them, when they were potentially dangerous, or who have failed to preserve the property in the first instance.  The compensatiion which Deputy Jones seeks is to be recovered only by people who have no responsibility for the maintenance of the structure.  The amendments to be discussed later on would give compensatiion to people who have responsibility for the maintenance of the structure.  We do not think that is desirable.  We consider compensation should be given to the innocent people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I wish to say about this is contrary to what Deputy Ryan seems to imply.  I am not relying merely on the fact that there is a precedent for it.  I am going back a little further.  The matter of putting dangerous premises in order is surely a matter for the Landlord and Tenant Act.  The amendments we are now discussing are much more appropriate to amending legislation to that Act.  It would be ridiculous to bring them into this Bill where the change does not purport to deal with that side of the affair at all.  If there are changes now, it certainly seems they should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there are cases at present where the owners of property, which might fall to be dealt with under this Act, are going to get possession of premises?  Is the Minister satisfied <Col N="875" /> that this is not being done at present because of the circumstances which have arisen, particularly here in Dublin, in which people are being dispossessed without entitlement to compensation? There is provision at present, apart from this Act, for compensation for the person who is interfered with in his possession of his dwelling.</P>
      <P>Perhaps quite a number of people do not know that they are entitled to compensation, even if it is only a small amount.  We are seeking here in many of these cases, and in cases which are likely to happen when orders are served, and when sites become available, that the owners of these sites which will be readily marketable as available building sites, because they are in the main in the heart of the city, should not be charged with the amount of compensation laid down.  Some of the tenants of these properties, who pay 5/- a week, would receive compensation of £39.  If we were to assume there were four tenants in that dwelling, the amount of compensation payable would be £156.</P>
      <P>Some of these properties which are coming on the market at present are of much more value.  Consequently, it would be incumbent on the landlord, to obtain a claim of possession of the building, to accept an obligation to provide an amount of compensation which we have mentioned here and which is covered by the two Acts to which I have referred.  Does the Minister see no merit in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I see merit in it but I do not see that it is relevant to the problem here.  Surely what we are talking about has no relevance since it is covered by the Landlord and Tenant Acts?  What we are dealing with in the Bill is what local authorities must do in order to save life. Whatever about the merits of the argument, I do not think it is relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is this.  At the moment the Corporation may move to have a place demolished.  If the Corporation get the <Col N="876" /> place demolished or the landlord issues an order at the behest of the Corporation demolishing it, the tenant gets no compensation at all.  If the tenant does anything to obstruct the course of action of the Corporation or the landlord, he may hold on to the tenancy. If the landlord then serves notice to quit to get him out that way and to get an order for possession on a number of grounds, he must pay compensation to the tenant.  In those circumstances, the tenant is compensated for being disturbed. We seek to preserve that right for any tenant who is ejected or has his place demolished at the behest of the Corporation before other legal remedies are available to him.  Deputy Jones is seeking to apply these compensation provisions to people able to hold on to their tenancies until such time as notice to quit is served.  Perhaps the Minister would consider it on Report Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we would not be considering it until next November. We are dealing with the action local authorities have to take in cases of dangerous buildings, particularly those which are a danger to life.  If we are to hedge this around with all sorts of restrictions concerning compensation and so on and making it unduly difficult and costly for local authorities to take action, we will not get these buildings cleared as quickly as they should be cleared.  I would not agree that we should wait for months before coming to a decision on making it possible for this action to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is contradicting himself.  Deputy Jones's amendment would not encourage tenants to obstruct the Corporation or the landlord. Because the compensation provisions are not there at the moment, any prudent tenant will see to it the Corporation or the landlord are obstructed in every possible way so as to preserve the building or the shell of the building.  Deputy Jones seeks to preserve the tenant's right to compensation, even though the building is swept away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid we are at cross-purposes.  My understanding of <Col N="877" /> the amendment was that any existing rights under the Landlord and Tenant Acts would not be interfered with. Under the law at the moment, the court may step in to protect the rights of the tenant or the landlord where the action of the local authority appears to endanger those rights.  That is the basis on which I am approaching this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you adopt Deputy Jone's amendment, there will be no need for the court to intervene to protect those rights because those rights will continue long after the premises have gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>You advocate bringing in the courts to protect this, that and the other.  The cat's tail would seem to be an appropriate thing for the courts to protect, according to the attitude of mind displayed so far.  Why should we reverse engines and say there is no need to bring in the courts?  Why not leave the courts in?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, after subsection (10), to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(11) (a)  A sanitary authority may, if they so think fit, make a grant of such amount as they think proper to any person who&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  on or after the 1st day of June, 1963, has left or leaves a dangerous structure at the request <Col N="878" /> of the authority or in pursuance of a requisition under subsection (9) of this section,</P>
    <P>(ii)  immediately before such leaving carried on a trade or business in the structure, and</P>
    <P>(iii) in the opinion of the authority, by reason of such leaving, has suffered or will suffer hardship.</P>
    <P>(b)  In determining the amount of a grant to a person under this subsection, a sanitary authority shall have regard to the length of the period during which the person carried on a trade or business in the structure in relation to which the grant is proposed to be made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an attempt to cover a type of case that may arise and which, according to some Deputies, has already arisen during the past year.  It is to enable local authorities to deal with such cases so that hardship by accident, as it were, will not occur in so far as these operations are concerned.  We are enabling local authorities to look after these cases with the knowledge they undoubtedly have of the circumstances of the people disturbed or of any particular loss or hardship.  This will enable them to act towards these people in a fair and reasonable manner and give them help where it is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment is permissive.  They may do this if they think fit.  The second point that strikes one is this: the Minister says they may do these things if a person leaves the structure after 1st June, 1963.  Why the Minister sets that date I do not know.  Why should it not go back to 1962, 1961 or the date when there was evidence first of these things occurring?  Is there any reason why we should confine it to 1st June, 1963?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three conditions are being imposed in respect of the payment of compensation in this case.  The first relates to the date of the compensation.  The second mentions that the premises must have been such that trade or business was carried on&mdash;no question of their having been a dwelling.  Why should compensation <Col N="879" /> not be payable in the latter case? The third point is that in determining the payment, the length of the period during which the person carried on trade or business enters.  In other words, it is being determined on the length of the tenancy rather than on the volume of the business.</P>
    <P>It is apparent that a person could have a considerable volume of trade, irrespective of the length of time he occupied the premises.  That ought to be considered in determining the amount of compensation.  The method of compensation we proposed earlier would have been better from the point of view that we were refraining from imposing a burden on the rates.  We suggested charging compensation on the property.  The Minister said he did not wish to penalise local authorities, but the basis of this provision is to penalise the local authority rather than the bad landlord who allowed the premises to become so decadent that they were no longer fit to stand.</P>
    <P>Another thing is that all sites becoming available in this way in the city have a high market value and there is no reason, therefore, why the site itself should not bear the type of compensation payable rather than that the local authority should pay it.  Still another thing is that money would be readily available from the sale of such sites.  One has only to look at the building taking place in Dublin at the moment to realise that most modern buildings are being erected on older portions of the city.</P>
    <P>In his amendment, the Minister does not set out in any detail to whom this will be paid or on what terms the compensation will be paid.  In our amendment, we attempted to set out in some detail the people to whom compensation would be payable and the amounts.  The ministerial amendment leaves this matter open.  Perhaps the Minister will defend that by saying the local authority are the better judges in these things.</P>
    <P>I say again, as I said on an earlier amendment, that the local authority should not be confused with the elected representatives.  In all these <Col N="880" /> cases, the local authority are in effect the executive power, in which the elected representatives will not have any say.  I agree the Minister's amendment is a big step in the right direction but I would urge him to be more specific in regard to the type of compensation he proposes to pay, the classes to whom it may be paid and the conditions which will apply to its payment&mdash;what factors are taken into account in the measurement of compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Jones has put his finger very properly on a number of very difficult points certain to arise from the efforts of the Department to apply the section.  There are no canons we can use in assessing compensation. The section as proposed by the Minister is to apply where, in the opinion of the local authority, hardship is suffered. Will this involve a means test? In a family where all or some of the children may be bringing in an income, where the husband may be in a position independent of the business, is it the position that no compensation whatsoever will be paid to the woman of the house if she is the person responsible for the shop?</P>
      <P>That case illustrates clearly what is quite common: there are quite a number of shops in the city known as hucksters' shops in which the woman of the house has run a reasonably lucrative business for years, supplementing the family income.  The local authority here would not offer any compensation to a person in those circumstances and that would be patently unjust.  Whether the person is of ample family means or otherwise, he or she should not have all right to compensation taken away because he or she did not suffer immediate stringent hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here, no compensation will be paid unless the person involved is thrown on the breadlines.  I do not think we should permit the local authority to worsen people's conditions by obliging them to suffer hardship before receiving compensation.  Obviously it is undesirable that where the local authority are in the position of executioner, they should also be judges <Col N="881" /> of the damage they have done.  Surely there should be some form of independent arbitration.</P>
    <P>In this case, it would also appear that the burden of compensation is to be borne entirely by the rates.  I may be wrong in that.  I had thought I had seen a section allowing the local authority to recover the various costs they would incur from the people responsible, but I am not now able to find it.  If that be so, it means the managers will be concerned to a great extent with the burden on the rates imposed by the application of this section.</P>
    <P>During the Second Stage, the Minister referred to the problem which would have to be considered where the removal of dangerous private dwellings in an area took away from a business premises its customers of the past and possible customers of the future.  This brings us to a problem we have seen develop over the years where a local authority have a general plan for an area, be it road widening or rebuilding.  It may occur that there have been demolitions over the years of private dwellings, leaving business premises until they are forced, because of bankruptcy or serious financial circumstances, to close without compensation, or leaving them until the local authority are prepared to initiate their rebuilding programme.  Only then is an effort made by the local authority to pay compensation.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael believe that if a local authority have plans for the redevelopment of an area, they will, according to this, deprive people of legitimate compensation they would have got if their premises were demolished during the first stage of the development.  That is the sort of compensation that ought to have been provided for in this Bill.  Our suggestion is that if the local authority find an area dangerous, they should treat the area as a unit and should pay compensation to traders based on an assessment of the profits they would have enjoyed if the private dwellers had not been taken away.  If this is not done, we are going to have a situation in which a shopkeeper in the middle of Bolton Street who in the past, <Col N="882" /> enjoyed a lucrative trade because of the presence of families all round him has now nothing left but the shell of a business and no hope of customers or business in the future.  That is the kind of situation which the Minister intends the local authority to consider and it is the kind of situation which will cause suffering because such a person may not get any compensation at all.</P>
    <P>One of the things which prevent many small shopkeepers from seeking compensation is that many of them do not keep proper accounts.  That may or may not be because they have sought to defraud the Revenue Commissioners with regard to income tax or it may be because the business is a small family concern and because they have not efficient methods of accounting.  Many people in the past have been deprived of their reasonable compensation where street widening projects have taken place because of their inability to produce books.  I do not think local authorities should avail of the failure of people to produce records of that kind.  Some kind of generous effort should be made to compensate these people and that is why Deputy Jones is right when he says the Minister should attempt to set out the considerations which should be in the minds of those who will assess this compensation.  The person who is paying the compensation will be the person who is going to assess it and if his assessment is not satisfactory, there is no comeback.</P>

      <P>The 1st June, 1963 has been set down as the operative date of this amendment.  Obviously, there has to be some date and I have been more than mindful of the situation as we know it.  The obvious date is the date of enactment but because of the fact that during the past 12 months the rate of demolition of property has been accelerated and because there are 71 of these people concerned, of whom 25 have been allowed to remain, I thought it only right that we should go back and cover that period.  That is why the operative date has been made 1st June, 1963 rather than any other date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> In so far as outlining, specifying and determining the conditions under which the local authority will pay, I tried to draw the scheme as widely as possible. Seeing that the power provided in the amendment is a discretionary or permissive one, I felt it should be drawn in wide terms because we cannot altogether foresee what type of claim for compensation will arise in the future.  In regard to the compensation of which we have had experience up to the present, we may not quite see the full picture to the degree that we can set out for the local authority how they should do this job. This matter is permissive and discretionary and we could not set out the lines on which the matter of compensation would be dealt with by the local authority.</P>
    <P>The objection that this amendment refers to the local authority itself and not to the elected members is quite true but the elected members of the local authority can require the manager to pay compensation in a specific case if he was not inclined to do so.  On the other hand, the elected members will have to vote the money necessary to provide the compensation and they will have the power to restrain the manager if he is inclined to pay too much compensation or to overdo the matter.  No matter which way we look at it, the elected representatives have control in the matter.</P>

By the operation of section 4, the manager is to do a specific thing and if the manager tends to over-pay, the elected representatives can refuse to vote him the money.  While the manager has the responsibility to determine the compensation, the local authority has the power to make him pay compensation or to restrain him from paying too much.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider a further amendment to sub-paragraph 3 to change the word &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;loss&rdquo;. Hardship is too severe a test.  If people suffer loss, they should be compensated and to require them to be in dire poverty before they are compensated would be too strict.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The term is wide enough.  The Deputy may, in his own interpretation, narrow it down but I think that we should keep in mind that in the type of case we will deal with under this section where loss is incurred, it will also mean that hardship will arise because of the nature of the business that has diminished or vanished due to an area becoming obsolete.  I think the substitution of the word &ldquo;loss&rdquo; would not make a great deal of difference.  The term &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; is quite wide enough to be used to the best advantage of those people we are trying to help in this particular situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was at a disadvantage, as I am sure the Minister was, too, when this amendment was being dealt with last week.  There were six or seven professionals brought into the Fianna Fáil benches to decry any word of Irish that might be spoken from these benches.  This is the snobbery of the Gael that no word of Irish must be spoken by anybody who is not a native speaker, the man who would not have the language but for the accident of geography.  The man born in Dublin who thought it worth his while to learn Irish is being decried and this is going to happen when Irish is established as a compulsory subject in every competition under this paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> The Minister should take a further look at this because if that applied from the clerical staff right up to the top, the Minister could not be there. Maybe it would be just as well.  This is the sort of thing that has served the country badly over the past 40 years. Any boy who is born in an English-speaking home in Ireland is at a disadvantage. We want to set up a special class constituting Irish speakers as the only people who can get work and the only people qualified to work in many of the positions available in State or semi-State bodies.  I will go so far as to say that many of those people would have nothing but the Irish language. They would get the job although they might know nothing about the job.</P>
    <P>It is about time we did away with this nonsense.  If CIE is to live at all, it should get the most efficient people. Whatever way it has been recruiting for the past ten or 12 years, however it has recruited its top staff, it has not been to the advantage of CIE or the country or the taxpayer, and we must judge by results.</P>

There has already been considerable discussion on the last occasion, and towards the end of a very long discussion on the question of the Irish language in State companies, I said that under an arrangement made with the trade unions, the test for Irish for clerical officers would be the fact that applicants would have to qualify in either the Intermediate examination or the Leaving Certificate examination which included Irish, and that it seemed, therefore, that to have an excessive discussion on this was hardly relevant to the section.</P>

I was giving the instance of this young fellow who when he discovered that if he joined the Irish Army, the most he could be was perhaps a private and the Army would probably have him peeling potatoes, crossed the water and now he is one of the most brilliant mathematicians there, although he is not yet 22 years of age.  We are talking about schools of technology.  By putting this paragraph in, the Minister is confining himself to a certain kind of people and is shutting out the majority.  Boys going to school have to spend an hour every day in many cases learning a language for which they have no aptitude. One language is enough for them and they are good or perhaps brilliant at other subjects.  We are going to legislate them out of the country.  When the Minister for Defence spoke here in Irish I asked that the matter be translated for the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  I am not saying that in deprecation of the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste.</P>

Similarly, Deputies are entitled to speak in Irish in the Parliament of Ireland.  There is a simple solution for this problem but this is not a matter before us at the moment.  The principal argument being made here, as I understand it, is that the retention of this particular provision will operate unfairly against some of our people.  What are the facts?  As I understand them, Intermediate and Leaving Certificate examinations are used by CIE to assess candidates' academic qualifications. We know that the number who fail the Leaving Certificate through failing in Irish is approximately one per cent of those who sit for the examination.</P>

      <P>In most ordinary schools, shall we say, it does not happen. Deputy Lynch and Deputy Dillon who spoke on this on the last occasion, are, I think, suffering under a delusion based on an idea that was current a generation or two ago, the idea being that the human race is divided into those who can learn languages and those who cannot, those who cannot usually being those who can learn mathematics.  But this theory has been disproved time after time and it is not good enough to have this old chestnut trotted out now in justification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be a small minority who cannot learn languages but certainly the vast majority&mdash;I would put it as high as 99 per cent of our people&mdash; who are capable of passing an examination of the standard required in the other subjects are quite capable of passing that examination in Irish.  I challenge Deputy Lynch or anybody else to show the House that somebody academically qualified by reason of, say, obtaining honours in mathematics or history or geography is unable to learn Irish to the standard required <Col N="893" /> to pass the examination, which is all that is required.  They are not required to get honours in Irish.</P>
    <P>I have personal experience of one young man who was very brilliant at school and got scholarships in the Intermediate and Leaving Certificate examinations.  He did engineering in the university and got first place and first-class honours in each examination he did.  I discovered that although he got something like six or seven honours in his Leaving Certificate, he barely passed in Irish.  I was intrigued by this because I knew that it has been disproved that a man of this mental capability was incapable of learning languages.  I felt there was another explanation and, on inquiry, I found his parents were bitterly opposed to Irish.  As you can imagine, if the parents of a child are bitterly opposed to Irish, it is difficult for that child to be good at Irish but it is not because the child is incapable of learning the language.  We are not trying to make provision here for the very small percentage, possibly less than one per cent, who may be incapable of learning languages, but are we to cut down any possibility of people seeing some advantage in, or desirability about learning Irish in order to serve this very small percentage.</P>
    <P>It seems that what the Minister is trying to do is to continue the practice which has existed all along and what Fine Gael are trying to do is to change this practice, and the reasons they have advanced are not very convincing, being based on outdated notions about aptitude for languages.  For these reasons, I suggest that the House should retain the <i>status quo</i> as no convincing reason has been given for departing from it.</P>

      <P>Ninety-nine per cent of those who would have the academic requirements necessary for the job. Therefore, of those who apply for the jobs, 99 per cent have nothing to fear; they are qualified.  According to Deputy Colley, we have no right to speak for the one per cent; they are to be driven out into outer space.  The Deputy says that provision here is an encouragement or inducement: perhaps it is a dog-collar to make them learn Irish.  I submit if the people who are really at the back of all this realise that volunteers are much better than conscripts for their purpose, they would be making real progress.  If 99 per cent of those with the academic qualifications necessary are qualified to pass the Irish language test, what difference will it make to the others? Why should the Parliament of Ireland make lepers out of the one per cent and cast them out?  Deputy Colley has given the Minister a real reason for striking out this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on the point of compulsion. Deputy Tully made what we have now come to expect from him, a very reasonable contribution to the debate. The pity is that over the years there has not been that level of detachment and objective assessment of this very complex problem by people who believe, as he obviously does, in the restoration of the language.  I think a <Col N="895" /> tremendous amount of damage has been done by the intolerance of the people who have met opposition to their policy.  They have met abuse at one time or another.  We come up against shoneenism, anti-nationalism or west-Britonism and they are against the Irish language for one reason or another.  The other day I saw Máirtín Ó Cadhain being singled out by some sort of lieutenant-colonel who wanted to know if he had given up his nationalism.  There is a lunatic fringe on both sides. Máirtín Ó Cadhain has not.</P>
      <P>In regard to the group who were attempting to restore the language, there appears to be another bigger lunatic fringe who helped the language revival.  They have been sincerely working for the restoration of the language for a very long time and it can be fairly claimed that they have had a very considerable measure of support from successive Governments since the foundation of the State.  The net result has been, as Deputy Colley said, the other night, if you write a business letter, you will not get a reply in Irish.  There is that exclusivism as far as this hostility to the Irish language in business circles is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My point is that it is there, that it is a reality, and that these business firms will not use the Irish language.  They want to continue the use of English and Deputy Colley resents that.  I can understand his resentment but he must understand there are people who would resent the suggestion that they should be forced to write all their letters in Irish instead of in English.  He resents the fact that he is forced to write in English.  It is the suggestion that anybody is compelled to do any of these things like believe in politics, believe in religion, believe in speaking the language, which human beings resent. They prefer to have their own freedom of choice.  This is an extremely delicate question.  A tremendous resentment is built up if you try to force conservative, liberal, social, Catholic, Protestant. Moslem, Irish or English speaking views on people.  That resentment is very much present and I think has been built up by the intensity of the <Col N="896" /> drive for the restoration of the language over the past 20 years.  That is particularly borne out in the Minister's present proposal.</P>
    <P>There appears to be an element of hypocrisy in certain sections of the society in its use of the Irish language. There are broad areas of this society in which there is no such insistence.  If it did nothing else, this inconsistency would give the movement the stick with which to beat the revival.  I have seen this in the commercial world which Deputy Colley has referred to.  I could mention the names of very distinguished Irish people in the language movement who have business firms of different kinds.  I have seen their advertisements in newspapers and on television and listened to them on the radio and I rarely see a word of Irish in these advertisements.  These people, for commercial reasons have no emotion or no sentiment in that regard. They come down to the hard and fast decision when money is involved and say they will speak English.  I do not want to mention any of these people but we all know them.</P>
    <P>I was very struck when I was down in Lettermullen many times and I saw a most significant thing in their advertisements. They said &ldquo;Caith tuitín Gold Flake&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is maith leat Guinness&rdquo;.  There is another advertisement which says: &ldquo;Buy the <i>Irish Press.&rdquo;</i> That is very significant because Gold Flake and Guinness are what one would call the West British type of firm.  The <i>Irish Press</i> is presumed to have taken a very direct interest in the promotion of the language over the years.  That particular newspaper is read largely by the people down there because they support the Government Party.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that compulsion in regard to the restoration of the Irish language has not worked. I think Deputy Colley supports that view.  It simply has not worked.  We are all representatives of the various schools and establishments and we very rarely speak Irish.  I am all for the Deputies who wish to speak Irish but I have only heard two or three Deputies consistently speaking Irish.  I have heard Deputy Ó Briain and the late Deputy Mongan speaking it.  In fact this compulsion has not led to increased speaking of the Irish language. So it is reasonable at this stage to question the validity of the suggestion that this is a correct approach.</P>

      <P>I have not intervened in this debate as between the Irish speakers in the House because I wanted to let the debate proceed on the basis that this provision is honestly intended, that it is workable and, according to Deputy Colley, is not restrictive to any great extent.  I was not in the House at the end of the debate the last day but I read in the newspapers a certain interchange between Deputy Colley and Deputy Dr. Browne.  I followed it up since in the text of the Official Report.  I think Deputy Dr. Browne was correct when he said Deputy Colley gave the game away with regard to compulsory Irish in his interjection.  If I may reset that again, Deputy Dr. Browne was arguing there was no compulsion with regard to the use of the English language.  Deputy Colley's very brief but, as Deputy Dr. Browne called it, pregnant interjection was: &ldquo;You should be in the business world to know where compulsion is&rdquo;.  I took that to mean that Deputy Colley, leaving aside his professional qualifications, was asserting that to do business in Ireland you must have English and that Irish is no good.  If I am misinterpreting the Deputy, he can reply to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us get down to the lower level of the clerical grades of CTE.  Deputy Dr. Browne was making the argument that you must have English.  English is <Col N="899" /> compulsory for the transaction of business at the level of the clerical officer of CIE and Irish is not required. Let us take this as being sincerely put down and honestly backed.  I want to get this into its setting.  Section 12 deals with entry to the clerical grades of CIE.  Paragraph (d) is a provision about competitions.  It states:</P>
    <P>A competition shall consist of such one or more of the following types of test as the Board may specify in the rules relating to the competition, namely:</P>
    <P>(i)  a written examination;</P>
    <P>(ii)  an oral examination;</P>
    <P>(iii)  an interview;</P>
    <P>(iv)  any other test or tests that the Board considers to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Personally, I do not understand what tests there could be other than a written test, an oral test or an interview. But apparently some other type of test is being considered.  I suppose a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse when it comes to any subject, particularly Irish.  Later we find &ldquo;Irish shall be a compulsory subject ...&rdquo; It is quite clear from the next paragraph that the Irish test need not be competitive because, if a competition consists of more than one test, written, oral or something else, then only one of those need be competitive.  Again, we have the situation that you may have the written test, the oral test or the interview.  In the interview something called Irish shall be, according to this, a compulsory subject.</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  Does it mean somebody must enter for Irish as a subject at an examination or interview? Does it mean he must pass in Irish?  I do not see any necessity for that.  It is to be a compulsory subject in the test, but the test may be written, oral or an interview.  I wonder how serious is this going to be?  I know that for many years in the profession to which both Deputy Colley and myself belong we have been governed by an Act of 1929, the Legal Practitioners (Qualification) Act.  Since 1929 it has <Col N="900" /> been the law that one may not enter practice either as a barrister or solicitor without having a competent knowledge of Irish.  A competent knowledge of Irish is described in the Act as:</P>
    <P>... such a degree of oral or written proficiency in the use of the language as is sufficient to enable a legal practitioner efficiently to receive instructions, to advise clients, to examine witnesses and to follow proceedings in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>That is the test.  As far as barristers are concerned, the Chief Justice has to satisfy himself that those admitted to the Bar have that proficiency described in that way.  As far as the part of the profession to which Deputy Colley belongs is concerned, the Incorporated Law Society have two examinations conducted by examiners approved by the Department of Education.  Both of us are tied to the conditions put down in the Act of 1929, never changed, repealed or amended since.</P>
    <P>In the past 15 years in UCD, I suppose I have never had fewer than half a dozen non-natives in the class. I probably had an average in the past eight years of ten non-native students. These were West Africans or East Africans, or students from India or Pakistan.  It may be a surprise to Deputies to learn that no foreign student has ever yet failed to pass the test in Irish.  Is that not nonsense?  It is complete nonsense that a Pakistani who attends lectures in UCD and passes the ordinary subjects is able to receive instructions, advise clients, examine witnesses and follow proceedings in the Irish language.  I assert without any fear of contradiction that no foreign student in the past 12 years has ever failed the Irish test.  Is that what we want here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Never.  I have been a Bencher and from time to time I have called attention to the fact that we are allowing foreigners to be called to the degree of Barrister of Law on that provision.  There is no question of changing it.  The thing is regarded as a joke.  Deputy Colley nodded <Col N="901" /> when I was speaking earlier.  The Incorporated Law Society take this more seriously than the Benchers do. They have two examinations.  Would Deputy Colley seriously consider standing up and saying that all the solicitors who qualified during the past 30 years are able to receive instructions, to advise clients, to examine witnesses and to follow proceedings in the Irish language?</P>
      <P>The Deputy must agree that that does not apply to a majority of the solicitors who qualified in the past 30 years.  Is Irish as a compulsory subject to be regarded in that way? People will say that if a person goes into a room and knows the difference between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, can say &ldquo;níl&rdquo; and &ldquo;tá&rdquo;, can say &ldquo;céad míle fáilte&rdquo; that is all he needs to qualify in the compulsory Irish test. I do not agree with Deputy Colley's recital of the percentage.  Deputy Byrne is right when he deals with this statistical information about the percentage failing because they do not know Irish.  Actually, a number have been withdrawn from the examination because they are not regarded as competent to take the Irish test, so all you get is the figure in respect of those who are regarded as sufficiently proficient to sit for the examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Long ago there was a situation, as the law developed, where the ecclesiastical courts had control of certain offences, more particularly on the criminal side.  Then the lay courts began to controvert that situation and there was a bit of a struggle between the two.  The main difference was that the ecclesiastical courts were more lenient in the dishing out of punishment than were the lay courts and in the end the ecclesiastical courts claimed that anybody described as a cleric&mdash;the word being defined as a clerical officer type hoping to be in orders&mdash;should be tried in their courts. The matter got so farcical that it had to be changed, but the farce had developed to the point where the test of whether the person to be called was a cleric or not was whether he could recite a phrase of Latin.  People were prepared to learn two or three phrases <Col N="902" /> of Latin in order that they could be removed from the lay courts and so get off with lighter sentences.</P>
    <P>Are we to have a similar farce here? Are we to have people learning a certain test piece of Irish like &ldquo;céad míle fáilte&rdquo; or something like that?  If Deputies are sincere, they will go back to the Act of 1929 and agree with the conditions provided in that measure.  If they do that, there may be some appearance of sincerity about this. That Act was passed in an atmosphere of enthusiasm, when the facts of life did not appear to have been operating sincerely or strongly, but no student ever failed the Irish test under that Act.  No matter what the Minister has told us that the Board have told him that they accept the Leaving Certificate Irish, paragraph (h) of the subsection gives power to the Board to revoke what the rule was as regards Irish.</P>

Dá mbeadh spéis acu sa Ghaeilge do bheadh an phaidir sin de ghlan-mheabhair acu.  Cloiseann siad í gach lá dá suíonn an Dáil.  Teaspáineann sin an meas atá acu ar an nGaeilge.  Ní meas go dtí é!

      <P>Reference was made by Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy McGilligan to an intervention which I made on the last occasion about trying to do business in Irish.  The context was that Deputy Dr. Browne was speaking about compulsion and about the objection there is to compulsion.  He was talking about economic compulsion.  I was pointing out that there is, in fact, a much greater economic compulsion on people to use English than there is to use Irish.  In fact, there is a very definite barrier against trying to do business in Irish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>How difficult it was.  It is not impossible.  There is a difference. The point I am trying to make is that it is possible to do business in Irish. People do business in Irish.  People do business in Irish with CIE.  I have on occasions made representations to CIE in Irish and got replies in Irish. I am trying to relate this to the amendment. The point I am trying to make is that it is difficult to do business in Irish.  This is something we should recognise.  It does not mean, as Deputy Dr. Browne says, we have failed, we should drop the whole thing. My reaction is that so many people know Irish and for various reasons are prevented from using it.  My reaction is not to scrap the whole thing but to see how many people could use Irish.</P>
      <P>If we take subsection (e) out, the result will be that CIE will start to employ people who have no knowledge of Irish and when I or anybody else tries to do business with them in Irish, it will be impossible for these employees to deal with it.  The logic of this amendment is that we are saying in future, not today or tomorrow, but at some time in the future, nobody will be able to do business in Irish with CIE because the people employed in CIE will not be qualified to deal with it.  I do not suggest that this is the immediate effect of it or the intended effect of it, but logically this is the ultimate result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is where we differ from Fine Gael on this subject because we believe the prospects for the revival of Irish are good.  I agree with Deputy Dr. Browne that we have to change our methods but I do not say that we have had a complete failure in 40 years. The proof is that we are able in this House on occasion in debate to have speeches in Irish and interjections in <Col N="906" /> Irish from both sides.  This could not have happened in 1919 in the First Dáil.</P>

      <P>I wonder why it is that Deputy McGilligan, Deputy T.

I can understand their being concerned with minorities and I do not say we are not to be concerned with minorities because they are small, but why is it that they are concerned with this very small minority and their rights but do not seem to be concerned with the people who know Irish and are unable to use Irish?  I suggest there is an example in this House.  There are a number of Deputies who would be only too willing to make any contribution they have to make in Irish but they cannot do it because Deputy T. Lynch and others rightly object that they do not know what is going on.</P>

      <P>The point I want to make is that all the restrictions that apply to people who try to use Irish are enormous compared with what is involved here but we never hear Deputy T. Lynch, Deputy Byrne or Deputy Dr. Browne worrying about this.  I am concerned about this because I want to see the years of effort that we have put in bearing fruit.  I want to see our national policy as enshrined in the Constitution, as has been stated by Deputy Ó Ceallaigh, being attended to in order to try to achieve it, but if we adopt what is being suggested in this amendment, we are setting the clock back; we are saying that there is no hope for the Irish revival; that we are satisfied that in future anybody can do business with CIE in English only and if a person wants to do it in Irish, that is too bad for him.  I, for one, am not prepared to support any such amendment and I doubt if any Deputy who thinks about this seriously and who is a believer in and in favour of the Irish language, who thinks about the implications of this, can support the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Inseoidh mé scéal fíor chun a theaspáint cad a thárlaíonn. I applied for a post to the Local Appointments Commission for the purpose of ascertaining the method of examination where it was compulsory to have Irish for the board.  I was interviewed in connection with my professional qualifications by four eminent public servants who had been many years in the service and who were therefore presumed to know Irish. None of these four sought to interview me regarding my professional qualifications in Irish, although they were presumed to know the language and I was presumed to know it.  On completing a searching examination on my qualifications for this post, which was a legal post and therefore one in which by law I must have statutory Irish, I was asked to leave the room and wait downstairs for 20 minutes. At the end of that time, a uniformed gentleman came in wearing on his coat the medal ribbons of 1916, the Black <Col N="908" /> and Tan War and of service in the 26th Battalion.  He spoke to me kindly and said: &ldquo;The natives are ready to see you now, Sir.&rdquo;  If that did not indicate the scorn in the mind of that man for all this business, I do not know what it indicated.</P>
      <P>The mere fact that the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission must have two separate boards in this day and age, one to test a candidate in his professional qualifications and the other to test him in Irish, shows that compulsory Irish has failed and in that regard I disagree with Deputy Colley. I agree that if we remove compulsory Irish, we may reach the position where Irish will never be revived until the majority of the people want to use it. It is with all sincerity and with the love of the Irish language and because we are in favour of having it spoken freely that we wish to have this amendment accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be regarded by Deputy Colley as believing that we should drop the attempt to revive the Irish language.  I have kept out of the language controversy but what I have done is to learn it and to speak it.  I did so because I felt it to be the responsibility of a Minister in Government to be able to speak to people who spoke nothing but Irish, in their own language.  That was one of the reasons I learned it during my period in office.  There were other reasons but it was a strictly personal matter and I made no attempt to put forward a wise or unwise policy for the revival of the language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would dearly like to see the language spoken in this House and spoken widely throughout the country. But I wish to draw to the attention of Deputy Colley, who appears to have a reasonably objective assessment of the position, that it is widely assumed that up to the present we have not achieved our objective, which is the right to speak the language across the floor of the House and expect it to be understood by everybody, whether in Opposition or in Government.  If the methods used to revive the language over the past 40 years have failed, the <Col N="909" /> experience of Israel in particular shows that there are methods that could be effective and it does appear as if we could have been put in the position to speak as often as we wanted in Irish if the methods used had been the correct ones.</P>
    <P>It is not a subject on which I feel very strongly politically but as an individual Deputy, I would like to make my contribution to the matter as I see it.  There is a much more reasonable element, as represented by Deputy Colley's point of view, now coming into the language movement.  I would examine that type of mentality and examine things as they are.  We should ask ourselves did we make the wrong approach; do the proposals we are now making represent the wrong approach; should we consider some other attitude, will our approach end up in the result which everybody fears that nobody can speak the language at all?  If that were so, I would be opposed to our present approach.</P>
    <P>I believe that as far as the people in the Gaeltacht are concerned, they must have complete freedom to speak the Irish language and use it in all their services.  I lived for quite a time in the Gaeltacht and I have on occasions been shocked at the fact, and I have complained to Government Departments about it, that people who were absolute Irish speakers had written to Government Departments in Irish and got back the reply in English. I would deeply resent that any such attempt would be made to force people who speak Irish to speak English.</P>
    <P>I am trying to draw Deputy Colley's attention to the fact that the compulsory aspect of the revival movement has been the cause of the main objection.  It is this word &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; which possibly causes opposition in people's minds and it was imposed on a particular attitude, dishonestly or wrongly.  I would hope that those who are close to the language revival movement, if they are really sincere about reviving the language will realise that this is one particularly strong reason for opposition resentment and it is being used as an excuse by those who are too lazy to <Col N="910" /> learn the language or who can produce 100 reasons for not trying to learn it.</P>
    <P>I would not feel that the attempt to revive the language should be dropped but people like Deputy Colley who appear to be taking on the leadership of that revival movement should remember they are fighting in a completely different context in this particular movement at this point in history, that the old slogans and the old battlecries do not have the same appeal at all.  However it is to be done, it will have to be a much more sophisticated approach than it has been in the past.  The language is no longer a symbol of nationhood in the old sense, in the sense of 1916.  I do not want to trespass on the debate in this regard.  I suppose we shall have a discussion on it at another time.  My only reason for intervening in this debate is to ask people like Deputy Colley to take another look at the desirability of having sections like this in legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>One might think from some of the contributions that have been made here that this clause was written into the Bill deliberately to debar a host of people from qualifying for recruitment to the CIE service.  Of course, there is no such thing.  This section deals with the recruitment by CIE to their ordinary clerical grades; in other words, it deals with the recruitment of secondary schoolboys and girls of leaving certificate standard. It has been suggested that perhaps the best people might not be got because they have not a knowledge of Irish and the impression has been given that this also deals with professional and technical staffs in that recruitment.  This section deals simply with the ordinary booking clerk or goods office clerk who is to be recruited and I cannot see in the year 1964 why there should be any objection by any member of the Irish Parliament.  You must have Irish.  It is eminently suitable for this grade and for the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the boy or girl of 17 or 18 years who has gone through the national school and the secondary school and who has had to have Irish <Col N="911" /> for the intermediate and leaving certificate examination, I see nothing wrong at all in saying: &ldquo;If you want to be recruited to CIE, you must have Irish.&rdquo;  Without going into whether one is pro or contra the revival movement. I think any citizen of the State is entitled to walk up to any CIE booking office in Ireland and transact his business in Irish.  The only way to ensure that is in a Bill of this kind. I am all for it and some of the vapourings that have been going on here just puzzle me.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry the Minister will not intervene in this debate.  One of the purposes of putting down this amendment is to bring home to people like the Minister for Transport and Power, who is personally responsible for provisions such as this, his personal responsibility for the injustice created by such provisions.  I suspect that for many years the tail has been wagging the dog, with all of us, both sides of the House.  This provision has been in Transport Bills since 1924 and, in fact, was originally brought in by Deputy McGilligan.  We have had 40 years of failure in regard to such provisions and now Deputy Childers who claims to be such a reasonable person, above all else, to be a rational person, is refusing to justify the continuance of this grave injustice, for that is what it is.  Deputy Colley a while ago inquired why we in Fine Gael are so concerned with the rights of the small minority of non-Irish speakers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to Deputy Colley the degree of injustice concerned as between one and the other is tremendous.  I am sorry that those who wish to do business with State companies or with private concerns in Irish cannot do so.  In many cases, they cannot, but the simple fact is that many of the Gaelic fanatics have a chip on their shoulders and wish to embarrass people and make things awkward for people who are unable to treat with them in the Irish language. There is not a small minority in my constituency and Deputy Colley's constituency of North-East Dublin who are victimised by provisions such as this.  There is a substantial majority. I am firmly convinced of the truth of that.</P>
      <P>One has only to speak to the people of Donnycarney, Raheny and Larkhill and so on to realise it.  Deputy Colley should realise how true that is.  They are not victimised because they failed to qualify for leaving or intermediate certificates in the Irish language, although, as has been said, there are many who are victimised on that score because long before the time of sitting for the leaving certificate, they have fallen by the wayside, and some are prevented from sitting for these examinations by school authorities anxious to keep up their averages.  I shall not digress unduly on that particular line.  I mention it merely because Deputy Colley did so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put to the Minister that what was said last week&mdash;I think, by Deputy Faulkner&mdash;that we were making a mockery of, and ridiculing the Minister because of his ignorance of Irish and because of the paradox in that he is imposing on junior clerks a standard he himself cannot live up to any more than the Taoiseach, is not <Col N="914" /> the point.  Mockery and ridicule can serve a very useful purpose at times. I believe it is an absurd situation and one which seems to disclose hypocrisy and insincerity because if the Minister and the Taoiseach did not learn Irish in their schooldays, people of their outstanding talent and brainpower could well learn Irish if they were sincere.</P>
    <P>I do not want to approach this matter in any Party spirit, seeking to score a point.  I am certainly disappointed that the Minister is refusing to accept the degree of personal responsibility that I believe attaches to him for this particular injustice.  He is complacent.  He is kowtowing to Gaelic enthusiasts and fanatics, of whom Deputy Colley is not one.  The Minister is kowtowing to them but not following their example.  That is a hypocritical thing to do.  I am sorry to have to say that but it is right and proper to say what we believe to be true.  It shows a sickening degree of hypocrisy which has disillusioned so many young people who feel that they are the victims of this state of affairs because, no matter what is said by Deputy Colley, who is such a reasonable enthusiast for the language, it cannot be gainsaid that Irish is most difficult to learn and is very badly taught.</P>
    <P>I believe this particular provision goes much further than has been touched on here.  I believe it is based on a certain philosophy, the philosophy that you are a better Irishman if you speak the Irish language and its corollary that you are an inferior Irishman not fit to be employed by CIE or appointed to the Civil Service, if you fail to conform. I, and most of us in Fine Gael, completely repudiate that philosophy.  We do not accept that one is an inferior Irishman, a third-rate citizen if one has an incompetent knowledge of Irish and is not an enthusiast for the language.  We believe the Irish language has its place in our society but that it is not all important to the extent advocated by others.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley is a most reasonable spokesman for the Irish enthusiasts, far more reasonable than persons like <Col N="915" /> the Minister for Social Welfare who has spoken of the Quislings and enemies of the nation and nationalism and has antagonised so many of us and has done such a disservice to the cause which he espouses.  I would echo the sentiments of Deputy Dr. Browne in his appeal to Deputy Colley to cease being the Minister's spokesman, to stand up to the bigots and fanatics in his own ranks.</P>
    <P>This provision in this Bill and the philosophy on which it is based is creative of grave injustice.  It has the effect of creating a privileged class, as Deputy Lynch said, a Brahmin class. We are not all endowed with the gift of learning languages, particularly a language that is in so many respects archaic and is also badly taught.  Apart from anything else, as others have said, the policy has failed in its object. We have 40 years of failure of this policy.</P>
    <P>The original Railways Act in which this provision was incorporated goes back to 1924 and it was then probably foisted on Dáil Éireann at a time of great emotional feeling.  I had a look to-night at the Official Report for the period in 1924 when this provision was first brought in.  There was not a word of debate on it but what struck one about that report was that 80 per cent of the members who voted in the various divisions on the Railways Act of that year&mdash;and none of them was Fianna Fáil&mdash;had their names in Irish.</P>

      <P>If I am wandering from the point, I am not the first to do so in this debate.  The Minister&mdash;and I mention this matter with diffidence&mdash; like me, is one of those who would be completely ostracised by the Gaelic fanatics.  He is a bastard Irishman in their eyes because he comes of Protestant, non-Gaelic stock and I am a Dublin jackeen, none of whose forebears ever spoke Irish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we have been discussing all night.  A man like myself is a bastard Irishman in their eyes, and that is why I am so anxious to pin on the Minister his responsibility for provisions such as this and for the results which spring from them. Despite what Deputy Casey said here to-night, there is far more in this provision than merely seeing that the booking clerk from whom you buy a railway ticket will be able to do business with you in Irish.  The Minister claims to be a rational person and not in any way an emotional person and for that reason I would urge him to intervene even at this late stage.</P>
      <P>In his few brief remarks, the Minister said that CIE had made it clear to the trade unions that the qualifying test for appointment to clerical grades will be intermediate certificate or leaving certificate and in each of these examinations Irish is compulsory so that acceptance of this provision we seek to delete is not imposing any great additional hardship.  In that event why is the provision there at all?  If the Minister wants logically to pursue that line of thought, he should accept our amendment.  It is significant that it is provided that Irish should be compulsory. It does not say English should be compulsory or even good character should be compulsory.  The Minister, on principle, could quite well accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said all I wish to say, except to make one final disclaimer.  Speaking here last week on this provision, Deputy Faulkner said: &ldquo;Tá a fhios agam ón méid adeireann an Teachta Ó Broin fá dtaobh de ó am go chéile anso sa Teach go bhfuil fuath aige dí.&rdquo; He said I hated the Irish language.  I <Col N="917" /> do not hate it.  God forbid that I should hate it.  I hate injustice and I have seen this compulsory Irish associated with so much humbug and injustice that I avail of every opportunity that presents itself to me to denounce that injustice.</P>

      <P>Deputy Colley challenged my remarks on the interchange between himself and Deputy Dr. Browne.  I have a copy of that very brief interchange here.  I am quoting from the Official Debate of 18th June, 1964, Volume 211, Column 502. Deputy Dr. Browne who was making the case about compulsion said:</P>
      <P>I personally dislike the idea of being compelled to do anything.  Any free individual living in a free society has exactly the same instincts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley said:</P>
      <P>Is the Deputy concerned about the compulsion on people to speak English?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Compulsion&rdquo; is the word used.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne replied:</P>
      <P>Had I been there at the time, I certainly would have resented it very much.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley's remark on that was: &ldquo;I mean today&rdquo;.  We are speaking today about compulsion to speak English.  Deputy Dr. Browne then continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have done my best to resist speaking English.  But the reality is now that we speak English automatically and, because of one reason or another, there are some people who do not speak Irish.  I am not <Col N="918" /> aware of any compulsion on anybody to speak English at present.</P>
    <P>Again, the word is &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo;. Deputy Colley's remark on this was: &ldquo;Try to do business in Irish&rdquo;.  Deputy Dr. Browne finished by saying:</P>
    <P>That is the most pregnant remark the Deputy has made in his implicit criticism of the failure of the revival movement over the past 40 years.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Colley can complain if I interpret that as meaning that there was compulsion nowadays on people in business to work through English.</P>

      <P>When there was a discussion relating to compulsion in regard to Irish, Deputy Colley said there was compulsion in respect to English.  I am very much interested in bringing that point home for the reason that the amendment is entirely to do with compulsion in respect of Irish.  As I said already, I am not sure what the phrase means but I think I know what it is intended to mean.  It is that Irish <Col N="919" /> shall be a compulsory subject in every competition under this subsection. That means that in an oral examination, a written examination or an interview, there will be a test in Irish and it will be compulsory.  I assume the person must pass or get through the test in Irish.  I am not so sure about that point of view because if the Board decide to have more than one of these type of tests, then not more than one of the tests might be competitive.  It could be that a group of people would be invited to an interview which would take place mainly in English but there would be a qualifying phrase or two in Irish which people would have to agree to.  The examination results would not depend upon who would have the best standard even of spoken Irish in an interview.  I think this could be made a complete cod of, the way it is done in the Legal Practitioners Act.  I do not think they can look back on this as the best piece of legislation in which it says nobody can be admitted to the Bar if he has not a competent knowledge of Irish.  No foreigner, whether he is an Asian or an African, has been refused to be admitted to the Bar because he is not competent in Irish.  That of course is nonsense.  If I thought this was going to be brought to that level, I would not mind but I should imagine in 1964 we are a bit more serious, particularly when we see the way the 1929 Act was developed.</P>
