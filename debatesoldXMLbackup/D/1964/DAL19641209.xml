      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he was aware of the investigations which Dr. Rapaport had made into the side effects of fluoridation; and whether he had given full consideration to his findings before making the Orders prescribing that the public water supplies to Dublin City and County should be fluoridated.</P>

      <P>I am aware of Dr. Rapaport's papers, in which he purported to show a statistical relationship between the incidence of mongolism and the fluoride content of water supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Rapaport's allegations were investigated by the New Zealand Commission on fluoridation and by the Ontario Committee of Inquiry.  Both these Commissions were satisfied that there was no basis for his conclusions. <Col N="592" /> I had studied both these reports very closely before making regulations, in May, 1962, providing for the fluoridation of public water supplies in Dublin City and County.</P>
    <P>I have also studied the writings of several competent medical experts who have shown that Dr. Rapaport's investigations were grossly inadequate and quite unscientific in method and in no way justified the theory which he propagated.  I accept the opinion of these experts that Dr. Rapaport's investigations are completely unreliable.</P>

    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that, despite his statement in the Budget speech last April that the increase would be granted to the same groups of pensioners for whom he provided an increase last year, Garda widows on the minimum scale have not yet received the five per cent.  Increase in pension as from 1st October; and when they may expect to receive it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="594" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Garda widows' pensions are paid at the rate laid down in the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1950, plus the increases granted under the Pensions (Increase) Acts, 1956-64, but a minimum rate corresponding to the contributory widow's pension under the Social Welfare Acts is paid, if this is more favourable.  This minimum rate, currently £111 a year, represents an 88 per cent increase in the pre-1962 Garda widow's pension.  Normal increases under the Pension (Increase) Acts, including five per cent from 1st October, 1964, would have given a pension of £78 to the widow of a Garda, an increase of 32? per cent on the pre-1962 rate.  As this is less than the minimum pension of £111 the latter continues to be payable without change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the understandable disappointment of this group of pensioners, who believe themselves to be covered by his general declaration of his intent to provide the same increase for all groups of pensioners for whom he provided an increase in the previous year, that they failed to get the five per cent which almost every other group of pensioners in the country received?  Would he agree it would be the general view of the House that we are dealing with a very limited group of widows and, even if the granting of five per cent would be a slight departure from the principles now enunciated by the Minister, the House would be prepared to support him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that these widows were getting the increase provided in the Budget each year up to 1st November, 1963, that is, last year. At that date I decided they should get the contributory widow's pension, which was much higher in many cases, rather than the increase they were entitled to.  When it came to this year, then, those who had got the £111 were on a standstill.  Going back to the old system of giving them what they had, very few would have done better, and they have got the increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I fully understand the regard had to a whole series of <Col N="595" /> considerations such as the Minister mentioned and while a great many experienced Deputies may understand the complex principles underlying the Minister's decision, would he agree with me that the bulk of these pensioners, not unnaturally, anticipated that the five per cent would be forthcoming for them?  It is a very small sum of money; it is a very limited category of persons; it is a diminishing charge and, in consideration of all these matters, perhaps the Minister would consider it again with a view to seeing if anything could be done to meet what, if it is not a grievance, is at least a disappointment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We were more generous than we promised by anticipating this increase in pensions last year and it is rather too much to expect that we should be, as it were, penalised for that now by having to give more.  I should mention one other point that is favourable in regard to this widow's pension. The ordinary person who has a contributory widow's pension cannot get a non-contributory pension, no matter what other means she has.  In the case of the Garda widow, although she has got the £111, which is the same as the non-contributory widow's pension, she is entitled to claim a non-contributory pension if her means so permit and I believe that a Garda widow is entitled to a small proportion of a non-contributory widow's pension if she has no other means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps over the coming season the Minister might reconsider the matter in the light of Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always prepared to reconsider it but I am afraid nothing more can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that as a result of the Pensions Increase Act, 1964, Garda widows receiving increased pensions have been deprived of 15/- per week of their non-contributory widow's pension; and whether he will take steps to amend the Pensions Increase Act, 1964, by inserting a provision similar to that in the Pensions <Col N="596" /> Increase Acts of 1956, 1959 and 1961, to provide that an increase would be regarded as a voluntary or gratuitous payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of a non-contributory pension varies according to the pensioner's means which are reckoned in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts.  A Garda widow's pension is reckonable as means under the Acts, which is proper having regard to the fact that the minimum Garda widow's pension is equal to the full contributory widow's pension.  By contrast, a widow in receipt of a contributory pension is debarred from receiving any non-contributory pension under the Acts so that the Garda widow is more favourably treated.</P>
      <P>With few exceptions, pensions to Garda widows are payable at the same rate, irrespective of the date of the husband's retirement or death.  It is therefore appropriate that these pensions should be assessed as a means on a uniform basis, so that the same amount will be reckoned as means irrespective of whether the pension is a new award of minimum pension, or has been raised to that amount by adding pensions increases to a smaller award made some years previously. The sums payable by way of Garda pension and non-contributory pension may vary from time to time because of increases in one or the other, but a pensions increase can never operate to reduce the total income from both pensions.  In fact total income has risen substantially in these cases in recent years.</P>
      <P>This matter was raised when the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1964, was being enacted and I considered it very fully at that time.  I regret that I would not be prepared to amend the Act as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will sympathise with me when I say that even to understand his answer is not easy for an experienced member of the House because it involves reference to a number of principles governing the pensions code.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But, in effect, I have brought to the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare at least one case in which the widow actually finds herself 15/- a week worse off than she was before she got the increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was certainly a mistake, if she is worse off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that in any case where the increased pension awarded to a widow has operated to reduce her social welfare pension so as to leave her with a lesser annual income, there is some regulation or provision under which that can be corrected?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister for Finance.  I understand the complexity of this problem.  Surely, none of us meant when we passed the Pensions Act, 1964, that a widow woman in receipt of a pension in respect of her deceased husband would actually find herself 15/- a week worse off than when we passed the 1964 Pensions Act?  Nobody meant that.</P>

      <P>In common with other borrowers the State and local authorities would be anxious to borrow for all purposes at the lowest possible rates.  Interest rates are, however, determined by prevailing conditions on the capital market including the availability of resources for lending and the particular attractiveness of alternative methods of disposing of such resources.  The scope for Government action to reduce the cost of its borrowing is limited by these factors.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that CIE are engaged in the construction of 255 new type single deck buses from imported completely knocked down parts. These were ordered a considerable time ago and a proportion of the order has already been delivered.  As I have already explained to the Dáil, the decision to make the bus bodies in a completely knocked down condition is a departure from previous practice but this is mainly as regards the main framing of the bus body and the introduction of fibre glass in the design; the outer panelling and inner trimming and finishing of the bodies will be carried out by CIE as before.  I am informed that this is the result of world-wide changes in the techniques of bus design and manufacture and will <Col N="605" /> enable CIE to incorporate up-to-date design and methods without being involved in prohibitive re-tooling costs. There is, of course, no question of importing double-deck buses but CIE contemplate commencing a programme of building 120 double-deck buses from imported completely knocked down parts when the present programme for single-deck buses is completed in about 18 months' time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that when the Minister refers to the importation of completely knocked down bus bodies, he is talking in effect about the importation of buses as such? What it means is that, whereas heretofore the workers at Spa Road, Inchicore, made buses from the ground up out of sheet steel, and employment was provided for 400 men, now we are exporting money to the tune of, in the first instance, £1,500,000, to England and possibly double that in respect of the double-deck buses in prospect, with the inevitable result of redundancy for a large number of men who have spent all their lives working in this industry and whose families were there before them.  In the light of that and all that has gone on about the 15 per cent and the intensive propaganda to buy Irish, is it not ironic, to say the least of it, that the Government should be spending £1,500,000 on imports from England&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no question of any redundancy for the present and there is plenty of work there to be done.  In further reply to the Deputy, owing to the change in the technique of making buses, there is a change in the character of the importation of parts.  When the Deputy referred to £1,500,000, I do not know to what he was referring, but the difference in the kind of materials that are imported now and the kind of materials that will be imported because of this inevitable change in the manufacturing of the buses is negligible and could not possibly have a bearing on the balance of payments or anything of that kind.</P>

      <P>I have replied to all these questions before and the Deputy knows the position.  I made it perfectly clear that in relation to the long-term changes that were to take place at Spa Road, and after the completion of a programme for manufacturing single-deck buses and of urgently needed maintenance work, of which the Deputy should be fully aware, there will be negotiations with the trade unions, inevitably, because there will be changes.  As I told the Deputy, by that time plans for the retraining of workers, which could apply to the workers capable of retraining at Spa Road, will be in operation.  We are awaiting the final decision of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I also told the Deputy that in relation to any redundancy, there would be negotiations with the trade unions.  There again that depends partly on any general redundancy arrangements or plans in relation to redundancy made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.

Is the Minister further aware that the Irish Royal Institute of Architects have found it necessary to restrain their members from carrying on this practice, a practice the Minister apparently considers to be quite in order?</P>

      <P>What the Royal Institute decide or do not decide has no bearing on what we decide here.  In so far as publication of these notices is concerned, publication represents a very great improvement, irrespective of what language is used, on what obtained over the past 30 years when no such notices were required and no register of applications or decisions was kept.  In the long term, I do not think there will be any real difficulty from a language point of view.</P>

      <P>No, Sir.  The Minister said it was proper and correct to publish the notice in one language, and that was sufficient.  I want to put it to him, if this notice related to Fior-Ghaeltacht property, and the probability was that all those interested <Col N="611" /> spoke only Irish, would he think it the fulfilment of the legislation of this House to publish this notice for the information of people in English, in the knowledge and belief that the people concerned neither spoke nor read English?</P>

      <P>As a matter of clarification. I should say that, irrespective of which of the two languages is used, the notice must be displayed and there must be kept conveniently available to all interested parties and they would include members of local authorities, and so on, a register in the various offices open for inspection at all reasonable times.  No matter what language is used information as to what is intended in any particular place will in future be available to all and sundry before any work commences or before any application is granted.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 41 to 46 inclusive together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that, for the more rapid development of our sea-fishery industry on rational lines, the processing sector will have to occupy a front-line position in our national fisheries policy.  As a corollary, existing processing factories, and others that may be established, will have to be assured of regular and adequate supplies for economic working.  In that connection, I intend to give special attention to the promotion of contractual arrangements <Col N="626" /> between Irish fishermen and processing factories to ensure that at least basic factory needs will be met and will be expanded.  I have implicit faith that Irish fishermen will in time, and with improved State aid and encouragement be well capable of playing their full part in this aspect of the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As an interim measure, however, to ensure supplies for the processing factory operated by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara at Galway, it is necessary to permit landings of fish by foreign trawlers to supplement, rather than supplant, local catches to enable the factory to fulfil highly important export orders which have been secured and which will, it is hoped, be repeated. In view of these considerations, I have recently granted a licence under the Agricultural Products (Regulation of Imports) Act, 1938, enabling an externally-registered vessel to land its catches for the factory at Galway under conditions which ensure that all such landings of fish will be processed and re-exported and will not, therefore, adversely affect the interests of Irish fishermen.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara refused fish at Galway because of alleged shortage of staff is not borne out by the information at my disposal.  Fish occasionally had, however, been refused by the Board on grounds such as poor condition and unsuitability for processing.  While the Galway fishermen were not specifically consulted about the present temporary importations, import of raw materials for re-export is a well-recognised industrial practice and I am fully satisfied that the best interests of Irish fishermen, which is my paramount consideration, are being served in the present case.  Finally, I have no reason to believe that the landings in question constitute cut-throat competition for locally caught supplies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if the Deputy is being deliberately or wilfully dense on this matter or whether he does not understand.  Perhaps I should explain: the catch from this trawler is sent into the factory for processing and such fish as cannot be processed and then exported is sent to the fish meal factory.  There is no question whatever of any competition with our fishermen. In fact, at the time of these landings, they had not landed any fish but directions have been given that if they land fish, their fish is to be taken before that of the Spanish vessel.  The only object is to ensure that this factory and the 58 people employed there will be kept in employment and that the factory will be kept going and expanded so that when our fishermen have large landings to make, the factory will be able to deal with them. <Col N="628" /> If that is not done the factory will close down and there will be no outlet for the fishermen.</P>

      <P>The late Deputy Desmond had been a member of Cork County Council since 1945 and Secretary of the Federation of Rural Workers since 1947. He was first elected to Dáil Éireann in 1948 and was returned at each General Election since then.  He gave the greater part of his life to public affairs and he will be remembered for his dedication and devotion to his work as a public representative.  His many contributions to our debates were marked by measured and deliberate argument and a reluctance to embark on extravagant statements.  He always showed a desire to be fair in his criticism.  His passing is a great loss not only to his Party, whom he served zealously as Deputy Leader and member of the Administrative Council, but also to this House.</P>

    <Col N="635" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill has two purposes, namely, to raise the statutory limit for issues from the Local Loans Fund and to give power to write off from the assets of the Fund the outstanding balances of certain loans which have proved to be irrecoverable.</P>
      <P>The present statutory limit on issues from the Local Loans Fund was fixed at £170 million by the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1961.  The Bill proposes to raise the limit to £250 million.</P>
      <P>From the time of its establishment in 1935 up to 31st March, 1964, issues from the Fund amounted to £149 million, by far the greater part of which related to housing.  Slum clearance and other re-housing schemes of urban local authorities absorbed £41 million, and the corresponding schemes of rural local authorities took £33 million.  This makes a total of £74 million for local authority housing as a whole, or just half of the total issues from the Fund. Almost 114,000 dwellings were provided by the local authorities during the period.</P>
      <P>Loans under the Small Dwellings Acquistion Acts and similar legislation up to 31st March last absorbed £35 million, the money being issued to the local authorities for re-lending to persons providing houses for themselves. The balance of the issues for housing&mdash;£8 million&mdash;related to loans to the local authorities to meet the requirements of their supplementary housing grant schemes, and to loans for housing in the Gaeltacht under the special Gaeltacht housing code.</P>
      <P>Thus, issues for the various housing services absorbed £117 million in all. To complete the picture I may mention that Exchequer housing grants in the same period for new houses and the improvement of existing dwellings amounted to £43 million, which gives a grand total of £160 million for housing over the whole period since 1935.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" /> Issues from the Local Loans Fund on services other than housing amounted to £32 million.  Of this amount, county homes, hospitals and dispensaries took £6 million.  Sanitary and other health services absorbed £20 million, of which a large part was spent on water supply and sewerage schemes.  These schemes, of course, arise primarily from needs associated with housing development and so may be regarded as part of the cost of re-housing or improved housing.  There is, however, a growing element in these schemes to cater for new industries and for the development of tourism as well as for new schools and hospitals. Loans for the construction and improvement of vocational schools absorbed just under £4 million.  Here, too, requirements are growing steadily, reflecting the expansion in our technical education service.</P>
    <P>I may add that the global amount of £149 million issued up to the 31st March last included a total over the past decade of £23 million lent to Dublin and Cork Corporations for housing and other purposes.</P>
    <P>In addition to the issues actually made, account must also be taken of the substantial outstanding commitments in respect of schemes in progress and planned.  On this basis, and bearing in mind that at Budget time requirements for 1964-65 were estimated at £16½ million, the existing statutory limit of £170 million needs to be increased. Some temporary falling off in issues is expected as a result of the building strike.</P>
    <P>A sharp increase is, however, anticipated in the years ahead, according as the enlarged programmes envisaged for housing, hospitals, vocational schools, water supplies, sewerage and other services come into full operation.  To meet the situation, the Bill proposes to increase the statutory limit for issues from the Fund to £250 million.  This should suffice for the next four years or so, after which it would be necessary to seek further authority from the Dáil to continue issues.</P>
    <P>A growing level of investment in building and construction is forecast in <Col N="637" /> the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> It is clear that this growth will impose a heavy strain on national resources.  As the figures I mentioned earlier indicate, building and construction accounts for virtually all of the issues from the Local Loans Fund, while accounting for about one-third of the public capital programme as a whole.</P>
    <P>In this situation it is a matter of serious concern to the Government that building prices should have risen so steeply over the last few years and that they still continue to rise.  The impact of these increases is felt throughout the whole community, not only by those trying to provide and maintain homes for themselves and their families but also by the taxpayers and ratepayers who have to meet such a large part of the bill for housing, schools, hospitals and other services.</P>
    <P>I would appeal now to all those in a position to help, whether workers or employers, to co-operate in every way towards keeping costs down.  Our need for more houses, schools and hospitals is great.  It is obvious that the higher costs go, the more difficult it will be to meet that need.  Ways should be persistently sought of increasing production and productivity in the building industry.  Improvements that will cut costs are vital to the long-term success of the industry and to the fulfilment of the heavy building programmes envisaged.  Given our present difficulties in the export field and our balance of payments problem, it is most important, too, that home-produced building materials should be used as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to give power to continue the issue of loans to local authorities, including health authorities, and vocational education committees. As in the past these authorities will be expected to do their best to borrow independently to meet their capital needs before calling on the Local Loans Fund.  In making this comment&mdash;I made a similar comment when speaking on the previous amending Bill in 1961&mdash;I think I should draw attention to the fact that local authorities <Col N="638" /> in neighbouring countries are obliged to rely much more on their own efforts to raise capital than our authorities.  Here the Exchequer provided as much as 80 per cent of the loan capital raised by our local authorities in the year 1963-64.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that the Bill also provides power to write off outstanding balances of certain loans which it has proved impossible to recover. These loans were made to farmers over 50 years ago under various last century Land Acts for the improvement or purchase of land or farm property.  On the establishment of the Local Loans Fund in 1935, the balances of the loans remaining to be repaid became part of the assets of the Fund.  All efforts to recover the amounts now outstanding have failed because of the death, emigration, or poor circumstances of the persons concerned, change of ownership of the land or other reasons.  The only practicable course now is to write off the sums involved.</P>
    <P>The total amount in question&mdash; £272&mdash;is insignificant in terms of issues from the Fund.  To comply with the requirements of the Local Loans Fund Act, 1935, it will be necessary to provide by supplementary estimate for recoupment to the Fund of principal written off which is just over £223.</P>
    <P>I commend the provisions of the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is, of course, an enabling Bill&mdash;a Bill to enable the Capital Budget to operate. It is one that deals with only one sector of the Capital Budget and it is entirely undesirable that our Capital Budget should be considered only in sectors.  The introduction of the Bill, I venture to say, therefore, underlines and stresses the necessity for the Dáil to consider the Capital Budget as one entity in the manner I indicated would take place in 1957 if I had been left in the Minister's chair.  I again say, as I have said on many occasions to the Minister, that it would be a desirable innovation that we would consider our capital programme at one time as some of the obviously more immediate effects of the current Budget which, <Col N="639" /> naturally, at that time, take up more attention both of Deputies in the House and the public at large.</P>
      <P>I do not think I need to reiterate the views of this Party in relation to productive capital investment.  We have always made it clear that we support as high a programme of productive capital investment as the people will support.  The necessity for that becomes more obvious every day and in so far as any scheme of investment by this Government is suggested which will stand up to the hallmark of productive capital investment on the one hand, or desirable social investment on the other, the Minister and the House can be assured that those plans will have our wholehearted and constructive support.</P>
      <P>This Bill, as I say, is an enabling Bill but I notice that in its introduction the Minister has taken the opportunity to comment on increases in building costs.  The Minister must know that the increase in costs on the whole community was started&mdash;and he was warned it would start&mdash;as a result of the spiral of inflation he touched off with the turnover tax.  He was warned adequately at that time that the only effect of his measure then taken was to commence a spiral of inflation the end of which no one could foresee. Notwithstanding that, he chose to keep to his course and unfortunately the prognostications and prophecies then made from these benches have come to pass in such a way that the Minister himself is constrained in his introductory remarks on an innocuous enabling Bill like this to refer to one of the effects of that very spiral of inflation for which he and the Fianna Fáil Government are responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, this is hardly the occasion on which to debate in full the Capital Budget when we are dealing with only one sector of it.  Our views in relation to a Capital Budget are well known in as much as it was initiated by us for the first time in 1949, when it was introduced by Deputy McGilligan in the inter-Party Government, and by the many statements we in Fine Gael have made since then.  I do not quite understand the write-offs there are in <Col N="640" /> the Schedule.  I fully appreciate the reasons for these 16 items the Minister has given.</P>
    <P>I must confess frankly, however, that I was not aware that many of the earlier Land Acts did charge sums on the Local Loans Fund in this way and it is desirable that the Minister should tell the House whether there are any other sums outstanding to the Local Loans Fund by private individuals, or whether the entire debt now due to the Fund is a local authority debt.  Perhaps the Minister could also let us know the last year in which any issue was made from the Fund to a private individual, as apart from an issue made to a local authority, which is what most of us understand as being the real function of the Local Loans Fund.  In short, what I want to know is whether there is any prospect of a similar Schedule ever having to be brought in, in the future.</P>

      <P>Investment in development has been recognised as urgently necessary in recent years.  As far as capital investment in industry and agriculture is concerned, I suppose such investment is designed to give the quickest return.  The tenor of the Minister's speech has been to the effect that capital investment in other things is also of extreme importance and urgency to the country as a whole. The purpose of this measure is to extend the amount that may be made available for the building of houses, schools, dispensaries, hospitals and other such structures.  In recent times I have begun to think that whilst there is quite an amount of talk, particularly from the Minister for Local Government, about the building of houses, we do not appear to be getting the results one would have expected, bearing in mind his speeches here and his outside public pronouncements.  It is true that the Minister for Finance in this measure is in one instance providing the money for building houses but we do not seem to be making much progress, and if one were to examine the position in various parts of the country&mdash;I do not say every part&mdash;one would find the rate of progress in house building such that it will be very many years before even those <Col N="641" /> who are now applicants for houses will be provided for.</P>
      <P>I know there are many problems attached to the building of houses, particularly by local authorities.  There is the difficulty in regard to the availability of skilled labour and there is also the difficulty of the various discussions and entanglements between the local authorities and the Custom House, meaning the Department of Local Government.  A great error was made some years ago when through inactivity, we allowed very valuable building tradesmen to emigrate.  As far as I can see, a lot of employment by local authorities in house building is very precarious and many workers left that type of building work because they discovered there was no security of employment.  Strictly speaking, this is not a matter for the Minister for Finance; it is initially the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government, but greater efforts will have to be made in house building by local authorities. An effort was made, and implemented, in 1948 and 1949 to try to induce building workers to come back from Great Britain and if the Irish building workers in Great Britain were now offered reasonable terms in wages and conditions of employment, and above all security of employment, we would find that the rapidity with which local authority houses would be built would be very much accelerated.</P>
      <P>No matter what picture may be painted in regard to wages in Great Britain, I know from my own knowledge from talking to Irish building workers in Great Britain that even though conditions may not be quite as attractive here, they would prefer to be back in their own country if they could be guaranteed secure employment.  Unfortunately in that particular trade, that is, house building for local authorities, there seems to be a policy of stop, go, stop, go and men cannot afford to wait until they are called again by the local authority and have to have recourse to the employment exchange or some other type of assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government, and I am sure all members of the <Col N="642" /> Government, must be concerned about this problem.  There are other very great attractions in the building industry, apart from working for the local authorities.  We have skyscrapers, hotels and new office buildings being erected and we have elaborate renovations being carried out, particularly in the big cities and in the provincial towns, on which many thousands of building workers are engaged and the Government will have to devise some method by which attractive terms will be offered to these building workers to ensure that the houses that are so badly needed will be built in a reasonably short time.</P>
    <P>The forecast of building by the Minister for Local Government does not seem to me to be spectacular.  It is pathetic to think that some people because they have no house here of their own, in their home towns, I will not say are forced to emigrate, but have to decide, because they cannot get anything more than one room for themselves and their wives and one or two children, to emigrate and to take a chance in Britain.  That may not be widespread but it is happening.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting if there were a breakdown of costs in regard to the building of hospitals, schools, dispensaries and such buildings.  Either the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Local Government was asked in recent weeks to give a breakdown in regard to materials, architects' fees, engineers' fees and salaries and building workers' wages.  It would be interesting to discover how these have fluctuated in recent years.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should also like to know a little more about these write-offs.  I do not know why it was necessary to put the names in or why, if it was necessary, the addresses were not also put in.  I presume it was to copper-fasten the write-offs, so to speak, in that the actual names were included in the legislation.  I do not think it was very enlightening for anybody, and I suppose it is not intended to be.</P>
    <P>Nobody wants to pry into the affairs of these people.  We have so many <Col N="643" /> John Murphys and Michael Smiths in the country that if such names were the subjects of the write-offs, they certainly would not mean anything, but the man with the unusual name could be recognised.  James Ryan could not be recognised.  There are many of them all over the country.  But Gerard Sweetman or, I think, Brendan Corish, would be recognised.  If we are including names at all, I think we should put in the addresses as well.  The James Ryans could get out of any publicity there might be, but the Gerard Sweetmans and the other people with the unusual names could easily be recognised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Sweetman said, this is to provide for part of the Capital Budget for the next four years or so.  I agree with the Deputy it is a great pity we do not find time or opportunity to discuss the Capital Budget <i>in toto.</i> The year before last I published a Table at Budget time setting out the Capital Budget.  There was reference to it but there was not a separate debate on it.  Naturally, it was in order for the debate on the Budget.  Last year there was some difficulty with regard to the preparation of the Second Programme and it was not done.  But I will certainly take a note and try to have it done again in future.  As Deputy Sweetman realises, and I realise too, in preparing the Budget you have to consider the capital side as well.  Not only do we have to consider the capital side from the point of view of raising the money but we also have to provide in the Budget for the interest and sinking fund payable on that capital fund when it comes to be spent.</P>
      <P>The Deputy spoke about touching off the spiral of inflation.  I think we will leave that for another occasion.  It might lead to a long controversy if I went into it now.  All I will say is that I do not agree with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the individuals, I take it they are mentioned by name in order that they will be taken off the books as debtors.  They are practically all gone away; they are dead, have disappeared <Col N="644" /> or are men of no means.  In the ordinary way in any other Department they would be written off and there would be no more about it.  But the Local Loans Fund legislation lays down that it must be recouped anything written off.  That is why we have to bring it into the Bill, to give the amount and also to bring in a Supplementary Estimate to recoup the amount taken off in this way.  I am told there are no other individual debtors.  As far as we know, this would appear to be the end of the operation in that direction, at least for the present.</P>
    <P>There are not any advances made now to individuals except under the Gaeltacht housing code.  I am not able to enlighten the Deputy as to what was the scheme under which these loans were made.  Had I been asked before this Bill came whether such loans had been made, I would have said no.  They were made mostly to small farmers for some reason or another and the debts are still outstanding.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish said there was not sufficient progress being made in the building of houses.  I think we all agree with that.  Where we differ, perhaps, is as to the cause for that complaint. There is as much money voted this year under this head as was ever voted before.  It is true that costs have gone up and that must be taken into account.  If the Deputy will examine the Programme for Economic Expansion for the next few years, he will find that amount is increasing each year. The money is being supplied and, indeed, used; yet we get complaints from time to time that houses are required here and there and that they are not being supplied.</P>
    <P>The one thing I hear from time to time in discussing this matter with members of local authorities is that they find it almost impossible to get a tender.  That may be due to what Deputy Corish says&mdash;that there is a scarcity of tradesmen, that many of our good tradesmen went to England and are not prepared to come back because they are afraid there is not the security of constant employment here.  I think they need have no fear about that <Col N="645" /> when they see the provision we are making for the next four or five years. There will be more than enough work for any tradesman to come back, but how you can get them back I do not know.  The new conditions the builders are providing with regard to guaranteed employment at a certain level and also with regard to superannuation may tempt more tradesmen to come back.  I hope they will.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate what the Minister said in relation to the publication of the projected Capital Budget in a pamphlet, my recollection is&mdash;I am only talking on recollection and I may be wrong&mdash;it was published only two or three days before the Current Budget debate.  It is inevitable that the interest and attention of Deputies and the country at the time of the Current Budget debate will be on the more immediate effects of the Budget.  The Minister will agree, I think, it is virtually impossible for him to frame his Current Budget until he has first got his Capital Budget to see what he wants to carry in for sinking fund, interest and so forth.  Therefore, as far as I can see, there would not be any difficulty in the publication of a Capital Budget around the time of the Vote on Account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that were possible, it might mean we would be able to get a discussion on our Capital Budget away from the more immediate impingement of Budget proposals on our pockets.  It is very necessary that some attention be <Col N="646" /> called to the nature and amount of our Capital Budget and to the necessity for ensuring it is directed into the right channels.  I can see no better way of doing it than by publishing the Capital Budget proposals, as they were published in 1963, a month or six weeks before the Current Budget and accordingly have an opportunity of discussing them on the Vote on Account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  On 21st July, 1964 the Government made an order under the State Guarantees Act, 1954 entitled the State Guarantees Act, 1954 (Amendment of Schedule) (No. 2) Order, 1964, empowering the Minister for Finance to guarantee borrowings by Aer Lingus up to a maximum of £5 million. Having regard to its capital programme, it was considered necessary to put the Company in a position to borrow direct from commercial sources under a State guarantee.  Such borrowing&mdash;provided the terms are reasonable&mdash;is to be encouraged as it reduces the amount to be provided by the Exchequer to Finance the State Capital Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus is at present negotiating a loan on the New York market.  The principal and repayment terms of the loan are expressed in dollars.  The Law Officers have advised that having regard to the provisions of the Currency Act, 1927, guarantees under the State Guarantees Act, 1954 must be in Irish pounds because that Act does not provide explicitly for guarantees of borrowings made in any other currency. <Col N="648" /> This Bill proposes to remedy this defect and will enable the Minister for Finance to guarantee foreign borrowing by any of the bodies scheduled to the principal Act.  Aer Lingus is the only body at present negotiating such borrowing.  All existing guarantees given under the principal Act are in respect of borrowings in Irish currency and are not affected by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides that the Minister for Finance may guarantee borrowings in a foreign currency by a Scheduled body.</P>
    <P>Section 3 sets out the procedure for determining the foreign currency equivalents of the amounts specified in the Schedule to the 1954 Act and of the Irish currency equivalent of any payment in a foreign currency which the Minister for Finance may be called upon to make under a guarantee.  The amounts specified in the Schedule fix the maximum amount of principal in Irish currency which may be guaranteed at any one time, and, in the case of foreign borrowing, the corresponding foreign currency equivalent will be determined by reference to the par rate of exchange ruling at the date on which the guarantee is given.  Where the Minister for Finance may have to honour a guarantee in respect of a loan expressed in a foreign currency the amount of Irish currency required to meet the guarantee will be determined by reference to the rate of exchange ruling at the time the guarantee has to be met.  I should point out that this means that in the event of a currency devaluation by this country the cost, in Irish currency, of meeting such a guarantee would increase and, conversely, would be less if a revaluation occurred.  A similar situation would also arise if the foreign currency in which a guaranteed loan was expressed was either revalued or devalued.</P>
    <P>Section 4 increases from £5 million to £6 million the amount of borrowing by Aer Lingus which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  The Company is at present negotiating a loan for $15,000,000, equivalent to £5,357,143 in Irish currency.  As the terms of the loan are reasonable it is <Col N="649" /> desirable to increase the authorised amount which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance so as to enable the Company to avail of the full amount on offer.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the provisions of this Bill to increase the total amount that may be guaranteed to Aer Lingus Teoranta from £5 million to £6 million, I have no objection or comment whatsoever to make.  It is understood by all of us that the cost of aircraft that have to be purchased from time to time must be and is rising and, accordingly, it is necessary to meet that increase and that rise.</P>
      <P>However, I must say that I do not accept the position in relation to section 2 in the naive way that the Minister has indicated.  Section 2 in its present form is wholly undesirable. What section 2 means is that not merely Aer Lingus but any of the State bodies concerned may contract a foreign loan without the consent of Dáil Éireann in a particular instance. That is wholly undesirable.  It is undesirable, I think the Minister would agree, that he would come to the House in relation to a foreign loan of any sort.</P>
      <P>The original State Guarantees Act of 1954, which provided in its Schedule for six different State sponsored bodies, was for a total of approximately £18½ million.  That amount has since been increased.  Offhand, I do not know the total increase that has been made by amending legislation in relation to guarantees that may be given.  I do not know whether the Minister has the total figure to his hand or not but, from recollection, there have been some substantial increases down through the years.  Indeed, the figure for Aer Lingus of £6 million is not mentioned at all in the initial Schedule, so that the amount involved must be now at least £25 million and my recollection is that it is very much more substantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is desirable that a State sponsored body and the Minister for Finance, without informing or getting the approval of the Dáil, should engage in foreign borrowing of a sizeable <Col N="650" /> sum like that.  I can certainly visualise the way in which Fianna Fáil would make the welkin ring if they were in Opposition and the Government of the day were making such a suggestion.  To put it at its very minimum, there should be provision for an affirmative resolution by Dáil Éireann in the event of there being a foreign borrowing guaranteed under the provisions of section 2 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting for one minute that the purposes for which the borrowing might be made might not be excellent purposes; I am not suggesting for a minute that it would not be quite good commercial practice but away over and above commercial practice there is here involved a very fundamental question of policy in relation to foreign borrowing as a whole.  I do not think it is right that the policy in relation to foreign borrowing should be, so to speak, by-passed in a scheme such as that now put forward by the Minister in relation to this Bill.  I do not propose to debate the merits of another similar transaction now.  I have no knowledge as to whether it was a good commercial transaction or not but I propose to return to the method of financing it on another occasion in this House.  However, there is no doubt about one thing, that that transaction, the method of which I criticised at that time and will criticise again, was wholly opposed to the principal of financing by the authority of Dáil Éireann which we understand.</P>
    <P>I believe it was wrong for the Minister for Finance to give his consent to a loan to a foreign power as he did in relation to Shipping Finance Corporation. The only body that should do that is Dáil Éireann.  I believe it is just as wrong that it should be attempted, as it is attempted in this section, to provide that foreign borrowings can take place without the explicit consent of Dáil Éireann in the individual case.  I would agree at once with the Minister that the power being sought in section 2 is not as objectionable as the other because at least the Minister is advising us in the Dáil that it is proposed to do this and we have advance knowledge to that effect.  I think I would be <Col N="651" /> excused, however, if I said the Minister was trying to introduce this to the House on the illogical argument of proceeding from the particular to the general.</P>
    <P>There may be an excellent case in the present circumstances for Aer Lingus borrowing the amount that is involved in the New York market, $15,000,000, and there may be an excellent case for the Minister asking for authority to guarantee that specific loan in the New York market.  What the Minister is asking us to do today is not merely to permit him to guarantee the Aer Lingus loan but to permit him, in addition, to guarantee any other purchase which, for example, Grain Importers, Tea Importers, Steel Holdings or the Potato Marketing Board might make in another country and to guarantee that no matter what may happen in regard to the devaluation of sterling.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister set out in his statement a specific reference to what would occur if there was devaluation. It is only ten days since it looked very likely that there would be a devaluation of sterling.  Some people believe that the danger of sterling devaluation has not even yet passed.  The effect that devaluation in London would have on us here is something which we need not consider but it is something which would be, as I am sure the Minister will readily agree with me, very grave indeed.</P>
    <P>We should not, therefore, take the opportunity because it is felt that a guarantee for one State body is desirable, of giving an omnibus or a blanket authority for the purpose.  Aer Lingus, for example, is a body which by its very nature and by the essence of its operations earns substantial foreign exchange.  It is a body which because of that earning is better equipped to deal with foreign borrowing than another body.  I do not think the Minister, or any Minister for Finance for that matter, would give authority to the Potato Marketing Board to raise a loan in New York.  The Minister will agree with me when I say it would be highly undesirable that it should do <Col N="652" /> so.  Why so frame the legislation, in that event, that it enables it to be done?</P>
    <P>I know the tendency of draftsmen and of the Civil Service&mdash;and I do not mean this in any way as a criticism of the Civil Service at all&mdash;is to include always in a Bill the greater rather than the lesser.  They naturally want to avoid having to come back to their Minister and to say afterwards: &ldquo;We did not get authority for this or for that.&rdquo;  I can understand the Civil Service approach and I do not say that in a critical way of the Civil Service because I think we are extraordinarily fortunate in the manner in which we&mdash; by &ldquo;we&rdquo; I do not mean Ministers or Deputies but the whole country&mdash;are served by the Civil Service.  However, it is the natural Civil Service approach and it should be the natural approach both of the political head of the Department for the time being and of the Deputies in Dáil Éireann to curb such a wide general approach.</P>
    <P>This is a specific instance in which it should be curbed.  This is a specific instance in which, rather than the general power that is incorporated in section 2, there should be included in this Bill a specific power enabling the Minister to guarantee specific borrowing for which he can make the case, whereas in many other cases it would be quite impossible for him to make it.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to think again and to change the omnibus provision he has got in either of two ways: either to restrict it to the Aer Lingus borrowing we have here, or, alternatively, provide that, before such a guarantee can be given, an affirmative resolution must be passed in this House to permit the Minister to pledge the credit of the country in a guarantee other than our own.</P>

      <P>The Minister said&mdash;and rightly&mdash;that allowing Aer Lingus itself to borrow reduces the amount to be provided by the Exchequer to finance the State capital programme and I think I would applaud that.  I wonder is Aer Lingus under any obligation to say for what purpose the money is to be borrowed?  I am sorry I was not <Col N="653" /> here for the Minister's speech which I have here.  I had assumed that when I came to the second page at least the Minister would have given us an idea of the capital programme in which Aer Lingus proposes to engage and for which it intends to borrow £5 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal first with Deputy Corish's question, naturally Aer Lingus had to make a case before the Minister would agree to give this guarantee.  I may say I was rather pleased that the application of Aer Lingus was for a guarantee rather than for the money because in their earlier days they asked just for money.  This was supplied by the Minister and although some of it was given by way of grant and some by way of loan, I do not think even the money given by loan is fully remunerative.  Therefore, I am glad to see them looking after their own finances by borrowing money on this occasion.  They did make the case of extra equipment required in the way of aeroplanes.</P>

      <P>Is that the sole purpose of the loan, the purchase of aeroplanes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As regards Deputy Sweetman's point, I agree with his anxiety on this score.  I quite appreciate it but I think he need not worry. I was going to state how we stand in regard to guarantees under section 4 but I might as well do so now as the Deputy has raised the question.  First, as the Deputy is aware, I cannot add any item to this list without getting the approval of the Dáil.  We are, therefore, dealing only with the cases I mentioned which have already got the approval of the Dáil.  The Irish Potato Marketing Board have approval for £150,000 but they have not asked for any guarantee so far.  That is a comparatively small amount.  The big item is St. Patrick's Copper Mines, almost £2 million.  That guarantee has been honoured but in giving the consent at the time I could only give it for pounds and, therefore, that consent still stands.  The same applies in the case of the Cork Opera House, £50,000. That is all that is involved except Aer Lingus.  If we have to add anything <Col N="654" /> else to the list, as Deputies are aware, I must come to the Dáil to have a resolution passed adding the new proposition. I should then, of course, as the Bill stands now, be obliged to tell Deputies whether it is being borrowed in pounds or some other currency and the Dáil would have an opportunity of objecting if they thought it was inadvisable to go to some other currency in the particular instance.  We need not be unduly worried about the fears expressed by Deputy Sweetman.  I think he is mixing up two bodies where loans are guaranteed.  The loan to Shipping Finance is made by the Industrial Credit Company.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister on the Second Stage if he had any information with regard to the firms which had availed of the special grants in order to make certain changes in preparation for the Common Market or, as he said himself, for the purpose of their making general improvements and arrangements for bulk buying and so forth.  The Minister thought that it was unusual that I should ask that. I said the assistance offered to those people to enable them to prepare themselves was pretty generous and the Minister had handed out money to something like 882 firms.  I think that figure is correct.  Is there not some follow-up on behalf of the taxpayer to ensure that progress is being made and the money is not just being wasted?  Surely there is some follow-up to ensure that these firms are using this money to prepare themselves for free trade.</P>

      <P>I may have said something which misrepresented something which the Deputy said and, if I did, then it was only because I misunderstood the Deputy.  I took his remarks to mean that he wanted to know to what type of firm and what type of industry these grants were being made available and my reply was that the types represented were set out fully in the schedule to the report of An Foras Tionscal.  I understand what the Deputy really wants to know is whether any check is being kept.  I can say definitely there is.</P>
      <P>In the first place, as the Deputy is aware, the CIO recommended the setting up of adaptation councils for groups of firms within certain industries. In many cases these councils have been set up.  Their purpose is to do exactly what the Deputy suggests, namely, bulk buying of raw materials and joint marketing of the finished products where these exercises appear feasible within the particular industries. As well as that, I have set up a special branch within my Department, called the Industrial Reorganisation Branch, and the officers in that section not only keep in touch with the adaptation councils but also with individual firms and industries both by way of interviews with representatives in the Department and also visits on the spot to the industries themselves.  All these industries visited are not industries which have applied for and been granted adaptation grants, but most of them are, and I get weekly reports from the Industrial Reorganisation Branch on the results of inquiries and consultations with these firms.  I cannot say that I could put these reports in the form of a submission for publication&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 2, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A grant may be made under section 4 of the Undeveloped Areas (Amendment) Act, 1963, in respect of an enlargement or adaptation that is of the kind referred to in that section and is approved by An Foras Tionscal after the 31st day of March, 1965, and before the 31st day of March, 1966, and a grant may be made under section 4 of the Industrial Grants (Amendment) Act, 1963, in respect of an enlargement or adaptation that is of the kind referred to in that section and is approved by An Foras Tionscal after the 31st day of March, 1965, and before the 31st day of March, 1966, and, accordingly, `31st day of March, 1966' is hereby substituted for `31st day of March, 1965' in each place where it occurs in subsection (5) of those sections.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill which was circulated during the Recess was, of course, drafted before the imposition of the British 15 per cent surcharge.  The purpose of the amendment is to give legislative effect to one of the measures announced by the Government to overcome the effects of the surcharge.  The law as it stands under the 1963 Industrial Grants Act provides that adaptation grants&mdash; these are special grants designed to ensure that Irish industry can be made more competitive to face free trade conditions&mdash;would cease to apply as from 31st March, 1965.  As a result of the special difficulties now being created by the British surcharge for certain exporting firms, and in case some firms might feel doubtful about proceeding with adaptation measures, it is intended to extend the period of the operation of the special grants by another year, that is to 31st March, 1966.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 2, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where, as a result of the imposition of the special charge on certain goods imported into Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man on or after the 27th day of October, 1964, any exceptional difficulty occurs in relation to the sale by an industrial undertaking of its products outside the State, a grant towards the cost of meeting that difficulty may be made under section 4 of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1963, or section 4 of the Industrial Grants (Amendment) Act, 1963, as may be appropriate having regard to the location of the undertaking, as if such cost were the cost of an enlargement or adaptation of the kind in respect of which grants may be made under those sections.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I envisaged this amendment in my Second Reading speech introducing the Bill.  Again, the same remarks apply. The Bill was introduced and circulated before the necessity for what is contained in this amendment appeared. In my opening statement on Second Reading, I referred to the necessity of introducing amendments to the Bill to give effect to the Government decision in relation to the assistance to be given to exporting industries in view of the British surcharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be cases in which the assistance which exporters may obtain by way of Market Development Grants in accordance with the Supplementary Estimate recently voted by the Dáil will not be sufficient to supplement the best efforts of the firms concerned to minimise their particular problem.  To deal with those cases of exceptional difficulty in which even the maximum assistance available under the Market <Col N="663" /> Development Grants scheme will still not enable an industry to maintain its export activities and its workers in employment, it is proposed to extend the scheme of adaptation grants.  Those are the type of grants to which I referred in relation to the previous amendment.</P>
    <P>The provision will be applied only in the exceptional circumstances and any applications for this form of assistance will be subject to a most searching examination before any decision is taken by An Foras Tionscal. I cannot now give the House any precise definition of the difficulties which would warrant the grant of the maximum assistance available under the different measures announced on 11th November.  If I may take an example, I should like to refer Deputies to the statement made by the Taoiseach on that occasion that the scheme of adaptation grants would be extended to provide help to industries, and new industries were mentioned in particular, to meet the cost of any re-designing of their products to fit them for alternative markets, or to cover any exceptional marketing problems arising for these industries, or to help them to effect changes in their production which would enable them not only to maintain their export trade but also to continue their efforts to raise the level of their activities and improve the employment possibilities in their industries.</P>
    <P>We must proceed on the basis that this temporary burden which, through no fault of their own, has fallen on our industries at a time when they were in the mid-stream of adapting themselves to conditions of freer trade, will not be allowed to slow up this process. On the contrary, we must do what lies in our power to encourage our industrialists and their workers to redouble their efforts now, so that they may emerge from this temporary difficulty with even brighter prospects than before of achieving the export target set for them in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>

      <P>This amendment, as the Minister said, is introduced to <Col N="664" /> offset in so far as possible the effect of the recent levy, and it is to be hoped that it will enable adequate assistance to be rendered to those firms and exporters who may be adversely affected by the levy in the future.  There is, however, another aspect of this matter which I wish to mention at this stage, and which has been referred to briefly in the House by means of a reply to a Parliamentary question.  It is another effect of the measures taken by the British Government in October last and is involved as part of the changes made when the levy was introduced.</P>
      <P>Under the double taxation agreement which this country has with Britain, and which I think was negotiated as far back as 1926, Irish people who have shares in British companies are not liable for double income tax. In other words, they are entitled to repayment of income tax from the British Revenue authorities and are, of course, liable for income tax here. This levy is a serious interference with their trading rights.  It is a serious breach of a bilateral trading agreement. If international agreements are to be respected for what they are they should be honoured.  The levy which is in operation interferes with and derogates from the double income tax agreement as well as the 1938 and the 1948 trade agreements.</P>
      <P>As I understand the effect of the changes that were made, the double income tax relief will not operate in respect of the increase in corporation profits tax which results from the measures taken by the British Government in October.  This will affect Irish shareholders in British companies.  I wonder can the Minister say at this stage whether any information has been received from the British Government as to their attitude on this matter. It is generally recognised that British exporters have a valuable market in this country and that the British Government should not take action which would prejudice their position or cast doubts upon the <i>bona fides</i> of the British in trade matters generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country has, over a long period of time, even prior to any of the agreements that I have referred to, been a <Col N="665" /> good customer.  The advantage which British exporters have had of having a valuable ready market for a wide variety of goods here has certainly been understood and appreciated by exporters in Britain.  It is true to say that so far as this country is concerned our exporters and manufacturers have also benefited but I think, on balance, the weight of advantages certainly has not been excessive so far as British manufacturers and exporters are concerned. The continuance of that position is to the mutual advantage of both countries.  I should like to know whether the British Government have yet indicated what the position of Irish holders of shares in British companies will be.  If they have not so indicated I should like to urge the Minister and the Government to make the strongest representations on this aspect of the British levy, which is, as I have said, a breach of a long standing and mutually advantageous agreement as distinct from the breach which it is of the trade agreements to which reference has been made.</P>

      <P>Is there any sort of limit to which the Minister is prepared to go?  I do not think any limit is proposed in the amendment.  It has been said that it would take a figure of £7 million to offset the 15 per cent surcharge in terms of actual cash.  In respect of industry and the value of its export trade is it possible that the Minister will go to 16 per cent, 17 per cent or above that, or has he laid down the yardstick, so to speak, that he will go to 15 per cent in relation to the value of the exports of any particular industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The total surcharge is 15 per cent.  The scheme, as announced, provides for a payment, where necessary, of 50 per cent of the surcharge.  That would automatically be 7½ per cent.  In effect, we have indicated to firms: &ldquo;You need not expect 50 per cent willy-nilly.  We can <Col N="667" /> give you a certain sum and between that and the 50 per cent, if you prove you are still suffering in any way we will be able to meet you up to the 50 per cent.&rdquo;  The maximum is 50 per cent and, as in the case of industrial grants, it will be difficult to get that maximum amount without very good evidence that it is needed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 2, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  A person who, for the purpose of obtaining in respect of an industrial undertaking a grant payable by virtue of section of this Act, knowingly makes a false statement or false representation either verbally or in writing or knowingly conceals any material fact shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £100 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both the fine and the imprisonment or, on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where an offence under this section which has been committed by a body corporate is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate, or any person purporting to act in any such capacity, he as well as the body corporate shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a penalty clause.  It is the first time such a clause has been introduced into industrial grants legislation.  It was with some reluctance that I decided to introduce this amendment.  However, I have been forced to include it, because of the greater flexibility which the amendment which has just been passed by the House provides.  There <Col N="668" /> is also a duty on me, for the protection of Foras Tionscal, to ensure that no fraudulent attempt will be made by a manufacturer to take advantage of the special grants now being made available under the previous amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is quite a reasonable proposal.  It should be obvious to everyone, but particularly to those concerned with it, that the decision which the Dáil and the Government have taken to offset, so far as it is possible by measures which we can take, the effect of the levy, is a contribution by the community to assist manufacturers and traders to keep their business going and also to maintain employment.  It is, to that extent, a community effort to assist a section of the community.  I feel there is every justification for the inclusion of the penalty clause, which is proposed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Cosgrave has said in regard to this matter.  When the 15 per cent surcharge was imposed by the British Government the Government decided to offset it by making certain moneys available.  Nobody, at this stage, expects the Government to say how this money is to be got, whether it is by direct or indirect taxation.  I believe a penalty should be imposed on anybody who attempts to get money, in relation to these grants, by fraudulent means.  The taxpayer is making sacrifices to produce this £7 million and if some smart industrialist produces false evidence to obtain a grant, he should be jailed or heavily fined</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned last week, I was dealing, to the best of my ability, with what I thought was the futility of the action proposed in this Bill.  I pointed out that I thought the simple publication of a formula on a packet merely pointing out that the contents consisted of certain deleterious matter would not make sense to people who tried to sell a product and, at the same time, point out that it should not be bought. This is a matter, if and when it reaches serious proportions and it is proven beyond a doubt that it is definitely and seriously harmful, in respect of which it should be the duty of the Minister responsible and the House generally at the time, to take whatever might be regarded as suitable action. For that reason, I do not think that, whatever good may have inspired the introduction of this Private Bill, it does not go any distance towards serving any useful purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of excess in regard to indulgence in any habit is entirely a question of where harm sets in.  One might say a bottle of intoxicating liquor should have the contents billed publicly on the label and the public warned that it is harmful, as it definitely is if indulged in to excess, but that does not conform to any reasonable laws of commercial advertising or salesmanship, and it would hardly be fair, to my mind, to ask people to put a product on the market and, at the same time, advertise that it is dangerous while yet offered for sale to the public.  It is a question of weighing <Col N="670" /> up whether this most unusual step would be justified in face of the amount of evidence available as to whether or not mild indulgence in cigarettes is really serious or harmful.  I do not think that, in moderation, smoking can be seriously harmful.</P>
    <P>I am a pipe smoker myself.  We all know the very consoling effect a smoke can have on one at such a time as when the debate has to be adjourned in this House: one can go outside and have a smoke.  It has a soothing effect on the whole mental system and one feels much more inclined to be placid afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There must have been quite a fog of smoke this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully, no doubt, resorted to the same soporific treatment when he went out today.</P>
      <P>Seriously speaking, what the Bill proposes is, in the first instance, not of any magnitude in so far as curbing any serious ill-effect which smoking may have is concerned.  Secondly, it is much too great a step to take in view of the fact that it is not likely to have any beneficial effect.  On the whole, even if my own Minister and the whole Government were in agreement with a proposal of that type, I doubt, personally, whether I could see any useful purpose being served by it.  There are things one might do that could possibly be helpful but, at this stage, it is sufficient to make known that the whole effect of smoking, with regard to this serious disease, is kept under review, as everybody knows it is.  I do not think there is a single member of the public at the present time who is not aware of all that has been said, tried and discussed.  We are left in a position to weigh up the indecision, if you like, with regard to the whole question of whether cigarette smoking is seriously contributing to cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not, on that score, even in a free vote of the House be prepared to vote in favour of Deputy Dr. Browne's proposals in this Bill.  It is a harmless Bill, possibly brought in with the best of intentions.  One is not called on to <Col N="671" /> condemn it out of hand, in so far as it seeks to do something beneficial to health.  What it seeks to do is a matter of grave confusion and, as I do not wish to hold up the House, I want to say in conclusion that, in putting a product on the market, one cannot simply say: &ldquo;We will commend you to use this but we want to tell you it will do you harm.&rdquo;  One can apply this to many things which are sold, certainly any luxury products.  It is not just the commercial stamp of salesmanship on the selling of any product. Anything we do in respect of curbing the smoking habit should be something definite and done only at a time when it is absolutely established that smoking to excess is harmful, and that it is absolutely essential to take that step.</P>
    <P>We all seem to be agreed that smoking to excess can be quite harmful. I do not think that what is proposed in the Bill would in any way lead to moderation in cigarette smoking.  For that reason, I regard the Bill as futile in so far as there is any attempt made to curb the excessive use of cigarettes and to bring to the notice of the public the fact that excessive cigarette smoking may be harmful. The Minister could, at a future stage, take steps of a less serious nature which would be more beneficial and, for that reason, I do not think the Bill is a suitable one at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I, as a member of the Labour Party, want to assure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach that none of us had any need to soothe our nerves after the adjournment this afternoon.  The necessity, no doubt, was there for members of other Parties in the House but we did not need to resort to anything like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill introduced by Deputy Dr. Browne has been attacked by people from various parts of the House, and particularly by the Minister for Health. The Bill was not attacked because of what it contains but for hundreds of different things which are not in the Bill.  I was amazed at people coming in here talking about this Bill as if it provided that nobody should be <Col N="672" /> allowed to smoke cigarettes in this country in future.  Of course, it did not suggest any such thing.  What it did suggest was that some attempt should be made to point out to people who were smoking cigarettes that some of the contents of cigarettes could cause them serious health difficulties.  Cancer has been referred to again and again but apparently it is now becoming very obvious that various types of heart trouble can arise from smoking and, as we all know, heart trouble is the real killer at the moment in this country and in some other countries. It is now becoming fairly obvious that smoking does help to cause deaths from heart trouble.</P>
    <P>If I interpret correctly what Deputy Dr. Browne said when introducing the Bill, he tried to point out, and in my opinion did so effectively, that an effort should be made not so much to cure the hardened cigarette smoker who has made up his mind that he will smoke cigarettes and hang the consequences as to try to induce young people not to start smoking at all, if possible, or certainly not to start smoking to excess. We believe that if the Bill does nothing else but bring to the notice of the Government and of the people, but particularly of the Government, that something like this is necessary then it will to a certain extent have achieved its objective.  I was very interested to hear the Minister for Health refer to discussions which had taken place between the tobacco manufacturers and officials of the Department&mdash;since, I presume, the Bill was introduced.  He says that efforts are being made to try at least to bring to the notice of young people that they should not be influenced by the types of advertisements which we see, particularly on television. As was pointed out here by some people earlier, it would appear that if anybody wants to enjoy himself then, according to the television advertisements, he must be a smoker.  While a particular brand is usually referred to, all the advertisements in turn assert that their brand adds to the enjoyment. The Minister said, in effect, that Deputy Dr. Browne and those who support him are a modern type of <Col N="673" /> killjoy.  I think that was a most unfair statement.  Like a number of people who have spoken here, I am not a smoker.  Therefore, I feel that when the Minister refers to those who do not favour smoking to excess as killjoys he refers to me as well as to everybody else in the country who is a non-smoker.  It is rather a stupid statement. It is akin to a statement that somebody going to a dance must be half drunk before he can enjoy himself. I do not follow the Minister's reasoning at all.</P>
    <P>This Bill simply suggests that, by Ministerial order, certain information should be put on the cigarette packet. Now, the silliest argument by the Minister against this Bill was that it would not be possible to get everything necessary to describe some of the harmful substances on to the packet of cigarettes.  I do not think the Minister has recently looked at a packet because, if he does, he can find the most extraordinary list of various things thereon&mdash;and there seems to be plenty of room for more.</P>
    <P>If the necessity arises and if the Government decide to accept the Bill, I suggest that there is plenty of room on the cigarette packet for what Deputy Dr. Browne suggested should be put on it.  Further than that, if the Bill is passed and becomes law, then, before the Minister may make an order, it would be necessary to lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas. If somebody disagreed with the order, a resolution could be put before the Houses of the Oireachtas asking that the order made by the Minister be annulled.  I think that is the greatest possible safeguard there could be. If there were any danger of the matter being rushed through, of the Minister &mdash;any particular Minister&mdash;making an order about something that most people thought should not go on a cigarette packet, then the order could be annulled simply by laying it on the Table of the House and having the matter decided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The whole kernel of this Bill is that there should be on the packet some notification as to the type of material <Col N="674" /> which is contained in the cigarettes and which is harmful if they are smoked to excess.  The Minister for Health spoke at length on two evenings here in an effort to prove that it is a shocking thing to suggest that something like that should be done.  Those of us who travel around the country know that at the present time a lot of people are prepared to spend very much more money than they possibly should and in many cases more money than they can afford on cigarettes.  Young people, particularly, feel that they are doing a manly thing if they start to smoke and that is encouraged by advertisements of various kinds, particularly by television advertisements.</P>
    <P>Surely it is not too much to ask that the very same thing be done in respect of cigarettes as is done with certain products of a poisonous nature which are bought in chemist shops, namely, a notice to that effect? It will not stop people who need them from buying them.  Surely there should be put on the packet of cigarettes some type of information showing that they are not something which will improve the enjoyment of health and that in fact if smoked to excess they can cause serious health ailments?</P>
    <P>Again, I was surprised to hear the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach suggest, as is usually suggested by the advertisements, that when people are under a strain or stress they gain a certain amount of solace from smoking cigarettes.  It is an admission which people should not be too quick to make.  If we have to depend on a cigarette to soothe our nerves then we should see a psychiatrist as soon as possible because there would appear to be something going a little bit wrong with the nervous system.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested also that this is the only suggestion ever made that certain things should be marked as being likely to cause danger or to cause trouble.  One or two speakers referred to the freedom of the individual and suggested that we are attempting to prevent the individual from having freedom to buy anything he wants or has the money to buy.  Again, that is rather a stupid argument.  We all know <Col N="675" /> that there are hundreds of things in this country which some people would like to buy but which they are not allowed to buy because it is considered by the powers that be that it is not in the best interests of the individuals that they be allowed to buy those items freely.  Yet because it is suggested in this Bill that something like that should be done about cigarette smoking, it is alleged it will impinge on the freedom of the individual.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe that if the Bill passes&mdash;and a free vote of the House is the easiest way of ascertaining whether or not the majority of Deputies are in favour of it&mdash;it can do a lot of good by preventing youngsters from being fooled by the type of television and newspaper advertising against which the Bill is aimed.  If it does not pass, then the arguments, particularly those made by Deputy Dr. Browne in his introduction of the Bill, are strong enough to bring to the notice of the general public that there is a danger in excessive smoking of cigarrettes, that no matter what the vested interests may say, the evidence is that smoking to excess causes certain diseases and that it would be in the best interests of the people in general not to smoke as many cigarettes as they have been doing.</P>
    <P>The only other point I wish to make is that when the Bill is being voted on, we should vote on what is in the Bill and not on what some people have been trying to say is in the Bill: we should vote on whether or not certain information should be set out on cigarette packets about cigarettes and not, as the Minister for Health has said, on whether people should or should not be allowed to smoke cigarettes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister for Health has treated the Bill in the way he has treated it.  Very rarely does one find Deputy MacEntee approaching practically any problem or subject on its merits.  It seems to me he is quite incapable of discussing an issue in reasonable terms, that the only thing he can do is discuss the individual who has introduced a measure. <Col N="676" /> That seems to me to be a terribly immature approach to the democratic idea of politics.</P>
      <P>If his point of view on this Bill is a contrary point of view, it seems to me the Minister should have put that contrary point of view.  The Minister suggested that there appeared to be some reason to believe that because this Bill is a Private Member's measure, it is an independent production&mdash;that I, in some way, wanted to show my independence from the Labour Party, my isolation from it, some imminent division from the Labour Party.  It does give one a sort of window into the Minister's mind, into his inability to conceive of an organisation which could hold fundamentally identical views but which, on an issue of not fundamental import, could differ and allow each other to differ.</P>
      <P>The Minister, who spoke so much about the freedom of the individual and of my alleged assault on that freedom, appears to be the kind of authoritarian, fascist person who resents very much the fact that an individual might be given freedom to introduce a Bill with which the Party with which he is associated might not agree.  It is, of course, a measure of the maturity of the Labour Party that they could allow me to bring this Bill into the Dáil and have it debated here on its merits, even if they accept no responsibility for it whatsoever, as being something in which I had an interest and an enthusiasm and that I have a right to exercise that interest and that enthusiasm. That seems a basic principle of democratic practice and is a sign of the maturity of the Party which permitted it.</P>

    <P>In fact the Private Members' Business before the introduction of this measure was another Bill by another member of the Labour Party, Deputy Seán Dunne, about the Georgian houses, and nobody who discussed that measure, on either side of the House, suggested that because Deputy Dunne felt strongly on that issue and demonstrated his feelings through the medium of a Bill, he was in that way signalling his independence of and division from the Labour Party.  It was <Col N="677" /> accepted as a perfectly reasonable device of Parliament, one of the best signs that we do believe in the democratic idea.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health is one of the loudest critics of the communist system, in which the Party line is absolutely asserted dogmatically and anybody who defects from it is immediately expelled from the Party.  Obviously, one of the things which a person dislikes very much is that the Minister for Health does not put his ideas into practice.  He insists on the necessity that everybody shall always toe the Party line, even in matters which are not of fundamental importance: the Party line must always be sacrosanct and must never be defected from by anybody, in any circumstances, even if it concerns a relatively simple principle.  Obviously, he has all the autocratic and dictatorial facets of the fascist and communist systems. The Minister took some time dealing with my political record here and, in effect, I think I can fairly summarise his assessment of me as being some kind of political prostitute.</P>

      <P>I think that is a fair assessment of the opinion he expressed about me.  Deputy Dillon was not here at the time so I shall read part of what he said.  He said I pursued my wayward way with the promiscuity of a young Hollywood star who enters upon a fervid association to advance her career and when advantage has been gained, disowns the relationship.  It is not the first time this sort of vulgar abuse has been used by Deputy MacEntee about me.  At other times, the Minister has used much the same kind of vulgarisms: once I was an out-of-work doctor touting for patients because I was attempting to do something about tuberculosis which the then Minister for Health had so seriously neglected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all old-fashioned and completely out of keeping with this House, with what we should like to see in the standards of this House.  Sometimes, that generation&mdash;Deputy MacEntee is <Col N="678" /> one of the few still with us of that generation &mdash; should be rather more thoughtful, more understanding and rather more cautious in its attacks on us, in its attacks on our defects.  It should be more in keeping with postwar politics here in Ireland, because whatever we have ever done, whatever attitude we have taken up, whatever disagreements we have ever had, or on whatever occasions we have decided to dissociate ourselves from our comrades as former colleagues, we have always done it&mdash;at least I have&mdash;in a civilised way: dissociation or resignation on a point of principle&mdash;and leave it at that. That is more than can be said for Deputy MacEntee or his colleagues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spent the whole of his time misrepresenting my attitude and my behaviour in public life and went on to misrepresent the contents of the Bill.  The origins of this Bill go back to 1957/58, when I asked the Minister some questions and I made the suggestion then which I made again in the Bill.  The Minister's reply at the time was that he had no power to interfere with tobacco advertisements and I suggested that he should take it.  I repeated the suggestion on a number of occasions and eventually the Minister invited me to introduce this Bill.  Therefore, if this Bill is all the things the Minister says it is, he must accept that responsibility because it is on his invitation that it is now before the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister in referring to this Bill used many silly and untrue descriptions. He referred to a &ldquo;diabolical apparatus&rdquo; and such childish phrases. The Bill is a permissive one.  It merely allows the Minister&mdash;the Minister cannot have read it&mdash;in certain circumstances to take certain action.  Section 2 of the Bill says:</P>
      <P>The Minister may from time to time, when it appears to him to be in the public interest so to do, make regulations in regard to all or any of the following matters, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) requiring that, if any tobacco or tobacco products are sold or offered for sale ... and in the opinion of the Minister contain substances likely to cause injury to health, the deleterious nature and origin of the substances as may be specified in the regulations shall appear on the label or the container in which the tobacco or tobacco products are sold or offered for sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly there could be nothing more reasonable and nothing more innocent of compulsion than that simple statement empowering the Minister, when <Col N="680" /> he thinks it is in the public interest to do so, to take certain action, the certain action being to specify on the container that these cigarettes may cause lung cancer because they contain carcinogens.  That is the only proposal in the Bill, and as any reasonable person will accept it is far wide of the suggestion that I intended to put a death's head on the package, or intended to tyrannise the individual into doing something he did not want to do.  The fact that the packet did contain that information was merely intended to remind the individual that &ldquo;if you smoke these cigarettes, they may cause lung cancer; if you still decide to go on smoking cigarettes that is your affair; you are taking the decision and are still free to smoke 100,000 cigarettes if you wish, three times a day, if that could possibly or physically be done&rdquo;.  So there is no compulsion on anybody to withhold from doing something and this is merely to remind people that cigarettes may cause lung cancer.</P>
    <P>That proposal has already been put into effect in a number of countries with a number of variations.  As we know, the American Surgeon General proposes to try to introduce a similar device for the sake of the American cigarette smoker.  To call that a killjoy seems to me to be an extraordinary misrepresentation of what is contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The rest of the Minister's misleading statements succeeded in misleading practically all the Deputies on his side who spoke.  Deputy Meaney and Deputy Brennan both spoke about prohibiting the adult from doing something he wished to do.  There is no such prohibition in the Bill and if they had read it, they would have found that out.  As I have already pointed out, there are powers under existing legislation, under the 1947 Health Act, the Minister's own Health Act, under which the Minister can insist that precisely these provisions are observed in regard to a number of different kinds of preparations, medical preparations, toilet preparations and other types of consumer goods which are <Col N="681" /> displayed in shops for sale.  That is in an Act introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said there was no comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister introduced these excellent provisions for precisely the same reasons as I have introduced these, in the interests of public health and for no other reason. There could be no other justification. At present, as we all know, the weight of advertising propaganda is universally on the side of the cigarette manufacturing companies.  It is they who have access to the television, newspapers, and so on.  In my view, by suppressing the truth, by suppressing this fact which is agreed between all of us that cigarettes may cause lung cancer, they mislead the public and will continue to mislead the public unless some action is taken by the Minister.</P>
      <P>There are two actions which could be taken.  One is the complete prohibition of advertisements.  I have not suggested that.  But there is a perfectly good case for the prohibition of advertisements in cases of that kind. As I said earlier, it is not permitted to advertise any of the other addictive drugs such as cocaine, opium, hashish, and so on.  I do not see any reason why those precedents should not be followed in regard to cigarettes.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health makes the point that there is a difference between cigarette smoking and these other addictions to which I referred.  His point is that because these other addictions have some element of moral turpitude&mdash;I am not terribly clear what he means by that&mdash;in their effects, one is permitted to take all the actions which the Minister does take in regard to them.  The Minister criticises me for relating cigarette smoking to these other forms of drug addiction and suggests it is somehow unfair or misleading of me to relate cigarette smoking to other forms of drug addiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is in the difficult position of, on the one hand, trying to treat this place as a college historical society <Col N="682" /> in which he scores debating points. Irrespective of the impact these things will have on the uninitiated, so long as he can score a debating point, he feels he has achieved something. On the other hand, he is in the position of having the responsible job of being Minister for Health.  In his capacity as a youngster in a college debating society, he says I should not relate drug addiction to cigarette smoking. In his capacity as Minister for Health in his little booklet <i>Starting to Smoke,</i> he has this to say: &ldquo;They will tell you&rdquo;&mdash;the grown-up&mdash;&ldquo;that ... smoking, like any other drug habit, becomes very hard to give up.&rdquo;  So, in fact, the Minister shares my view that cigarette smoking is a form of addiction.  He feels it necessary that action of a prohibitive kind be taken in regard to hashish and so on but that no significant action be taken in regard to cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>One of the extraordinary facilities the Minister has is his capacity to believe anything he says&mdash;his Alice in Wonderland touch.  He made a prolonged attack on my suggestion by saying that one should not take action in regard to this question of cigarette smoking because it would be an interference with the freedom of the individual and something which could not be justified on the basis of the evidence available to us.  Anybody who reads the papers will realise that one of the most authoritarian and hardly well-founded actions taken by any of us probably since the State was formed is the action recently taken by the Minister in regard to putting fluoride into the drinking water.  The case there is very much less convincing and compelling on the merits than the case by various people in regard to the dangers of cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>There are many countries who believe the contrary to what the Minister believes.  There are many authorities in this country who believe completely contrary to what the Minister believes. My own belief is that what he should do is bring in a proper dental service. Leaving that aside, the Minister has taken the most dictatorial action, insisting that all of us, no matter what our views are on fluoridation, will <Col N="683" /> drink fluoridated water and that there is no alternative, no choice.  Under this Bill of mine, if you like you can smoke as many cigarettes as you wish for as long as you want to.</P>
    <P>This is the Minister who chooses to lecture me on taking arbitrary, dictatorial action against the rights of the individual's freedom.  Everybody in this country from now on, because the Minister has decided on what is not completely convincing evidence, will be forced to drink fluoridated water. There are a number of countries which, in fact, forbid the drinking of this kind of water, but that does not seem to worry the Minister.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is stuck for an argument with which to attack one, he simply manufactures such an argument. He made the point, quite wrongly, that I had made certain assertions about lung cancer and cigarette smoking.  I do not think that since I first raised this matter six years ago I have said at any time that I believe anything in regard to cigarette smoking.  I have very carefully tried to leave this matter as one upon which only competent judges can make a final assessment.  I have quoted various authorities.  I quoted the American Surgeon General's report, which was, of course, the summary of all the evidence available from all parts of the world, a most comprehensive, carefully thought out document, which came to the same conclusion as the document, also quoted by me, the College of Physicians' report.  The various other people I quoted&mdash;Dr. Flynn from Westmeath, Dr. Corridan from Cork, Dr. Mulcahy from Dublin&mdash;all of these were authorities who had investigated this problem from various sides and had come to certain conclusions.</P>
    <P>I invariably referred to their conclusions and did not give any statements on my own behalf, although I suppose because of my medical background I could have been permitted to give my own opinion of the matter. I did not do so.  Invariably I quoted the authorities of the various countries which have made evidence and <Col N="684" /> reports available.  It is on that scientific evidence that I have brought forward this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does give the impression that he holds very strong views about smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes; I hold very strong views, yes, but I am convinced by the evidence of other people.  I am trying to make the point that I am not saying that, because I as a doctor or as a pseudo-scientist believe it, that is a reason for doing it.  My point is that the Minister gave the impression that I believed that lung cancer and cigarette smoking were absolutely associated one with the other.  I want to say that the evidence on which I have made any assertion is the evidence of the various authorities throughout the world which I have quoted.  The Minister is completely wrong, therefore, in saying that I gave any personal opinion on this matter as an authoritative opinion which should influence the House.</P>
      <P>Another misleading suggestion which the Minister put forward was that I had implied in some way that only cigarette smokers got lung cancer or bronchitis or coronary heart failure. The Minister went on to show that he had figures to prove that people other than cigarette smokers got lung cancer and bronchitis and coronary heart disease.  Nobody ever contested that. It is simply putting up a skittle in order to knock it down again.  Nobody ever suggested that only cigarette smokers got lung cancer.</P>
      <P>The very fact that one quoted figures showing in the non-cigarette smokers a certain incidence of cancer, bronchitis or coronary heart failure and in the moderate smoker a certain incidence and in the heavy smoker a certain, higher, incidence shows that we were at all times clearly of the opinion that everybody can get cancer or these other diseases.  What we wanted to show was that in those who smoke moderately there is a rather higher incidence of these diseases and in those who smoke excessively an even higher rate still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> The Minister is completely wrong, and dangerously wrong, when he says that, in fact, non-smokers get these diseases equally.  That is not true.  They do not get these diseases&mdash;bronchitis, coronary heart failure and lung cancer &mdash;equally.  They get them in completely different proportions.  As I say, heavy smokers get them at a very much higher rate than moderate smokers and moderate smokers get them at a very much higher rate than non-smokers.  So, it is very misleading and the Minister in his responsible position should not make remarks of that kind, giving to people who might not know him the impression that he knew what he was talking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister for Health intended to give the impression that people who did not smoke were just as likely to get lung cancer as the others.  Perhaps the Deputy misinterpreted the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>At column 378 he said:</P>
      <P>... people who do not smoke at all are equally subject &mdash; the figures I have prove it &mdash; to all the diseases which the Deputy has referred to in order to intimidate the House....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he was using the word &ldquo;equally&rdquo; in a different sense perhaps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>When one is in the position that Deputy MacEntee is in as Minister for Health it is important that he speak with great caution on matters of this kind because that is to me a perfectly reasonable interpretation of his statement&mdash;a statement which he made here in the course of a debate when he was not under any pressure. It seems to me to be an attempt to mislead the public and it is something which he should not do because, certainly, it is not a true statement of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that were true, it would destroy completely our case against cigarette smoking.  If it were true that everybody gets these diseases equally there could <Col N="686" /> be no case for us asking that the tobacco companies be asked in some way to tell the public that in smoking cigarettes they are running grave risks of getting these diseases.</P>
    <P>The Minister, again, in his completely outrageous misrepresentation of the case made by me, implied that I wanted to go to the lengths which they went to in the United States of America in imposing total prohibition. I do not think it is possible to prohibit the use of cigarettes at all.  I do not think it would be effective.  It certainly was never effective in schools.  If we are to believe Dr. Flynn and Dr. Corridan, children smoke all the time. So it would be absurd to expect that prohibition would be an effective measure.</P>
    <P>I believe that if every time he takes out a packet of cigarettes the individual is reminded that cigarettes may cause lung cancer, or these other diseases, he will have the advantage that we, as doctors, have of being fully conscious of the great dangers associated with cigarette smoking.  It is, I suppose, a great help to some of us who see people who have contracted lung cancer, possibly as a result of heavy smoking, in cutting out smoking, because it is a dreadful experience to see someone suffocating after being subjected to some of these dreadful operations that have to be performed.</P>
    <P>I confess I am very frightened of the idea of lung cancer and I think this fear of lung cancer is one of the reasons why so many doctors have given up this practice of cigarette smoking.  It is just as hard for us as for others.  I personally was a heavy smoker and I found it very difficult to give it up.  Contrary to what the Minister for Health says, that I did not like smoking, I did like smoking very much but because of the likelihood of lung cancer developing, because it struck me as being such a stupid thing to expose oneself unnecessarily to the chance of getting this disease, I decided it was worth the effort to give it up.</P>
    <P>The doctor is in a better position to <Col N="687" /> judge than the ordinary person and it is for that reason I felt it would be a help to put the ordinary person into a comparable position, to give him the assistance we have, of seeing somebody dying of the disease, in the course of our profession.  The Minister suggested that I thought cigarette smoking is the sole cause of lung cancer.  I did not suggest that at all.  How could one suggest that when it is a fact that non-smokers get lung cancer?  It seems to me that the Minister really goes outside the reasonable bounds of the rules of debate when he, at a loss for reasoned criticism or argument, manufactures statements which the person against whom he is debating never made at all.  I did not suggest that cigarette smoking is the sole cause of lung cancer.  However, I do not think that anybody seriously doubts that it is a cause.</P>
    <P>One of the Minister's extraordinary achievements is his production of this literature&mdash;this small amount of literature&mdash;in which he goes to some trouble to explain to young people the dangers of getting lung cancer from smoking.  In this leaflet, which appears to be directed towards adults &mdash;there is an adult on the front of it&mdash; he gives most of the statements which were made by me in trying to convince the House of the necessity for some sort of control over cigarette advertising. It is he who makes these remarks in regard to lung cancer: there is a higher death rate in smokers than in non-smokers; a higher death rate in heavy smokers than in light smokers; a higher death rate in cigarette smokers than in pipe smokers; a higher death rate in those who continued to smoke than in those who gave up smoking.  Four times the Minister mentions the word &ldquo;death&rdquo; there.  In his speech here the other night, he ridiculed me for using what he described as old-fashioned methods, the old-fashioned idea of trying to frighten people about death.</P>
    <P>That is an astonishing suggestion from the Minister.  Are we not all frightened of dying?  Are we not all reasonable people frightened of death? It came as a surprise to me that the <Col N="688" /> Minister would think it was old-fashioned to tell people: &ldquo;You may die if you carry out such a practice&rdquo;, in the hope they may decide: &ldquo;I do not want to die.&rdquo;  The reasonable animal response, even leaving aside the human being, is to escape from unnecessary avoidable death, and it is a very powerful argument when used to a person as a reason for taking any particular action.</P>
    <P>The use of the suggestion to people that: &ldquo;This may kill you; this may cause you to get a disease which will kill you&rdquo; seems to be perfectly reasonable and not the ridiculous suggestion which the Minister implied here the other night.  As I say, it is the fear of death from lung cancer which seems to dominate the Minister's leaflet in attempting to persuade people not to smoke or to desist from smoking. Fear of death is quite clearly the dominating motif of this leaflet and yet the Minister thought my suggestion about death and the likelihood of death was old-fashioned.  That he should think it was old-fashioned to use this fear of death as a device for trying to persuade people to desist from doing something runs completely counter to the whole basis of the present road safety campaign whereby the Minister for Local Government is attempting to make people drive safely so that they will not kill one another.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister gave very serious consideration to the speech he made the other night.  It contained so many contradictions and silly statements that it is difficult to believe it could have been made by a responsible Minister.  This Department of Health leaflet, the Minister's leaflet, contains this statement:</P>
    <P>The number of deaths from cancer of the lung has greatly increased within the past few decades; since 1950 alone the number of such deaths in this country has more than doubled.  Scientists and doctors have devoted a great deal of study to the cause of this and, recently, they have been considering whether it might be the result of tobacco smoking which has also increased greatly in recent decades.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> He then went on:</P>
    <P>... patients suffering from this disease were interviewed and their previous histories and habits as regards smoking and any other factor that might be of interest were compared with those of a group of patients without lung cancer.  The results of nineteen such enquiries in different countries (in Britain, the USA, Finland, Germany, Holland, Norway and Switzerland) have been published and they all agree in showing that there were more smokers, and fewer non-smokers, among the patients with lung cancer, and a steadily-rising death rate from lung cancer as the amount of smoking increases.</P>
    <P>I am portrayed by the Minister as a scaremonger who is trying to terrify the unfortunate public by the fear of death if they go on smoking cigarettes. This is a leaflet put out by the Department of Health with the Minister's full authority.  Who is the scaremonger? Who is the killjoy?  Who is the bare-bones who asks a cigarette smoker to read this kind of stuff?  They are perfectly true, perfectly legitimate, perfectly reasonable conclusions based on scientific truths.  Yet, when I quote precisely the same authority, arrive at precisely the same conclusions and make precisely the same suggestions as are contained in this leaflet, I am anathematised by the Minister with various bowdlerisms to which he resorts when he knows he has no useful constructive comment or criticism to make.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in the difficult position that he spends a certain amount of money&mdash;not half enough&mdash; trying to stop people smoking.  These leaflets are directed at youngsters; they are given to teachers and clerics with the one object and that is&mdash;whether he works hard enough at the job or not is another question&mdash;to stop people smoking, if not this generation, then the next or even the generation after that. The simple purpose is to stop youngsters and adults from smoking cigarettes. Why does he want to do that? Why should he destroy, as he will, if <Col N="690" /> he and other Ministers in similar positions throughout the world have their way, this great industry in the US and other countries?  Surely he is not doing it because of a whim or a sudden decision that he does not like tobacco men?  Surely he is doing it for the perfectly good reason that he is concerned for the public health, because he is convinced that cigarette smoking is a dangerous habit, that it causes lung cancer, and because he is effectively convinced of the evidence.</P>
    <P>He tried to go around it and dodge the evidence and suggest that the evidence was not quite as watertight as he would like it to be; that he is not absolutely satisfied and that there are certain questions that have not yet been answered.  Yet, in the face of these doubts, he tells us he intends to stop a whole generation of youngsters from getting what he thinks are the pleasures and enjoyments of smoking cigarettes.  Why should he do that? Surely it is an irresponsible act if he is not absolutely convinced of the necessity of doing so?  The fact is that he is convinced of this necessity and convinced of the case against cigarette smoking but he is in the position of having a colossal vested interest in the tobacco industry.  He has a tremendous amount of income, increasing year after year, and he is putting this financial interest, the moneyed interest, before his responsibilities to public health because he is not prepared to face the financial difficulties in which he would find himself if he brought this practice to a stop very much more quickly than he proposes.</P>
    <P>Yet, other countries with a greater sense of responsibility in the matter, other countries with the same vested interest in the tobacco industry from the revenue point of view, have decided to put what they feel is a matter of conscience above the economic needs of their societies.  As so frequently happens here, we preach one doctrine and practise another.  The Minister knows quite well that year after year as the cigarette smoking habit continues unabated&mdash;even worse, it is increasing each year&mdash;so will the number of unfortunate people going to St <Col N="691" /> Luke's and various cancer hospitals continue to increase because the Minister will not face his responsibilities as a Minister for Health who knows of these truths and is unwilling to act on them.</P>
    <P>In his own booklet, <i>Smoking And Health, A Summary of Surveys of the Evidence,</i> issued in March, 1964, it is stated that deaths from lung cancer went from a figure of 56 in 1925 to 298 in 1950 and to 697 in 1962.  So that 697 people died of lung cancer and a percentage of those died avoidably and unnecessarily because they had this smoking habit.  He also gives the figures of deaths from coronary heart disease and they have gone up concomitantly with smoking.  In 1950, the figure was 2,906; in 1962, it was 4,539, almost double.  The Minister knows quite well that he is conniving or continuing to connive at the sale of a commodity which contains a substance which is poisonous in so far as it contains carcinogens.  The Minister has suggested that the evidence is based on figures alone.  I do not know what the Minister would like, how he would like more proof, whether he would like those carcinogens injected into a human being so that we could have a human experiment to prove to his satisfaction that the injection or inhalation of these carcinogens is how an individual gets lung cancer.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that through a considerable amount of scientific and medical research it is possible to be absolutely certain, on the basis of statistical evidence from surveys carried out of various kinds currently and retrospectively, beyond all doubt of what happens in certain circumstances. I do not think there is any doubt whatever that the case in regard to lung cancer has been proved.  The extraordinary thing where the Minister is concerned is that he is so hesitant about accepting the evidence in regard to lung cancer because there is the uncertainty he complains about, while in regard to the fluoridation of water, he had no such hesitation at all, despite the fact that various eminent medical and scientific authorities in various parts of the world are convinced <Col N="692" /> of the damage that can result from putting fluoride in water.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any responsible group of scientific or medical authorities anywhere in the world who put forward seriously the suggestion that there is no relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer and all these other diseases.  I do not think anybody has put forward any serious case to controvert the relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.  One suggestion was put forward by the tobacco companies and, having spent a couple of millions, they eventually got a report, but I do not think anyone took it seriously.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister was asked a question by Deputy Noel Lemass about cigarette smoking.  Deputy Lemass asked whether the Minister had seen a report of a jury case in a Federal Court in the United States for damages against an American tobacco manufacturer.  The Minister replied he had seen the report.  The jury decided that cigarettes are reasonably safe and wholesome for human consumption and, in spite of that finding, the Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>...notwithstanding the finding of the American jury, I shall continue the campaign which I have initiated to discourage smoking, and to impress on children and adolescents, and on their parents and others who may be in a position to influence them, that, on the basis of statistical evidence gathered in a number of scientific investigations in different countries, the highest medical authorities are convinced that smoking is dangerous to health in that it may give rise to lung cancer, heart disease and other morbid conditions and should be discouraged.</P>
    <P>Were I Minister for Health one could imagine me giving an answer like that, with my views, and the strange thing is that the Minister spent the best part of an hour, or more, in this House attempting to discount the significance of the evidence put forward as a result of scientific investigations in different countries.  His whole case was that these investigations were <Col N="693" /> not convincing, that there was some element of doubt and, because of that, any suggestion, such as the suggestion I put forward, that people should be reminded in the simplest, plainest terms that cigarette smoking may cause lung cancer, was not well founded.  But he was quite precise in his answer to Deputy Noel Lemass that cigarette smoking may give rise to lung cancer.  That is all I was suggesting and because I made that suggestion the Minister spent the evening abusing, ridiculing and pillorying me.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in one of his most tortuous and evasive arguments, suggested that so long as tobacco is allowed to be smoked, it must be allowed to be sold and it must be allowed to be manufactured; and, if it is permitted to manufacture cigarettes, why make it illegal to advertise them?  When I first suggested that he should do something about advertising, he told me that he had no power to take any action, and I said that he could, of course, take power. That is what Parliament is for.  That is one of the great privileges of being in Government and being a Minister: one can look for power if one has not got it.  All this rigmarole: &ldquo;If it is permissible to manufacture cigarettes, then one must allow them to be sold&rdquo;, is completely irrelevant.</P>
    <P>If we decided that it was undesirable to sell cigarettes because of the danger to public health, because of the likelihood of many people becoming mortally ill as a result of smoking cigarettes, no matter what happens to tobacco in other countries and no matter how much tobacco is manufactured, there is no reason in the world why we should not take any decision we want to take here.  As we know, various noxious drugs of one kind or another are manufactured in various countries, including the ones I mentioned earlier, marijuana, hashish, opium, morphia, cocaine, and so on. They are manufactured in different countries, but that does not mean that they should be advertised here or sold here.  The Minister's argument is an extraordinary one.</P>

      <P>I am not prohibiting advertising but I am saying that cigarette packets should carry certain information.  I am doing that because I do not want to suggest the authoritarian action of stopping advertising altogether, although I can see a good case for doing it.  But I do not go that far, though I could make a good case for not allowing advertising, just as we do not allow advertising of the other drugs I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>The other suggestion I put forward was that we should launch out on a campaign comparable with the one just used by the tobacco companies in the newspapers and on the television and radio.  That, of course, would be an absurd waste of public money and, therefore, in the absence of a comparable campaign against the tobacco manufacturers, it seemed to me the simplest thing to do would be to make the manufacturers pay for our campaign in the interests of public health; in other words, make the manufacturers remind the public every time they sold their cigarettes that these cigarettes are dangerous and can cause various diseases.  I think that is a perfectly reasonable proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has accepted that cigarettes can cause disease and the very fact that the tobacco companies have accepted the Minister's invitation to devise some kind of code, an utterly futile code and one which will be utterly ineffective, I am certain, allegedly to stop youngsters smoking seems to me to imply that the manufacturers themselves accept the case against cigarette smoking.  They accept the evidence generally accepted around the world that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.  If they did not believe that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer it would be a serious infringement of their rights to make them carry out a campaign based on that belief.  If they had a leg to stand on and if they seriously believed their cigarettes were harmless, they would be the first to take the action, which, I understand, they are taking in the <Col N="695" /> United States, of questioning the whole proposal under the Constitution, emphasising the difference between the action proposed by the American Surgeon General and its likely effectiveness and the ineffectiveness of the action proposed by the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 2, section 3, between lines <Col N="696" /> 41 and 42, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>(2)  Section 11 of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited Act, 1959, shall not apply in relation to grants of the kind that may be made by virtue of this section.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the special grants legislation that we have just passed by way of amendment to industries established in the Shannon Free Airport Development area.  In section 11 of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited Act, 1959, it was provided that after the passing of that Act An Foras Tionscal would not make a grant in respect of the establishment, development or maintenance of an industrial undertaking at the Airport.  There is some doubt as to whether a grant of the kind provided for under this Bill could be made available in the Shannon Free Airport Development area by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.</P>
    <P>I think it is desirable that these special grants should be administered by the one authority.  It may be that there are industries within the Shannon Free Airport Development Area which would require the type of assistance we are providing in this Bill in the special circumstances of the British import surcharge.  The purpose of this amendment is, therefore, to extend this provision to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and An Foras Tionscal will be available to receive applications from industries in the Shannon Airport area for these special purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will remember that on Second Stage there was some discussion about the possibility of extensive take-over operations being conducted by outside companies or firms against firms established here.  Some concern was expressed that the method whereby firms might be acquired could lead to undesirable consequences.  When that was referred to, the Minister said the matter had been adverted to during the discussions of the Special Committee on the Companies Act, and that, if necessary, the Companies Act could be amended to deal with the problem if it arose, that it was more appropriate for inclusion within the framework of the Companies Act than in this measure.  I should like to know from the Minister whether he has since considered the matter further, and if there is any evidence or any information available to him which would suggest that there has been any acquisition by outside interests, acquisition to such an extent that it would be regarded as interfering with, or having consequences or possibilities which might interfere with the running or operating of concerns in the national interest or in accordance with what is agreed policy on these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we discussed the Bill here a fortnight ago on Second Stage, there have not been any take-overs of a kind which I would regard as endangering, in any way, our economy.  In fact, I have heard of no such take-overs of any magnitude at all.  There have been, in recent months, forms of new investment that might sever all take-over bids in relation to different forms of industrial and commercial activity in the country but these have in no way been a threat to the security of the industries involved.  On the contrary, they have increased the viability of these undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will, of course, to an extent, facilitate the greater injection <Col N="698" /> of capital into smaller industries.  This injection of capital would have been a deterrent under the Control of Manufactures Act, as it stood.  There are some companies whose capital holdings conform with the Control of Manufactures Act, that is, that the necessary percentage of non-Irish holdings is within the prescribed amount. It has been found in many cases these industries have been incapable of expansion because of the inability or the reluctance of some shareholders in these companies to inject further capital.  It is believed in many cases, if such further capital were available, it would not only be of advantage to the company but the market outlets which would follow would be to the great advantage of the particular undertaking and certainly to the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>The new Bill, the repeal of the Control of Manufacturers Act, is designed, to an extent, to facilitate this form of investment.  I can assure the Deputy I shall continue to keep this form of new capital injection under review to ensure that it will not take the form of interfering with the viability of the companies concerned which would be, in the long run, a detriment to our economy.  I have said, and the House is aware, that this will be a matter which will come within the ambit of our companies legislation and I can assure the House that this whole aspect of outside capital will be kept under close and constant review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is general agreement that the amendment of this measure is to attract and facilitate outside capital for the purpose of promoting industrial development and expansion. I have some particular cases in mind in which I think there is a distinction between new enterprises or enterprises which are established by means of external capital or partly by external capital and partly by finances provided by home resources.  There is also the case of the already established concern which may be open to acquisition as a result of this.  There would be objection in these particular cases if such should occur.  Naturally it is <Col N="699" /> a different matter if outside capital comes in for the first time.  We are anxious to encourage that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two cases of the type of firms to which Deputy Cosgrave has referred, of wholly established Irish firms who have engaged the interest of outside investors.  I know of one case of a particular industry located in a town in a rural area.  The proceedings have gone through a fairly complete stage.  I am satisfied in that case that this will be for the benefit of the industry itself and for those already employed in it, and will give, I believe, further scope for employment in the industry and in the area.  No cases have come to my notice in which there would be any detrimental effect on old-established industries where such new capital investment from outside sources is involved.  Again, I can assure Deputies that in all these cases I shall keep a close eye to ensure nothing is done to the detriment of our investments generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended speaking on this measure tonight, but while I was sitting here listening to the Minister on the Bill, I thought of what happened in the past.  My late father was a member of this House for over 30 years&mdash;I think it was nearer to 40 years.  He was a member of the House when Fianna Fáil took office in 1932. One of the first actions of Fianna Fáil, when they took over, was to introduce the Control of Manufactures Act, which we are now repealing.  I recall very strongly indeed the numerous occasions upon which my father spoke about this because he knew the effect of it in his constituency, which is now my constituency.  The effect of that Act was that Gallahers tobacco factory, East Wall Road, was closed down <Col N="700" /> within three months of the coming into operation of the first Control of Manufactures Act and 400 people were thrown out of employment.  That fine factory premises remained derelict for donkey's years until Fry Cadbury took them over.</P>
      <P>I rejoice at a Fianna Fáil Minister coming into Dáil Éireann and introducing a measure such as this, to repeal this first measure of theirs which they brought in during the days of the hairshirt economy when we were supposed to drink light beer and milk as a national beverage. Fianna Fáil are now learning sense. They have learned it the hard way and at the cost of much hardship for the plain people of Ireland.  It is a grand thing to see a reasonable person like the present Minister for Industry and Commerce coming in here and introducing this measure calculated to promote employment opportunities for our people and to facilitate the introduction of capital from abroad.</P>
      <P>I rejoice that that day has come and that the days of chauvinistic national economics&mdash;thank God, the British market is gone, that every industry be controlled only by sea-green incorruptible Gaels&mdash;have gone rapidly.  Fianna Fáil have learned sense and we on this side of the House rejoice in that development.</P>

      <P>I should like to direct on this occasion the personal attention of the Minister to one matter which I consider to be of very great importance.  I welcome any measure which is likely to give greater encouragement to industrialists and manufacturers to expand for the export market, and for the home market by providing additional employment in industry.  Industry contributes so generously to our pool of national employment that it is necessary that any progressive Government should always bear in mind the necessity of keeping under constant review legislation dealing with industrial activities in general, as this Bill does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attention of the Minister must already have been directed to a number of industries which in recent years <Col N="701" /> have been established in this country. They got substantial subsidies and financial accommodation of every possible sort.  We have old and long-established industries, which were commenced in this country without one penny of State aid.  In years past there was sufficient enterprise, and sufficient people were interested in Irish industry, and various groups of industrialists came together who, because of their faith in Irish industry, were prepared to put their own money into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to make a speech.  I just want to direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that he must always bear in mind those industries set up by private enterprise without any specific State aid whatever. Those industries may have difficulty in competing with industries recently established with practically 100 per cent State aid.  I should like to ask the Minister to keep in mind the woollen and worsted industry, particularly one in my constituency which was established without one single penny of State aid.  Great credit is due to the directors and everybody concerned, but they now find they may be in danger by the fact that they may have to compete with recently established industries set up with practically 100 per cent State aid.  I ask the Minister is it fair to have an industry with 100 per cent State aid competing with an old-established industry successfully set up without one penny piece from the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are industries which the Minister, I am sure, will always keep close to heart.  They are industries in which we have belief and which we are always anxious to help and safeguard. They are the woollen and worsted industries, particularly those giving good employment.  They have certainly given good results in the high quality of their products on the export market.  I have been approached by a number of industrialists who fear for their <Col N="702" /> future because of the competition by the new industries set up with practically 100 per cent State aid.  I ask the Minister to keep under constant review the circumstances of the industries that have been a credit to this country, a credit to their skilled workers, a credit to the management and a credit to the enterprising people who in the early days had such faith in Irish industry as to put their money into it, asking money from nobody. These people are worthy of the constant thought and consideration of any Government in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure Deputy Flanagan that there are few industries that have engaged the attention of my Department more than the woollen and worsted industry, and also that the woollen and worsted industry still enjoys the full measure of protection afforded by quota restriction. Furthermore, it is not the practice of An Foras Tionscal to give grants for the establishment of woollen and worsted industries to compete with the old-established Irish industries.  If grants of this nature were ever given, they were given on the basis of the output of the industry concerned.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Byrne, the only reason I reply to him is lest my silence implies that I agreed with the suggestion he made, that the control of manufactures legislation was wrong at the time it was passed.  I believe it was right and necessary in the context of the times.  Politics and economics are matters of evolution.  We found ourselves in the early Thirties with little or no industrial enterprise catering for the home market, much less the export markets, and it was necessary then to introduce the kind of protection, not only tariff protection but investment protection, that we had over all those years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might remind Deputy Byrne that his Party were in power for two periods of three years during which they could have repealed this legislation, if they so desired.  It is obvious that the Government of the day recognised that the time was not yet opportune for the repeal of this type of legislation.  The time is now opportune and I am glad <Col N="703" /> to see his Party recognise this.</P>
    <P>I may say in reference to Gallahers that no matter what caused Gallahers to close down their factory, not one cigarette less was smoked in the 26 Counties than would have been smoked if they had continued in operation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 48 and 49, to insert the following new subsection (in section 12):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" />&ldquo;( )  For the removal of doubt, it is hereby declared that an agistment, conacre or grazing letting is not a letting, subletting or subdivision within the meaning of this section&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to section 12. Deputy Sweetman and I have tabled it for the purpose of removal of doubt. We already have in the Bill quite a large number of sections which are included merely for the purpose of the removal of doubt.  In the course of the debates on the Bill, the Minister made reference to the removal of doubt in regard to sections 8, 9, 10, 19, 22 and 27.  I feel that, for the purpose of removal of doubt, it is most desirable that the amendment should be accepted by the Minister and I ask him in all sincerity to do so.</P>
    <P>This amendment has been tabled on the understanding that the intention of the main Opposition Party on the Report Stage, and indeed on the Committee Stage of this Bill, is to endeavour to improve it.  Our efforts on the Report Stage to improve this Bill are justified by the high degree of commonsense and intelligence in our amendments.</P>
    <P>In rural Ireland, there are large numbers of landowners, big and small, who set land on the conacre system. When we are tidying up land legislation and putting through a Land Bill, we should remove doubts from the minds of landowners, particularly in relation to this section, and that is the reason for this amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already said that this section and this Land Bill in general have no bearing whatever in regard to the usual conacre lettings &mdash;the 11 months lettings, the grazing letting or the aftergrass letting with which we are all so familiar down the country.  Many Deputies have given guarantees of this kind to those interested in conacre lettings.  Whilst we give them this guarantee, we have the guarantee from the Minister. However, in the event of legal proceedings at a later stage, there is nothing in this Bill which gives security to the person who conacres his land.</P>
    <P>This is a very important matter for the many types of people who must <Col N="705" /> conacre their land.  It is important for the cottage tenants, the small-holders who must take the land on the conacre system in order to supplement their small holdings.  There are many instances of the cottage tenant who already has an accommodation plot from the Land Commission who frequently attends a conacre auction to supplement his accommodation plot with, say, three, five or six acres of tillage, a number of acres for grazing, or perhaps he may turn up at a meadow sale or may successfully purchase aftergrass over the three months period.</P>
    <P>Landowners who set their lands on a temporary basis have been given an assurance by the Minister but we want that assurance written into this Bill for the removal of doubt.  When the Minister stands up in this House and gives us the assurance that the ordinary conacre lettings are excluded from the terms of this Bill, what harm will it be&mdash;since, on numerous occasions, he made reference to the removal of doubt on various sections&mdash;to remove all doubt on this section?</P>
    <P>In addition to recommendations from the National Farmers Association and other farming organisations, one of the principal recommendations that came to the Minister from the Irish Auctioneers and Estate Agents Association in relation to conacre lettings was that it should be written into this Bill that such lettings are not covered by the relevant section.  In order to improve this Bill, the Minister would make a very good start on the Report Stage, if he accepted this amendment.</P>
    <P>There are many landowners who, due to financial circumstances, must set their lands annually.  It is common knowledge that when a farmer dies, leaving a widow and a young family, the widow usually sets the land for a number of years until such time as her children grow up and are able to manage the farm.  The Minister has assured us that the powers of the Land Commission to inspect under section 27, will not be put into effect in such cases but it is only right that that should be written into the Bill.  It is a very reasonable request.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> We did not table this amendment without giving the matter very serious thought.  A good deal of anxiety, worry and misunderstanding exists among landowners whose land must be set on the usual short-term temporary convenience basis.  Nobody has a greater knowledge of the conditions and domestic affairs of such people than the local auctioneers or estate agents. That is why the auctioneers, through their organisation, have made this very strong plea to the Minister to have written into the Bill a provision excluding such lettings.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably tell us there is no need to write it into the Bill.  My reply to that is that in the event of proceedings being taken in any of our courts, it will be useless for an aggrieved party to stand up and tell the judge that the Minister for Lands had told the Dáil such lettings would be exempted.  The learned judge will be concerned only with what is written into the Act, not with what the Minister said.  Neither will he be concerned with the statements of Deputies.  It will be his job, and rightly so, to deal with the law as it has been written.</P>
    <P>All we ask is that the doubt be cleared up, that the matter be made clear for the learned gentlemen on the benches in the event of such cases arising.  The Minister should in all fairness, as he did in other sections of this Bill, write into this section that temporary grazing and conacre lettings are exempted from the terms of the section.  If he does that, I, for one, will express my appreciation.  Even if it does not seem necessary, what harm will it do?  This is one section where it seems most desirable to clear up any doubt that exists.  The plea we are making is fair and reasonable and the Minister should accept it in a spirit of friendliness and co-operation.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does what we ask in this amendment, I can assure him it will be a big step towards fostering co-operation and common understanding in this House.  Those who must set their land in conacre or grazing lettings <Col N="707" /> need this guarantee of security.  They must be given to understand that such lettings will in no way interfere with their rights to continue to set their lands on the 11-month system.  Numerous conacre people throughout the country are extremely worried and this amendment in my name and Deputy Sweetman's is an attempt to allay that anxiety and that fear.  I, therefore, make a serious plea to the Minister to accept the amendment which is aimed at improving the section.</P>

      <P>I had some kind of faith in Deputy Oliver Flanagan until he came to discuss the auctioneers. Now I submit that if we accept this amendment we shall be defeating the whole purpose of the Land Bill, which is to make land available for the purpose of division.  The Minister has already met the point made by Deputy Flanagan and there is no need for the Deputy to make a case for those who set their land.  There is now no need for any farmer to set his land either as grazing or conacre.  The man who sets his land in that way does so at the expense of the small farmer who so badly needs land.  Such a man does nothing, employs no labour.</P>
      <P>As I have said, there is no need for this amendment.  The Land Bill was introduced for the purpose of providing land for division among small-holders and if this amendment is accepted that purpose will be defeated. People set their land only because they do not want to work it.  I do not think the Labour Party will be anxious to support the amendment because such men do not employ any labour.  The people who work their land are being and have been catered for by Parliament down the years.  I agree with the Minister that you cannot leave the section open as suggested by Deputy Flanagan.  I was not surprised to hear that the auctioneers are so susceptible. Of course, when a man is in that position he may lose part of his work in the setting of land.  I submit that the Minister must get this Bill through without the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister has stated that for years the principle has been and will continue to be accepted that this type of letting will not be interfered with.  If he is prepared to stand over it, we will be satisfied.  While it is true that there may be some big farmers who are setting their land and do not want to work it and we believe it is right to take the land off them and give it to others who will work it, it would be most unfair if people who have to set their land because of family circumstances, and until the family are in a position to work it, were interfered with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point.  Perhaps, I did not understand what Deputy Fanning meant.  As far as I know, the small farmer and the landless man take conacre and work it and may make a living from it.  There are many in my own constituency who cannot get land and who are able to take conacre and live on it.  Naturally, when the owner starts to use the land it is <Col N="709" /> no longer available for that type of man and if the Land Commission take over all the land that becomes available, then the small farmer and the landless man will be left without any means of livelihood at all.  The Minister has again assured the House that this type of letting is not to be considered by the Land Commission and, while Ministers may change, a ministerial statement here must hold good in the years to come, no matter who is Minister for Lands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a question of a ministerial statement; this is a question of law.  Since the very earliest times, away back before 1860, prior to the Decies Act, there was this traditional system of conacre lettings and lettings for temporary convenience. Under the Decies Act, under the Gladstone Act and under every single Act passed by this House there was never any question of it being suggested by anybody that conacre lettings were within the Land Acts.  On an earlier stage of this Bill I put on the records of this House several judicial decisions going back at least to 1881 in which the different judges in dealing with contentions of this kind held that, where the circumstances showed it was a conacre letting or a letting of temporary convenience, it was completely outside the Land Acts.  I do not want to go over all the matters on this particular proposal that I put on the records on Committee Stage.  I am not surprised that Deputy Fanning was confused because that was Deputy Flanagan's purpose in putting down this amendment.  This amendment was put down for one purpose and one purpose only, to create fear outside this House, to terrorise the people, to terrorise the poor widow into believing that she could not let her land for 11 months in her circumstances because he alleges and tries to create the idea outside the House that conacre lettings and lettings of temporary convenience are controlled under this Bill.  That was the sole purpose of the Deputy's previous amendment and of this amendment also and so long as the Deputy thinks he will get people outside <Col N="710" /> to fall for this he will try to create this smokescreen.</P>
      <P>This, as I said, is not a question of ministerial assurances or statements.  It is a question of the law of the land that has been in existence since the first Land Acts were passed.  Indeed, long before the establishment of Dáil Éireann, in every Land Act passed here, including the 1923 Act, it was not thought necessary, for instance, by the then Government to write into it, as Deputy Flanagan said, to remove doubts that conacre lettings were outside that Act.  It was not thought necessary in all the Acts from 1923 up to the 1950 Land Act, which was passed by the Deputy's Government, to write in for the removal of doubts that conacre lettings should be specifically excluded from the Land Acts.</P>
      <P>The fact is that there is no doubt in this case.  There never was a doubt. The only doubt is that created, and deliberately created, by the legal men on the opposite side, although they do not come in and argue it like Deputy Flanagan.  They want to create it in the minds of unsuspecting people outside who will believe them.  The people who fell for the doubts deliberately created by Deputy Flanagan on this issue have now been reassured.  Certainly the recent deputation of the NFA, when the legal position was explained to them, were perfectly satisfied.  The legal position is what I have stated it to be and, consequently, I ask the House to reject this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinMedler" hpid="Mr. Medlar Mr. Medlar">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Medlar</NameTxt>
      <P>This section can be looked at from various points of view. It is a rather intricate question.  Deputy Tully made a point with which I agree entirely.  Deputy Flanagan wants a free for all in so far as land letting is concerned. We can put those people into two categories.  There is one type of person who through no fault of his own, through family circumstances, is compelled to set his land.  There is another type of person who sets it and earns a very good livelihood by setting it systematically, that is, setting it for cereals, for root crops or for corn.  He can continue that year after year and <Col N="711" /> he can prove to the Land Commission that the farm is being used according to the rules of good husbandry.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, we have the conacre man who is earning his livelihood and rearing a family by that system of farming and who may be, over the years, paying an average of £20 per acre for that land.  Should the Land Commission acquire it you will be depriving that man of his means of livelihood.  I may be departing from the section when I say this, but a great many of the people I have in mind may live more than a mile from the estate and may have been taking it for more than 30 years.  If the Land Commission acquire it they do not qualify for allotments because of the distance. It is very difficult to know how you can meet the desires of every section, of the conacre people and the people setting the land.  The position differs in various counties and our first consideration should be for the uneconomic holder, or, if you like, the landless man who is earning his livelihood and dozens of whom are in my constituency, fully mechanised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am again grateful to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his protection in this matter. Deputy Seán Flanagan's intervention is for the purpose of creating confusion. As Deputy Medlar said, it is no offence for a person to conacre his land in rotation.  The conacring of root and grain crops in rotation is the usual practice of these people, who must, of necessity, resort to temporary conacre lettings.  What the Minister says is true: temporary conacre lettings are excluded from the provisions of the Bill.  If the Minister is prepared to give the House that guarantee, what harm is there in writing it into the Bill?</P>
      <P>Again, the purpose of writing it in is the removal of doubt.  There are many smallholders, who, because of family circumstances, must resort to temporary conacre lettings.  There is nothing in the Bill as it stands to indicate that those people will not come under the cold, dead hand of the Land Commission, particularly in view of the powers the Minister is getting under section 27. I feel Deputy Sweetman and I are justified in asking the House to accept this amendment.  Deputy Fanning and Deputy Medlar appear to be concerned about the people who must, of necessity, set their land either in grazing or tillage on the conacre system.  These two Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party are both practical farmers, who realise the inconvenience it will be for those people who must set their lands for temporary convenience.  In many cases those lands are extremely well worked by the person who takes them on the conacre system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear I do not in any way subscribe to the idea of Deputy Fanning that the intention of this amendment is to encourage conacre lettings on a large scale.  That is not the intention.  What we propose to do is to see it written into the law so as to safeguard those people who must resort for the time being to having their lands set in conacre.  If there is large-scale letting of land, either for tillage or grazing, and if the owner cannot establish a good case for <Col N="714" /> conacring the lands, I have no doubt the Land Commission have power to examine the merits of the case in which such a farmer is doing so.  In 99 cases out of 100, the person who sets his lands on the 11 months system is doing so as a matter of necessity.</P>
    <P>In all conacre and temporary convenience lettings, there is a proviso inserted in the conditions of sale that the lands must be well nourished and kept in good heart.  For that reason, I cannot see the argument of the two Deputies from the Government Party that the lands will run out and will eventually become neglected, if continued letting is allowed.  Under the conacre letting system, the land must be manured and cared for and the crops must be sown on a rotational basis.</P>
    <P>With particular reference to sections 8, 9, 10, 19, 22, and 27, the Minister went to great lengths to explain why certain sections were included for the removal of doubt.  Here is an amendment submitted by Deputy Sweetman and myself, again, for the removal of doubt, and the Minister is not prepared to consider it favourably.</P>
    <P>I would again appeal to the Minister seriously to consider writing this amendment for the removal of doubt into the Bill.  I am convinced that it would add considerably to the peace of mind of persons who, for the time being, must resort to temporary conacre lettings of their land until such time as family circumstances improve, for instance, until such time as a widow's family are sufficiently adult to take over the holding and to work it.</P>
    <P>There are numerous holdings which at the present time people are compelled to let in conacre.  In the case of minors, where the father and mother are dead and the lands are in the hands of a reliable solicitor and auctioneer, the lands are let annually and the proceeds are credited to the minors concerned.  There are many cases where such lettings must continue to be made.</P>
    <P>When this Bill is enacted, there will be a considerable amount of justifiable fear, having regard to the terms of section 22.  In my view, amendment <Col N="715" /> No. 2 is a most desirable amendment designed to remove all doubt from the mind of everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that there is an understanding that all such lettings are exempt from the terms of this Bill.  I accept the Minister's assurance most sincerely on that but again I would ask the Minister to have that written into the Bill so that his assurance may go further than this <Col N="716" /> House.  In the event of legal proceedings as a result of a conacre letting on the 11 months system, the learned judge disposing of the case would be concerned not with what the Minister thought or the personal guarantees which the Minister had given the House, but with what is written into the law.  It would be his function to administer that law.  It is for that reason I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Yes.  These amendments are brought in to meet the wishes of the House and outside bodies as expressed in the discussion on this section on Committee Stage.  On Committee Stage, I indicated that I was inclined to accept the argument that the prohibition on dealings for a period of 12 months after the service of notice of inspection was perhaps too severe and that a lesser period might serve the purpose well enough. It seemed to me that although the bulk of cases might be dealt with inside three months, it would be necessary to hold out for a period of up to six months in cases of difficulty or delay.</P>
      <P>This matter was also discussed at some length with a deputation which came to me from the Council of the National Farmers Association.  On balance I have concluded that there ought to be a normal control period lasting only for three months from the service of the inspection notice.  To cope with special difficulties, however, I am satisfied that there should be provision for extension by a further three months, making a total of six months, if required.  To avoid delay, the first decision has to be left to the Senior Inspector.  The decision to extend the control period can be given to the Lay Commissioners.  This is what the amendment does.  This is a fair practical compromise.  It goes a great deal of the way to meet the opposing views expressed on this section.</P>
      <P>The effect of these two amendments is that, normally, the freezing period will be three months but in cases of special difficulty the Lay Commissioners may issue a notice controlling or freezing the land for a further period of three months, making in all a period of six months.</P>

      <P>This deals with the point on which, I think, there should be no disagreement. Several Deputies thought that sporting rights should be regarded as abandoned if they were not exercised for 12 years.  This suggestion accords rather well with certain provisions in the recent Registration of Titles Act which was passed by the House this year and I am adopting the new period rather than adhering to the original period of 20 years as proposed.  That would conform to the new statutory period under the Registration of Titles Act.  The view had been expressed in this House and by some outside bodies that 20 years was too long.  I think the 12 year period should be accepted to meet the wishes of the House.</P>

      <P>I think it right to direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that we submitted the case we had to make in this regard to a wider tribunal, a cross-section of our people, in the Parliamentary by-election and I do not think the Minister himself will deny, nor will any of his colleagues attempt to deny, that they eagerly accepted that challenge in the country, arguing their case with all the emphasis and influence they were in a position to bring to bear and that the verdict in East Galway went against them.  I want to make this clear: the amendment we now submit is not the amendment that we shall ultimately make in this law.

The Minister, who, I feel, finds discussion on any part of this section uncomfortable, intervenes to call the attention of the Ceann Comhairle to the fact that we are discussing the amendment. I want to explain why we shall not divide on this amendment.  It is because we think it is a miserable thing, not even second best, but second worst.  The worst proposal is that of the Minister.  This is merely a final effort in some measure to mitigate the fundamental evil that underlies the powers the Minister claims in section 27.</P>

We sought to put an end to the power of eviction and section 27 seeks to give the initiative of taking steps towards that to the Minister of Lands for the time being.  Our amendment seeks to place a restriction on that power so that he shall not be allowed to use it without being in a position to satisfy the High Court that there has been delinquency on the part of the Land Commission.

I want to notify the House that when the time of decision comes, we will not divide because we will not, by implication, say that this power, subject to any limitation, is a power the Minister for Lands should have.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had looked at the picture to which I have referred, he would see there what appeared today to be a reference to ancient history.  But it was not.  It was the reproduction of a contemporary portrait of what was passing in Ireland in 1880.  It represented a man and his wife, and two children, evicted, with nowhere to go, and the case I want to make to the House is that it was a reproduction of that picture on every road in Ireland that drove our people into the Land War.  For what end?  To take irrevocably from everybody, from every individual who could have an interest, the power to evict a man's neighbour.</P>
      <P>We found ourselves in the position that we had not only a policy of obligation to protect the security of tenure of those who got their living on the land but we had also the obligation of ending the system under which it was possible for an individual with an interest to put a tenant farmer on the side of the road.  Now that dilemma of serving the major purpose of defending security of tenure, while achieving contemporaneously the end of landlordism in Ireland, we resolved by the creation of the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mark you, that is a solution which is the envy of the world.  I have been asked in Paris; I have been asked in Bonn; I have been asked in Brussels; and I have been asked in Washington: how did we solve the problem of land tenure?  How did we preserve the sense of security of the people on the land, while, at the same time, claiming in one night, as we did in the Hogan Land Act of 1923, to change the ownership of practically all the untenanted land of Ireland?  I told them that we had the grabbers to deal with, that we had all the rotten elements in <Col N="724" /> our society to deal with, but that we devised a plan which took the grabber by the throat and which took the landlord by the throat, but preserved the security of tenure of the tenant on the land.</P>
    <P>How did we do it?  We created a new instrument of executive responsibility, an instrument that had never been devised before, and we invested its members with a security of tenure analogous to that we confer on a judge. Why?  Because we were resolved that no interested party would ever again have the power to evict a farmer in this country.  But there are many kinds of interests in a free democracy, such as ours, to which one must have regard if one is planning in so vital a matter as fixity of tenure on the land. There was the interest of the landlord in his land.  There was the interest of the agent in the docility of the tenant. There was the interest of the bailiff who preferred to have a subservient and terror-stricken tenant to deal with rather than an independent man.  We struck from the hands of all these interested parties the right to put anyone on the side of the road.  There was the interest of the grabber, always lurking like a hyena on the heels of the tiger of landlordism, hoping to pick up the scraps.</P>
    <P>We erected, when we took over responsibility for all the land of Ireland, a body that would be free of the new interest, because there did emerge a new interest.  I know that interest, the interest of the unscrupulous politician who goes down the country and says: &ldquo;My vote is worth its weight in gold.  There is land for division and I am going to see it is going to be taken from Patrick Costello and divided among the people who keep my vote worth its weight in gold.&rdquo; I have had my own constituents come to me and ask me to come down to a meeting to settle the distribution of an estate in County Monaghan.  I have been told that my political rivals in Monaghan have held their meeting.  I have told my supporters, with a clear conscience, that &ldquo;I have no more power to control the distribution of land than has the Emperor of China.  The distribution of that land, the decision whether it will <Col N="725" /> be acquired or not, the decision whether it will be examined for acquisition or not, lies in the hands of the Land Commission and, even though I am now Minister for Agriculture, there is not a Land Commissioner sitting in the Land Commission who is not entitled to tell me to get out of his room and, even if I were moved to vengeance against him, I am as powerless to touch him as I would be to touch the Chief Justice.&rdquo;  But there are a great many simple people who believe the reverse, and I do not deny that I came in for harsh criticism on that from my own supporters; I would not do as much for them as those contending with me were prepared to do for their supporters.  In the long run, I believe it is best to tell the truth.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the House this question now.  If this section passes without the amendment we now propose, is there any Fianna Fáil Deputy who can with a clear conscience say to his supporters: &ldquo;I am not in a position to influence the decision as to whether your neighbour's land is to be inspected for acquisition.&rdquo;  I want to say that unless this detestable power, vested in the Minister by section 27, is at least this far diminished&mdash;we are sitting at present in a House with a minority Government, and there is not a single day of our sitting in which this Government may not depend for its survival on one vote; every camp follower they have may be depending for his living on one vote&mdash;it becomes possible for any camp follower or any member of the Fianna Fáil Party to find himself in his constituency faced by a constituent who says to him: &ldquo;We think that man's land should be inspected for acquisition.  We do not care what you think.  We will judge the weight you carry in our Party by whether that land is in fact inspected, because if you are as big a man as you let on to be, you ought to be able to go to the Minister's office and tell him you demand that the farm shall be inspected for the purpose of acquisition, whatever the ultimate decision of the Land Commissioners may be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not have to make any apology <Col N="726" /> to the Ceann Comhairle personally, or to most members of the House who understand what life in rural Ireland means, but there may be people who feel that the history behind me, my long association with this problem, influences my mind, and there may be people who feel that the picture I have painted arouses some atavistic memories that are not characteristic of the generations of people who people the land today.  They are wrong.  The sentiments I am expressing now are not peculiar to me, and they are not peculiar to the unsophisticated people living on the small holdings.</P>
    <P>I want to bring in evidence the testimony of some of the most experienced ex-Land Commissioners in this country.  I want to emphasise again that I have not felt it proper or seemly even to address an inquiry to any existing members of the Land Commission, but I have deemed it to be my duty to discuss this and cognate matters with many men who have served the Land Commission and the old Congested Districts Board in the past, with high distinction.  I want to call to the attention of the House as clearly as I can, by reference to this copious note I hold in my hand, the virtually unanimous view of every Commissioner who served the Land Commission in the past.</P>

      <P>We are fighting for a very fundamental principle, that the Minister for Lands for the time being shall not direct an inspection of any man's land so long as the Land Commission are there functioning as they should function.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The case made by the Minister is that the only purpose in transferring this reserved power from the Land Commission to himself is to avoid delay.  Our case has consistently been that they defend the proposition on the grounds of the merest expediency, and we attack it on grounds which we are sure go to the heart of a most fundamental principle in which we most passionately believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" /> I want to offer to the House the testimony of the experienced men who served the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board in regard to this narrow issue of expedition in the handling of matters of this kind. I challenge it on principle, and I shall never yield on principle.  The Minister defends it on the grounds of expedition. I will ask him to yield on a matter which is for him one of expedition and one of principle to me.  I join with him on this amendment on the issue of expedition and I call in evidence the combined wisdom of those whom I have consulted, who have detailed knowledge of the working of the Land Commission.  My best recollection of the substance of their advice is this: Every stage in the proceedings to acquire a man's land from him from beginning to end should be outside any suggestion that the Minister or the staff under him has had any hand in it.  Any Ministerial act in this matter could cause panic in the country.  Once the Irish Land Commission inspector is seen on a man's land, there is fear and trembling and undoubted anxiety in that man's mind until the position is finalised.</P>

      <P>The excuse for it is to stop delay in the acquisition procedure, the inference being that such delay is caused by red tape in the Commissioner's office.  This is a very ancient wheeze.  The truth is that the one place there is, or has been, no delay is in the Commissioner's office, the reason being that many years ago when that complaint was first made the Commissioner determined to clear the decks as speedily as possible and to keep them cleared.  There is some delay here and there and that is due to the inadequate number of outdoor inspectors. The remedy, and it is one we <Col N="730" /> would help the Minister in, is to appoint more outdoor inspectors and to tighten up the outdoor fabric of the Land Commission by appointing, as there used to be, a few senior inspectors at headquarters to make customary visits to areas where the work is falling into arrears, to find out locally what is wrong and push it along.  If this Ministerial power of inspecting land is passed in its present form it will not make, in five years or in ten years, the slightest improvement or difference in the real cause of such delay as may exist.</P>
      <P>This is not sentiment; this is not illusion.  This is my own intimate knowledge having spent the greater part of 40 years living amongst these people, my people.  I cannot deny that there may be in this a certain atavistic sentiment.  I know my great grandfather was an evicted tenant.  That feeling was passed on from one generation in my family to another.  I can remember, as a child, one particular surname in that area in which I lived. It was anathema to me and it was not until I was in my 30s that I knew the reason for this.  That name was never mentioned in my house.  An old man told me that that man's family had grabbed my great grandfather's land. His association with that act had long been forgotten but the family was remembered as somebody we despised. I had forgotten why we despised them but they were grabbers.  I remember a field near home on which I never walked because it was grabber's land. It all came from this deep-rooted sentiment. The man who lived and got his living on the land should be independent and should be free.  There is not a historian in this country who will not tell you that the whole struggle for the national freedom of this country was founded on victory over the landlord. Every rebellion failed and every effort that this country made for freedom for seven centuries collapsed until we had established the people secure in their ownership of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were good landlords in Ireland and let us not forget that.  The folly of our present situation is that we seek to confuse this position on the ground that the Minister for Lands is <Col N="731" /> a good man.  If that defence were valid we would never have fought for the land code.  I knew landlords who reduced themselves to penury for that. I knew landlords who gave away everything they had and wound up poorer than the tenants on their own land.  It is hard to believe but that is so.  They mortgaged their estates to feed the hungry amongst their own tenants.  I knew the agony of mind that it caused many leaders of the Land League that these people should be assailed.  I know the agonising judgment they made that the system was capable of such abuses. It had to give good and bad.  I make for the moment no individual indictment of this Minister for Lands.  I say in respect of any Minister for Lands, to whatever party he belongs and whenever he may come, no Minister for Lands should have the power in section 27, and if he had, and for the time being, since it is Committee Stage of this Bill he has got that power, then we must hedge it around to restore the situation to the limit of our ability.</P>
    <P>I take the Minister at his word.  He says: &ldquo;All I want is expedition; all I want is to be sure that if the red tape of the Land Commission holds up acquisition, I have power under this amendment, and that is all it says&rdquo;. Because it says no more than that, I despise this amendment.  It is no permanent or satisfactory solution.  I pledge this Party unreservedly to wipe this section off the board.  It is not in my power to meet the Minister on his own ground and say to him: &ldquo;Very well; I still retain my point of view that here is involved a matter of fundamental principle; you seek simply greater expedition; very well, take it on that basis; all I ask you now to say is that before you use this power, you will have to show that the process of land acquisition for the relief of congestion, or other purposes of the Irish Land Commission, is being hindered by delay in the offices of the Irish Land Commission&rdquo;.  Once you have determined that and placed it on record where it can be challenged, an aggrieved party can go to the land judge and say: &ldquo;There has been no <Col N="732" /> delay; this is a capricious act on the part of the Minister for Lands&rdquo; and the judge on hearing the evidence may say: &ldquo;No, I hold the Minister for Lands is entitled to plead in this particular case that there was undue delay and, therefore, he had freedom, despite the amendment, to act under the powers conferred on him under section 27&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Is there any reasonable Deputy here, who accepts the Minister's case holus-bolus, who could have the slightest hesitation in accepting our amendment? I ask any honest Deputy: if the Minister is irrevocably opposed to that amendment, what other explanation is available than that he fears impartial arbitration on the simple question?  So his decision to direct inspection for acquisition is the capricious decision of a hardpressed politician, or was it the prudent course of administrative delay on the part of the Irish Land Commissioners in the acquisition of land for the essential purposes described in the Land Act.  I am certain that the purposes behind this section are wrong and bad.</P>
    <P>I think it is manifest to the House that the angry rejection of our amendment by the Minister is in itself evidence that my worst suspicions are proved true.  I am as convinced as that I am standing here that there are Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party who are as much opposed to section 27 as I am.  There does come for all of us a moment of truth.  I am a Party man and I believe in political Parties and am quite prepared to assume that members of the Fianna Fáil Party who shared my doubts and apprehensions regarding section 27, hearing the Minister say: &ldquo;No other purpose is being served by this section but expedition&rdquo; believed him and said: &ldquo;Well, doubts that were stirring in our minds are illfounded and the Minister is right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is an amendment which gives him the power to direct inspection for acquisition if there is undue delay. Here is an amendment which exactly reproduces what the Minister says he wants the section for.  Here is an amendment moved by a Party that <Col N="733" /> assure the Minister and the Government that this is a matter about which they feel most deeply, sufficiently deeply to take the risk of going into one of the most congested areas in Ireland and fighting an election on this very issue, leaving themselves open to the charge that was widely made that the Fine Gael Party were opposed to the acquisition of land for the relief of congestion.  I never feared people would believe that, but we took the risk.  If we felt so deeply about it and if we offer the Minister now a means of retaining this detestable power, subject to this moderate limitation, I ask Fianna Fáil Deputies who have had doubts, are their doubts revived? Why does he refuse this provision?  If it is only to remove the danger of expedition, he has that power still with this amendment.  What other explanation can there be if this amendment is rejected but that he never wants it put to the test?</P>
    <P>The Minister in regard to certain other amendments has found a ready understanding on this side of the House.  Do not let us forget that since this Bill came before us it has been subject to 48 or 49 Ministerial amendments. Let Deputies ask themselves why, if nothing more is here involved than a mere trifling administration problem, we here, the principal Opposition in Dáil Éireann, should concern ourselves about it to the extent we have?  Why should Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party, or any Party, who have heard the consensus of opinion of every retired Land Commissioner in this country doubt that there must be some substance in the case we make?</P>
    <P>We persuaded a number of supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party in the recent by-election to share our view by their secret vote.  It takes more courage, I admit, to stand up as the culprit and perhaps I am unduly optimistic. We hope that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who share our views may have the moral courage to do that now.  It would be a stimulant to the public life of Ireland if there were found a few of them who would say of this proposal on the Land Bill what many of their colleagues have <Col N="734" /> been bold enough to say about the Succession Bill: &ldquo;It is so bad that we could not vote for it&rdquo;, and the Bill dropped dead.</P>
    <P>If three or four Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party who know that we are right in this regard would take example by their braver colleagues who spoke and were prepared to act in regard to the Succession Bill, we could get this amendment inserted in the Land Bill.  It would be a vast improvement on a loathsome proposal but it would provide some reassurance for those of us who hate this mortal blow to fixity of tenure in Ireland and it would show that on all sides of the House there are still men and women who understand what their fathers and grandfathers meant when they gave their lives and their homes in the defence of free sale, fair rent and, above all, fixity of tenure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has evoked a great deal of emotion in the long speech he has made on this amendment.  As well as evoking the history of his family, he has appealed to this side of the House to show moral courage with regard to this section.  I, also, am the great-grandson of a tenant who was evicted from a farm in South Galway.  Unfortunately, my family had rather less fortune than the last speaker's in subsequent years and suffered rather more brutally in the process and those who eventually struggled back on to the land did so in poor and wretched circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, no less than Deputy Dillon, understand the love of people for the soil. I, no less than Deputy Dillon, have reason so to understand.  But what seems to be forgotten here, and was certainly forgotten by the Fine Gael Party in their by-election campaign in Galway&mdash;Deputy Dillon is right, without any doubt&mdash;is that Deputy Dillon and his supporters persuaded many hundreds of people who had previously voted for Fianna Fáil to vote against them in the secrecy of the ballot; that we were using the most pestilential instrument in the history of political blackmail in Ireland; that we were land grabbers; that we were bringing Ireland back one hundred years to the <Col N="735" /> time when the farmer no longer had security of tenure&mdash;as if the farmer is any longer a tenant in Ireland, for he is not; as if fair rent had anything to do with the Ireland of to-day, for it has not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I let the Deputy speak for three-quarters of a hour without interruption: let me speak now. I listened to every word he uttered.  Let me tell Deputy Dillon that it is not once but many a time that I have shown in this House that I am no moral coward.  I would not be afraid, if I thought the Deputy and his Party were right, to stand up against my own: I was not afraid to do so before.  I shall not ever be afraid to do what I know to be right.</P>
      <P>I accuse the Fine Gael Party in this House, through all Stages of this Bill and in East Galway throughout the by-election recently past, of using the worst form of political blackmail to try to badger people into the belief &mdash;and Deputy Dillon dragged the Succession Bill into this as well&mdash; that we were trying to take the land of Ireland from the owners of Ireland and that we were coming like moonlighters in the dark to emulate the land grabbers of one hundred years ago.  I do not accept that this is so and I will repeat what I said on the Second Reading of this Bill, is maith an scéalaí an aimsir, time will tell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know what happens in County Mayo.  I know what has happened and it has happened now in the county of Galway.  The day that some Minister exercises this power in any of the ways suggested by Fine Gael to be an abuse, I shall no longer have anything to do with the Minister or the further exercise of that power. Every day of the week, there are advertisements in every paper in the west of Ireland of farms for sale by private treaty or by auction.  There is congestion in the area.  Everybody knows that there is congestion there when there are people living in squalid rural slums.  They are not too far away from that many of us who reside in the west of Ireland.  These people <Col N="736" /> come to the local county councillor or the local Deputy and ask him to get in touch with the Land Commission. Months pass by and nothing happens.  The next thing is that the auction takes place.  The land is sold and these poor people are left there to fester on.</P>
    <P>One would imagine from the discussions that have been held here and from the emotional speeches that we have heard that the Land Commission in its entirety was being abolished by Section 27; that, when the little power that is being given by this section is being used, the farmer will no longer have any right of appeal, that he will not have the Land Court to go to; that these Commissioners, whose independence of the Minister has been so eloquently described by Deputy Dillon, will no longer be sitting up in Merrion Street or down in Castlebar&mdash;but they will.  If the owner exercises his right of objection, and it is valid and if, by any chance, the Minister's machinery were to operate where it should not, the Land Commissioners, whose judicial capacity is not interfered with, will come along and say: &ldquo;Oh, no, this man's land cannot be acquired whether for relief of congestion or otherwise&rdquo;. The Deputy painted a picture earlier of himself as a person who always tells the truth and of the menial Fianna Fáil TD who pretends he is a divider of land on the hearthstone. Indeed neither Deputy Dillon nor anybody else in this House has a monopoly of the desire to tell the truth and nobody has the right to point to anybody in Fianna Fáil, or Labour, or in Fine Gael and say he is the sort of person who pretends he can divide land.  Anybody who does that is dishonest; anybody who pretends to his constituents that he has any power over the Land Commission in the divison of land is not telling the truth. I wonder would Deputy Dillon and Deputy O. J. Flanagan have the courtesy not to carry on a conversation? I do not propose to continue until they cease.</P>

      <P>I have never suggested to anybody that I have any power over the division of land and this section when it is passed will not alter that position in the slightest.  It is being suggested that as a result of this Bill, if it is enacted, members of the reigning Government Party supporting the Minister will be able in future to promise land to their supporters, in return for their votes at election time.  It is a poor suggestion, it is also an illogical one because it presupposes again that the structure of the Land Commission in regard to the procedure on acquisition is going to be changed.  When the previous speaker mentioned the Minister using the power of inspection and acquisition, he was speaking about something which <Col N="738" /> is not in the section and is not referred to either in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Deputy to give way to me?  I can assure him I never said that.  I emphasised that the only power covered by section 27 is the power to direct inspection for the purpose of acquisition.  I never said that the Minister sought power to determine land acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I was reading from notes which may have been taken down too quickly. However, it is important to emphasise and to re-emphasise, for the benefit of the people who have been previously misled by Fine Gael propaganda, that the acquisition procedure of the Land Commission remains the same, thereby protecting the security of the farmer and preserving it in so far as it exists now.  Long before today and ever since the first Land Commission was set in operation, there was a <i>de facto</i> limit to the security of every farm in the State. There was the limit imposed by the obligations under these statutes from time to time which gave the Land Commission power to acquire land for the relief of congestion and to acquire land elsewhere under slightly less stringent circumstances.  But these powers are not new and these powers are not increased, so far as the acquisition procedure is concerned, in any way and will not be by the enactment of section 27.  Therefore the security of the farmer will be just as safe in the hands of the Land Commission after as before the passing of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth is and the plain fact is that over the years the Land Commission machinery, as it is called, has been creaking and groaning along without ballbearings and without oil and failing in its attempt to cure the dismal situation that exists in several parts of Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Clare and Kerry.  People in those areas have been crying out and demanding for years that something be done to strengthen the hands of the Land Commission to acquire land, to expedite the division of land and to see that every person has a fair and reasonable chance, the <Col N="739" /> tools with which to make an economic living for his wife and family.  As I said before, and said on various platforms in Galway&mdash;and I am prepared to accept that the verdict so far as this section is concerned did go against us &mdash;I am prepared to abide by the verdict of time and prepared to abide by the verdict and the experience of the working of this section and when the people realise that they were hoodwinked in 1964, they will learn not to believe some of the wild and strange prophecies that they heard at that time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply want to point out that we in the Labour Party have made it quite clear when this Bill was going through the other Stages that while we oppose the Bill in its entirety and have voted against various sections and will, le cúnamh Dé, vote against it on the final Stage, we do not oppose section 27.  It is, in our opinion, the section which makes it possible to put, as it was described earlier, some teeth into the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Teeth is the word.  The position up to now has been that if the Land Commission were notified that a farm was not being used properly and were requested to inspect it, by the time they got around to doing that, the land, in nine cases out of ten, had passed out of the hands of the person who was misusing it and, over the past few years, particularly, into the hands of foreigners.  We believe this section will prevent that from happening in future and since the Minister has reduced from 12 months to three months the period during which the land can be freezed, there does not appear to be any objection to the section.  As I have already said, we will vote against the Bill on its final Stages but not because of this section on which we are prepared to support the Government because we believe it is a very necessary one.  As far as the amendment is concerned, since we agree with the section we cannot agree that the amendment will improve it or meet our point of view and for that reason we are prepared to support the <Col N="740" /> Government if it comes to a division on the section.</P>

We must remember, however, that the Minister has taken power to delegate to an official of his Department the right to inspect land. Deputy Tully spoke of a freezing period.  In my recollection, he is incorrect. The freezing period is six months, reduced from 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister delegates to an official of his Department the right to inspect land and the land, having been inspected, is now frozen for three months.  During that period acquisition proceedings can be started. The Minister's Secretary&mdash;the Secretary of the Department, that is&mdash;will be a Lay Commissioner for the first time. All this adds up to the introduction of politics, through officials, into the working of the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>Whether a person's land was taken from him or not, we always believed such a decision should be left in the hands of someone with the status of a judge.  No matter in how small a way&mdash;in our view, it is not a small way &mdash;there is the introduction of politics. Since the Bill was introduced, I have had more people coming to me with reference to the various matters relative to the Land Commission than ever before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputy Seán Flanagan to say he never implied he had the right, the power, or any influence in the giving of land or in its acquisition.  Nevertheless, the people who live down the long lanes believe there is such influence, that the local politician has it.  If the local politician is a member of the Government Party, he can go to the Minister and, at the <Col N="741" /> Minister's bidding, the Lay Commissioner must consider this and, over a period of three months, decide whether to proceed with acquisition.  It was the Deputy who instituted the inspection when he went to his own Minister and made representations to have the land inspected.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, the Minister sought to freeze land for 12 months. Now, as a result of pressure, he has reduced it to three months.  I admit I was a little out of date in believing it had been reduced only to six months. Deputy Seán Flanagan said that Deputies were impotent in this respect, that when people came to the local Deputy the land had already been advertised in the local papers, therefore bringing the notice of the Land Commission to the fact that it was to be sold.  Deputy Seán Flanagan put forward an extraordinary line of thought, when you consider the simplicity and the dignity of those people.</P>
    <P>He said they are left to fester on, a phrase which gives me the greatest offence.  Whatever the offence of the phrase, however, the position is that while Deputy Seán Flanagan says Deputies are left impotent in this matter, that they have no power, Deputy Tully has just said that the Labour Party had decided to support this section, to vote for it, because it is the section that puts the teeth into the Bill.  Deputy Dillon has told the House it affects fixity of tenure.  Are they the teeth Deputy Tully talks about and Deputy Seán Flanagan talks about? The latter Deputy said the local politician was impotent, could do nothing and that the people were left to fester on.  Does he believe this section will put Deputy Tully's teeth into the Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to teeth.  Our view is that whether a man's property should be taken from him should be the decision of a judge, of a person in a position apart from politics, a person given a salary above that which he needs, a man of impartial <Col N="742" /> and fair mind.  There is a view in this House that the Land Commission only move in cases of large estates which have not been employing people.  I want to say now that I went with the parish priest to the Land Commission Court to object to the acquisition of 19 acres from a widow who could not work it because of her circumstances, because the nephew who is now working the land was not available at that time.  She wanted the land to give her a living and later to pass on to her nephew.  The parish priest and the local Deputy had to go to the court to object.  The Commission had decided that the land was needed for distribution in the district.</P>
      <P>Our defence was successful for that widow, but this lady might easily have had her land taken from her if there had not been this objection, fortified by facts and figures.  What will the position be if it is possible for another Deputy, this time on the Government side, to go to the Minister and ask him to instruct an official to go and inspect a farm?  There is to be a period of three months during which the Lay Commissioners can make a case.  One thing a farmer, whether large or small, cherishes beyond all else is the right to own his land.  This right can be seriously interfered with by this section, which we seek to amend.</P>
      <P>It cuts across another section under which land, three miles away from a man's home farm, can be acquired even though the farmer is working it in a proper manner.  If a small farmer has succeeded in putting himself in a position to buy an outfarm to which he can send his dry stock, what is the position to be if the local Fianna Fáil Deputy can have such land frozen for three months?  During that period the value of those lands, even if the Land Commission decide to do nothing, will have deteriorated by at least 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House do not want power of that sort.  As Deputy Dillon has said, we are forsworn that our first act on taking Government, when we have thrown you out&mdash;it will not be so long now&mdash;will be to remove this section from the Bill.  It will be months, not years.</P>

That means that Deputy Seán Flanagan and Deputy Fanning sincerely believe there is a power in this section which can be used in the way of abuse.  That is the phrase Deputy Seán Flanagan used&mdash;&ldquo;in the way of abuse.&rdquo;  That is what Deputy Dillon's forefathers and Deputy Seán Flanagan's forefathers and the forefathers of many other people on both sides of the House were evicted for.</P>

Deputy Seán Flanagan even indicated that his family had suffered more.  But they all suffered to preserve fixity of tenure. Now we have a situation in which the Minister says there is nothing in this which could lead to abuse.  Deputy Tully for the Labour Party says this section is the teeth of the Bill.  Deputy Seán Flanagan let the cat out of the bag by saying that, if the Minister used <Col N="744" /> this section in the way of abuse, he would vote against it as he had done before.  Deputy Fanning says they do not believe the Minister is a man who will use this in the way of abuse.</P>

      <P>I am not interested in the virtue, or lack of it, of the present Minister or any Minister.  I am interested in the fact that no Minister, however virtuous, should have that power.  When we assume office, as we will, our first duty will be to remove this section entirely from the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Seán Flanagan also said the farmer was no longer a tenant.  I presume what he meant was that the farmer owned his own land, that he had the right to live on it and enjoy it in perpetuity.  If the Minister persists in putting this section through, the farmer may not be defined as a tenant but he will have all the indignities of a tenant.  The local Fianna Fáil Deputy&mdash;as long as they stay over there&mdash;can go to his Minister.  His Minister can instruct an official who can inspect the land and it can be frozen for three months.  During those three months the Minister can instruct the Secretary of his Department, whom he is now making a Lay Commissioner, to see to it that the Lay Commissioners consider this case.  In other words, there is no man owning land in Ireland whose land cannot be considered for acquisition by the Lay Commissioners.</P>
      <P>In any representations to the Land Commission, I always made my position perfectly clear.  If anybody wanted to apply for land and came to me, I transmitted the information.  But I did not transmit information about the acquisition of any particular person's land, unless that person wished it to be done.  Perhaps I was softhearted about it, but I do not think it fair for any man to walk up to a Deputy and ask to have his neighbour's land divided or to feel that Deputy has the right&mdash;no matter to which Party he belonged&mdash;to have that land inspected and frozen for three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to talk about the position in <Col N="745" /> relation to the freezing of land.  All rural Deputies have a good knowledge of how land is bought and sold in Ireland.  Land sales are a matter for discussion in every country parish: the price land makes, the bids and all the rest.  Deputies know what happens. The man seeking a parcel of land, who knows that 12 months previously the Land Commission had frozen that land for three months, will not be too keen to bid as he would otherwise, because he would be afraid that, having bought the land, he would have to face the Land Commission.  Up to this the decision to acquire a man's land was that of a person of the stature of a circuit court judge, a person who was instructed to have all that impartiality and who had been placed, as far as income is concerned, above bribery or any of the things that could lead him into difficulty.  Now the local Deputy can make it.  If this is so, where are we going?</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Flanagan provided sufficient material for a speech that would last hours, although he spoke for only 20 minutes.  He said the machinery of the Land Commission was creaking along with no oil and no ballbearings.  It is perfectly relevant to this amendment to say that is not the problem.  The problem is fixed on Budget Day.  The civil servants in the Land Commission are as efficient, as honourable and as dutiful as any other civil servants in this State.  We are very lucky to have the type of civil servants we have.  But if the money voted is the same&mdash;and, despite all the talk by Fianna Fáil about land division and all the flaunting of this Land Bill, it has been for the seven years they have been in power &mdash; then the creaking Deputy Seán Flanagan speaks about has nothing to do with oil and ballbearings: it has merely to do with lack of use.</P>
    <P>What is the use in the Lay Commissioners indicating that certain lands should be acquired when the position is that the money is not there to pay for them?  We must consider that fact and consider also that at the moment the Land Commission have large tracts of land which they cannot afford <Col N="746" /> physically to divide into economic units and give out to the people.  Does everybody not know that?  Is Question Time in this House not taken up with questions as to when land held by the Land Commission for from three to six years will be divided?  No politician is here for six months without knowing that the reason they cannot do it is that they have not the money to pay for the farms and the houses.  Yet here Fianna Fáil come along and say that simply by including this section in the Bill &mdash; and I say with certainty it is nothing but a political section&mdash;they are going to cure this ill.  The creaking without oil and the creaking through lack of ballbearings is the creaking for lack of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of a series of questions I tabled today in regard to landings of fish at Galway by a Spanish trawler, I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands if Irish sea fishermen were consulted before this licence was granted.  His reply was that Galway fishermen were not specifically consulted about the present temporary arrangement.</P>
      <P>As I see it, the trend of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply to this and other questions shows Government policy in regard to the future of our Irish fishing industry especially as it affects us in the west and our Irish trawlermen.</P>
      <P>I also asked if the Galway fish freezing plant was still under the control of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara. To that, I got no reply.  It is of paramount importance to get that answer.  It would also be interesting to know when a secret agreement was entered into with these fish merchants who have now such a controlling interest in the fish plant at Galway and what are the financial arrangements between these people and the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary states <Col N="747" /> that his information is that fish was not refused at the Galway plant due to shortage of staff.  I made it my business to inquire in Galway and I was informed by members of the staff that the reason was that they could not handle the fish.  I do not know who has informed the Parliamentary Secretary but he states that fish was occasionally refused on the ground of being in poor condition.  I can tell the Parliamentary Secretary why. Before I do so, I should like to say that I have here positive evidence of fish in perfect condition and suitable size being refused on the doorstep of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wants it, I can let him have it.  These pictures were taken in November, a time of the year when fish could not easily go off. The fish were in perfect condition.  I saw the fish and I am prepared to stand over what I have said in the face of the Board or any member of the Fianna Fáil Government.  I should like to remind the Parliamentary Secretary, who is an Irish speaker, that these fish were landed by an all Irish-speaking crew.</P>

      <P>I would further remind the Parliamentary Secretary that in the last few weeks Pat Jennings&mdash;that name should ring a bell with An Bord Iascaigh Mhara&mdash;was refused acceptance by the Board of 60 boxes of fish that were in perfect condition.  This fish, as in a previous case that I mentioned, had to be sold for a few shillings for fish meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy say on what date that occurred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the past three or four weeks.  I cannot specify the <Col N="748" /> date.  Do not mind the date.  I am giving facts and I will stand over them. Pat Jennings needs no introduction to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Members of the Board were delighted to be on television with Pat Jennings when he was shown as being one of the best fishermen off our coast and was presented with a high award for his efficiency.  I may add that his crew were all Irish speaking, like all the other fishermen based on the west coast.  It was rather strange to hear three languages spoken on the quayside at Galway&mdash;the Irish language spoken by the Irish trawlermen, Spanish spoken by the Spaniards and very fluent English being spoken by a gentleman with a very Oxford accent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Galway is the City of the Tribes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but this gentleman did not come from the City of the Tribes.  I am afraid that if Mr. Eoin O'Mahony were asked to trace his background he would have his hands full.  This gentleman was able to flaunt his licence, that was given by the Parliamentary Secretary's Department, in the face of these Irish speakers.</P>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that there is no ill feeling towards the Spanish fishermen coming in there. These men are only pawns in the game.  We know who the gentlemen are who are playing the game.  I watched the fish being landed from this trawler.  My attention was drawn to dogfish that were being landed.  If one of our Galway trawlers dared to land that type of fish, we know what would be done to it.  Yet, not alone did An Bord Iascaigh Mhara accept it, but they sent out members of their staff, when the ordinary draymen refused, to carry the stuff over to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara from the quay side.  I am a witness and I will stand over anything I say here to-night.  It would be very interesting to know what financial arrangement was made for the payment of this staff for such transportation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred to the landing of dogfish.  I inquired of some of the gentlemen who were interested in <Col N="749" /> having the fish landed and was informed that this stuff would be all right for the continental market.  That is very interesting.  Dogfish, apparently, is good enough for the continental market but prime fish, in perfect condition, is not to be accepted by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for any market, Irish or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what action has been taken in regard to the fine mesh net that we have seen on this foreign fishing trawler, so fine that one could not get one's small finger through it.  If an Irish trawler had such a net, the owner would be subject to a fine of not less than £50.  I can go further and say that the Department were informed.  I should like to know what action they have taken to deal with this infringement of fishing law. I do not like to mention the name of the gentleman who was informed but I have seen to it.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of refusing to accept fish from the Irish fishermen is to depress the prices to Irish speakers. This is a very poor contribution from one who sets himself up as being a great Irish speaker and in the light of the Buy Irish campaign, all this lip service we have heard from the Departments these past few weeks.  It would be interesting to know if An Bord Iascaigh Mhara intend to process turbot&mdash;for those who may not know, turbot is called the turkey of the sea&mdash;and sole into fish fingers. I should like to know if this fish will find its way into the Irish market to the exclusion of Irish caught fish.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give me the answers I seek, because if he does not, I shall table questions here in the House until I get an answer to everything I ask.  Does he intend to charge an import levy on this importation of foreign fish?</P>
    <P>A fishery harbour has been mooted for Galway and the view is now widely held that this is for foreign trawlers only; no Irish need apply.  They have positive proof from the way they have been treated and completely ignored in their efforts to get proper berthage in <Col N="750" /> Galway while the Galway harbour scheme is going through.  In the present position where these Irish trawlers are based, if the wind came overnight from the wrong point, the whole fleet could be wrecked.  I brought this to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary but nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>The action in this case is merely the thin end of the wedge for what is to come.  The view is that foreign trawlers will be based in Galway at the expense of the Irishman.  It is a sad day when Fianna Fáil have allowed the land of Ireland to be swept from under the Irish people, when industries are now in the stranglehold of foreigners and, last but not least, the fish of our coasts are now to be handed over to them.</P>
    <P>The Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries here for quite a while have given great promises but I would advise them when there is a general election, which we expect very soon, to keep out of Galway.  They have done enough damage there already and if there is an election, the people will give Fianna Fáil their answer.  I hope Deputy Geoghegan, who was very silent at Question Time today, will come into the debate to talk of the Irish-speaking trawlermen off the west coast.  I shall give him his opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought when we got the new Parliamentary Secretary in the Fisheries Branch, it would be a case of a new broom sweeping clean.  We had a barnacled old warrior here in the person of the Minister for Defence, then Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Bartley, in charge of fisheries.  When the war ended, his method of solving all these problems was to charter and buy three second-hand German trawlers at a cost of approximately £110,000 to clean up our Irish fisheries.  I think it was Deputy Cunningham who said once in this House that he did not believe in part-time fishermen and the then Parliamentary Secretary said that the salvation of our fisheries would be three deep-sea trawlers, and he proceeded to buy these second-hand trawlers from Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a change of Government, <Col N="751" /> but prior to that one of our boatyards, Meevagh, was closed down by the Parliamentary Secretary.  When Deputy Dillon took over responsibility for fisheries in the first inter-Party Government, the first thing he did was to reopen Meevagh boatyard and the next thing he did was to give more employment in the building of ships for inshore and outshore fishing without talking of deep-sea fishing.  From that we began to build up our fisheries.</P>
    <P>The next thing we found necessary was to ensure continuity of supply by means of preserving fish in the lacuna periods in which our boats could not go to sea.  We decided the first thing that was necessary was to procure freezing plants and adopt proper methods of distribution.  I remember, as a result of Deputy Dillon's policy in this House and in the country generally, the procurement and purchase of distributing vans with frigidaire equipment installed.  They were purchased by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara but they were later sold as secondhand at practically half the price for which they were purchased.  We established the deep-freezing plant and, associated with it, the fishmeal plant and from that we thought we would enlarge, but in those days the theme song of Fianna Fáil was: &ldquo;Anything you can do I can do bigger and better than you,&rdquo; and they proceeded to establish the Atlantic Fisheries fishmeal plant in Killybegs.  It was built, as we all know, extravagantly and out of proportion, and we found it then becoming a national liability.</P>
    <P>Here we are today at the very same thing.  As Deputy Coogan pointed out, licences are being granted to foreigners. I am sorry, as an O'Donnell, to call a Spaniard a foreigner because Spain accepted an O'Donnell.  I am sorry to call them foreigners but licences are being issued to foreigners to come in and compete, as Deputy Coogan has pointed out, against native Irish speakers.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary will say they must fish in the same conditions and on the same terms outside territorial waters as other deep-sea trawlers.  That is not so.  Rounded whiting or cod caught <Col N="752" /> by these foreign trawlers are gutted and frozen outside territorial waters. But these trawlers that have been licensed are bringing in immature fish knowing that in that fishmeal factory they can sell the same fish and procure the same price for it as we are procuring for offals of prime fish.  I am sorry I must give time to the Parliamentary Secretary who has only ten minutes but on some other occasion I hope to have a word on this matter.</P>

      <P>The object of this Government is to expand the fishing industry very substantially.  It is perfectly obvious that even the considerable increase in the home consumption of fish, even doubling it, will not be nearly sufficient to give us the expansion in the industry which the country and the fishermen need.  So that the real hope for expansion lies in exports. It is also obvious that the trend in our food industry in general and in the fish industry in particular is towards <Col N="753" /> processed, pre-packaged goods.  Therefore, I am quite convinced that the future of the Irish fishing industry and the future of the Irish fishermen depends on a considerable expansion of the processing industry.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the fishing industry.  The imports by the Spanish trawler have enabled the factory to be kept open and enabled the 58 people to be kept in employment there.  We have created a situation where we can expand that labour force and when our Irish fishermen have heavy landings we can cope with them. If we did not reach this situation we could not cope with them and we should have to close down the factory. Would the people then thank Deputy Coogan for having closed down this factory, which is what he and his Party want to do?</P>

      <P>There is evidence that fish were refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that. Deputies know that the supplies landed at Galway in recent months could not keep the factory going in processed fish.  I do not know if Deputy Coogan professes to be an expert on what is required for processing but the reports I have received from Bord Iascaigh Mhara and which I have no reason to disbelieve and would accept before Deputy Coogan's &ldquo;expert&rdquo; evidence indicate that the fish he referred to as having been rejected from the fisherman he mentioned were rejected on the grounds that the fish were undersize for filleting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I also have confirmation from the fishermen's representatives that the fish which had been rejected at Galway was rejected rightly because it was too small or in bad condition except in one case to which Deputy Coogan has not referred.  If necessary, I shall deal with that on another occasion but I shall not waste time going into it now.  He did not make the case he should have made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a case which can be well answered.  The case made by Deputy Coogan was based on misconceptions and inaccuracies.  I want to make it clear that the licence which was granted was granted on the basis that it would not constitute any interference whatever with the Irish fishermen's market.  No evidence has been tendered by Deputy Coogan or Deputy O'Donnell to show that the Irish fishermen's market has been affected one iota.</P>

      <P>Deputy Coogan has a lot to answer for if he convinces the fishermen of this.  Their whole future is bound up in the type of operation we are engaged in in Galway.  The essential feature is to ensure regular supplies. My efforts are directed in that way towards getting a vast expansion in the processing industry.  I want Irish fishermen to partake in this and get the benefits of it and not to be misled into thinking it is not in their interests.</P>
