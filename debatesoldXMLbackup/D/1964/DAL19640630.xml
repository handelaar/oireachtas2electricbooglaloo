      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) the national average retail prices of the food items included in the consumer price index at mid-May, 1963 and mid-May, 1964, and the actual increase or decrease in each case, and (b) the percentage changes in the prices of all items entering into the consumer price index between mid-May, 1963 and mid-May, 1964.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving (a) the national average retail prices of certain items of food at mid-May, 1963 and mid-May, 1964 and the actual change in each case and (b) the percentage change over the period in the prices of all the items entering into the Consumer Price Index numbers.  In the case of items, other than certain food items, no attempt is made to obtain quotations for an identical quality of the different articles in all areas and, therefore, any average prices computed would not be meaningful.  The correctness of the relative price changes is ensured by the fact that at each source the identical article is priced at successive inquiries.  Price quotations in respect of some items of food are not available from all centres at each inquiry and the figures for the percentage changes in these prices, computed in such a way as to eliminate the effect of differences in coverage, may differ slightly from the percentage calculated from the actual changes.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  NATIONAL average retail prices of food items at mid-May, 1963 and mid-May, 1964 and the actual change in each case.</P>

      <P>Undulant fever is a notifiable infectious disease, of which, in each of the last two calendar years, 13 cases were notified.</P>
      <P>In connection with the efforts to ensure the availability of safe milk supplies, there has, in recent years, been a big increase in the number of pasteurisation plants established throughout the country.  In view of this development, my Department has had under consideration the desirability of the more widespread use in local authority institutions of pasteurised milk so as to avoid any possibility of infection arising from the use of raw milk.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that what the Deputy has in mind is an increase in the allowance for single persons which would raise the effective exemption limit for earned income above the present level of £312 a year or £6 per week.  As I pointed out in my reply to a Question by Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan on 11th June, 1964, budgetary considerations preclude the granting at present of such an increase.</P>

The figures for 1963/64 will be shown <Col N="1070" /> in the accounts for that year when published in about two months' time; the corresponding figures for gallonage are not available to me and, in any event, I would not disclose that information as the price they pay for diesel oil is confidential to CIE.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of section 5 of the Regulation of Railways Act, 1889, every passenger on a railway is obliged, on request by an officer or servant of the railway company, either to produce a ticket showing that his fare is paid, or to pay the said fare, or to give his name and address.  If the circumstances indicate the intention to avoid paying a fare, the person concerned is liable to prosecution under the said section and the railway company has the right to prosecute.  The penalties for offences are laid down by section 5 of the Act of 1889.</P>
      <P>Article 56 of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicle) Regulations, 1963, provides that a person who travels on a public service vehicle, that is, any road vehicle used for the carriage of passengers for reward, shall not refuse or omit to pay the appropriate fare.  A contravention of this provision constitutes an offence under section 82 (6)  of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and a person who commits such an offence is liable to prosecution, the penalties applicable being set out in section 102 of the Act.  Such offences are prosecuted by the Garda Síochána in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government what dual carriageway roads it is intended to provide as main arteries in the city of Dublin; when it is expected that these roads will be completed; the amount of the grant in each case; and the total cost of the portion within the area of the Dublin County Council in each case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Improvement to at least dual carriageway standard is necessary in the case of the portions of the following arterial roads which lie within the County Dublin boundary, namely: T.1&mdash;Dublin-Drogheda; T.5 &mdash;Dublin-Naas; T.7 &mdash; Dublin-Bray; T.3&mdash;Dublin-Mullingar; T.35&mdash;Dublin-An Uaimh.</P>
      <P>Both the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin County Council are engaged on the preparation and execution of a works programme towards this end, but it is not possible at this stage to forecast when the programme will reach completion.</P>
      <P>These works are financed by way of 100 per cent grants from the Road Fund, and grants are allocated for the various sections of the work as the construction stage is reached.  Up to the present, a grant of £109,240 has been allocated to the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation in respect of the section of the Bray Road which lies in their district, and a total of £457,256 to the Dublin County Council for the various sections of the Naas Road already undertaken in their area.</P>
      <P>I have given an assurance to the road authorities concerned that the necessary financial support will be forthcoming to enable this programme to be completed, but I am not at this stage in a position to indicate what the final cost of the programme will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The general purpose of this Bill is to provide that the remuneration of the Comptroller and Auditor General shall, with retrospective effect to 1st November, 1961, be the same as the normal salary for Secretary of a Department, thereby enabling eighth and ninth round increases to be paid to the Comptroller and Auditor General, whose present rate of remuneration, £2,850, has remained unchanged since 1st January, 1959.  The revised rates payable would be £3,375 with effect from 1st November, 1961 and £3,780 with effect from 1st February, 1964.</P>
      <P>As the House will recall, the office of Comptroller and Auditor General exists pursuant to the Constitution, Article 33.1 of which reads:</P>
      <P>There shall be a Comptroller and Auditor General to control on behalf of the State all disbursements and to audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with the judiciary, the Comptroller and Auditor General's salary is determined by statute.  Up to 1962 his remuneration was increased on each occasion on which the remuneration of the judiciary was increased. Following the 1962 increase for the latter, legislation would have been proposed for an increase in the <Col N="1090" /> Comptroller and Auditor General's remuneration were it not for the publication of the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i> early in 1963.  The judiciary have since obtained a further increase with effect from 1st February last.</P>
    <P>While past revisions of the remuneration of the Comptroller and Auditor General have been related, in timing, to those for the judiciary, they have, as to amount, been determined by reference to the normal rate for Secretary of a Department.  When first fixed in 1923, the Comptroller and Auditor General's rate was slightly in excess of the Secretary rate; the relationship varied from time to time over the years but, on redetermination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's salary subsequently, the rates were brought approximately into line on each occasion. The fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General's salary was from time to time out of alignment with the Secretary rate was due to the circumstance that the increase had to be made by statute&mdash;which involved delay &mdash;rather than by direct adjustment as in the case of the civil servants.  While there was a case for statutory adjustment when changes were infrequent, it is nowadays in danger of leading to unreasonable delays.  To avoid such delays in the future, provision is being made in the Bill for permanent identity between the Comptroller and Auditor General rate and the normal Secretary rate.  Future adjustments in the Comptroller and Auditor General's remuneration will thus automatically follow after changes in the Secretary rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill of which we approve for the purpose of giving the Comptroller and Auditor General the percentage increases all civil servants have got.  There seems to be some confusion, however, about what the exact term &ldquo;Secretary of a Department of State&rdquo; means.  The Secretary of the Department of Finance is the Secretary of a Department of State and is paid a different amount from that of the Secretaries of other Departments.  The Minister will understand that I appreciate the reason for that and approve of it, though some of his colleagues might not approve in <Col N="1091" /> the same way.  Apart from that, is the figure that is paid to Secretaries of Departments entirely fixed and the same for all the other Departments? I do not think it is, though the difference may perhaps be because it is on a personal scale.</P>
      <P>The Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce, for example, is I think paid £3,850 per annum but the Secretary of the Department of Defence is paid a lesser figure&mdash;£3,375 per annum.  I always understood that all Secretaries of Departments were on the same scale provided they were all married or all single, as the case may be.  Have I correctly understood the situation to be that they have gone off that figure?</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would refer to page XII of the Book of Estimates where the rates of pay for General Service grades are set out, I presume A is the married and B the unmarried salary.  I cannot reconcile the figures there with the figures given in the Book of Estimates in other places in relation to individual Secretaries.  That is a matter which should be clarified if we are relating him to a Secretary.  I agree entirely that it is much more satisfactory that it should be related in this way so that his salary will get the benefit of such percentage increases which there may be from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely that it is a good thing to relate the salary so that the same trouble will not arise again.  The thing I do not like is the period of retrospection.  It appears rather astonishing that the Minister should ask here for permission to pay a substantial retrospection, in fact to 1st of November, 1961, for this one person when we have had experience over the years of attempts being made by Departments of State to prevent increases given to ordinary employees of the State, even from a current date. Sometimes these increases are postdated so that there will be a saving of a very small number of pounds, or in some cases a saving of shillings.  It is rather extraordinary, that being the case, that the Minister should now ask for a retrospection date back to 1st <Col N="1092" /> November, 1961.  Is there some particular reason, apart from the one given, for doing this?  I know there has been a change of office in the recent past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this measure, naturally.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is the custodian, in so far as the House is concerned, of public money.  This is a very important position.  At the present time, as I happen to be Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, it is only right I should say that the link between the House and the control which the Oireachtas exercises on the spending of State money is accounted for by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As he is an officer appointed under the Constitution, he is responsible for seeing that the various Departments of State not alone conform to policy, as laid down, in the expenditure of money, but account equally for the proper expenditure of the moneys voted by this House.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he should certainly be in a position comparable with that of any Secretary of a Department in the State.  It is an important principle that the constitutional officer, who has that responsibility, should not feel in any way inferior to any Secretary of a Department.  I should like the Minister to inform the House whether the figures now proposed for the Comptroller and Auditor General will apply to the occupant of that office at the present time or whether these will in fact be equal to what is paid, or will become payable, to the secretary of any Department of State, taking into account the payment of the 12 per cent in the latest round of wage increases. It is a point of some importance that this officer should not be in any inferior position to any of the officers whom he may have to ask for an explanation in regard to their control or disbursement of moneys provided by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The words in the first section of this Bill state that the Comptroller and Auditor General will be paid the same remuneration as the secretary in the General Service Grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1093" /> In the preface to the Estimates, there is a list of salaries for the various officers in the Civil Service and the term used is &ldquo;General Service grades&rdquo;. Therefore, it would apply to the ordinary salary paid to the Secretary of the Department.  There are, as Deputies are aware, three Secretaries who are paid higher salaries than those of officers in the General Service grades. These are the secretaries of the Department of Finance, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  With regard to retrospection, I explained there is always a lag from the time the judiciary or secretaries of Departments get increases and the time the Comptroller and Auditor General is thought of.  There was, of course, a practice of giving retrospection in regard to him to the date when the Secretaries of Departments got their increase.  For one reason or another, he has not been dealt with now for about ten years. There is, therefore, a big lag to be made up.  The present salary is £2,850.  Under this Bill the Comptroller and Auditor General will be brought up to £3,780 so he is almost £1,000 behind what he should be paid at the present time.  That is the defence, if you like, for retrospection, to bring the salary of the former official and the present Comptroller and Auditor General into line with the salaries of Secretaries of Departments.</P>

      <P>When this Bill is passed, it will not be necessary to introduce the question of retrospection so far as the Comptroller and Auditor General is concerned.  The salary fixed, on the whole, is reasonable.  As the Taoiseach explained, when we were appointing the new Comptroller and Auditor General, we could legally appoint anybody for that position but the senior man in the Department has been appointed from the very beginning.  We might, therefore, regard the appointment as practically a Civil Service appointment, although, constitutionally, it is done by the Dáil.  Looking at it that way, I think the salary fixed is reasonable for this particular person. I therefore recommend the Dáil to accept this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Minister has just said, there seems <Col N="1095" /> to be a very strong case that the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor General should be aligned to the salaries of the Secretaries of the three Departments he mentioned.  I always understood that the scales of pay for all Departments were exactly the same but that the Secretary of the Department of Finance was paid something in addition, because he is also the head of the Civil Service.  It does seem to me that the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is going to be the officer of this House dealing not merely with the various Votes under the Department of Finance but also the Votes under Agriculture and Industry and Commerce, should not be in an inferior position to those Secretaries.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, accepted that the badge of equality is remuneration. Outside the Civil Service, there might be certain other matters to be brought into account, but as far as the Civil Service is concerned, the badge of equality is equal remuneration.  There is an overwhelming case that the officer of this House should never be in an inferior position to the accounting officer in any Department over whom he has to exercise supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I think the salary we are fixing is reasonable. From the commencement of the State, he was paid in or about the same amount as the Secretary of a Department. During all that time, the Secretary of the Department of Finance was paid more.  Some years ago&mdash;25 years ago maybe&mdash;the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce was brought up to the level of the Secretary of the Department of Finance.  Since I became Minister for Finance, the case was made to me that the Department of Agriculture was as onerous and as important a Department as any of the others and that, therefore, the Secretary should be brought up to that level.  I agreed with that.  At the same time, I think it is not altogether a good thing that there should be differences.  Some Departments may be lighter than others, but we cannot try to regulate the amount that should be paid to each Secretary <Col N="1096" /> according to the amount of work he has to do.  However, it is there now, and these three are paid more.  The Comptroller and Auditor General was always paid less than the Secretary of the Department of Finance.  I would, therefore, ask the Dáil to leave things as they are for the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is slightly inaccurate in his recollection. The Secretary of the Department of Finance was always paid more than the Secretaries of the other Departments because, as I said, he was head of the Civil Service, in addition to being Secretary of the Department. The Secretaryship of the Department of Industry and Commerce never carried with it, <i>per se,</i> any additional salary.  It carried the same remuneration as other Departments. One particular Secretary, who had acted at one time both as Secretary of Industry and Commerce and of Supplies, when the two Departments were subsequently amalgamated after the war, was given a personal salary because of the amalgamation, but the salary attaching to the post was always the same as that for other Departments.</P>
      <P>I think there is a good case for the Secretaries of Departments which carry the heaviest weight being paid more. Once that case has been made&mdash;and accepted by the Minister when he brought Agriculture up to the same level as Finance and Industry and Commerce&mdash;there is an overwhelming case for the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is not in any way an answer to say that the Comptroller and Auditor General has always been on one fixed figure, because the circumstances are entirely changed now with the standard rate for Industry and Commerce and Agriculture set out on a different basis.  I am not talking of personal salaries of individuals, but the standard rate for Industry and Commerce and Agriculture are at a different level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not help overhearing the Minister asking was it personal.  I do not think it is so set out in the Volume of Estimates, but I may be wrong. However, I am very glad to hear that <Col N="1097" /> one thing has not happened&mdash;that, while the Minister for Finance has elevated the salary of the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, he has had sufficient sense not to elevate the salary of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is merely to continue the existing provisions for rates on fisheries which are due to expire at the end of September next.  Those provisions enable boards of conservators to strike and collect rates on fisheries within their districts. They were first enacted on a temporary basis in 1925 and have since been continued from time to time: rather than continue them for a further limited period, the opportunity is now being taken to make them permanent.</P>
      <P>Fishery rating has become a well established feature of the fisheries code and the produce of the rate represents the largest single item in the revenue of boards of conservators.  Thus, out of the board's total receipts of some £103,000 in the fishery year ended 30th September last, £36,000 came from fishery rates, close on £29,000 from licence duties and £23,000 in the form of grants from the Fisheries Vote.</P>
      <P>Local authorities, to whom fisheries were rateable up to 1925, receive compensation from the State for that loss in their rates.  Where, by reason of the exemption of fisheries, a local rate on other property would have to be increased by more than a penny in the £, the local authority receive an amount equivalent to that which would be produced by such an increase.  The total amount of these compensatory payments from the Fisheries Vote in the last financial year was approximately £33,500.</P>
      <P>It can, I think, be safely claimed that this system of fishery rating has proved its value and has come to be accepted as a permanent feature by all concerned.  I, therefore, have no hesitation in recommending this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>There is no objection to the Bill from this side of the House.  Section 55 of the 1959 Act empowers boards of conservators to strike rates on fisheries within their respective districts.

I presume boards of conservators who strike these rates use the rates for the provision of the protection services in their areas.</P>
      <P>When I hear the Minister say that out of the total receipts of boards, some £103,000 came from fishery rates, £29,000 from licence duties and £23,000 from Fishery Vote grants, I recall that on more than one occasion he told us the salmon levy was used to enable boards of conservators to provide increased protection services for the safeguarding of fisheries.  One would imagine that if the salmon levy were being utilised for the purpose of giving boards of conservators an income it is the boards who mainly benefit from the levy.</P>
      <P>I have always maintained that the levy was used for the relief of the Exchequer and I am satisfied that if any substantial amount of the proceeds of the levy were going to boards of conservators to supplement their rates on fisheries, the Minister surely would have told us about it.  When he is replying, I trust he will refer to this matter.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister give us any indication as to what benefit the owners of fisheries get for the rates they pay? When a local authority strike a rate in the normal way, they provide roads, housing and health services for the benefit of the ratepayers.  Can the Minister tell us what benefits fishery ratepayers get from the money they pay on rates for their fisheries?  Do they get any benefit apart from the protection staff the boards employ? Is any portion of the moneys fishery owners pay by way of rates utilised for the purpose of repairing the walks or banks along those fisheries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally enough, boards of conservators have an income from licence duties, but, again, I ask what return has the owner of a fishery for the rates he is obliged to pay?  The purpose of the Bill appears to be to provide that where a fishery is rated by a board of conservators it will not have to pay rates to a city, county or urban rating authority.  It would be lacking <Col N="1100" /> in commonsense and would be unjust if fisheries already rated by boards of conservators had to bear ordinary rates as well.  That is why I subscribe to this amendment of the existing law.  I welcome any move that is made to clarify the law in that respect.  Yet, I have grave doubts as to the return which the owner of the fishery gets from the amount of rates.  I should like to know whether the authority that strikes the rate would be responsible for improvement of walks or banks; whether footbridges, which might be an added attraction to the fisheries, might be erected at the request of owners who paid rates to a board; whether suitable stiles would be erected convenient to fisheries; and, if so, at whose expense.</P>
    <P>I should like to direct very special attention to a matter with which I have been concerned for a considerable time and which I propose to discuss personally in detail with the Minister at a later stage.  I refer to the complaints which have been sent to the Minister's Department by owners of fisheries who are already paying fishery rates to boards of conservators and who have to endure various types of trespass on their lands.</P>
    <P>The owners of fisheries pay rates in respect thereof to boards of conservators. They pay county rates to the local authorities.  In these circumstances, one would not expect that they would have to suffer inconvenience caused by officers of boards of conservators, in the course of their protection duties, leaving gates open and thus allowing livestock to wander.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not the Department lays down standard regulations or whether regulations are laid down by the General Council of Boards of Conservators, which is a body representative of all the boards of conservators, which would impose a high standard of conduct on the officers of the boards.  I am reliably informed that in the course of their duties employees of boards of conservators, whether through neglect on their part or otherwise, have caused inconvenience to fishery owners.  When I was in the Fisheries Branch my experience was that these employees were not only highly intelligent but were courteous <Col N="1101" /> and very reasonable people who discharged their duties with a very high degree of efficiency.  Therefore, I am surprised to learn that on more than one occasion a fishery owner has had to draw the attention of the Department to the fact that gates were left open and livestock allowed to wander into neighbouring fields, thus causing general uproar.</P>

      <P>I agree.  That is why I do not propose to develop the matter and I have already said that I will discuss it at a later stage with the Minister.  Perhaps the Minister can tell us what return, if any, a person paying a fishery rate gets for that rate.</P>
      <P>I should be obliged if the Minister would seriously consider the points I have made.  I agree that they may not all be in order or within the scope of this Bill.  Nevertheless, I considered it necessary to raise them and thought that the debate on this Bill would afford me an opportunity to ventilate these matters on behalf of persons who are obliged to pay fishery rates.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to comment on the Salmon Conservancy Fund which was originally designed, as the Minister tells us, for the purpose of providing money to supplement the rates.</P>
      <P>I have been anxious to get information from the Minister for the benefit of all concerned.  There should be some means whereby the general public can get the information required.  If information is required as to the rates struck by a local authority, the information can be readily obtained but it is very seldom that the public are informed as to the amount of rates struck, the amount paid and the amount outstanding, in the case of fishery rates.  This information should most certainly be available to those who require it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very short Bill dealing with what can be described as a technical matter.  We on this side of the House have no objection to its passage. <Col N="1102" /> The points I have raised are worthy of the Minister's attention and I should welcome any information he can give the House in regard to them.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that we are always ready to co-operate and assist in every possible way the passage of what we can describe as necessary legislation.  The Minister will receive from this side of the House a full measure of co-operation in relation to fisheries.  We have never merited the criticism which the Minister on more than one occasion has hurled at us that we were destructive or obstructive. The fact that we are readily cooperating with the Minister in giving him this Bill and, indeed, approving of it, because we consider it is necessary, is in itself a certificate of our responsibility and vouches for the fact that we approach such matters in a businesslike and commonsense way. When the Minister introduces a Bill which we consider is designed to improve matters coming under his Department it will meet with out support. But, when the Minister brings in a Bill which we believe deserves criticism which should be approached cautiously and the dangerous aspects of which should be highlighted, we consider it our duty and our function, as an Opposition for the time being, to deal with it accordingly.</P>
    <P>However, I assure the Minister that we have no objection to the passage of this Bill through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first paragraph of his introductory statement, the Minister said that the provisions enable boards of conservators to strike and collect rates on fisheries within their districts.  There is a matter which I should like the Minister to clarify.  I should like to know who it is that decides as to the fishery rates to be struck.  I was a member of a board of conservators for a number of years and am aware that the position was that the board got instructions as to the fisheries on which they were to strike rates.  The position has been reached in many cases now that small farmers who have a small stretch of river running through their land and who have not either the time or the inclination <Col N="1103" /> to fish are being charged in respect of that fishery a higher rate than they are paying on their poor law valuation.</P>
      <P>Take my constituency, where the rate in the £ is well under 30/-.  The fishery rate is now over £2 in the £.  An extraordinary situation has arisen there. The Minister can correct me if I am wrong but I understand that if a person is alleged to have caught salmon on a stretch of water in one year that stretch of water becomes rateable the following year.  If that is so, it would appear that a number of people will be placed in a very awkward position.</P>
      <P>Recently, I met a man who has a very small farm.  He told me that although he does not fish he allowed some persons who came to the district to fish off his land on a few occasions last year and one of them was lucky enough&mdash;but from the farmer's point of view unlucky&mdash;to catch a salmon, and that he has received a demand for £10 this year.  It was a very expensive salmon if that is the case.</P>
      <P>I do appreciate it is much easier to have a regulation made or an arrangement made whereby there can be a continuation of the necessary procedure without having to come before the House every year.  For that reason we in the Labour Party have no objection to the passing of the amending legislation.  However, when the amending legislation was being introduced the Minister might have considered doing something about the matters of which I understand his Department have been made aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the figures given by the Minister of £36,000 from fishery rates, £29,000 from licence duties, and £23,000 in the form of grants from the Fisheries Vote, the ratio is all wrong. The sum from the Fisheries Vote should be very much more than £23,000.  Having regard to fishery protection to which Deputy Flanagan referred, I am aware that a number of people employed on fishery protection are being paid extraordinarily low rates because the amount of money available to the board of conservators that employs them is so small that it <Col N="1104" /> is unable to make provision for the workers apart from the actual weekly wage it gives them.</P>
    <P>In regard to the licence duties, the Minister is also aware&mdash;and he might possibly have amended it&mdash;that there is the extraordinary position that a licence can be bought in Dublin city which entitles the buyer of the licence to fish in rural districts of Ireland, in the Minister's part of the country and in mine.  The result is that the share of the licence which should normally go to the local board of conservators is given to a board which is spending very little on fishery protection and is able to reap quite a substantial harvest without any expenditure worth talking about.  The Minister might have considered that because since the passing of the Fisheries Consolidation Bill this situation has become more and more evident.</P>
    <P>You have ruled out of order, Sir, the reference which Deputy Flanagan made to the leaving open of gates, and so on, but I should like briefly to comment.  I do not think the comment should have been made.  If somebody has a complaint against a bailiff or a fishery protection man, the proper place to make the complaint would be to the board of conservators who employ him because I can say from my experience that there could not be any foundation for it.  The complaint should be made to somebody who can prove or disprove the allegation without going any further.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if the Minister would clear up those two points for me: first, who actually decides what water is to be rated?  Secondly, how can we in this House ensure that the rates which are put on the waters will not be so high that they will be a burden on people who are not interested in fishing?  There are a number of people who make a good living out of fishing.</P>
    <P>There are people who can charge as much as from 70 to 100 guineas a year for fishing on one day of the week.  However, that does not apply to the ordinary person who owns a small fishery whether he uses it or not. I would ask the Minister if there is any way in which this excessive burden <Col N="1105" /> on those people can be relieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take the last matters first and deal with the point about valuations made by Deputy Tully.  As far as I know, valuations on fisheries are fixed by the Commissioners of Valuation, the same as any other type of property in the country. I find it difficult to accept what the Deputy said, that because of catching a salmon somewhere, the landowner or the riparian owner had his valuation increased by £10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister allow me to explain?  There are many waters which are not rated but if a salmon is caught in a stretch of water which was not up to then rated, my information is that a rate of as much as £10 has been imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In the jungle of valuation law I do not want to contradict the Deputy but my experience is that the valuation of fisheries is done by the Commissioners of Valuation under what we call Griffiths Valuation of 1851.  It is unusual that somebody should find his valuation increased by virtue of fish being caught.  On the other hand, I had the experience of appealing against a valuation in respect of a public house and discovering in the court from the books in the Valuation Office that this public house, which is one of the oldest in the west of Ireland, had no figure charged for the actual licence.  Therefore, I could not very well say that this could not have happened.  All I can tell the Deputy is that the valuation of fisheries is the very same as any other type of valuation of property, the responsibility of the Commissioners of Valuation.  That being so, those concerned have an appeal open to them in the same way as the people who are dissatisfied with valuations elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the rate, it is the responsibility of the board of conservators to strike the rate.  It is true to say that I can intervene if I am dissatisfied with the rate being struck but, in the first instance, the striking of the rate is a matter for the board.  I have some <Col N="1106" /> figures here and perhaps I should say that, generally speaking, the rate is far less on fisheries than the ordinary rate prevailing in the particular county. The only exception I see here is Dublin where the current county rate is 41/-and the fishery rate is 42/-.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In Meath, it is very much more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Drogheda is also an exception but in practically every other case it is less.  If I take my own county: in Ballinakill, it is 35/-; in Ballina, it is 32/-; whereas the county rate in Mayo is 69/-.  In Galway, the fishery rate is 27/6; in Connemara, it is 24/-, and the county rate 68/3.  Therefore, generally speaking, the fishery rate is substantially lower that the prevailing county rate.  We come in to subsidise the local authorities to make up for the valuation on which the fishery rate is struck by the board of conservators, the prevailing rate in the county.  That has come down over a long number of years.  At all events, it has been there since 1925.</P>
      <P>I am not too happy about the whole structure and it is all under review at the moment.  My energetic Parliamentary Secretary is making a particular study of this business and I believe that further legislation will be necessary to deal with it on a national scale.  These old laws do not suit the present time and it is necessary to have another look at the whole structure of these boards and their finances.  One can say: what do the local authority do for the rate that we make up to them by these boards of conservators?  I assume that the local authority could do anything they though fit for these fisheries and those concerns, as they would in the case of anybody with whom they were concerned in their county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan complains that the owners of fisheries get nothing for the rate they pay to local authorities. Many people pay rates to local authorities and get very little, depending on their location.  That pattern is changing as we go ahead but there are people living in isolated portions of counties contributing to sewerage or housing <Col N="1107" /> schemes in other centres of population. Their turn is coming and they are now getting water supplies and so on.  I am sure Deputies will readily appreciate that every ratepayer cannot expect that every penny he pays in rates will be spent in his own backyard or on his own doorstep.</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal about the salmon export levy and the suggestion that it is used solely for the relief of the Exchequer.  That is not so.  The figures I have show that, roughly speaking, approximately £10,000 is collected from the levy on salmon, that is 2d. in the £ up to mid-May and 1d. in the £ from then on.  This comes back from the Exchequer with a lot more because, as I think I said in my opening statement, an extra £23,000 approximately is given by the Exchequer to boards of conservators to enable them to go ahead with their work.  It is incorrect to say that the levy on salmon is used solely for the relief of the Exchequer.  The £10,000 that is collected goes back with more to this business.  If that levy was not there, no doubt licences or something else would have to be increased in an effort to deal with the matter and make the necessary money available for these purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister repeat that?  I understood the Minister to say that £10,000 which is collected from the Salmon Conservancy Fund is paid into the Exchequer and that from the Exchequer come grants to the extent of £23,000 to the boards of conservators.  That bears out Deputy Dillon's argument and my argument that the Fund is relieving the Exchequer.  Is that not really the position?  It has taken us a good many years to get that information from the Minister and I am glad to know at long last that the Fund is used for the purpose of relieving the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Every halfpenny that comes in from all sources, I assume, is paid into the Exchequer.  What I am <Col N="1108" /> pointing out is that the amount we are concerned with here in the Salmon Conservancy Fund is a mere £10,000 and that, in addition to this, over £23,000 is paid back to the boards of conservators: the £10,000 goes out to the boards which get this £23,000 in addition for the purposes of their finances.  Many taxpayers and ratepayers would not be quite satisfied with the position in which this industry would pay nothing at all as an individual contribution for its own development. The boards, as I said, decide on what rate should be struck and it varies very much from area to area and from county to county.  It is quite true that somebody can get an all-purpose salmon licence in Dublin that will enable him to fish, here, there and everywhere.  That, again, is not of so much importance when one considers that the Exchequer has to come to the relief of all these boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Dublin Board of Conservators have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It would depend on the local board, on how interested they were in their business.  Certainly, I was surprised on looking at some of these figures because it is difficult to see a solid, logical argument as to why a fishery should not be paying the same rate as any other type of property in the country, but they are not.  However, the whole position is under examination in the reorganisation of this ancient structure we have inherited and we hope to get a more rational approach to the business in due course.</P>
      <P>I cannot say anything about the matter that has been raised in regard to trespass.  I understand the suggestion is about trespass by some officials. Trespass in a fishery is the same as any other type of trespass and the first duty on those who complain is to take action themselves.  I do not think it is a matter for my Department but if the Deputy gives me particulars about the complaint I shall see whether my officials had anything to do with it. Generally speaking, anything regarding trespass on fisheries is a matter for those concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> I do not think anything else was raised to which I need refer.  The Bill is necessary for the purposes I have mentioned and the general reorganisation of boards of conservators needs very careful study because many changes will have to be made.  The position is under active consideration at present and I have no doubt that legislation will be before the House in the not too-distant future to deal with the reorganisation to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The comment I have to make now arises out of the statement the Minister made a few minutes ago.  I quote the Minister's opening speech in which he said:</P>
      <P>...out of the boards' total receipts of some £103,000 in the fishery year ended 30th September last, £36,000 came from fishery rates, close on £29,000 from licence duties and £23,000 in the form of grants from the Fisheries Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He tells us that the salmon levy extracted from the pockets of the salmon fishermen yielded a sum of <Col N="1110" /> £10,000 and that £10,000 goes into the Exchequer and, out of the Exchequer, comes a grant of £23,000 for boards of conservators.  It would appear, therefore, as if a sum of only £13,000 is being granted to boards of conservators when one remembers that £10,000 of that amount is stolen out of the pockets of the fishermen engaged in salmon fishing.  These men are put to the pin of their collar to eke out an existence by salmon fishing and I think it is morally wrong that they should be subjected to a levy or a tax of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that only £10,000 is got from this levy.  According to Fianna Fáil and the Minister, we have now reached a most desirable state of prosperity.  That is proclaimed by Fianna Fail long and loudly.  Surely the Government should now reconsider this whole matter.  To use the phrase of the Minister for Transport and Power, this £10,000 is really very small beer indeed where the State is concerned but it would mean a great deal to the men out of whose pockets it is taken.  I feel very strongly on this matter of a salmon levy and I appeal to the Minister now to abolish it.  It is an unjust means of extracting money from these people.  We have the Minister's word for it that this money is being used to relieve the Exchequer.  It is morally wrong to extract this money from these salmon fishermen.  It is wrong in principle.  It is wrong that any food exported should be subjected to a tax or levy.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consult with his colleagues and to bring himself and his colleagues to a proper realisation of their responsibilities towards the men engaged in the salmon fishing industry.  I repeat what Deputy Dillon said on the Fisheries Estimate; one of the first acts performed by a Fine Gael Government will be to ensure that justice is done to those engaged in the export of salmon.  We ensured that justice was done before and we are quite capable of ensuring it is done again.  We are confident we were right before and nothing has changed our minds since.  It is unreasonable to enforce this levy and, so soon as there is a change of Government, those who <Col N="1111" /> suffer as a result of this levy now will be put in the position of having an extra penny or tuppence put into their pockets.</P>

In addition to that £23,000, there is also a sum of £10,000 going back to boards from the salmon fund.  In actual fact there is a sum of £33,000 going back from the Exchequer to these boards in the form of relief.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt Deputy Flanagan will try to put it over that this country can be run without any taxation of any kind on anything.  The Deputy and his friends tried to sell that idea to the people of Cork and Kildare, but they failed to convince them.  The people know only too well now that there is no private Fine Gael leprechaun to produce money for the Government without the Government having to get it from the pockets of the people. That is where the Deputy makes a mistake.  After last Saturday the people may believe in Santa Claus but most people, including Deputy Flanagan, can scarcely believe that there is another Santa Claus who will bring about a change of Government for the Deputy's private benefit.</P>

I referred generally to the particular section on Second Reading.  The section gives the Minister ample power. It was interpreted to my personal knowledge as meaning that the Minister had the power to inquire as to the position of insurance companies.</P>
      <P>The relevant section is section 46 of the Insurance Act, 1936.  Under subsection (1):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may, by notice <Col N="1113" /> served upon an assurance company, require such company to furnish to him within such time as may be specified in such notice, such specified explanations, information, accounts, balance sheets, abstracts and statements as the Minister may consider necessary, for determining whether such company is or is not insolvent.</P>
    <P>What are the facts?  The facts in relation to this particular insurance company are that there was one very large investment on its balance sheet which was not a quoted investment, as the Minister must have been aware.  In spite of that fact, the Minister did nothing about it.  My information is that that position arose some years before the actual liquidation of the Equitable Insurance Company.  It certainly was common knowledge that this company was in a precarious state for a considerable number of months before the Minister moved and in consequence people were paying in premiums all the time after that was known.</P>
    <P>It is not for me to say the date on which the Minister had knowledge of the insolvency, or suspected insolvency, of this company, but it is an undoubted fact which the Minister cannot deny&mdash; and the Minister as an honest man will not deny it&mdash;that he knew for a very considerable time that there was such a state of affairs in existence and that he should have asked for the information under section 46 of the Act.</P>
    <P>The fact that he did not do so has to some degree necessitated this measure.  It is better that we should get from him some indication of the amount involved in relation to the measure.  Admittedly, £30,000 is the maximum amount that will be involved as far as the State's contribution is concerned, but apart from that, how much will be involved?  I make the Minister a present of this piece of information: the amount that has to be paid under the Motor Insurance Bureau alone for claims under that specific risk and which arise because of the defalcations of the Equitable Insurance Company will exceed £100,000.  I do not know what the other deficiencies will be.  The Minister <Col N="1114" /> must have got an estimate, even if only a rough estimate, of the amount at the time he got the estimate in relation to the workman's compensation business.  As well as I can recollect, the words he used the other day in reply to a question were&mdash;I do not want to misquote him&mdash;that some hundreds of thousands of pounds were involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are the words I used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot find the exact quotation.  As I say, £100,000 is involved on the Motor Insurance Bureau side alone.  I did not know whether the Minister was taking the Motor Insurance Bureau into account when he mentioned &ldquo;some hundreds of thousands of pounds&rdquo;, but it is proper that the House should be given the full extent insofar as it is known at present, of this deficiency.  I should also like the Minister, on the Money Resolution, to give us some indication of how this particular case is differentiated from the other insurance company that went into liquidation some years ago&mdash;I think it was called the Irish Employers' Mutual; I remember that it had its Head Office in Pearse Street &mdash;and why that insolvency did not generate the idea of the levy involved here.</P>
      <P>Possibly the Minister may have seen a reference in the newspapers to the fact that one company proposes to challenge this levy, to resist it.  I do not know what is involved in that; I have no more information on it than I saw in the newspapers.  The plain fact of the matter is that this Bill is necessary, to a large extent, because the Minister did not exercise the rights he had in relation to section 46 and I should like him to explain clearly to the House why he did not exercise them in this particular case when, as he knows himself, he was making inquiries in other cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Sweetman in stating to the House, in the presence of the Minister, that the failure of the Minister and his Department&mdash;he must take responsibility for it&mdash;to exercise the ample powers in section 46 of the <Col N="1115" /> 1936 Act has caused considerable public uneasiness.  It must be recognised that under the statutory insurance code, there is imposed on certain categories of people an obligation to insure against certain contingencies and risks.  That has been in this country since the Road Traffic Act, 1933. There are also other forms of insurance risk which, from a practical point of view, any prudent person must insure against and when the State lays down, as this State has done, obligations which require widespread insurance cover, and also lays down a system of control with regard to those who may engage in insurance business, there is in those circumstances a very definite obligation on the Minister who has the responsibility to keep a very watchful eye on what is going on.</P>
      <P>People are encouraged to insure, and I think it is right that they should be so encouraged.  They are told this is our system: that there are certain recognised insurance companies which make deposits in the High Court and which are authorised by the State to engage in insurance business.  They are told also by our legislation that there is a member of the Government specially charged with the responsibility of supervising the conduct of insurance business by recognised insurance companies, and small people who pay their money in the way of premiums and so on are entitled in those circumstances to expect that a section in an Act of Parliament would not be regarded as a dead letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no one in this country in the past five or six years who did not know that the Equitable Insurance Company was in the height of trouble. Anyone who has anything to do with the practice of law must have known from the manner in which the company was carrying on its business that its financial circumstances were at least suspect.  The conduct of the Equitable Insurance Company and the way in which it was carried on was, in a variety of ways, symptomatic of a very doubtful financial situation.  I know that, apart from that, there were, or should have been, indications to the advisers of any <Col N="1116" /> Minister that here was something that required the most careful scrutiny.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, it passes my comprehension how the Minister failed to exercise the ample and generous powers laid down in section 46.  Under section 46 of the Insurance Act, as Deputy Sweetman pointed out, the Minister was enabled to get the fullest information as to what was going on in that insurance company.  He was entitled to examine the records, to satisfy himself with regard to the kind of cover they had for the risks they were insuring.  He was entitled to do all these things.  So far as I know at the moment, and I hope I am wrong, it appears that none of these powers was exercised by the Minister.  Nothing at all was done and the drift of the Equitable Insurance Company to its inevitable end was allowed to proceed. It was inevitable that that company would end in liquidation, as it did, but its liquidation brought with it heartache, tragedy and misery for a great number of people.</P>
    <P>We are discussing a Money Resolution. We shall be discussing in a few moments the details of the Bill which the Minister introduced eventually, after a considerable time lag.  That Bill does not pay the bill due by the Equitable Insurance Company for a whole lot of people have suffered hugely in the past 18 months, who had to suffer in terms of money, in terms of hardship and misery, and who can never be compensated and whom it is not proposed to compensate by this Insurance Bill.  It is not a story I should ever like to see repeated, but I do say, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, when this House passed the Insurance Act in 1936, a responsibility was placed on the Minister for Industry and Commerce to supervise carefully the conduct of insurance business.  This House in giving him power under section 46 of the Insurance Act of 1936 was doing something which it expected to be acted upon.  It did not expect that that Act would go on the Statute Book, and be left there to gather dust, without any of the Minister's advisers from time to time thumbing through the Act to see not merely what their powers were, but also what their responsibilities were.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> It is a bad thing when safeguards are introduced into an Act such as the Insurance Act of 1936 and, once introduced, are to be forgotten.  Insurance is an industry which permanently depends on public confidence.  Fortunately, the people of this country have reached the stage where they appreciate the importance of insurance. The collapse of the Equitable Insurance Company in circumstances of apparent ministerial complacency has shaken the confidence of a great number of people in insurance of this kind.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister has to take responsibility for any act or omission that may appear to be proven and, for that reason, is the responsible member of the Government who has to account to us here for failure to exercise the powers under section 46.  I think this House is entitled to a very full explanation from him as to why the clear powers in that section were not exercised in this instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been astonished by a number of things associated with the collapse of the Equitable Insurance Company.  I have even been more astonished listening to Deputy O'Higgins a few moments ago.  The fact that everybody in the country knew the Equitable Insurance was going to collapse was not evident to me and to other members who had taken out insurance and who had been burned.  At least one member got himself into serious trouble as a result of it.  It is a pity that people who knew about that did not use their knowledge for the purpose of warning others that there was a danger that it was going to collapse.</P>
      <P>We are blaming the Minister now.  I am quite aware we must accept the auditor's certificate.  If we do not accept the auditor's certificate in general, we are then upsetting a recognised principle in this country.  But the one thing that has been worrying me is that if I thought it was because of certain associations with the company that a very doubtful asset was accepted as being there when, in fact, it was not then I would be prepared to pillory the Minister.  If that is not so, then the matter is on an entirely different plane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other comment I should <Col N="1118" /> like to make is that the Minister is apparently covering those who have succeeded in making some kind of settlement through the courts.  That is the point which Deputy Coogan tried to get clarified the other day.  Is it not a fact that cases which have been settled in and out of court are covered by this Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case then, the only third case that could possibly be affected is that of a person who has paid a very heavy sum by way of premium almost immediately before the final collapse of the company. Apparently there is no provision&mdash;possibly there cannot be&mdash;for recouping him.  The amount of money involved is, I suppose, the reason why this cannot be done.  I asked the Minister a question the other day and he did not answer me.  Perhaps he will do so now.  Is it true that quite a lot of the money which was paid in premiums through brokers never found its way to the Equitable Insurance Company? Could the Minister say whether this is correct or not?  Is it true money paid through brokers on a yearly settlement with the company was not paid?  Is it still in the hands of the brokers and, if so, why is that not taken into account?</P>
      <P>Secondly, could the Minister say why a statement was not made as to the extent of coverage still held following liquidation of the Equitable Insurance Company?  I ask that again since their policies were cancelled from 31st July when, in fact, the company was unable to meet any claims from May.  We had the question of people who had road tax on the basis of insurance for another 12 months.  If they had continued to use their road tax which was no use, was a statement made by anybody in authority that the insurance was no longer valid, or no use to them?  I do not think so. Apart from notification sent out by the receiver, people were allowed to go around with a piece of paper about as useful as the Order of Business, read out by the Taoiseach here today, is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think a bad mistake was made in that case and was most unfair to <Col N="1119" /> people who got caught.  A number of people here got caught and had to pay insurance again.  I am aware that a number of people could not afford that at all and, in fact, had great difficulty in finding the original amount and had extreme difficulty in raising the money to cover a second insurance.  I believe that if he was at fault, the Minister was at fault there.  He should have made some effort to clarify the position at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As previous speakers have said, it is obvious that the Minister did not insist on the terms of the 1936 Act being complied with, because if he had, no doubt it would have been discovered at least one year, and possibly two years, earlier, that this company was unable to meet its liabilities.  If that is taken into consideration, the assets of £80,000 mentioned were almost fictitious and could not be regarded as an indication of solvency.</P>
      <P>This £1 million which it is proposed to put into a fund is, in a way, an invitation to unscrupulous insurance companies to neglect their business, knowing that protection is now there and available, which was not there before.  If the terms of the 1936 - Act had been complied with, there would have been no need for the fund which it is now proposed to set up.  It is too late to say it, but the required deposit of £30,000 which applied in 1936 for a licence to transact motor insurance business was very much out of date in 1964.  It is a pity the amount of deposit for a licence was not adjusted in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This £1 million will include a grant from the State, in addition to levies from the insurance companies and also a loan made by the Minister for Finance.  The insurance companies object to the proposal that a levy should be made on their resources, just because one insurance company became insolvent, went out of business, and left a number of liabilities to be <Col N="1120" /> met&mdash;liabilities which the State considers necessary to be met as a result of the Equitable Insurance Company going out of business.  It appears to be most unfair to put a levy on insurance companies in retrospect in respect of money now required to meet the liabilities of another firm which had gone out of business.</P>
    <P>I know the insurance companies will contest this proposal, and I believe their case will succeed.  I do not believe there is any case to be made for the retrospective levy which is proposed here, in order to assist the Government and the State to meet liabilities imposed by the 1936 Act.  It is quite clear that the 1936 Act imposed liabilities and responsibilities on motor vehicle insurers.  When the 1936 Act was passed, no effort was made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the Minister for Finance, to set up a fund such as is now proposed. If that had been the case, it is possible that we would not be confronted with the situation that now exists.</P>
    <P>Of course the basic trouble is that the Minister did not insist on the terms of the 1936 Act being complied with by this particular insurance company. The 1936 Act imposed responsibilities, and no effort was made by the Government in the meantime to set up a fund. It is most unfair at this stage to require the insurance companies to make a contribution towards this proposed fund in order to discharge liabilities incurred by the Equitable Insurance Company.</P>
    <P>I feel this Bill is being put through too quickly.  It is being dealt with on the basis of an emergency.  Of course, there is an emergency so far as the unfortunate people are concerned who were not covered by the funds of the Equitable Insurance Company, and who are now waiting to be paid in respect of injuries and losses which were supposed to be covered by the Equitable Insurance Company under the 1936 Act.  Instead of trying to rush this Bill through the House, as he is doing, the Minister should try to bring in some brief piece of legislation which would enable the immediate liabilities to be met, and then general legislation to cover all aspects and contingencies <Col N="1121" /> could be brought in at a later stage when the facts could be debated at greater length and more carefully.</P>
    <P>If we put through this Insurance Bill which may meet what it is designed to meet, that is, the immediate situation that has arisen, I feel at a later stage the defects arising from hurrying this Bill through will become apparent.  For that reason, I am not happy about the Bill going through as it stands, although I am anxious to see the people who are waiting for compensation paid equitably and as quickly as possible.  There are many cases of very great hardships.</P>
    <P>Various aspects have already been mentioned by other speakers and I shall not repeat them on this occasion. Certainly all the points mentioned by previous speakers are worthy of consideration and if they were considered, we would have before us a very different Bill, a more comprehensive and possibly a more appropriate Bill.</P>

      <P>The 1936 Insurance Act imposes an obligation on the Minister for Industry and Commerce to require insurance companies to lodge their accounts annually in a <Col N="1122" /> specified manner.  It does not require the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the officers of his Department to audit the accounts of insurance companies, or to assess the assets of insurance companies as disclosed in the returns made to the Department.  I explained at some length on the last occasion, when concluding the Second Reading debate, the details of the procedure&mdash;the requirements upon the insurance companies in connection with the lodging of their accounts.  I do not think it is necessary to go into them again.</P>
      <P>Under section 46, there is an obligation on the Minister for Industry and Commerce to cause inquiries to be made if a doubt arises about the solvency of an insurance company.  I do not accept at all what Deputy O'Higgins has said.  It is as much a surprise to me as to Deputy Tully that it was common knowledge in the legal profession that the Equitable were in a difficult position for five or six years. If that was common knowledge, it certainly did not reach me or people like Deputy Tully who entrusted their insurances to the Equitable.  Apparently it did not reach the other insurance companies either because up to a short time before the liquidation was sought in the High Court, the other insurance companies continued to do business with the Equitable.  One would imagine that other companies would be the very first to hear whether difficulties had arisen in connection with a particular company with which they were doing business.</P>
      <P>It is true that rumours started some time in the early part of 1963 about the position of the Equitable Insurance Company.  The accounts of the Equitable Insurance Company for the year ended 30th June, 1962, were required under the Act to be lodged with the Department of Industry and Commerce at the end of that year, on 31st December 1962.  It was common practice for insurance companies to require a further three months within which to lodge their accounts and, again, this was provided for in the 1936 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was provided in the 1936 Act that the Minister for Industry and <Col N="1123" /> Commerce could give extensions up to 31st March in the next ensuring year within which insurance companies could lodge their accounts.  A request to this effect was received from the Equitable Insurance Company and they gave the reasons.  Their first reason was that the managing director of the company died suddenly in January, 1962, that is, during the accounting year in respect of which the final accounts were lodged.  The second reason advanced was that because of a change of auditors in August, 1962, they were unable to lodge their accounts by the end of 1962 and therefore required the extension, which was granted.  It is not necessary to show such serious cause for the application for extension of time and it was, as I have said, granted to the Equitable, as, indeed, it was to other insurance companies.  During the period of the extension, these rumours circulated.  In the meantime, my Department continued to press the Equitable for the lodgment of their accounts, even before the end of March.  Nevertheless, they had of course the extension given under the statute.</P>
    <P>On 3rd April, 1963&mdash;just three days after 31st March&mdash;it was found that the Equitable had not yet lodged the accounts for the year ended June, 1962.  Officers of my Department contacted the Equitable Insurance Company and pointed out that they were in breach of the statute&mdash;although they were not, up to 31st March, 1963 &mdash;and pressed them to lodge their accounts.  A typescript copy of the returns was then immediately forwarded. Even though that copy of the returns was not complete, it did appear from them that the company was not solvent.</P>
    <P>A reference has been made to an asset written into the previous returns of the Equitable indicating assets to the value of some £70,000 or £80,000 in favour of the Equitable Company. The returns made do not require the insurance company to identify these assets.  These assets are written into the returns without identification of the investments.  They are written in as &ldquo;investments&rdquo;, with the value of the <Col N="1124" /> investments.  It is not a function of my officers to evaluate these easements.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Tully pointed out here today, the whole pattern of business and trade in this country, and in many other countries, depends on the services of auditors.  They are qualified people and are specifically recognised under the Companies Act.  Their qualifications are recognised.  It is practice here and elsewhere to accept auditors' certificates.  The auditors' certificates accompanied all the prior returns of the Equitable&mdash;certificates to the effect that the returns and the accounts disclosed the true position of the company and that the value of the assets disclosed was accurate and correct to the knowledge of the auditors.  As well as that, they were certified as being so correct by the certifying officers of the insurance company itself.</P>
    <P>When it did appear from the incomplete typescript copy of the returns that the company was insolvent, I certainly delayed some further weeks in an attempt to salvage the position of that company.  I saw representatives of several insurance companies, both British and Irish.  I felt that to act precipitously in any way would damage not only the insurance industry itself but might damage the wider field of Irish economic endeavour.</P>
    <P>When my efforts to assist the Equitable over the troubles failed, I had then no alternative but to petition the High Court, as I did on 11th May, 1963, for the appointment of a liquidator by the court.  That was done on 21st May.  Had it been done on 21st January, I ask the House if the situation would have been materially different.  Would it not have been the case that some insured persons would still have unexpired portions of their year of cover and therefore of the value of their policies still to run? Would there not be a considerable amount of money due to policy holders who had claims made against them by people either in their employment, in the case of employer's liability, or people who were injured as a result of alleged negligent driving of the insured person?  The fact is that when <Col N="1125" /> on 21st May the liquidator was appointed, a certain number of claims were outstanding and there were certain unexpired premiums in respect of which no claim had been made and probably were not made subsequently. Nevertheless, the people who had paid those premiums found they were not covered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully suggested that some explanation should have been provided as to the value of insurance certificates held by the people who had paid these premiums.  I was in no position to say if the assets of the company would have covered the claims against them. I understand that the liquidator who was appointed by the court acted in accordance with the directions of the court and not otherwise.  I believe he went as far as the circumstances, as he then knew them, allowed him to go with regard to notifying policy holders. With regard to the amount that was involved <i>in toto</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are not proposing to take account of the value of unexpired premiums because the purpose is to meet the claims of hardship cases. Of course any person who was insured and has a claim against him will be a hardship case.  It is expected that it would require considerably more time than we envisage here if we try to repay the balance of premiums of policy holders.</P>

      <P>That is a matter I am afraid I cannot take into account just now.  I may say, in reply to a question by Deputy Tully, which unfortunately I omitted to comment on during the course of my reply to the Second Reading debate, that I have had no complaint other than what the Deputy said, that brokers collected premiums and failed to pass them on to the Equitable Insurance Company.  If that is the case, it will be a matter for the liquidator to get after the brokers and to demand payment of the premiums they collected for and on behalf of the Equitable Insurance Company.  I have no doubt the power of the court will be adequate to ensure that whatever payments are outstanding will be brought into the account of the Equitable fund.</P>

Deputy Rooney suggested, on his legal knowledge, that there was no doubt about the outcome of an action some insurance companies were contemplating taking about the constitutionality of this Bill.  I am advised it is constitutional; Deputy Rooney has stated it is not.  I am prepared to act on and rely on the advice I have got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, first of all, in relation to what the Minister said, I make no charge about his not insisting that the accounts to 31st March, 1962, should have been returned earlier.  I fully accept and understand the circumstances in which they were not asked for then.  I agree with the Minister's statement that it is correct that similar extensions of time have been requested and granted in other cases by him.  That is not the gravamen of my charge at all.  My charge is that the 1936 Act was brought in to ensure that there would be an end to insolvency in Irish insurance companies.</P>
      <P>The whole reason for the 1936 Act was that insurance companies were then insolvent.  The Minister is fully aware that the purpose of the amalgamation of the life and industrial insurance companies was the fact that many of the companies were insolvent. The then Dáil was given an assurance that there were ample powers in this Act to make certain it would not happen again.  It has happened again on two occasions.  The Irish Employers Mutual fell down.  There were no public funds paid to remedy the unfortunate circumstances in which certain people found themselves at that time.</P>
      <P>We now have the second case. Everybody with any intelligence must accept the fact that it is not possible for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to audit the books or the accounts of an insurance company but it is the function of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to assess the value of the assets set out in the balance sheet.  It was his function to assess the value of the assets set out in the balance sheet filed in respect of the year ended 31st March, 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> I never saw that balance sheet.  I only know what is in it by hearsay.  I am told that examination of that balance sheet would show anyone that there was an imbalance in it, which would mean that the Minister should look for the further information which section 46 of the 1936 Act specified. The balance sheet was not such that anybody picking it up and looking at it would say: &ldquo;Of course the company is insolvent.&rdquo;  That was not the position. The position is that it is not right for the Minister to say he has no function to evaluate whether or not an insurance company is solvent or is insolvent.  He has that function.  He was deliberately given that function in the 1936 Act and he failed to exercise it in respect of the delay in the extensions of time he gave and he failed to exercise it in respect of his analysis of the balance sheet to 31st March, 1961.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken it that we are challenging his doing nothing about the matter between 3rd April and the date when he moved in May.  Again, I make no accusation against him whatever in respect of that period.  If 3rd April, 1963, was the first time he knew the Equitable was insolvent, then we certainly would not argue that a month or five weeks, or whatever it was, was an unreasonable time for him to cast around and see what he could do.  But I challenge the Minister to stand up in this House, knowing him to be an honest man, and say that 3rd April, 1963, was the first time he knew the Equitable Insurance Company was insolvent.  I challenge the Minister to deny that the directors of that company knew six months before that the company was hopelessly insolvent, and yet no action was taken by the Minister in pursuance of the powers vested in him under the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to explain one thing I said, on which Deputy Tully and the Minister commented. I said, in relation to the practice of law, that anyone in practice in the courts would have known for some five or six years before the eventual crash of the Equitable that it was heading that way.  I want to repeat that.  But what I said is not based on <Col N="1129" /> any particular knowledge of the trading position of the Equitable, its balance sheet or anything of that kind. I was referring to the fact that the Equitable Insurance Company had become a byword in the courts for endeavouring to avoid the clearest possible obligations for the most outlandish reasons.  It was well known that, if it were a case involving the Equitable, the most far-fetched and bizarre reasons would be advanced for the company to escape liability.  That particular course of conduct involved the Equitable in the most expensive of litigation, which inevitably, to anyone appreciating the very high standard ordinarily operated by most insurance companies, would put one on notice that a company carrying on that way must inevitably end in trouble.</P>

      <P>In relation to the Minister's remarks concerning retrospective effect, there is approximately £250,000 involved.  That is a lot of money, particularly when it relates to unfortunate people who have suffered heavy loss, may be loss of limb or even loss of life.  The Bill tells us that the Minister will provide a grant of £30,000 and will seek a loan from the Minister for Finance.  He is going to levy the remainder on the existing insurance companies licensed under the 1936 Act. I know the Minister has a legal right to impose this levy on the insurance companies in order to make up this fund.  In the last Budget, there was a retrospective clause in respect of corporation profits tax.  The same principle is being operated here.  We should have an end to that kind of retrospective legislation as soon as possible.  It may have been considered justified in relation to corporation profits tax, but we are introducing the same principle here. In the long run, it is not the insurance companies who will pay this money, but the ordinary man in the street.  He will have to pay a substantial proportion of this through premiums.  The insurance companies have no money to pay out except the money they collect into a fund from the various policy holders on their books.</P>

I wish to tell the House, also, that I took legal advice about my position, and the eminent senior counsel who moved the petition for winding up in the High Court advised me that without the accounts I should not succeed in that application.  The accounts were my evidence of the state of solvency, in so far as they did disclose the solvency of the company.  The previous accounts did not show the company to be insolvent.

      <P>It is no harm I should mention at this stage that as soon as the liabilities of the present case are met or are about to be met, the fund will hardly be allowed to accumulate again.  The sum of £30,000 will be contributed capital, non-repayable, by the Minister for Finance. <Col N="1133" /> The Minister will make available a loan and the accountant of the Courts of Justice may raise funds for the balance, to be repaid out of the fund which will be provided by the insurance companies.  The period for payments into the fund will be a considerable number of years, perhaps.</P>
      <P>Coming towards the last year, if a certain amount is outstanding for repayment of principal and interest to the Minister for Finance, the levy in that year will be fixed to about equate to the sum outstanding.  It is likely that from there on the levy will not be requested so that there will be no question of allowing a huge sum to accumulate.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The fund will get demands on it from the present Equitable Insurance Company case, running over a period of years.  It will not be a question of waiting for the Equitable liquidation and then saying that £x will be put in.  I assume it will be dealt with by drawings on the fund from time to time as the liquidator and the court decide. The amount will be borrowed from the Minister for Finance and that amount can be repaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it proposed to get the amount repaid in the one year or is it proposed to collect the amount over a period of years, or has the Minister yet come to a decision on that?  My understanding of the borrowing provisions in this fund is that when the liquidator certifies £x are required to be drawn from the fund, with the consent of the President of the High Court that would be <Col N="1134" /> borrowed by the accountant on the fund and paid over forthwith and the levy will be brought in by repayment of the amount borrowed, or does the Minister propose to build the fund up at once in anticipation of what will come?  It could be done either way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be done either way.  Our intention is to have a consultation with the insurance companies to ascertain what method of payment of the levy they would prefer. I would be prepared to recommend to the Minister for Finance that the period of levy would extend over a considerable number of years so that the impact on the insurance companies in any one year would not be very great.</P>
      <P>I do not know if I explained the position satisfactorily when replying to Deputy Rooney.  I shall take an example, as near as I can get.  Assume that £200,000 is needed.  As Deputy Sweetman said, the method of payment into the fund by the Minister for Finance will probably be, as the Deputy suggested, according as the court and the liquidator decide during the period.  Assuming that £200,000 was the total amount required, then we could have a period of, say, ten years during which the levy could be paid and assessed according to the premium income of the respective insurance companies, and, say, in the 10th year or 15th year, as the case may be, there would remain to be repaid to the Minister for Finance, say, a sum of £20,000.  My intention at this stage is that the levy in that final year, be it the 10th, 15th or 20th year, would roughly equate or almost exactly equate, the £20,000 necessary to pay off the Minister for Finance in respect of the Equitable fund and there would be no question of another fund accruing in the meantime.  There would not be any other obligation on the insurance companies, unless another liquidation under the court&mdash;which God forbid&mdash; occurred.</P>

It was felt, although, perhaps, not rightly felt, that judgment could have been obtained against insured persons of excessive amounts, amounts that would be far in excess of what the claim was worth; in other words, if an insured person who would normally defend an action against him decided, because this fund was being created, not to defend or to be dilatory or in any way careless about his defence of the action, to such an extent that the court might award an unduly high amount of damages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The main part of section 3 is subsection (1) and I assume that the object of subsection (1) is to cover the case of a claim being made against a policy holder of, say, the Equitable Insurance Company and to indemnify a policy holder fully in respect of the claim.  If the object or spirit of subsection (1) is carried out the money should go from the fund to the policy holder and should be <Col N="1137" /> applied by him to satisfy the claim made against him which was covered by the policy.  Am I right in saying that that is the object of subsection (1), roughly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain that the sum goes to the policy holder or to the aggrieved party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my trouble.  Under this it appears to go to the policy holder.  I read the subsection:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provision of this section, there may be paid out of the Fund to the liquidator of an insolvent insurer ... such amounts as may be necessary to pay any sum ... which is due to a person under a policy issued by the insurer in the State ...</P>
      <P>The only sum that could be issued to a person under a policy would be the sum due to a policy holder by the indemnifying insurance company.  The person claiming against him would not have any privity with the insurance company and would be a third party. So that, &ldquo;a person&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;which is due to a person under a policy issued by the insurer&rdquo; must mean the policy holder.  It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>and is in respect of a contingency the insurance of which is required by the Act of 1936 to be effected by an insurer ...</P>
      <P>And it says:</P>
      <P>together with the costs or expenses (if any) necessarily and reasonably incurred by the person in endeavouring to secure payment of the sum ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and then on receipt of the sum the liquidator shall pay it out.  If this money is to be paid by the liquidator to a person under a policy and if I am right that it goes to the policy holder, first of all, what safeguard is there in this section that it will, in fact, be applied in discharge of the claim brought against the policy holder?  I know there is the ordinary safeguard that any person has against having himself made bankrupt or in debt but there can be circumstances in <Col N="1138" /> which the policy holder might get a payment out of the fund which is earmarked to discharge a particular claim brought against him and may, in fact, cash the cheque and disappear.</P>
    <P>Secondly, if the money is to be paid to the policy holder, what is meant by the last two sentences at the end of page 3:</P>
    <P>together with the costs or expenses (if any) necessarily and reasonably incurred by the person ...</P>
    <P>that is, the policy holder&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>in endeavouring to secure payment of the sum.</P>
    <P>The only cost the policy holder could have incurred in endeavouring to secure payment of the sum would be in relation to the proof of that debt in the liquidation.  What appears to me as probably intended to be covered is the costs and expenses of the claimant against the policy holder.  If that is so, the section would obviously require some redrafting.  I cannot see how the policy holder could be involved in costs or expenses in endeavouring to secure payment of &ldquo;the sum&rdquo;, which is the indemnifying sum. I do not know whether I am applying the wrong view to the section but subsection (1) baffles me.  If I correctly interpret it as providing that from the fund shall go to the policy holder a sum to discharge his claim on the company in liquidation under the policy, there is no safeguard provided for the discharge of a claim against the policy holder and the provision in relation to costs and expenses appears not to make sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The insurance company gives the policy holder a policy indemnifying him against any loss, liability or contingency.  It is the policy holder that is covered.  Supposing a motor claim results in a settlement for £3,000.  Before that £3,000 can be paid to the person who secured the award the policy holder has to sign his consent.  He must consent to the payment of £3,000 to the person who was awarded that compensation. The fact that the policy holder must consent to the payment shows he is regarded as the person <Col N="1139" /> who is covered, and that consent permits payment direct to the person to whom compensation is payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand at all how it is proposed to work this section in general and I should like a little clarification on it.  Supposing Mr. Browne goes into court and gets a judgement against Mr. Smith, who was insured, for £10,000, will there then be a direction by the judge, assuming it is a High Court case, that the liquidator of the Equitable Insurance Company get from the insurance fund that £10,000 as an isolated case?  Or will the position be that from time to time the liquidator will say: &ldquo;I must pay out now to Mr. Smith £10,000 which has been adjudged against him and, therefore, I want to draw on the fund to the extent of £10,000&rdquo;?  Or will the liquidator wait until he is able to go to the court in the liquidation and say: &ldquo;It is obvious there will be a £100,000 deficit.  Give me £100,000 for the fund?&rdquo; If it is to be the second general case, it seems to me it is all wrong. When Mr. Browne gets against Mr. Smith a decree for £10,000, he is entitled to leave that with the sheriff so that the sheriff can seize Mr. Brown's goods and put them up for sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely if we are providing this fund at all, there must be a method by which we can prevent the insured having an additional loss thrown upon himself and perhaps thrown upon the fund by the moneys being made available at the very earliest possible time they can be.  I should have thought that the cheapest way of dealing with this would be that a general declaration would have been made by the judge in the liquidation. That is what the Bill should have provided if it was to be done in this way at all, a general declaration by the judge that there is a deficit in the Equitable Insurance Company's accounts and that, accordingly, when a judgement is given by the court against somebody who shows he has a valid policy, there and then in that action the appropriate certificate issues. Otherwise there will be quite unnecessary duplication of applications to the <Col N="1140" /> court in the liquidation under subsection (1).  Perhaps I have misunderstood the matter, but if the Minister will explain what practice he visualises, it may help us to understand it better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply, first of all, to Deputy O'Higgins, the costs and expenses referred to here are the costs and expenses of the person who seeks to be reimbursed from the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I thought but it does not bear that meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it does. It was felt in the Department that the reference to costs and expenses was unnecessary but the draftsman insisted that it go in.  The sum due, in any event, would be inclusive of costs and expenses incurred in actions already decided.  These are not the costs and expenses referred to here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman raised the point&mdash; and to an extent Deputy O'Higgins raised it too&mdash;of the difficulty of a person having been decreed and not having the money available, that there might be a danger that the plaintiff or the applicant might not get his money at all or that he might be in too much of a hurry and have the goods of the defendant seized.  In the first place, the fund will find itself in the same position as the insurer's company and when a person is decreed the obligation of the insurance company is to indemnify that person against whatever costs and damages have been levied against him. As in the case instanced by Deputy Sweetman, if Mr. Smith has a decree given against him, Mr. Smith will then claim against the liquidator and prove his claim with the liquidator.  I expect that in cases where there might be some difficulty about the plaintiff being in too much of a hurry, the liquidator would be able to act and would be able to provide the amount of the costs decreed for the plaintiff in the case.  In any event, I doubt if, in the circumstances, the plaintiff would be in a hurry to have the judgment, mortgage or whatever it is registered against the defendant and so put the defendant's property in jeopardy as long as he has the knowledge the fund <Col N="1141" /> is there.  Of course, as Deputy O'Higgins is aware, there is the method of garnishee in case anybody wanted to hold on to the money out of this fund.  In any event the liquidator will be able to act under the authority of the court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I meant.  Does the Minister visualise that the liquidator will have to go to the court for directions in every case to pay a judgement when he is going to get the money out of the fund?  If so, the cost of doing it this way will be quite fantastic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he can do it either way.  Once the claim is proved, he can pay it or ask the court for authority to pay it.  However, that is going into some detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am worried about is that there will have to be a specific application for every case.  It would be endless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the difficulty Deputy Sweetman raises and I want to say a word about it but I also want to get back to what I said originally.  It appears to me this subsection requires redrafting and I suggest that to the Minister.  If the object of the section is as he said, imagine the position in relation to a person who is a policy holder of the Equitable, against whom a claim has been brought.  That person, first of all, must be indemnified fully against the judgement debt, plus the costs of the persons who sued him, the plaintiffs. That person should also be indemnified against any legal costs and expenses that he has been put to in investigating or resisting the claim brought against him.  That would appear to be the minimum that a policy holder is entitled to expect from a measure of this kind and I understand it is the aim of the Minister to provide that protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trouble I see in this section is that this is not done.  The section says in its operative parts that out of the fund there shall be paid to the liquidator such amount as shall be necessary to pay any sum which is due to a person under a policy.  That sum <Col N="1142" /> would be the amount of the judgment debt and the legal costs and expenses of the plaintiff.  It is clear there that, so far, what must be paid out to the person under the policy is the amount of the claim recovered against him and the costs and expenses of the plaintiff in recovering that sum.  Then it goes on:</P>
    <P>... together with the costs or expenses ... necessarily and reasonably incurred by the person ...</P>
    <P>that is, the policy holder</P>
    <P>... in endeavouring...</P>
    <P>In the case I have mentioned the section should say: &ldquo;in endeavouring to resist the claim&rdquo; or words to that effect but the provision is:</P>
    <P>... together with the costs and expenses ... necessarily and reasonably incurred by the person ...</P>
    <P>that is, the policy holder</P>
    <P>... in endeavouring to secure payment of the sum ...</P>
    <P>The policy holder was not endeavouring to secure payment of the sum but to resist the claim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely &ldquo;to secure payment of the sum&rdquo; is going into court and asking the liquidator to pay out money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>A person who has fought the claim, since the Equitable has gone &ldquo;bust&rdquo;, is left there like Deputy Desmond in a situation in which he had to go into court and fight the claim which ordinarily should have been covered and resisted by the Equitable and his costs and expenses in fairness should be claimed upon the fund.  I gather it is the Minister's intention that it should be paid but under the section, as drafted, I do not think it can be paid because only the costs and expenses of the policy holder &ldquo;reasonably incurred in endeavouring&rdquo; means his costs of going to a liquidator and saying: &ldquo;Discharge it&rdquo;.  For that reason, I suggest that the section be looked at again from the point of view of redrafting if what the Minister has in mind&mdash;as I can well understand&mdash;is proper protection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some mention of this in the section and I think it is very clear that it is the sum due to a person under a policy issued.  That sum must take account of a decree, plus costs of plaintiff, plus the defence's cost of either investigating a claim admitted or in resisting a decree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because under the policy there is provision that the company will cover only legal costs and expenses incurred with their express consent in writing.  These words are in every insurance policy. It follows, by reason of the emergency created by this liquidation, that the costs and expenses of resisting the claim have not been incurred by the consent in writing of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the situation in respect of policies.  All policies have the provision in them that the company will not reimburse for costs incurred without their express authority. As I understand the position, the liquidator has been, understandably&mdash; I am not criticising him&mdash;taking the line since the liquidation: &ldquo;I cannot tell you anything about it; you will have to stand on your own resources and come along afterwards and see what you can do about it.&rdquo;  If that is so, under the terms of the policy the insured has no right against the liquidator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an act of grace, an insurance company would normally pay those costs but we cannot consider acts of grace here.  We must consider express rights and the only express right the person has against the liquidator is in respect of (a) damages given against him, (b) plaintiff's costs given against him and (c) his own costs if under the policy he had got express instructions to resist the claim from the insurance company.  If that provision were not in the policy, you could have people <Col N="1144" /> resisting claims, not telling an insurance company at all and enormous bills incurred.  It seems to me that on the phraseology of section 1 Deputy O'Higgins's argument is quite incontestable.</P>
    <P>I also want to come back to the other problem.  This fund is to be administered by the Accountant under the control of the President.  I think that was the phraseology used in relation to any funds held in court.  The Minister might be better, in his private capacity, in so deciding than I should be.  He might have a better knowledge of the sections, but I think it is the same as the ordinary provision.  If I am right in that, it means that the Accountant will only pay sums out of this fund on the specific order of the court and I think the intention is that the Accountant would only pay sums out of the fund to the liquidator on the order of the court.  I think that is what the Minister intends and I can understand that.</P>
    <P>When, however, you come to read that practice in conjunction with section 3, subsection (1), leaving aside the point raised by Deputy O'Higgins, &ldquo;which is due to a person under a policy issued by the insurer&rdquo;, then it seems to me you must have two things: you must have the application to the court for payment out of the fund and you must have it in respect of each individual claim unless you can perhaps bulk three or four claims that happen to come in in the same week or two.  Will that not mean a very much greater and an unnecessary expense on the fund?  Surely the fund could be operated on a much more satisfactory basis?  The liquidator has either got to do the job or not. Liquidation is, in my opinion, the wrong way entirely of doing the job, but that is neither here nor there.</P>
    <P>Surely the proper way to do it would be to operate the fund on a float basis. Then the liquidator could go to the court and say the company was insolvent and he must have funds to meet claims as they came in.  He could ask the court for £50,000 out of the fund to meet the claims that would come to him between now and next <Col N="1145" /> October, say, when he could come back to the court, account for what he had done, and ask for more.  Would not that be much easier, much cheaper, much more satisfactory?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It probably would, but the Deputy must remember that this is a liquidation under order of the court.  We could, perhaps, go a bit of the way in easement of the procedure in that the liquidator may come to the judge and say: &ldquo;I have 15 or 20 cases in which judgement has been given.  The costs have been assessed and I want an order for the payment out of £x to cover the 15 or 20 cases&rdquo;. There is no reason why a judge could not give an order in respect of specific cases, McGowan against Smith, Murphy against O'Brien, O'Sullivan against O'Donovan, and so on.  There would not be necessity at all times to go before the court in respect of each individual case for which payment would be required by the liquidator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not an ordinary court liquidation.  The liquidation is there and the court agrees, but we are providing that the dividend in the liquidation will be met, which is an entirely different situation, and it is not an ordinary court liquidation.  If it were an ordinary court liquidation the point is that the court must ensure that no one creditor is paid before the others because, if he were, he might be paid a greater dividend in the £ than his colleagues.  In this case there is no such dividend problem at all. <Col N="1146" /> This is 100 per cent payment so long as it is a case coming within the purview of subsection (1) and, if it is a case that comes within the purview, there will be 100 per cent payment.</P>
      <P>There cannot be any question of preferential payment and the only effect of doing it this way will be to make the costs very much heavier.  I can see certain people being surprised that a solicitor should object to that, but I do object to it because it will bring the law into disrepute whereas it is not the law but the schema of the Bill and its drafting into the section which should be brought into disrepute because this is not being done in the cheapest way possible.  Indeed, I am amazed that the Minister does not try to have it done cheaply.  I shall try to draft an amendment.  Whether or not I will be able to is another matter.  I have not got the resources the Minister has at his disposal.</P>

    <P>When the Minister heard these rumours, on which, I agree, he could <Col N="1148" /> not go to the court and ask the court to wind up the company, he could, nevertheless, have gone under section 46 and asked the company under that section, &ldquo;by notice served upon an insurance company, requiring such company to furnish to him ... such specified explanations, information, accounts, balance sheets, abstracts and statements as the Minister may consider necessary.&rdquo;  He had only to look at the last Equitable balance sheet when he heard these rumours.  Incidentally, may I say that my recollection is that the Minister did table the Equitable accounts for 1961, as requested by me, but they cannot now be found in the Library.  I cannot tell, therefore, who signed the accounts because I am perforce in the situation of having to depend entirely on the abstract schedule.</P>
    <P>In the balance sheet of 31st December, 1961, there is a figure of £104,603 included for stocks, shares and debentures. It is the only insurance company in the schedule.  Table 19, where the amount of equity stocks is greater, and substantially greater, than the amount of Government securities.  I am talking now about non-life companies. The proportion in the other companies is £946,000 to £226,000, £907,000 to £69,000, £312,000 to £178,000, £640,000 to £256,000, £367,000 to £130,000 and £49,000 to £9,000, and in one case alone, the Equitable, was the proportion £71,000 to £104,000.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister knows as well as I know that non-life companies do not invest their funds, except very much surplus funds, in equities.  The overwhelming proportion of non-life funds is always invested in fixed interest Irish securities rather than other securities. On the face of Table 19 of his own return, the figures at 1961, which must have been available to him a fair time before he moved, there was sticking out like a sore thumb something that required the certificate that should have been given, and probably was given, under section 101.  There was, too, an obligation on the Minister to inquire in relation to that sore thumb that stuck out even before he heard the rumours but most certainly when he had heard the rumours, <Col N="1149" /> whether section 101 had been complied with in respect of these funds or whether it had not, and if it had not, how the computations had been made.</P>
    <P>The Minister was frank enough to say that he had heard rumours.  The obligation was on him, as is disclosed in this summary, without hearing any rumours, but surely to goodness there was a double obligation on him, when he heard rumours, to get the information and to make certain that the securities were valued in accordance with the 1936 Act?  I know in the case of another insurance company where there was some difficulty over the interpretation of this section that the securities were valued specifically under that section in what I might call the harshest possible way against the company concerned because of the specific provision to review.  The fact that the figures stand out like that, for the only company that has this type of imbalance, was surely something which the Minister had an obligation to examine and, not having examined it, should have examined it when he heard the rumours.</P>
    <P>His defence that, whether he moved in January, or whether he moved in May, there was going to be loss to somebody, is a pretty bad defence.  To say that it does not matter, where things are wrong, that you can let them run on because there is bound to be some loss anyway, is a defence that really does not do justice or credit to the Minister.  When he reflects on the matter, he will realise that that statement was not worthy of him personally, or of his office.  The fact is that section 101 could not have been complied with in respect of the Tower Insurance Company if there is some £80,000 of this £104,000 that is there on the balance sheet.  The Minister had an obligation to deal with it, and still has an obligation to ensure that the appropriate steps are taken against the persons who signed the certificate that did not come up to the strength required in the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman referred to my defence.  Let me say at the outset that I do not regard myself as being on trial at all.  I carried out <Col N="1150" /> my functions in relation to the Insurance Act, 1936 as I saw fit, in the best interests of everybody concerned. As the Deputy is aware, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, there was a sequence of events in the Equitable Insurance Company which would have made it difficult in any event to get the facts that section 101 of the 1936 Act enables me to get in certain circumstances, one being the change of auditors.  I want to suggest that when I did move in respect of the request for the returns from the Equitable, the returns were made in a matter of days after the final statutory time in which it should have been submitted to me. I do not believe that to have moved in any other manner would have made for any greater expedition in the ultimate bringing of this matter before the High Court, and therefore in the ultimate disclosure of what the true position of the Equitable was.</P>
      <P>The ratio between securities, Government and other gilt-edged, as against equity securities is not as ominous as Deputy Sweetman has suggested and certainly not to the point of sticking out like a sore thumb, having regard to the fact that the certification, which was necessary, was done, and having regard to the fact also, as I have already suggested, that it was not my business to audit the accounts of the insurance company nor does Deputy Sweetman suggest that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I say is this: I have not been defending myself or my Department in any way.  I have given a factual account of the sequence of events which indicated that when I got the accounts on 3rd April, three days after the final statutory date, on the repeated insistence of officials of my Department, they were examined, even though they were incomplete, and then I moved.  I moved after a reasonable time, after some weeks, and that is something about which Deputy Sweetman does not upbraid me because he accepts that I was right in trying to do something to avert the situation that had arisen.  As far as the bringing to account of the people concerned with this certification is concerned, if there was a false certification as there <Col N="1151" /> appears to be, then I suggest it is in the best hands possible in the circumstances, in the hands of a judge of the High Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say quite categorically that it is the Minister's duty to bring it to the notice of the judge?  Secondly, may I say the Minister did not fulfil his functions under the Act.  He has functions under section 46 and he acknowledges that he never asked for any information under that section.  That is the gravamen of the charge, not in relation to 3rd April. He was quite right in the 3rd April situation, but he never asked for the information under section 46.  I admire the Minister for not denying that he had this information.  It was common gossip for six months before.  I did not think it was common gossip for the period one of my colleagues suggested. The Minister was fully aware of that gossip and never asked for information under section 46.  He should have and, if he did, perhaps whatever accumulation arose in that situation might never have arisen.</P>

      <P>The Minister has mentioned the levy and I should like to ask him whether he has considered how much the levy is likely to be, taking into consideration what the premium income was in 1962 or 1963.  If he examined the premium income for either year, I think he would be in a position now to indicate what percentage he had in mind when he introduced subsection (a) regarding percentages of the annual aggregate income of insurers derived from premiums payable in a specified time.  I think, at this stage, considering that this proposal will probably cause an increase in premiums, either temporary or permanent, he should be able to indicate the possible percentage levy that will be applied.</P>

      <P>As I told the House already, I propose to discuss that matter with the insurance companies. I think I dealt with it fully and I am surprised at Deputy Rooney asking me the same question over and over again.  I said I would consult with the insurance companies and I would recommend to the Minister for Finance <Col N="1152" /> a long period.  That being so, the levy would be a small amount against the insurance companies, so small that it would not make any difference so far as the level of premiums is concerned. To sum up, the insurance companies might like to have it paid for quickly or might agree with my views that it be extended over a long period.</P>

      <P>Whether they were life companies or not.  Some of them transacted other types of business.  If my recollection is clear, the resolve of this House then was that a similar situation would not arise again.  At the time the amalgamation took place, a large sum of Government capital had to be injected into the amalgamated company in order to restore solvency.  Over the years that have elapsed since then the amalgamated company has of course become a very worthy company, but at the time of its institution, without the injection of a large capital sum by the Minister for Finance, the liabilities then outstanding could not have been met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to the 1938 Act, not the 1936 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the amalgamating Act.  That amalgamating Act was not embarked upon without protracted and <Col N="1153" /> anxious consideration of the whole situation then obtaining.  It was present to the mind of the Government in 1936 that a difficult situation existed in Ireland at that time in the life insurance world.  We all knew that the condition was very rocky.  As the Minister will appreciate, life companies did not present so immediate a problem as companies engaged in accident and general insurance because the claims which were likely to mature against the life companies were actuarially ascertainable.  In the atmosphere then obtaining, I think the Insurance Act was designed to ensure that a situation would never be allowed to arise in this country in the future such as was then known to exist in regard to the insurance companies.  That situation rapidly progressed but not without long and protracted negotiation to the Insurance Bill of 1938 which created the amalgamated company, which subsequently took over all the other industrial life insurance companies operating in this country.</P>
      <P>I cannot imagine that it was absent from the mind of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in his corporate capacity that the time of the Insurance Act of 1936 was one in which we had become aware of what is a catastrophe in the life of any company, that is, that the insurance companies were about to fall.  So grave was that emergency considered in 1936, 1937 and 1938 that the companies then in danger of collapse would not be allowed to collapse, without having recourse to any other company.  The existing companies were notionally amalgamated.  They were combined under deficit and in the amalgamating Act provision made to fill that deficit. The intention was to ensure that such a catastrophe as then happened would never happen in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certain that the powers conferred by section 46 were designed to invest the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for the time being, with all the powers he needs.  If he heard the rumours, as in 1936, he could move in and get the information he required in respect of any insurance so that time might be taken by the forelock and the mercantile capacity of an insurance <Col N="1154" /> company falling could be avoided.  The note attached to section 46 has &ldquo;powers in cases of assurance companies of doubtful solvency&rdquo;.  The note does not say &ldquo;Powers in cases of insolvent insurance companies.&rdquo;  It charges the Minister with a specific responsibility in the case of companies of doubtful solvency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman says he will not attach more than six months to the period during which the insolvency of the Equitable Insurance Company was a matter of common gossip.  I do not know how the Minister goes about his duties under section 46, but anyone could have told him, I think, long before six months that the rates being quoted by the Equitable Insurance Company for the insurance of scutch mills in County Monaghan were of a character that no sane insurance company had ever quoted since the dawn of time.  It was common talk in Monaghan that scutch mills were being insured in Monaghan at premiums approximately one-quarter, or less, of the traditional charge for that highly precarious risk.  I do not move in insurance circles, but I heard that talk myself in Monaghan.  I do not know if the Minister for Transport and Power is sufficiently familiar with Monaghan to have that kind of information, but if he makes inquiries, I think his supporters will tell him that it was notorious at that time&mdash;I do not think there are many scutch mills in Monaghan now because flax has ceased to be widely grown&mdash;that the premiums were grotesque.</P>
    <P>I am as sure as I am standing here that the belief of this House was that in the 1936 Act we had armed the Minister for Industry and Commerce with all the powers necessary to prevent the kind of catastrophe which was threatened at that time from occurring again.  We all recognise that in accordance with ordinary practice the board of directors of a given company are entitled to rely on the certificate of their auditors if they are auditors of good standing, but I do not think there is a parallel between that situation and the statutory duty of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1155" /> I suggest to the Minister that the very note on this Act which says: &ldquo;Powers in case of insurance companies of doubtful solvency&rdquo; put on him an obligation in his capacity as Minister, with all the resources at his disposal, to at least take a cursory look at the schedule of assets presented by an insurance company as collateral for risks.  I am not suggesting there is any statutory duty on the Minister to go down the whole list of the assets and have them valued, but looking at a long list of securities quoted upon the Stock Exchange, one would get a reasonably approximate idea as to whether the assets were correctly represented by the value placed upon them in the auditors' certificate.</P>
    <P>If you are presented with a schedule of assets, the largest item of which is not quoted at all on any Stock Exchange, is it unreasonable to say that the Minister, specifically charged by section 46 of the 1936 Act to watch on behalf of the public the circumstances of any insurance company of doubtful solvency, should say: &ldquo;Here is an immense part of your assets represented by one security for which there is no quotation and no readily available evidence as to whether it is anything more than a stock certificate&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Do I greatly exaggerate if I say that the shares of the Tower Insurance Company were not worth much more than the paper and ink requisite to make out a stock certificate?  Once that fact came to light, the whole financial foundation on which the Equitable Insurance Company stood collapsed. I cannot but feel that if I were an insurance agent, never mind Minister for Industry and Commerce with the vast resources at his disposal, I would have to scratch my head and consider very carefully my clients' rights if I had put their affairs into the hands of an insurance company the assets of which upon close examination proved to be substantially non-existent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman said he approves the Minister's frankness in admitting the course of action he pursued, but I am at a loss to understand how, in view of section 46 of the 1936 Act, <Col N="1156" /> the Minister does not find himself obliged to say: &ldquo;Perhaps I did not act with sufficient circumspection and vigilance.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel the Minister has fallen down very gravely on this matter. The Minister will agree that for all the acts of his Department, he is personally responsible to this House. He takes the credit and accepts the blame.  I think he should say quite frankly: &ldquo;I do not think I have acted under section 46 of the 1936 Act with all the viligance and expedition that might reasonably be expected.&rdquo;  I am bound to say I do not think he did. I feel that the Minister's failure to discharge the duty devolving upon him under section 46, to the grave detriment of certain individuals who, I think, were entitled to assume that he did discharge this obligation, would constitute a very equitable claim against the Government for full compensation.</P>
      <P>If I were an insurance agent and had familiarised myself with section 46 of the 1936 Insurance Act, if I had put the affairs of my clients in the hands of an insurance company of this kind, I would be inclined to look at a balance sheet and say: &ldquo;It looks very queer to me but, my gracious me, if they have satisfied the Minister under section 46, is there any obligation on me to check on the Minister for Industry and Commerce?&rdquo; I ask the Minister could he find it in his conscience to blame an insurance agent who looked at a balance sheet and felt there was something queer about it because the value of the principal asset could not be tested by any public quotation, found that the premium quoted was very competitive, and said: &ldquo;After all, under section 46 the Minister is responsible in the case of any company of doubtful solvency.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think he would be justified in saying that the company was not doubtful, because if it were, the Minister would move, and if he moved and found anything wrong, which his inquiries would bring to light, the <Col N="1157" /> appropriate steps would be taken to put the company out of business.  If I put it that way to the Minister, would the Minister say that an insurance agent who depended on the vigilance and prudence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the time being, armed with the powers conferred on him by section 46 of the 1936 Insurance Act, was seriously remiss?  I do not think he would.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 46 was to put that duty on the Minister.  The Act was passed in the light of the experience at that time of the catastrophe that had overtaken the company and its customers, and we intended it to be used.  Either we did not put in it what we intended at the time, or else in 1964 the Minister had not used it as we assumed he would when we made that law.  I should be glad to hear from the Minister, supposing he had used those powers exhaustively which he had under section 46, might a great deal of this trouble not have been averted? If he did not use them, he is in a position to tell the House why.</P>

The Third Schedule includes a certificate.  The Minister has an obligation to consider whether the people who gave that certificate, and who are still alive, would not have the obligation of making the payments required to this fund rather than the ordinary public who have been duped. I do not know the financial strength of the persons concerned.  I know that the Managing Director died. However, specific certificates were given and the matter stuck out like a sore thumb.  We can see all the accounts, one next the other, in the summary.  Nothing was done when that summary was put together and when it should have been stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knew that there were <Col N="1158" /> what I shall call euphemistically rumours around.  Nothing was done under section 46.  The Minister has come here and said he does not believe the section gave him the power or the duty of evaluating assets.  Section 46 is utterly meaningless unless it gave him that power.  The obligation was put on him by that section and it was not discharged.  The Minister does not admit it, but he stands convicted before the public of not having taken the action which section 46 of the 1936 Act deliberately empowers him to take.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether or not I am in order to raise this matter at this stage but I feel that a deposit of £100,000 should not be sufficient for the issue of a licence.  I think the insurance company should have sufficient assets, apart from the sum deposited, in order to permit them to go into active business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that an insurance company is able to gather together £100,000 and then get a licence for the transaction would not appear to be adequate.  That is the kind of situation that this fund might meet, namely to meet the liabilities of some company that would go out of business because they have no assets except a sufficient sum to deposit in order to get the licence, that is, a sum of £100,000.  Therefore, I feel that the <Col N="1159" /> section is not satisfactory.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1 which stands in the name of Deputy McGilligan:</P>
      <P>In page 3, section 6, subsection (5), line 44, after &ldquo;order&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;which shall be open to amendment by way of reduction in the amount of the grant proposed to be varied.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Last week, when we were winding up on this Bill, Deputy McGilligan asked the Minister for an explanation.  As reported at column 969 of the Official Report, Volume 211, No. 6, Deputy McGilligan said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may be able to <Col N="1160" /> advise me now on a point.  I had an amendment to section 6 which deals with the annual grant to the Board. The Minister also tabled an amendment and told us that the type of order he contemplated under section 6 was a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; type of order and could not be amended. The chief difference between my point of view and his was that my amendment was that the order should be open to amendment.  The Minister's reply was that the parliamentary draftsman had more or less insisted on the form we have from the Minister.  I asked the Minister why and he agreed that he was not briefed on the matter and proposed to be briefed at a later stage.  Has he got the explanation now as to why my form, asking that an order should come in draft form and be open to amendment, is wrong?  I am asking this for the purpose of putting down an amendment.</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle said:</P>
    <P>I do not want a debate on this. I can see the Deputy's point of view.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The main answer is that this procedure could equally apply to the Seanad.  You could have a position of hopeless confusion with amendments upwards and downwards in the Seanad and upwards and downwards in the Dáil and it is not considered desirable.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan said:</P>

    <P>The Minister then said:</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that under the procedure laid down in the Constitution, if the Seanad amends a Bill already passed by the Dáil, or in the case of a Money Bill makes recommendations, the Bill must come back for further consideration by the Dáil.  There is no such procedure for ministerial orders and the situation could arise, if the Deputy's amendment were accepted, that the Dáil could amend the order in one way and the Seanad could amend <Col N="1161" /> it in another way, and there is no procedure for reconciling the amendments between the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan then said:</P>
    <P>I thought the point was that if a draft order were made and were open to amendment&mdash;this is about varying the subsidy&mdash;an amendment might be proposed which would increase the amount in any year and thereby put a charge on the State.</P>

      <P>This is the last paragraph. Deputy McGilligan then said:</P>
      <P>That could be met by saying something like &ldquo;open to amendment by reduction&rdquo;, and that is the way I propose to word it.  I gather that the Seanad might make recommendations and there is no way of reconciling them.  I thought the situation was clear that the Dáil in the end over-powered the Seanad.  I propose to examine what the Minister has said and I propose to put down an amendment with the phrase &ldquo;by way of reduction&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That is what is here.  Deputy McGilligan asked the Minister last week to give an explanation.  The Minister said he had not been briefed and he proposed to be briefed at a later stage. I should like to hear from the Minister now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be possible to frame an amendment in such a way that no further variation could be tabled in the Seanad.  I have thought over this matter since the last debate and I think I have met Deputy McGilligan very amply by my own amendment to section 6.  It will be recalled that the arrangements for providing the subsidy after April, 1969, were that an order under subsection (5) of section 6 would be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  I think Deputy McGilligan made a good point when he suggested that there should be <Col N="1162" /> a Resolution in the Dáil and that the debate should take place on it.  I accepted that amendment and I slightly altered his amendment.  My amendment to section 6 was to delete subsection (5) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Where an order is proposed to be made under this section, a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In that connection Deputy McGilligan described it as an improvement in the Bill in the sense that even if the previous arrangement stood of having an order laid on the Table of the House which could be annulled or otherwise, there would, quite obviously, at that stage, have to be quite an elaborate White Paper giving the reason for a change in the subsidy, giving the background of CIE, giving the full pattern of the traffic changes which would have occurred since the enactment of this Bill, giving particulars of changes in costs, the amount of traffic secured and the position as it would be affected by the then prevailing volume of private traffic. Under my amendment, suggested by Deputy McGilligan, there would be a debate in this House in which I would outline the main features of the White Paper and perhaps provide some additional notes.  I think I have gone far enough in that regard.</P>
      <P>My amendment, under section 6, does not change the scope of this House to debate and propose an alternative to the draft order.  It preserves the position where, in the event of the House being of opinion that an order should not be approved in the form submitted, the Minister of the day will not be denied an opportunity of considering fully the implications of any suggested change and, if deemed necessary, of consulting the Government.  So, if Deputies feel the subsidy is excessive, they can suggest it should be lessened.  I understand they are not permitted to suggest an increase of subsidy by the rules of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> I have gone as far as I can in regard to this matter.  It is quite obvious to me, from a purely practical point of view, if the Opposition felt that the subsidy was excessive, and if the Government were defeated it would be a matter of very considerable importance.  I should think that such a defeat would be regarded with great seriousness.  It would be a very serious matter for the Government and it seems to me it would be quite sufficient to mention a sum by which the subsidy should be reduced if there were a conflict of opinion in regard to it.</P>
    <P>I feel quite unable to go any further than I have already gone in satisfying Deputy McGilligan's attitude concerning section 6.  There could be a full-scale debate, apart from the debate on the annual Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power and apart from any discussion which could take place on the annual report, by way of special Resolution.  It would be a case in which the whole position of CIE would be explained to the House and the reason for any change in the subsidy fully justified by facts and figures.  There would be no need to do anything so elaborate as to make a Pacemaker document available.  It would only be necessary to indicate in some detail the financial position of CIE.  If the Opposition feel the subsidy is too much, they are fully entitled to suggest a lesser sum and have the matter debated in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress, I was referring to the ultimate fate of the canals and urging on the Minister for Transport and Power that the proposal to close the canals in the city of Dublin and use them as a sewer was one he ought resolutely to oppose, because quite apart from the use of the canals as a means of transport, they are recognised now in most civilised countries as a potential amenity of great value, both to the cities through which they pass and the rural areas in which they exist.  Of course, it is true that their amenity value depends on the extent to which they are maintained. Far from being an amenity, they can become a nuisance, if they are abandoned and allowed to become filthy and uncared for.</P>
      <P>The time has clearly come when we ought to make up our minds as to what amenity value we attach to the canals and then determine what our permanent policy is in regard to them. It is always a source of astonishment to me to observe on the continent of Europe the extent to which canals are used for transport.  It is also true that in certain areas of Great Britain canals are extensively used for transport purposes. The history of the canal system here has been unfortunate, because they existed before the railway system was fully extended throughout the country.  Both canals were paralleled by railway systems and subsequently, in an unfortunate decision, it was determined to make the canals and the railway company into one.  Not unnaturally, the railway company became concerned to take from the canals the maximum amount of transport they could secure for the railway system.  It became a kind of vested interest on the part of the railway company to destroy the canals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all history now.  We are left with the problem as to what will happen to the canals hereafter.  I suggest to the Minister they have an amenity value amply sufficient to justify their retention.  We have to <Col N="1167" /> face the fact that, if we retain them in the city of Dublin, human nature being what it is, children will bathe in them.  I cannot believe it is going to put an intolerable burden on the resources of the State to maintain these canals in reasonable condition to make it possible for children, without damage to their health, to avail of this amenity in hot weather.</P>
    <P>We are constantly lamenting here the absence of good swimming pools and constantly resolving that something should be done about it.  I should be glad to see the number of swimming pools available to the city greatly increased.  As far as I know, at present the swimming facilities available to the children of this city are approximately exactly the same as they were 50 years ago.  At that time the Iveagh and Tara Street Baths were functioning.  As far as I know, no substantial addition has been made to that accommodation since.  That is a great reflection on our society, and even if we do succeed in remedying it, there is a great deal to be said for allowing the canals to continue to function within the city limits, not only for the scenic picture they provide for the citizens but also because, children being children, they can be used for swimming.</P>
    <P>I apprehend that if you begin by filling in the canals in the city centre and turn them into sewers, it is only a matter of time until they are abandoned throughout the country.  At the moment in the country they constitute a very valuable tourist amenity on account of the coarse fishing they can be made to provide, which is peculiar in that the restocking of the canals is a very simple matter and the banks are so constructed as to make fishing from them peculiarly attractive to the type of tourist we are trying to bring into the country.</P>
    <P>There is a category of tourist who will be drawn by such facilities into the parts of the country which ordinarily would not participate in the tourist trade.  The Minister knows that in the constituency of Monaghan there was little or no tourist traffic four or <Col N="1168" /> five years ago.  As a result of the exertions of the Inland Fishery Trust, the lakes have now been stocked with coarse and other fish and there is a very substantial income pouring in from tourists who avail of these facilities.  Coarse fishing could be made available in all parts of the two canal systems right down to the midlands and there are thousands of potential tourists who would gladly avail of the accommodation provided in hotels and boardinghouses in small towns if they had access to the canals for coarse fishing.</P>
    <P>I urge on the Minister most strenuously that he should concern himself to preserve the canals and to ensure that the purpose of turning them into sewers in the centre of the city should be frustrated.  I said to him before, and I repeat it, that it is a pity his Department are not equipped with some specialised engineering advice because he may find himself confronted with public-spirited public servants who have high engineering degrees and who will press on him the view that there is no alternative accommodation for important new sewage works which will be required in certain parts of the city which are undergoing the process of development, unless these sewers are put in the Grand Canal.  The Minister should fortify himself with alternative advice to suggest alternative means of dealing with the problem and avoid the situation of being forced to accept the solutions that will be pressed on him by certain municipal interests, whose purpose I can fully understand but who are primarily concerned to lay a sewer and not primarily concerned with the amenity value of the canal to the citizens of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I often wonder if, when we are formulating policy for transport in this country, we are allowing the whole situation to get out of control.  How far has anybody undertaken inquiries into the relative cost of maintaining the railways and of the road works that have been made necessary by the transfer of rail freight to the roads? Up to four or five years ago, it often struck me, driving through Ireland, that one of the distinguishing features of this country as a tourist centre was <Col N="1169" /> that there were roads on which you could drive a car without any serious delay.</P>
    <P>Sometimes, passing through a town, there might be slight congestion, but on the open road you never experienced any serious obstruction in driving. As time went on, this distinction between our roads and those on the continent grew wider and wider until eventually we reached a stage where in Germany you were on these hideous and detestable autobahns which are now being extended into France and elsewhere.  You got on to these abominations and drove like a lunatic along them, seeing nothing of the country, quite detached from it, and eventually came to the point where you could not drive at all.  In Britain, the construction of these large arterial traffic-ways has been proceeding so fast that any weekend motoring is out of the question.  All around London, Liverpool or any of the principal cities, it has become impossible to get out or back.  If you got out, it was time to come back by the time you got there and you might be out until three or four o'clock in the morning.</P>
    <P>That never was a feature of our countryside but recently, in the past four or five years, I have been experiencing more and more the irritation and the inconvenience of driving along roads which are not congested with traffic but which are very substantially obstructed by the large pantechnicon type of vehicle which is manifestly the consequence of closing down rail facilities, and the new apparition of the articulated vehicle consisting of a large six-wheeled lorry drawing a large six-wheeled trailer behind it.</P>
    <P>These can create an obstruction as insoluble and exasperating as the worst traffic jams on English roads and even more dangerous because sooner or later somebody can be expected to take his life in his hands, leave the queue of traffic following this enormous vehicle.  If he can get away with it, he is a public benefactor; if he does not, he will, of course, be looked on as a public enemy.</P>
    <P>It does alter the character of the roads and it will tend to alter it more and more with the passage of <Col N="1170" /> time.  I am informed that in the Pacemaker Report, of which we did not get copies, though a copy was placed in the Library&mdash;I did not see it and no copy was furnished to me for the use of the Opposition, and, to my knowledge, none of my colleagues has been given a copy&mdash;there is given a figure which I find hard to believe that of all the goods traffic in Ireland only seven per cent is carried by the railways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a more realistic figure.  Suppose we go on tearing up the railway and go on shifting that on to the road.  As we know, the transport of livestock involves the most pernicious type of pantechnicons which constitute a peculiar obstruction on the roads, both smelly and obstructive. At least, if you travel behind a large vehicle transporting ordinary goods, you may suffer irritation but not suffocation, but if you travel behind a two-storey cattle wagon or two-storey sheep wagon on a hot day for a protracted period, you would want to be in the whole of your health to survive it.  If this goes on, has anyone made any estimate of what the cost will be (1) to maintain the roads and (2) to expand the roads to carry this volume of traffic?</P>

      <P>That will be a problem, I take it, for another Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all upbraiding the poor Minister for Transport and <Col N="1171" /> Power that he is responsible for nothing. Somebody has even said that he is the Minister for jets and debts and nothing else, but I cannot believe that the Minister is not responsible for the resolution of the problems of transport. If he sheds that responsibility, he will be naked altogether.  On his shoulders ultimately devolves the responsibility of shifting the traffic in the country&mdash;passengers, goods and livestock.</P>
      <P>I am suggesting to him that his policy of indefinitely tearing up the railroads is being pursued without due regard to the true cost of it and I am beginning to wonder if we have been right in this policy of tearing up railroads at all.  We have closed the stations.  We have created the redundancies which caused a great deal of distress and accepted the liability that substantial compensation for redundancies involved us in and yet anyone who goes out on the roads will tell you that although very considerable roadworks are proceeding and we are now spending&mdash;is it not&mdash;£8 million or £10 million a year on the roads, that these roads, although adequate for all foreseeable volume of normal traffic are being made inadequate by the intrusion on them of a type of traffic for which they were never designed.</P>
      <P>I do not feel that when the Minister was recommending this policy to the people that he and the Government of which he is a member were ever concerned to give the people all the truth of the picture because I begin to suspect that if we had simply said to the railways: &ldquo;Carry on; go on carrying freight and goods and livestock out to West Cork and passengers from Waterford to Tramore&rdquo;, far from involving us in extra cost by way of subsidy, we would have made a substantial saving.  We would have kept the railways in being and would have provided a great deal of steady employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that is not a fashionable think to say at the present time.  The fashionable thing is to say that Dr. Beeching has done it and therefore we must do it, and Dr. Beeching must <Col N="1172" /> be right.  I am not sure that Dr. Beeching is right.  I do not think our circumstances are the same at all as those obtaining in Great Britain.  One thing I do know is that it does not seem to be happening anywhere on the continent of Europe.  I see trains battering away on the continent and carrying great quantities of freight. And the canals.  I do not know that there is this immense diversion of traffic on the roads.</P>
    <P>I think this is the kind of thing Irish Ministers for Transport and Power in the Republic of Ireland are forgetting: When I go sailing along the autobahns in Germany or France, I ask myself what part of the cost of these roads has been charged up to transport and what part has been charged up to defence.  I should say that the bulk of the cost of the great new traffic arteries of Europe is really charged up to strategy and defence.  They were primarily put there for the purpose of moving armies quickly and I do not believe that if that necessity had never existed in Europe, these autobahns would ever have been constructed. Certain it is that the cost will grow and grow and grow and in many cases the convenience of those who have to travel will be seriously abridged.</P>
    <P>I often hear Deputy Lynch here talking about the people who used to go to Tramore for the day and the rapidity and convenience with which they could go at fixed hours.  They are now required to travel by bus.  It is costing them more, I believe, and the county council has on its shoulders an immense burden of cost to provide new roads and CIE has made some economy. Has anybody worked out the saving effected by CIE and set it against the inconvenience to the passengers, plus the cost to the passengers, plus the cost to the county council, plus the disruption of the people who used to work on the Tramore railroad, and found where the balance lay?</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that this is a matter that is deserving certainly of review.  If on investigation it is proved that this view cannot be sustained then I want to put it to the Minister that an entirely new situation <Col N="1173" /> arises.  If we are reconciled to the fact, as the Minister appears to be, that of the 20 per cent of the total goods transport still handled by the railway company a further substantial part must go over to the roads which are to be maintained by the county council and the road grant, what case can the Minister make for not throwing open goods transport to public competition?</P>
    <P>I can see a case being made against throwing passenger traffic open without restriction to public competition. In every sort of circumstance conceivable, it will remain necessary to provide some kind of passenger transport in all parts of the country and if you throw passenger transport open to commercial competition, there will arise the danger that it might not materialise and it might happen that in certain parts of the country they did not have public transport at all.  I think you must preserve some public transport in these parts of the country if you withdraw the existing rail services but I cannot conceive of any situation arising in which freight transport would not become available in any part of the country even if CIE should withdraw from it and leave it to open competition.</P>
    <P>I feel bound to say that if we are to make up our minds to the fact that, in substance, the railways are to be closed down and the freight traffic transferred to the public road, the whole question of whether freight traffic should not be left open to competition will call for early and urgent review.</P>
    <P>I am bound to direct the attention of the Minister to a fact for which he perhaps would seek an appropriate explanation.  I am told by my constituents that for a bus journey on an excursion day from Monaghan to Dublin, one rate is quoted and for the same occasion for a similar excursion from Cavan to Dublin, a very substantially lesser rate is charged.  The people who live in those parts are persuaded of the fact that the reason why a very much more competitive rate is available for Cavan is that there is surviving in the town of Cavan a very well run and efficient independent <Col N="1174" /> bus service and that the competition of this bus service induces CIE to quote a very much lower rate for that trip than for the Monaghan trip. There does not seem to be any substantial difference between the two trips but local people feel the comparison is very dramatic and is deserving of examination with a view to determining whether the Cavan trip is run at a loss or whether CIE is compensating itself for the Cavan service at the expense of those who have to travel to Monaghan.</P>
    <P>I ought to draw the attention of the Minister to another odd development. I am told&mdash;I have not personal experience of this&mdash;that in the past at the CIE hotels the practice was that they would quote the price for bed and board at so many guineas a week. Certainly when I frequented these hotels, if you paid that, you got all your meals and accommodation and the amenities of the hotel for the weekly sum quoted to you.  I am told that recently a new practice has emerged, that is, if you make reservations at some of these hotels, you arrive to take up your room; you come down to dinner and discover there is one dish on the menu which comes within the overall charge but there are three or four other dishes quoted, all of which involve a supplement. I am told there are certain services which used to constitute part of the overall charge and which now have been made supplemental charges.</P>
    <P>If I am any judge of the reaction of visitors, they are quite prepared to deal with a hotel company on the basis that they are taking a room for the night and all other services are charged at scheduled prices or they are prepared to pay an overall charge.  What they bitterly resent, if they accept the overall charge which has been quoted, is then to discover when they have committed themselves to a holiday that there are a whole lot of supplements introduced which appear to them to be a little short of fraudulent. I put it to the Minister that he might politely suggest to CIE that if that is the practice, as I believe it to be, in some of their best hotels, they are setting <Col N="1175" /> a very bad headline from the point of view of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>CIE ought to provide two scales of charges: one for your room and then everything else to be added to the bill; or, alternatively, one charge to cover all the amenities of the hotel and no supplements added thereto of an unreasonable kind.  When we pay 24, 26 or even 30 guineas a week for bed and board in a good hotel in a summer resort, we do not expect them to supply us with champagne, beer, wine and spirits as part of the overall charge, but short of that, I imagine that guests staying on these terms should be entitled to whatever is going without any further supplements.</P>
    <P>I should be glad to hear from the Minister whether he is prepared to say if any accurate computation has been made of the economies that have been effected in the rail service and the consequential costs that have devolved upon the public authority in maintaining and providing additional road accommodation.  It is interesting now to realise that we are faced with a situation in which, after six years of illusion, we have apparently reconciled ourselves to the fact that the railway can never pay again.  I spoke somewhere else today on the fundamental difference between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, that we believed in the practice of planning for the future, not for today or tomorrow but for next year and the years that lie ahead, and that Fianna Fáil believe in programmes which operate for a year without very much regard to what the ultimate consequences will be.  The permanent burden which CIE is now to be upon the nation, I suppose, is one of the fruits of the Fianna Fáil programme for transport.  It is not a result upon which I can congratulate the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is another matter of principle that urgently requires to be settled and it was made the subject recently of a very interesting article by a distinguished ex-member of the public service who is now deeply involved in the commercial life of the country.  He wrote an article in the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> in which he advanced the proposition <Col N="1176" /> that it was nonsense to ask a State company to remunerate its capital, that if a State company met its depreciation and its charges, that it conferred so much benefit on the community as a whole by way of employment, the earning of foreign exchange, and so on, that it was unreasonable to ask it to pay interest on the capital involved in it.</P>
    <P>I want to contest that proposition but I do not intend today to go into the pros and cons of that argument which is of rather wider scope than this Estimate permits.  However, I want to put this to the Minister for Transport and Power: if this theory has been given the aura of respectability by recommendation from so distinguished a source, is not the Minister for Transport and Power himself largely to blame owing to the extraordinary attitude he has adopted despite his public professions that he thought all State companies ought to pay their way?  He has evolved this new jargon of the operating surplus.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that if for his own information he wants to work out the theory of an operating surplus, no harm is done, but if he wants to keep the people honestly informed of what the true position is, he should admit that an operating surplus is as deceptive to all ordinary reading as the form in which he sets out the net losses of CIE in Table I of his White Paper.  I agree that when you proceed to query the Minister on the true meaning of Table I in this White Paper, you can see what he meant, but on first reading, you get the impression that the losses were much larger than they were in fact.  But if you present a report saying that such and such a company has an operating surplus on the previous year of £400,000, the average reader says: &ldquo;That is splendid; they are making this profit.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not do that. I have been very clear in all my Estimate speeches in regard to the air companies and also I have stated it specifically in public, that the capital is not remunerated.  With all due respect to the Deputy, that was clearly <Col N="1177" /> put forward in the past two or three years.  I have done my utmost to make this clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But of course a great deal of the original investment in Bord na Móna was written off in the early days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Only for wartime operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but Bord na Móna are in the peculiarly fortunate position that in respect of the bulk of their output, they can ascertain the cost and charge a suitable price to the ESB who are obliged to buy it from them at that figure and the ESB pass on that cost to the consumer.  That cost over the year is a substantial figure if <Col N="1178" /> you compare the cost of generating one unit of electricity at a peat-fired station with the cost of generating one unit at an oil-fired station at approximately the same time.</P>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure that in respect of each of these companies, without going into the merits here and now of whether they should be required to finance their capital charges, there should be a clear statement.  If we say there has been an operating profit of £100,000, it should be noted that the capital furnished by the State amounts to so many millions on which the State is still paying so much per annum.  If that were regularly done and a policy decision were taken as in the case of Irish Shipping &mdash; or whatever company the Minister mentioned&mdash;that they were to plough back all their earnings into capital investment for expansion and leave the standing charge on the Exchequer, then we could say the maintenance of Irish Shipping on its present basis is costing so many hundred thousand pounds per year.  But I feel that in respect of some of the State companies this matter is not sufficiently clear.  I think it should be clear.</P>
      <P>If that information were always available, than we could annually determine in an informed, sensible way what the real value of some of these enterprises was to the community as a whole.  I think it is true that the ESB remunerates all its capital and imposes no charge at all on the Exchequer and no question there arises, but in regard to other State companies, where they do not do this, I think very specific mention should be made of it annually so that we know where we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see the force of the case, which can be argued, that in this modern day and age in which we live, to maintain air communication between ourselves and the continent of Europe, it is necessary that we should have airlines operating over whose services we would exercise ultimate control and I should be prepared to face Oireachtas Éireann and inform them that it costs so much per annum to have that; but I think it is thoroughly unsound and undesirable that the people should be persuaded that that or any other <Col N="1179" /> service is making what they believe to be a profit when they are told of an operating surplus, when in fact it is involving them in substantial annual cost.  How far it is right to charge up to our airlines, or air services generally, the capital costs of the airports is a matter that should be carefully examined.  I do not think it is clear from the accounts what the airports cost to maintain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There again the accounts are in the Appropriation Accounts and they include all the information required, that is to say the total cost under all heads, the revenue and the depreciation and interest. These are published in the Appropriation Accounts every year and submitted to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister ever had, as I have had, the experience of presiding over the Committee of Public Accounts for many years.  It is true that these accounts are considered by that Committee but even with the assistance of the Comptroller and Auditor General, what these accounts really mean in terms of profit and loss precisely is extremely difficult to determine.  I think a simple statement showing positively and clearly what each of these companies is costing, bearing in mind what the Government are paying out in respect of borrowed capital, would be more satisfactory.</P>
      <P>In the case of Irish Shipping, I should be prepared to accept the proposition that no additional charge fell on the public purse over and above remuneration of its original capital. That is the standing annual charge. The ploughing back of its surplus capital development is a policy decision and does not affect the annual charge that devolves upon the Exchequer but without that kind of specific information brought directly to the attention of the House, I do not think rational or coherent decisions can be taken on the desirability or otherwise of maintaining some of these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, for reasons best known to himself, has allowed himself to be <Col N="1180" /> manoeuvred into the position in which he feels himself constrained to present himself before this House as a Minister extremely reluctant to give information about any State enterprise which the House manifestly feels it ought to have.  I do not minimise the problem of providing this information in a practical form.  I recognise that, if the Minister accepted liability to answer for every detail in the day-to-day administration of State companies, the situation would become virtually impossible, both in the view of the State company and in the view of the procedure of this House.  I do not feel, however, that the Minister is giving the House the information which Deputies are entitled to expect from him in regard to many of these State companies and, unless and until he can, on behalf of the Government, present the House with acceptable machinery for getting this information other than that provided by way of Parliamentary Question, he is, I think, in default and is therefore called upon to justify the attitude he has taken up. If he is in a position to offer the House some alternative means of getting this kind of information, then he can seek acquittal but, until he does, I think he deserves to be condemned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is noteworthy that the Electricity Supply Board has proved to be a very valuable customer for Bord na Móna.  Indeed, I do not think Bord na Móna could possibly carry on were it not for the fact that most of the turf produced is consumed by the ESB.  The demand for electricity is expanding and we can rest assured that the demand for peat produced by Bord na Móna for the generation of electricity will also continue to grow.  Generation is also aided, of course, by hydro-electric, coal-fired and oil-fired stations.  There has always been a feeling that the production of electricity from water is the most economic method of producing electrical power.  Economy in the production of electricity is an important factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been using four sources of generation&mdash;coal, oil, water and turf&mdash; and we should now be able to set down the costs of generation in each case <Col N="1181" /> and discover which is the most economic. I believe there is still scope for more hydro-electric schemes to feed in to the network a greater quantity of units.  The greater the quantity of units put in, the greater the possibility of cheaper electricity per unit.  The cost of electricity at the moment is substantial.  Domestic consumers find the costs pretty high.  Electricity, however, is an important modern amenity and almost essential to modern living. Whatever the cost, people must use it for domestic purposes, industry, agriculture, and so forth.</P>
    <P>I should like to have some information &mdash; the Minister may be able to give it to me when he comes to reply &mdash;in connection with the proposed power station at Kilmore Quay, County Wexford, in the Waterford estuary.  I should like to know whether that station will be oil-fired or whether it will be interchangeable, enabling coal or turf to be used instead of oil.  Will it be adaptable or will it be operated on one kind of fuel only? The consumption of fuel will be fairly substantial and the production of that fuel is a matter of concern from the national point of view and from the point of view of those who might be engaged in producing the fuel.</P>
    <P>With regard to transport, it is of course a fact that private lorry owners in general haulage are confined to very limited areas.  CIE have a monopoly so far as commercial transport is concerned. Some general hauliers have all-Ireland plates; others have plates limited to specified areas; others are restricted because the weight of the vehicle is another limiting factor.  CIE have, as I said, a virtual monopoly, and CIE are not by any means the most efficient transport carriers. Private enterprise is practically nonexistent and the result is that the cost of transporting goods is much higher than it would be if private enterprise were allowed to operate.</P>
    <P>I can give one example.  A CIE lorry was sent from Sligo to north County Dublin to take a load of hay back to Sligo.  Believe it or not, it was four days before the hay reached Sligo. A private haulier could not possibly <Col N="1182" /> carry on business if he were to operate in that manner.  Obviously the cost to the State and to the taxpayers of transporting a load of hay from north County Dublin to Sligo over a period of four days shows how uneconomic the service is.  Apparently the man in Sligo who required the hay could not avail of the service of a private haulier.</P>
    <P>Again, there are people desirous of operating private bus services and the public would be glad to have these services. In most rural areas, transport services are not economic.  I believe an opportunity should be given to private enterprise to provide services in various areas, subject to the approval of the Department.  I can speak for only Dublin, Louth and Meath, but possibly the same argument applies to other counties.  In the early 1930's there was a wonderful bus service provided by a number of private firms.  They were bought over and instead State buses were provided but the people can still remember the excellent, efficient and cheap transport system which was provided by those firms.  We may have to go back to that system again if services become less efficient and more costly, particularly in the areas which are not paying their way.</P>
    <P>The canals were mentioned this evening, the services they are providing and the need for protecting our waterways. A number of people want to see these canals preserved but if the taxpayers wish to have them preserved and maintained they should contribute a lot more towards their maintenance to support whatever facilities or amenities the canal can provide.  The Royal Canal has been closed, although it is still open to navigation and must be maintained by the Department of Transport and Power, but if people want this canal preserved, an effort should be made to popularise whatever facilities or amenities it can provide. The position in regard to the Grand Canal is much the same.</P>
    <P>There was a considerable amount of debate recently when it was suggested that it was in a perfect position in Dublin city to carry a public sewer in connection with the expansion and development of the city.  Nobody will <Col N="1183" /> dispute the fact the city is expanding rapidly and that there is an urgent need for a main drainage scheme.  It was pointed out that this part of the canal is not being used, that the water in it is obnoxious and that weeds and grass grow in it, and, generally speaking, it is a nuisance and a danger to children who wish to swim in it and who become entangled in the weeds or get caught in the mud in it.  It is also, of course, a danger to health.  If the canal is to be preserved, the Department of Transport and Power should make an effort to clean it up and make it what people describe it as, that is, a very picturesque canal which should be preserved.</P>
    <P>If it were preserved, it would be availed of by people interested in boating and sailing and, as Deputy Dillon mentioned, a certain amount of coarse fishing could be encouraged on it.  I know that in Great Britain people are delighted to get even a few yards along the edge of a canal to engage in coarse fishing.  I met some of those people over here and they were delighted with the fishing available.  I am talking now about fishing in general, but we could develop canal fishing here as they have done in Britain and this would afford relaxation for a number of people interested in that pastime.  With the canal in its present condition people could not enjoy any of the amenities I have mentioned, such as boating, sailing or fishing, within the city boundary.</P>
    <P>On the question of providing a main drainage scheme, we must face the fact that this is urgently needed and a decision on where it must go must be reached soon; otherwise, it will hold up the expansion and development of the city.  As it is, areas immediately outside the city boundary cannot be developed because the existing drainage system cannot cater for further development.  Strangely enough, the Grand Canal follows the line that would seem to be necessary for a drainage scheme for that part of the city and for that reason people have suggested that the sewer pipes be put into the canal.  There was considerable opposition to that suggestion.  It <Col N="1184" /> is possible of course that instead of putting the pipes into the canal, they could be dug in alongside it.</P>
    <P>That would seem to be the most economical arrangement for placing these pipes, which are six or eight feet in diameter and in which an average sized man can stand up.  Apparently that is the line which this new drainage scheme will have to follow.  Public opinion is against using the canal for the purpose of carrying this sewer but it seems to me that that line will have to be followed unless the gardens of a large number of people are to be dug up and sewer pipes laid under them, or perhaps, ten feet beneath their kitchen floors.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I should like to mention is the matter of disused railroads.  I read in the report that in 1922 the railway system consisted of 3,500 miles but that it has now fallen to 1,500 miles.  That means that there are 2,000 miles of disused railway line, and at the same time, our roads are crowded with traffic, particularly heavy vehicles which are now used because a number of branch lines were closed.  Those 2,000 miles should be transformed immediately into roads for one-way traffic, if they are not capable of taking two-way traffic. Even a road for one-way traffic would relieve the burden on the existing roads and cut out the need for changing almost completely the line taken by some of our trunk roads.  Even in the city there are a number of disused railway tracks and no time should be spared in having these tracks changed into roadways.  This would remove the congestion from the city streets.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable amount of congestion at the moment which has necessitated quite a lot of one-way traffic.  If the disused railway lines were converted into roads, and it would not be very expensive because the line is already cut, it would give one-way roads, and would ease the burden of traffic in the city while allowing the ordinary traffic going to a certain destination to use those lines. It could be one-way traffic either out of the city or one-way traffic into the city but it would take quite an amount of the volume of traffic off the streets <Col N="1185" /> of Dublin where the motorist is not interested in travelling through those streets but in getting to a certain place outside the city.</P>
    <P>The railway lines at the moment are overgrown with grass and weeds and are providing no public service at all.  They represent a vast amount of written off capital.  If the Minister for Transport and Power has a responsibility in connection with these railway lines, and I think he has, he should take steps in the city of Dublin with the Dublin Corporation and with the various county councils to see that the lines are taken over and ordinary roads laid down.  In the country these lines, which previously carried trains or goods wagons which no longer ply along those lines, could now take heavy transport lorries loaded with the goods which previously were conveyed in goods wagons.  Those lorries could be sent to their destinations on roadways constructed on these railway lines instead of crowding the existing public roads.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the continuous rise in fares.  One day it is a rise in bus fares and another day it is a shortening of the bus stage. The situation in regard to bus stops and fares has reached such a stage that the continental system should be adopted, where a passenger gets on a bus and pays a certain amount of money regardless of the distance he is going.  If such a system were adopted here it would stop the argument about whether people get off at one stop or another.  While one person may have to pay more than he would at the moment the other person will have less to pay but it should balance out. I am sure it would cut down a good deal of the work involved in the present arrangement of bus stages and bus fares.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another matter but I am not sure whether this is the Minister's responsibility or not. People in the city of Dublin, especially now with traffic congestion, find the oil fumes from buses very nauseating.  I wonder has the Minister discussed with CIE the question of fitting some kind of equipment which would prevent the emission of heavy black fumes from <Col N="1186" /> the diesel engines.  It is believed, rightly or wrongly, that these oil fumes are a cause of cancer and, if they are, I feel an effort should be made to cut out that danger to the city people who have to breath the air, whether they like it or not, when all these buses are held up by traffic jams and even when they are accelerating through the streets.  I am sure this problem has been considered in cities outside this country and, if so, I feel the Minister should adopt any improvements that have been made.  I feel the exhaust pipes of these diesel buses should be extended over the roof of the buses. I suppose that is not possible from an engineering point of view, but if it were at least the citizens would not have to inhale these heavy fumes.</P>
    <P>The CIE bus passenger system is very well organised in Dublin city but there are times during the day when the service is still inadequate.  There are complaints from many parts of Dublin city regarding the need for more accommodation between 7.30 and 8.30 in the morning when a bus starts out from a point at, say, Ballyfermot, or Finglas West.  Very soon the bus is full and hundreds of people who must be at work at a certain time are left standing at bus stops.  I feel that with better organisation an adequate number of buses could be provided at the rush hours, particularly in the morning time, when people want to get to work. They want to get to work on time and do not want to stand at the bus stops in the pouring rain.</P>
    <P>The same applies to school children. Some of the people trying to get to business complain that the buses are filled by school children, but there again it is a case of inadequate accommodation.  The children must get to school on time and they cannot be expected to stand aside in order that adults will get to work.  Better organisation is required as far as the Dublin city transport is concerned to ensure that at the peak hours, particularly in the morning, adequate transport will be provided.  There is also the question of providing extra transport on short notice on fine Sunday afternoons to the seaside.  I must say CIE do a fairly good job in that <Col N="1187" /> respect but these seaside journeys are becoming more popular and the city is expanding, with the result that there are large numbers of people in the suburbs of Dublin who are, indeed, a long way from Nelson Pillar, who desire also transport to those seaside resorts.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the question of a car ferry scheme.  Everyone knows that the proposal to provide a car ferry scheme appears to have been mishandled, and seems to have been a rather hasty decision which has caused considerable resentment in Dún Laoghaire.  I am sure Dún Laoghaire is not the only place where a car ferry scheme could be operated.  It is part of our tourist trade.  It is very important that we should facilitate visitors to the country &mdash; particularly visitors from Great Britain who want to bring their cars here &mdash; in getting their cars in cheaply and quickly, so that they can drive away when they get here.  At some future date, the Minister should be able to provide some kind of permanent arrangement which will ensure that car ferries can be used by our visitors, particularly from Great Britain.  We may have to have a greater number of unloading places for cars.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints regarding the rough handling of cars.  There is a scheme operating between Great Britain and France whereby a man can drive his own car on to the boat and drive it off again when he gets to the far side.  It is a question of getting the landing stage at the right level.  If people cannot get facilities to drive their cars on to and off the boat, and have to comply with formalities to get their cars into this country, they are discouraged by the frustration and annovance of the cumbersome arrangements here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power gives us an opportunity each year to cover a very wide range of activities.  It gives us an opportunity of discussing the activities of a number of boards set up by the Government, such as CIE, Irish Shipping, Aer Lingus, <Col N="1188" /> Bord na Móna, and the other branches of activity covered by the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister may be noted for being a very good man for making after-dinner speeches, but he is not noted for courtesy.  It is no harm to remind the Minister of that.  Many of his colleagues when questioned on the activities of their Departments go out of their way to provide Deputies with information, but we hear the Minister for Transport and Power continually evading questions in the House, and indicating that he has no responsibility for, and is not prepared to intervene in, the day-to-day working of the boards for which his Department is responsible.</P>
      <P>I venture to say that if the Minister facilitated Deputies to a greater extent, and showed a little more courtesy in dealing with this House and with public representatives, his Estimate would probably go through much more quickly.  One cannot help wondering at the annoyance that must be caused to a number of Deputies whose constituencies are primarily concerned with problems for which the Minister's Department is responsible, who come into this House and address questions to the Minister and are given the cold shoulder in reply.  We have reached the stage where we have all grown up, where there is give and take, and reason and commonsense.  Neither reason nor commonsense has been exercised by the Minister in regard to any branch of his Department.</P>
      <P>No matter what other Minister presents his Estimate here, it is very difficult to point a finger at a Minister who has so little to boast of, and so much to hang his head for as the Minister for Transport and Power.  I cannot see that his Department has anything to report on transport, in particular, with any degree of confidence. The general public have given up all hope of the redemption of CIE. As we were told by the Taoiseach many years ago, CIE was set up to give the people cheap and efficient transport, but it has given neither cheap nor efficient transport.</P>

    <P>The Minister asks the House for money to provide the services the <Col N="1189" /> country expects, but he also tells us that he must cut down branch lines and close railway stations.  We cannot help noticing that towards the end of 1963, and in this present year, the reports published in all the newspapers do not reflect any great credit on his Department.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> of April 12, 13, 1963, went to the trouble of publishing a leading article under the heading: &ldquo;Doomed stations&rdquo;. That paper should be complimented on the leading article.  The last paragraph states:</P>
    <P>What about the railway workers?  It is important to avoid confusing objectives; CIE does not exist primarily to provide jobs.  But when several hundred men will be affected (some will be retained, but clearly not all), most of them in areas where alternative employment will be hard to find, the problem cannot be easily dismissed.  &ldquo;The generous provisions of the Transport Act&rdquo; referred to by CIE will not take them very far. What use is a lump sum to a man of forty with a young family?  It is no substitute for steady work.  We have never been slow to press for moderation in Government spending, but social consequences of the kind foreshadowed in present transport policy are so grave it is time to ask for some sensitivity on the part of Government.</P>
    <P>That leading article offered very serious criticism of the activities of CIE.  The men who lost their employment were given very mean, unreasonable and inadequate rates of compensation.  We all know the ordinary people down the country are not concerned with good book-keeping. There is no use in the Minister telling people who lost their employment with CIE that they lost it because CIE had to balance its books properly.  The men down the country, and those who require an efficient and cheap transport system, are not concerned with good book-keeping.  The general public are entitled to an efficient service.  That is why I say that the Minister may be endeavouring to cloak CIE by presenting sets of figures.  The sets of figures which CIE presents to the <Col N="1190" /> people year after year are intended as a cloak for greater redundancy, closing of branch lines, closing of railway stations, closing of canals, selling of lock houses and the general air of depression surrounding CIE for years past.</P>
    <P>No Minister, since this State was founded, has been more successful in wrecking this country than the Minister for Transport and Power.  The evidence is clear in his constituency.  In the constituency of Monaghan, he assisted in tearing up every foot of railway line.  After his constituency of Monaghan, he succeeded almost 100 per cent in my constituency, with the exception of the main line from Dublin to Cork, but he was responsible for ripping up all the remaining branch lines.</P>
    <P>The deputation received by Dr. Andrews and the Board of CIE at Kingsbridge in connection with the Roscrea branch line and the Clara-Banagher branch line left absolutely convinced that those lines were paying their way and not satisfied with the explanation the Board gave.  If any body receiving public money through this House deserves seriously to be criticised, it is the Board of CIE.</P>
    <P>We shall not refer to the Board now, because the Minister is responsible. Individually and collectively, they are utterly irresponsible and incapable of giving this country the transport system and services our people expect and are entitled to.  This House is now voting considerable sums for CIE and the taxpayers are getting a very bad return for it.</P>
    <P>The freight charges of CIE have surpassed reality.  They are unreal, unjust and unfair and they can be described as completely and entirely insane.  Every other quarter, we experience continuous rises in bus fares and in train fares.  I cannot see how CIE will give this country efficient and cheap transport if they embark on a policy of making it easier for people to walk or to use other means of transport because the rail, bus and freight charges are completely out of the reach of the people.  That is why I say that <Col N="1191" /> this company have failed miserably. Whether or not the problem will be courageously tackled by this Government I cannot say&mdash;I doubt if it will&mdash; but some Government will have to consider all aspects of this matter and the incompetent activities of the Board will have to be brought to an end sooner or later.  I have nothing whatever to say in favour of CIE.  One act on their part has been more stupid and insane than the other.  I cannot see anything good that CIE have done.</P>
    <P>Most certainly, CIE give considerable employment.  However, the employment they give at present is nothing to that which they would be able to give if our people were receiving the benefit of the transport system to which they are rightly entitled.</P>
    <P>It is not so very long since the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited invited probably all Dáil Deputies and Senators to visit the Free Airport and to note the industries and the activities being undertaken there.  There was criticism of the activities of that company.  I was tremendously impressed by the volume of work undertaken by that company.</P>
    <P>Many years ago, I visited Shannon Airport.  It was before the establishment of the Development Company. There is no comparison between the activities there then and now.  The general public ought to be a little charitable in their criticism in the earlier stages of industrial development of this kind.</P>
    <P>I welcome any scheme which gives employment to our workers.  Reading through the Minister's statement on this subject, I notice that on 31st March, 1964, there were 12 manufacturing concerns and eight trading concerns in operation in the Industrial Estate and that 40 factory bays had been completed.  I note also with great satisfaction that the number of persons employed on the Industrial Estate is over 2,000.  Without that Development Company, it is probable that those 2,000 people would be in industrial employment outside this country.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Company Limited at Shannon Airport deserves <Col N="1192" /> a little clap on the back.  We should be absolutely dishonest if we did not say we were impressed by it when we visited it.  I was tremendously impressed by what I saw.  Some people may say they are mushroom industries &mdash;up in the morning and gone in the evening.  When I see people working for a reasonably good rate of pay, that represents progress to me.</P>
    <P>I also saw work in operation in some of the industries there.  I saw the quality of the product being prepared for the export market.  I have nothing but the greatest possible praise for those who have so courageously undertaken that development at Shannon. It is something which should be encouraged. The Minister for Transport and Power ought to give it a greater degree of encouragement.  If his attention is in any way directed to a requirement of any of those engaged in providing work in that area, it ought to be given special Government consideration. They should be congratulated for the courageous steps they have taken there.</P>
    <P>Anybody who visits the airport and sees the industries there will appreciate the manner in which the workers are being catered for by the very up-to-date and modern groups of industries there and the highest possible standard of hygiene and industrial standards. It would be wrong if I did not avail of this opportunity of expressing my admiration for everybody who has been concerned with the industrial activities at Shannon Airport.  I hope and trust, as time goes on, that an opportunity will be given to Deputies continuously to review their activities.</P>
    <P>I had not an idea of the extent of the industrial development there until I saw it for myself.  Needless to say, I was glad and happy to see the efforts made to provide work for such considerable numbers of people in that area.  As I have already said, it is much better to have those people employed in industry at home rather than have them employed in industry in foreign fields.  The activities of that company deserve the highest possible appreciation.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for us to criticise. There is nothing simpler than to criticise. <Col N="1193" /> I feel Shannon Airport Company is too young yet to offer any criticism of it.  It is only in its infancy and it is not fair to offer any serious criticism of or to put any obstacles in the way of a company which is young in its activities, unlike CIE.  CIE is old and has gone completely beyond repair. There seems to be none of the initiative or drive which there is in the development company at Shannon. For that reason, the Shannon Airport Development Company is worthy of recognition and appreciation.</P>
    <P>All those who are engaged in the activities of that company should be reinforced in the knowledge that there are men on all sides of this House who are with them in development works of that kind.  A greater degree of welcome should be extended to people who commence and set up industries in that area if the standard of work which is there continues.  This is development work which I welcome and for which I want to express my admiration.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word in relation to the activities of Bord Fáilte. I cannot say I am altogether impressed by this aspect of the activities of the Minister's Department.  I do not know very much about them.  Perhaps because my knowledge of the activities of Bord Fáilte is so limited, if I have anything critical to say about them, I ought to be charitable and say nothing about them.  I want to say this about them.  I have taken up various types of literature and booklets published by Bord Fáilte and I have seen the Lakes of Killarney mentioned in them.  I have seen the Wicklow mountains mentioned and Wicklow described as the Garden of Ireland.  I have seen the various write-ups about the West of Ireland and the various seaside resorts around the country but I have not seen a single mention of Clonmacnoise in any of these booklets.</P>
    <P>Surely Bord Fáilte must be aware, if there is any place in Ireland which holds out an attraction for the tourist, if he is English, but particularly if he is an American, it is the burial place of the kings of Ireland, of the last High King of Ireland, of the saints and bishops and of the great people of <Col N="1194" /> this country.  That place is Clonmacnoise, which was at one time the seat of learning for all Europe.  It is situated on the Shannon, in County Offaly, and not a single tourist coach ever pulls up at the village of Shannonbridge for the purpose of bringing tourists to Clonmacnoise.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably tell us that Bord Fáilte went to the trouble of giving Offaly County Council a grant for the purpose of building a jetty on the Shannon so that tourists would be able to arrive there by launch and visit the ancient buildings of Clonmacnoise.  That is not enough.  The bulk of visitors do not come by pleasure boats.  They usually travel by coach.  I feel the Minister would be very well advised to direct the attention of Bord Fáilte to this.  I will not say that he can compel them to do it but he can direct attention to the fact that on the list of tours of historic spots being organised for tourists to this country, Clonmacnoise ranks as the greatest, the most important and the most historic.  It is all very fine to bring people to Athlone and tell them they are six miles away from Clonmacnoise. They should be brought to Clonmacnoise by coach.  Bord Fáilte should have a guide, particularly versed in the history of Clonmacnoise, to explain the various historic associations of that place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a local guide there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Mr. Molloy.  I am very glad at least the Minister is aware of the hard work which Mr. Molloy has put into Clonmacnoise over the years.  There is no man in Ireland who deserves more thanks and appreciation than Mr. Molloy for the work he has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember calling to the Bord Fáilte Office to ascertain if I could have a coloured picture of Clonmacnoise. I was told there was no such picture available in any of the offices of Bord Fáilte.  The county manager of Leix-Offaly has in his office various historic pictures and scenes relating to the county.  He has been supplied with a picture of Clonmacnoise which is hanging on his wall and which I <Col N="1195" /> feel should have been in colour.  It could have been set out far more attractively.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the people of Wicklow look upon the scenery of Wicklow or how the people of Kerry look upon the Lakes of Killarney. Clonmacnoise is far more important from the historic point of view than any of these.  It is a great pity that tourists are allowed to leave this country without a visit to Clonmacnoise and without being told that this is the resting place of the last High King of Ireland and the resting place of various saints.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have certainly done their part in the organisation of various fishing competitions.  They are probably doing all they can to attract tourists. They deserve any support we can give them in that regard.  I feel the Inland Fisheries Trust, in co-operation with Bord Fáilte, have been responsible for attracting a vast number of tourists to this country.  That good work should be continued as far as possible.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to note the number of international conferences which have taken place here.  When the delegates return to their respective countries they are the means of attracting other visitors here.  The more international conferences we have, the greater will be the return in the years to come.  These conferences show the people abroad that we have nothing to be ashamed of, that the days of those who sought by their writings to belittle this country are gone, and that we have no such thing as a pig in the parlour.  I believe that if the views of these delegates were obtained, they would say we have as much to offer them as any other part of the world. The only thing we cannot give any assurances about is our climate, but that is something over which we have no control.  We have not a lot to complain about even in regard to it, judging by the atmospheric disturbances we read of in other places.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have been responsible for changing the face of my constituency. Everybody connected with their activities can feel very proud.  There <Col N="1196" /> is only one thing I am worried about: the possibility that Bord na Móna may try to step in the same dog track as CIE.  If they start leaving off workers for the purpose of balancing their books properly, in the long run they will find that that is a bad policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>They are certainly balancing their books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Particularly because of the briquette factories established by the inter-Party Government. The two factories functioning in my constituency are a credit to everybody connected with them.  Bord na Móna are inclined to be bashful about displaying their activities.  I am convinced there are Deputies who never saw the full workings of Bord na Móna in the midlands.  That is a shame. There is no comparison between Offaly today and what it was 21 years ago when I was first elected to the Dáil. There are the bog development and the ESB power stations at Ferbane, Portlaoise, Rhode and Shannonbridge&mdash;all industries giving valuable employment which deserve to be appreciated and complimented in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope Bord na Móna will extend their activities as far as possible.  I would appeal to them to consider, in conjunction with ESB, the possibility of utilising duff anthracite.  The Minister may have gone into this before and it may have appeared economically unsound to embark on such a project. But there must be something wrong when we are exporting anthracite and, at the same time, importing it.  I am reliably informed that the ships taking anthracite out of this country pass the ships bringing anthracite in.  There must be different grades of anthracite. I wonder how it is so much duff anthracite is imported here when we have so much to sell.  I venture to say some of the best anthracite mines in the world are in Laois.  The Minister has not gone out of his way to be helpful in this regard.  I have often wondered why Bord na Móna, who have been so successful in developing our peat deposits, have not considered setting up a sub-committee to examine the possibility of developing <Col N="1197" /> those anthracite mines, particularly in Leinster, which cannot be profitably worked by private companies.  I fail to understand why the ESB cannot utilise the anthracite areas for generation purposes.</P>
    <P>It is about time serious note was taken of our undeveloped coal resources.  The Minister would be well advised to consult with officers of his Department and decide to embark on something new and practical&mdash;the development of our undeveloped coal and anthracite resources.  It could take hundreds of thousands to develop these mines.  But 25 or 30 years ago the pioneers of Bord na Móna were laughed at.  They were told they were trying to develop the bogs, which were only the homes of the bogmen.  Now the position is different.  We see the outstanding work resulting from the drive, energy and sincerity of those who underlook the huge task of developing our bogs.  I would ask the Minister to consult with the technical advisers of Bord na Móna in regard to where development will take place.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the new peat moss factory near Portlaoise, which will provide much needed employment there.  On the other hand, now that the Board are seriously considering a third briquette factory, I hope they will choose a site along the Blackwater where there is a huge acreage of bog and where there is the excellent centre of Shannonbridge. Without exaggeration, I forecast that with all its physical assets, Shannonbridge in 25 years will have grown to the size of Athlone.  At the moment there are 1,000 men employed there and I hope that through the co-operation of the Minister, the ESB and Bord na Móna, this briquette factory will be sited there.</P>
    <P>The ESB could also consider, with advantage, the setting up of a power station there to be run on anthracite. We have the miners there; we have the other facilities; and we have, of course, the anthracite.  All that is needed is the initiative.  There is need for greater employment in the area.</P>
    <P>We in this House have confidence in Bord na Móna and we should not be stingy in our allocations of money <Col N="1198" /> to that body.  We have seen the outstanding results achieved by them and by the ESB.  The engineering staff of the latter body deserve our highest praise and I trust the Minister will convey to the chairmen and members of the ESB and Bord na Móna the appreciation of the people of Laois-Offaly for the very valuable contributions they have made to the development of the area and the employment of the people.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that there are still large tracts of undeveloped bog which could be utilised by both the ESB and Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might be able to tell us what the demand is for briquettes throughout the country. Without a third factory, I do not think it would be wise to embark on a sales campaign for briquettes : I understand that at the moment the demand exceeds the supply.  All this is greater argument in favour of a third briquette factory.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest that all Departmental offices, hospitals now being built, and other public offices should use turf for heating instead of oil or coal-powered boilers.  In the midlands, where there is such need for extra employment, we are very concerned about obtaining the largest possible markets for our production of peat.  In order to achieve this, we should do everything possible to cut down our imports of coal.  In doing so, we would not only be helping to adjust our balance of trade but would be utilising our own raw materials and giving valuable employment in areas where employment is so necessary.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister sees some merit in my observations, and let us hope that from tonight he will understand when Deputies address questions to him, they do not do so for the purpose of offering personal embarrassment but to solicit information on behalf of their constituents.  Let us hope that during the lifetime of the present Dáil, the Minister will reconsider his attitude to Deputies in the matter of helping them to solve the problems of their constituents.  If he does so, he will make his job much easier.  In the past, <Col N="1199" /> he has made it difficult for all of us. None of us likes to be embarrassed and, therefore, none of us likes to be embarrassing.  Therefore, I suggest the Minister adopt the more grown up and mature attitude which he has failed to show in the long number of years he has been here.  For whatever it is worth, I offer him the advice to be a little more courteous with the people he is dealing with.  In return, he will get much more co-operation and courtesy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCummins" hpid="Mr Cummins Mr Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>State-owned industries in this country occupy a unique position in so far as they were not created from a belief in socialism but rather because we looked to people with sufficient money and faith in the country's future to found these industries. We are committed to a predominantly free enterprise society, into the preserves of which the State will enter only when private interests prove inadequate, unable or unwilling to act. I submit that the Estimate before us should be discussed in the light of our oft-expressed belief that private enterprise has a vital part to play in our economic progress.</P>
      <P>We are not doctrinaire socialists. The Minister responsible for many of our State enterprises is not a commissar with power of life and death over the people appointed to run these industries.  The Minister cannot always be made to answer for the day-to-day operations of any particular concern. To expect that the people running a business should be dependent on ministerial approval for every act of theirs would stultify their efforts to make the business a going concern.</P>
      <P>The people running our State enterprises are worthy of the confidence reposed in them.  CIE are an easy target for criticism.  Whether we like it or not, the trend of passengers and goods transport has moved from the railways to the roads.  That transfer was bound to create difficulties, which I submit have been met by CIE in a spirit of progress and courage and with the idea of giving our people and our industry a first-class service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Admitting all that, there is one <Col N="1200" /> problem to which I would like the Minister to refer, that is, the Grand Canal, particularly that stretch of the canal from Griffith Bridge to James's Street Harbour, that is, the part of the canal to the rear of Fatima Mansions and Rialto.  To the parents of the children in that area the controversy as to the future of the canal has become unrealistic and irrelevant to what they rightly consider to be the main issue, that is, the safety of the children.  Already there have been two deaths and many near deaths on this stretch of the canal and the time has come either to fill it in, as was done on the Royal Canal at Phibsboro, or to fence it in some way.</P>
    <P>This is a densely populated area where hundreds of children go to and from school daily and it is surely the business of some public body, whether it be CIE or the Corporation, to ensure that they do so with the least possible danger to their young lives. These children are faced with sufficient unavoidable hazards without their being presented with an avoidable one.</P>
    <P>The decision as to who is responsible for the fencing should not prevent the work being carried out.  It should be possible for the Corporation and CIE or the appropriate Government Department to come to some agreement. From correspondence I have received from CIE and Dublin Corporation I am well aware of the position of both these bodies in the matter.  Nevertheless, I am not convinced that this is an insoluble problem. I would appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to bring about a solution to it as early as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what Deputy Flanagan has been talking about this evening on the subject of Bord na Móna, it seems to me that Bord na Móna are one of those semi-State organisations that are paying their way and making a profit and have prospects for the future.  I have always been a strong advocate in favour of the use as far as possible of native raw materials.  In other parts of the country besides Laois-Offaly there are extensive bogs, as I have had an opportunity of discovering recently <Col N="1201" /> in connection with the by-election in Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I am informed that for a certain number of years Bord na Móna functioned in the west of Ireland and gave vast and useful employment.  Judging from the population that I have seen in the areas I visited, there are very few young people left there.  Does the Minister not consider that it might be possible for Bord na Móna to extend their activities in that area and to develop the bogs there?  In the place where I was there were at least 300 acres of bog which are totally undeveloped. Is there any reason why Bord na Móna should not extend their activities into the west?  The demand for briquettes exceeds the supply.  In these circumstances Bord na Móna might consider developing these bogs for the production of briquettes.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that point?</P>
      <P>The next point I would wish to make is in connection with the Great Island Harbour which is being established in Wexford.  We are all very glad that this development is taking place and that there is an extension of electrical power there and that the harbour is being established for the purpose of bringing in large oil-burning ships.  The Minister knows as well as I do the uncertainties of the present age.  He realises that there could be a conflagration in the Near East, that there could be trouble in the oil producing areas of the world. In these circumstances an appalling situation could arise.  It might be necessary to fall back on other fuels.</P>
      <P>In connection with the Great Island Harbour it should be possible to arrange for storage facilities for coal and other fuel, apart from oil.  If a crisis did develop we would have this very valuable harbour which, naturally, I consider to be in a very suitable place, but it would be most undesirable that it should transpire that the harbour could not be used because oil was no longer available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which I have raised each year on the Minister's Estimate.  It is the enormous tourist potential represented by the <Col N="1202" /> ancient monuments in this country.  I have suggested to the Minister that he might suggest to those concerned the desirability of producing an up-to-date map showing where these ancient monuments are located.  There is difficulty in knowing where they are to be found because of the fact that they are so numerous and are practically everywhere.  Other nations are particularly interested in this type of tourist attraction.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Board of Works, at the invitation of the Minister, are producing a brochure.  The only one I have seen so far is an extremely limited one giving information in relation to places that the majority of people know about already.  What we need is an up-to-date catalogue which would give all the relevant information. Some of these ancient monuments are located in remote places.  Information regarding convenient hotels could be included in the catalogue.</P>
    <P>Another form of tourist attraction is coarse fishing, the best period for which is late autumn.  From information I have obtained from local people I understand that a big effort is being made to eliminate coarse fish from our lakes and to replace them by trout or other fish.  It seems to me that the experiment has not been a success.  We have succeeded in eliminating the coarse fish, in connection with which a certain amount of tourism was being developed, but the effort to replace it with something else has been a failure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been allowed to develop my argument. The point I am trying to make is that we have been denuding our lakes of coarse fish which was a tourist potential.  We have been replacing them <Col N="1203" /> with trout with the idea of developing a different kind of tourism.  Trout are in the majority of instances in Irish lakes ground feeders and the result has been that we have abolished our coarse fishing and tried to replace it with something which is just nonexistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I must correct the Deputy.  The Inland Fisheries Trust is scheduling lakes and rivers for either coarse fishing or for trout fishing and an enormous number of lakes are developed for coarse fishing.  There is a dual programme for coarse and game fishing worked out scientifically and we are attracting large numbers of tourists for coarse fishing because of the specific reservation of lakes and rivers for coarse fishing.  The Deputy is greatly misinformed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">

The Minister may correct me but I have been informed of that by the local authority in the areas concerned.  I shall not labour the point. The Chair is getting restless because I am dealing with fish.</P>

      <P>The Minister accepted it as part of his responsibility. I shall not delay on that matter any longer but I shall convey to the Minister privately the information I have on the subject.  There is another point I wish to raise with the Minister in regard to the Great Island Harbour. There seems to be some doubt and controversy in the area concerned in <Col N="1204" /> regard to the tender, for which I take it the Minister has responsibility as Minister for Transport and Power, for the construction of this harbour, in that the tender that has been accepted is not the lowest tender.  There seems to be a grievance on the part of some people who have tendered at a lower figure than other people that the higher tender has been accepted.  I do not know if that is the case.  One gets information on these matters.</P>
      <P>I feel on this matter that if a Government Department is inviting tenders for the construction of a harbour, it is always advisable that it should accept the lowest tender, provided it is made by a reputable firm. Perhaps the Minister will give us some accurate information on that.  In the specific case I have mentioned, the tender is a considerable one and perhaps he will say whether the lowest figure has been accepted or whether he accepted a higher figure.</P>

      <P>I shall reply on the basis of taking separately each company or each service under my Department in respect of which Deputies raised questions.  First of all, I should like to refute what Deputy Flanagan said about the services of CIE, which has been repeated by some of his colleagues; but equally some of his colleagues have testified to the competence of the CIE services.  Therefore, there appears to be a division of opinion within the Fine Gael ranks about CIE.</P>
      <P>I believe a magnificent programme of reorganisation has been carried out. The CIE services, while they are always capable of improvement, are first-class and the speed with which they deliver goods to most parts of the country can be compared with that in any other modern country.  Moreover, I believe that through their modern organisation, they are attempting as far as possible to provide the best bus services, making allowance for all the difficulties that inevitably exist in connection with bus services during peak hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the general problem of CIE and rail transport in <Col N="1205" /> relation to roads.  I made very long detailed statements in regard to this at the time a number of branch railway lines were closed but I suppose I had better, for the benefit of the House, give the information over again.  It has been estimated that 20 per cent of the goods traffic goes by rail and 80 per cent goes by road. Seven per cent of the passenger traffic goes by rail transport and the rest by road, either public or private. In the past ten years, the number of private cars has doubled, and the number of private cars we have in this country per £1 million of income is one of the highest in Europe.  In other words, the people, regardless of where they live or whether a railway exists in their area, have put as a prime charge on their income the purchase of private transport to a far greater degree in relation to their income than the people of most countries in Europe, and that fact has affected the position of CIE.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon seemed to link in his mind the improvement of the main roads and the gradual growth of the autobahn type of road with the closing of branch lines but in actual fact the arterial road programme has been going steadily ahead independent of any rail closures.  The Minister for Local Government, through the Road Fund, provides 100 per cent of the cost.  I have never yet seen any county council decide not to improve an arterial main road on the ground that the people could travel along the arterial main railway line.  There may have been some isolated cases of that kind but so far as I know the county councils throughout the country have made the decision in regard to the development of main roads regardless of the effect, directly or indirectly, on arterial main line rail traffic.</P>
    <P>The branch lines which have been closed carried only something like five per cent and contributed only between five and six per cent of the revenue of CIE rail traffic.  They carried in most cases a negligible amount of traffic and in relation to the 621 miles of railway line closed and the 221 stations closed since 1958, CIE had to provide only 87 buses and lorries plus <Col N="1206" /> occasional additions for special traffic such as the lorries which are used during the beet season.  It is ridiculous to say that 87 buses and lorries placed on the roads create a major demand for autobahn roads.  There is no connection between the closing of the branch lines and the development of wider and better roads between the main cities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the saving of some £700,000 a year through closing these branch lines, other expenditure has to be considered. There were the once-for-all road grants provided by the Minister for Local Government to improve some of the roads to which a certain amount of rail traffic was diverted.  It is interesting to note in connection with those grants that, quite clearly, when the county councils concerned provided the estimates they were not only including what would be the strict expenditure associated with the closing of railways but they were including a backlog of work along the road concerned which it was far more economic to do at the time when the Minister offered the special grants than it would have been to do separately on another occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember a perfect example of that in connection with one of the roads entering Cork from the West where the city manager asked for a grant for this particular road and made it quite clear that there would be some extra beet traffic passing through the city as a result of the closing of the West Cork railway line but that the improvement of the road was inevitable in any event because of <Col N="1207" /> the great growth of traffic which occurred during the period when the West Cork railway was still operating. That was the case in respect of a very big proportion of the grants allotted in connection with the closing of rail services. It was very wise on the part of the Minister for Local Government to make the grants reasonably ample for the purposes I have described.</P>
    <P>The railways that were closed were for the most part operating with empty trains for a good part of the year and had only a handful of passengers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Not all of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;often two or three or, perhaps, five passengers got in or out of a train at a station.  I want to make it clear that I regard the replacement of a very little used branch line by a good bus and lorry service as an improvement of the transport, a very definite improvement. There are regions in the country where, because of the scattered nature of the population and the great dispersal of houses&mdash;we are one of the most unvillaged people in Europe, with the Swedes&mdash;having bus services stopping frequently and lorry services setting down and picking up at frequent intervals is more satisfactory.</P>
      <P>My own belief is that railways serve the purpose of providing fast, long-haul traffic with relatively few stops except where the population is extremely dense or, as in the case of commuter services, adjacent to or within a city. That has been found all over the world and that change has taken place everywhere and is quite inevitable.  I am quite convinced that the economies made by CIE, making allowance for the once-for-all-road grants and their true value in relation to railway closing and making allowance for the once-for-all redundancy compensation voted by the State, will prove to be justified in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say in that connection as I clearly indicated on the Second Stage of the Transport Bill, that it is not the intention of the Government that CIE should close the main arterial system. There are some short stretches of <Col N="1208" /> branch lines, the continued existence of which I should imagine is highly speculative but it is the Government's wish that the main arterial railway system should be preserved.  Therefore the argument put forward by Deputy Dillon that we should have regard to the cost of the autobahn type of main road improvement does not enter into the future picture.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan referred once again to the fact that I appeared to be too optimistic in regard to the possibility that CIE might pay its way.  I do not know if I must go over the same ground that I have already covered in the Transport Bill debate but may I make clear first that both Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Norton in the course of their remarks on the Second Stages of Transport Bills they introduced in this House expressed reasonable optimism that these measures might produce the satisfactory result that CIE might pay its way. They expressed themselves guardedly but optimistically.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, on the Second Stage of the 1958 Transport Bill, did not commit himself in a single phrase to saying he actually envisaged that CIE would be able to pay its way at the end of five years.  He spoke of the difficulties that the railway would have to encounter in making it a profitable service.  I myself was quite determined that until I could be certain that the result would not be favourable I was not going to encourage political pressures to be exercised on CIE which might prevent the possibility of the service paying its way.  It was quite impossible for me to be able to predict what package deals CIE could secure, what would be the result of their being allowed to make commercial arrangements; what volume of traffic they would secure.  It turned out to be some £900,000; as far as I was concerned in 1959 it might just as easily have been £2,000,000, which would have made a very big difference to the result of rail operations.  I had no knowledge of what would be the rate of growth of the economy.</P>
    <P>At that time, after 1958, we were all beginning to look ahead when the economy began to grow.  Neither had <Col N="1209" /> I any kind of statistics which would show me that the growth in rail traffic of CIE would follow proportionately the growth of national income because of all the varying patterns of transport involved, such as the location of new factories, how many of them would be on the coasts, how many in the centre, how many in Dublin and how many would be in the country.  I had no means of predicting what the effect of the growth of economy would be on the rail fortunes of CIE and so I was perfectly entitled to encourage CIE to the absolute limit to try to pay its way until finally the result emerged that it would not be possible.  I make no apology for the enthusiasm I showed during that period and if another State company were ever to undergo a period of massive reorganisation of a similar kind I should also encourage them even though I knew the objective to be a very difficult one for them to achieve. So I make no apology for that enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>Referring again to Deputy Dillon's observations on CIE, he suggested that if CIE is now going to be subsidised there might be some liberalisation of road traffic.  There again one must have regard to the fact that there are something like 45,000 private vans and lorries; there is a huge number of private motor cars, one to every 14&mdash;1 think it is now one to every 12 of the population&mdash;and some 1,000 licensed carriers and 832 CIE lorries.  I do not think it can be claimed that the CIE monopoly position is unjustified.  I think it is important to retain some CIE monopoly privileges in operating lorry and bus services.  I think that is absolutely inevitable under present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy raised the question of the CIE employees' pension scheme. Discussions are at present proceeding between CIE and the trade unions on the proposals made by the committee but no submission has as yet been made to me in regard to this matter. Some Deputies referred to the rather niggardly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I was answering the question about the manual grades.  In relation to the pensions paid to retired members of the wages grade staff of CIE, some Deputy suggested that the increases were miserable and conferred no benefit.  I could not subscribe to that view because the revised pensions have to be taken in conjunction with social welfare benefit payments.  The commission that sat recently as a result of the bus dispute quite clearly linked the pension with the social welfare benefit in their recommendation with regard to future pensions in CIE.  They accepted the principle.  I accepted it and the Minister for Social Welfare accepted it.  The increases recently given to existing pensioners in CIE will bring the income for a single man to a minimum of £3 10s. and a maximum of £4 13s. 7d. and, in the case of a married man, the minimum and maximum figures will be £5 7s. 6d. and £6 3s. 9d. respectively.  I do not think the combined CIE pension, as increased on my request to CIE, and the social welfare benefit could be described as grossly inadequate having regard to the figures I have just given.</P>
      <P>Deputy T. Lynch asked whether CIE pay any tax on diesel oil for road and rail.  CIE pay duty at the full rate of 2/4 and the 11/12 ths of a penny on diesel oil used in its lorries.  They pay a special reduced rate&mdash;the full rate less 9d.&mdash;on diesel oil used in buses.  That applies also to other commercial bus operators and the Lough Swilly Railway.  Diesel oil used in rail locomotives is duty free.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lynch referred in a rather vague way to existing <Col N="1211" /> CIE cattle freight services.  I want to repeat once more that I take very great care to examine all complaints made in regard to cattle freight services by road or by rail.  We get a few complaints in the year and, in most cases, there are explanations for the deficiencies in the service.  Recently I met a deputation from the NFA and discussed the matter with them.  I asked them to let me have particulars of cases in which they feel the services are deficient.  All I can say is that the number of cattle carried by CIE lorries is increasing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lynch referred also to the Rosslare, Fishguard and Waterford service.  The Rosslare Harbour Company, in which CIE and British Railways are both represented, are preparing a plan for the improvement of the services, as I have already indicated, and I imagine that, if the plan I hope eventuates, it will have regard to the improvement of the cargo, passenger and car ferry facilities for the three ports.  I could not, however, offer any hope of the restoration of the passenger service to Waterford.  I think such restoration very unlikely.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon asked some questions about CIE hotels and their rates.  I am quite certain it is possible to secure <i>en pension</i> rates for CIE hotels, or in most of them, at any rate, for a stay exceeding a certain number of days.  It is quite true that on the menus there are supplementary dishes which are not included as part of the ordinary <i>table d'hOte</i> coming within the <i>en</i><i>pension</i> arrangement.  That is quite a common practice in hotels everywhere. Very special dishes are charged extra, such as a dish like lobster.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>These dishes are charged for over and above the <i>en</i><i>pension</i> rate.  That is quite a common practice.  I do not think tourists are unused to it.  It is accepted generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Rooney, licences are given by me to private bus operators where they do not compete with CIE and where they provide a service <Col N="1212" /> at a particular time when CIE cannot do what is required.  Quite large numbers of private bus operators are operating on this basis.</P>
    <P>CIE are making a tremendous effort to end the emission of noxious fumes from their buses and lorries.  They have been overhauling all their engines.  I understand they are also using a new type of fuel.  The injectors have been reconditioned and I myself have noticed a very marked reduction in the fumes from CIE buses in the past 12 months.  I hope that improvement will continue.  I might add that there are many other operators running lorries whose engines are defective. Only portion of CIE buses were affected in this particular way.  I understand the campaign of improvement is going ahead and people should have very few grounds for complaint in the future.  CIE are also replacing about a quarter of their very old buses with new stock, for which the House has provided the capital.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I should deal again with the Dublin bus services since I dealt with them in very considerable detail on the Second Stage of the Transport Bill.  I believe that, when there is centralised traffic control, with the establishment of a central traffic control office in O'Connell Street, linked by radio telephone with the bus inspectors, it will be possible to overcome some of the problems associated with peak hour traffic. It is equally true to say that, once bunching commences in the centre of the city, some delays in bus traffic are inevitable and there is just nothing CIE can do about it.  This is a problem common to all cities.  CIE may be able to mitigate the position by turning some of the buses around at a given point but that, of course, also creates problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan spoke about the poor compensation afforded by CIE to rail workers who lost their employment as a result of the closing of branch lines.  The rates of compensation provided by this House for CIE workers&mdash;I say this without fear of contradiction&mdash;were the highest ever to come to my notice.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the increases in charges over the past <Col N="1213" /> years.  The average receipts per ton mile rose by 10 per cent from 1958 to 1962-63.  The average receipts per mile on railway fares, second class, rose by 27 per cent.  The increase per ton mile is, I think, reasonably satisfactory considering the general increases in the cost of living that took place in that period.  The increase in receipts per mile on the railways, if compared with increases in industrial earnings, for example, will also indicate that it was not excessive.  It was more than we should have liked, but it could not be regarded as excessive in relation to the earning capacity of a pretty high proportion of the population.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Flanagan praised the company promoted by the Taoiseach.  Deputy O'Donnell wanted assurance that the Shannon Free Airport Development Company would advertise the tourist amenities of the whole of the west of Ireland, particularly the south-west, and that is the case.  The medieval tours include a three-day tour which embraces Killarney and the Kerry area, and indeed, the company in its general promotional operations with airlines advertise the whole of Ireland in their &ldquo;Drop Down at Shannon&rdquo; type of advertising.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to the fact that the growth of air freight emerging from the new Shannon industries was not as much as he would like and suggested that the Company could be more selective in the industries to be promoted on the industrial estate.  It is true to say that the Company is operating so successfully now that it is possible for it to be reasonably selective and encourage industries to come there which would normally use a considerable volume of air freight.  Of course, air freight has been increasing and we hope it will go on increasing. The suggestion that the ambit of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company should be extended to a region including Limerick and Ennis is not really feasible.  It would require legislation and there would be vested interests to be protected and it is not <Col N="1214" /> a practical suggestion.  Deputy Flanagan asked if the Shannon Free Airport Development Company had sufficient funds.  The full capital is being provided for grants to companies and loans to carry out the necessary community development and they recently designed a plan to cover housing and ancillary services which is now being examined.</P>
    <P>The Grand Canal, as I have already indicated, will be retained and until the law is amended, and as long as it is used by even one vessel a year, it must remain open.  CIE have just purchased a new weed cutter which I believe is working very effectively.  The final question of the Grand Canal is linked with its value as a tourist and transport amenity and also with the proposal of Dublin Corporation for its use as a sewer.  The matter will have to be discussed with the Corporation and the Minister for Local Government before we can make a decision but we are preparing a provisional report on this whole question which will be placed before the Government but I cannot say when it will be published because, again, we have to consider all the matters which relate to the Dublin Corporation's sewerage plan and the Government's final decision will relate not only to the general question of the Grand Canal but to the aim of providing a further water and sewerage system for Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cummins suggested that part of the canal should be fenced. Curiously enough, this is the first time I have heard such a suggestion.  We have had complaints about the condition of the canal, which is now being improved by the weed cutter, and a certain amount of rubbish is being removed by voluntary effort, but I have not had any suggestion about fencing for safety purposes.  I shall refer the matter to CIE to see what the position is in that connection.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Dillon was trying to draw me but he did suggest that I should comment on an article in the <i>Banking Review</i> in regard to whether State companies should remunerate their capital.  We regard this position pragmatically; <Col N="1215" /> every State company has different problems, different origins and different targets and whilst it is true that I would prefer that every State company should pay its way, I have previously described the variations in the position in the different companies and that the companies have to follow the line directed by the Government.  We regard the position on the basis of what is the national need in relation to efficiency and the character of the service concerned.  As I indicated to Deputy Dillon, we have published in the notes the amount paid by the taxpayer each year indicating that the capital of the air companies is not remunerated.  We have not concealed the information and it is in the notes which I prepared and issued to the Dáil and to the Press.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to the position of Aerlínte.  Aerlínte have been doing extremely well and have fully justified the predictions made for them by the Taoiseach, and referred to by some Deputies.  Unless there is some radical change in the position, or unless Aerlínte face difficulties that do not now exist, they should be in a position to remunerate, in some way or other, a substantial part of their commercial capital.  Both air companies have been directed to force the pace of development, to develop new and sometimes uneconomic but essential services involving short hauls, before earning the surplus which they could earn on the more profitable routes.  As a result, the pace of capital development has been very <Col N="1216" /> rapid and I do not think it would have been possible for the air companies to remunerate their capital not because of inefficiency but because of the directives given to them to develop rapidly a national air transport system. Having said that, we are trying to bring about a position where in future capital should largely be found from their own resources.  In connection with their present development, out of £14 million, the State is providing £2 million and the rest will be provided from their own depreciation funds and their own borrowing.  That is a change which reflects what might be described as a compromise position. They are not remunerating the capital which they received from the State at an earlier stage, they are providing more capital from their own resources now.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy O'Donnell, I cannot enforce the establishment of charter services to or from this country, but if any company proposes to establish a charter service similar to that recently started at Shannon I shall examine the proposal with the utmost sympathy.  British European Airways have applied to start a service to Shannon next year and I am regarding their application sympathetically as I agree with Deputies that communications with Shannon need to be expanded constantly.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
