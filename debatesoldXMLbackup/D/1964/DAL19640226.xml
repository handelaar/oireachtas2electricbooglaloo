      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will fully explain the position with regard to income tax of a person who during the course of a financial year returned from Britain to this country, who paid tax on his British earnings, but whose residence in this country was sufficiently long to make him liable for income tax for the year in question here; and if he will state whether such a person's British earnings, in addition to his Irish earnings, are liable to Irish income tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee (for the Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the assumption that the person referred to was resident for income tax purposes in Britain as well as in this country for the financial year in question, he is liable to the tax of each country.  His British earnings, in addition to his Irish earnings, are liable to Irish income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Double Income Tax Agreements, however, in force between <Col N="1578" /> this country and Britain he is given double taxation relief by each country in respect of the doubly-taxed income at one-half of the lower of his two appropriate rates of tax, Irish and British.  The effect of the relief is to eliminate the smaller of the two taxes on the doubly-taxed income&mdash;leaving him ultimately to bear, as between the two countries, the bigger of the two taxes.</P>
    <P>Questions of residence and the application of the Double Taxation Agreements are technical matters and, if the Deputy has a particular case in mind, he might perhaps care to send me the details and I shall be happy to look into it.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons)" RHead="Bill, 1963: Second Stage">
    <Title>Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Bill, 1963 [Seanad]: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The Bill, which has been passed by Seanad Éireann, proposes, in the first place, to enable the Minister for Health to make regulations which will lay down desirable requirements for homes where incapacitated persons are maintained for profit and, as a corollary to this, it proposes also to empower health authorities to see that these requirements are fulfilled.</P>
      <P>It is important, as a beginning, to form a clear picture of the type of establishment with which the Bill will deal.  Its Short Title refers to &ldquo;Homes for incapacitated persons&rdquo;; and in its Long Title, such establishments are further delimited as being &ldquo;homes in which incapacitated persons are maintained for private profit.&rdquo;  Mark the words &ldquo;private profit.&rdquo;  It should be noted also that the term &ldquo;nursing&rdquo; does not appear anywhere in the Bill, whether in the Short Title, Long Title, or the several sections.  The Bill, indeed, is not intended to provide a system of statutory control over hospitals for chronic ailments or over establishments which are fully equipped and staffed to provide high-grade nursing for acutely-ill persons.  Institutions of this elaborate type&mdash;hospitals, maternity homes, institutions for the mentally ill&mdash;are, in fact, already dealt with under special legislation or other arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure is designed to apply to establishments which, because they are somewhat cognate in character are referred to, in the loosest sense of the term, as nursing homes, but of which the essential characteristic is that they <Col N="1584" /> have a domestic quality which marks them out from institutions where sufferers from acute illness are received and the formal type of medical and nursing attention is given.  In places of the type to which the Bill is intended to apply the element of medical and nursing speciality does not primarily or mainly arise; so that in essential characteristics they do not differ very much from hostels or residences where the old or infirm may be cared for and enjoy the ordinary amenities of life at a charge which is within their limited means.  It would be extremely difficult to fit establishments such as these into any rigid category; they exist to meet a wide variety of needs and the service and amenities provided in them may vary accordingly.  At this stage it may be helpful to outline what, in general, I believe these needs to be.</P>
    <P>First of all, it is necessary to emphasise that the persons in the establishments to which the Bill will apply are not, in the normal sense of the word, ill, certainly not acutely ill. They may be, most often are, suffering from some degree of physical or mental impairment due to old age or infirmity, and to this extent, they require some small amount of rudimentary nursing care&mdash;the kind of care that any wife, mother or daughter could perform for a member of her own household, should the need arise. By and large, therefore, homes for incapacitated persons need not differ radically from the ordinary home in this country where, as we know, there are no specialist amenities for dealing with infirmity, where there is, in fact, no need for them, and where the highly proficient skills of medicine and nursing are not required.</P>
    <P>For the care of a person maintained in such a home, there is, however, one vital requirement: that he or she be treated with human kindness and attention&mdash;the kind of attention, in fact, which would be given in the family home.  But it is not within the competence of parliamentary draftsmen to set forth in legalistic formulae what human kindness and attention are.  And to prescribe by statute the physical amenities, conveniences and services which must be available in homes for <Col N="1585" /> incapacitated persons would be a barren exercise, if those operating such places did not possess those basic human qualities, that are such an enormous factor in making life pleasant for the people who must live in them.  In dealing with premises of the kind to which this Bill applies we must remember that their very existence shows that they fulfil a genuine public need. Any legislation, no matter how well-intentioned, which would tend to increase their costs and their tariff, and by doing so, tend also to deny them to some invalids who may need them most, would be from the social point of view, a grave disservice.</P>
    <P>Because the end to be aimed at is the happiness and well-being of those who are being cared for in these places, and because the kindness and humanity of those in charge of them will conduce much more to this end than the number of bathrooms provided, or a prescribed menu, or a designated type of floor-covering in the rooms, we must eschew any tendency to set up standards which might be unduly rigid or exacting. Were the contrary line to be taken, it could happen that some homes where, at present, incapacitated persons are kept, and where they are reasonably happy, would fail to meet the statutory requirements and would be driven to close down.  So much the greater demand would then be made on those which remained and fees would tend to rise.  They might even rise substantially; and the ultimate outcome of our well-intentioned endeavour could well be that not a few people who solely need this kind of accommodation might be deprived of the facility because of their inability to meet the cost.  Thus by the pursuit of perfection a situation might be created where many people would find themselves, not better, but worse off than they are at present.</P>
    <P>Health authorities, whose function it will be to enforce this Bill, will have adequate powers of inspection to enable them to do so but only where&mdash;and this is important&mdash;they have ground for believing that inspection is necessary. Officers of health authorities will not, let me emphasise, be empowered to invade any premises, unless <Col N="1586" /> they have reasonable grounds for believing inspection to be necessary. Their powers of inspection are provided for by subsection (2) of section 1. By virtue of this subsection in accordance with which the Bill is to be construed with the Health Acts, 1947 to 1960, an authorised officer of a health authority will be entitled to conduct an inspection of any premises which fall within the definition set out in subsection (1) of the same section. Such an inspection may be made at any time; but it is my view&mdash;and I shall so provide in any regulations I may make&mdash;that, as a general rule, premises will be inspected only when a complaint has been received by the health authority from a responsible person.  If a health authority, whether as a result of a complaint or otherwise, has reasonable cause to believe that a person in a home for the incapacitated is not receiving proper care, then under paragraph (h) of subsection (2) of section 2, an officer, and, again, he must be an authorised officer, will have power, in accordance with regulations, to conduct interviews in private with inmates in it and with members of its staff.</P>
    <P>Finally, should a health authority, having taken everything into account and weighing one thing against another, conclude that conditions in a particular establishment are below a reasonable standard, it is empowered by section 5 of the Bill to prosecute the person carrying it on or any person concerned with its management; and, in this connection the court, under subsections (5) and (6), may impose penalties which, it will be seen, may be quite severe.</P>
    <P>In framing this legislation, I have been particularly anxious to ensure that those responsible for establishments which are operated in a responsible and humane way should not be subjected to unwarranted interference and harassment.  Allegations that bad conditions prevail in many of these places and that residents or inmates in them have been subjected to maltreatment, have been made, with great freedom, it is true, but, so far, scarcely ever than in the most general terms. Definite charges related to specific homes have been extremely rare and, <Col N="1587" /> upon inquiry, have not been substantiated.</P>
    <P>As an example of what I have in mind, I would recount certain things which were said when this Bill was being debated in Seanad Éireann.  They outline, I think fairly, the position of those who, because the Bill is not based on the assumption, <i>a priori,</i> that the necessity for registration has been established, are dissatisfied with it.</P>
    <P>My first quotation sums up succinctly what I may describe as the general indictment laid by those who were hesitant about accepting the Bill against those who operate the type of home with which it is concerned. Their mouthpiece in this instance was Senator Murphy, for whose ability I may say I have the greatest respect. He said&mdash;I quote from Volume 57, Columns 24 and 25: &ldquo;What she&rdquo;&mdash; that is Senator Miss Davidson&mdash;&ldquo;and many others have been saying&rdquo;&mdash;but not, may I interpolate, Senator Murphy &mdash;&ldquo;is that some of them&rdquo;&mdash;homes for the incapacitated&mdash;&ldquo;are badly run and they are operated by people of bad character.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To suggest that a premises, business or institution is operated by &ldquo;people of bad character&rdquo; is a truly formidable charge.  It was made on the 13th November last in the Seanad; and one would have expected that, in the course of the several Stages of the Bill in the Seanad, those who made it would support their charges by irrefutable evidence.  No attempt was made to do this however; and the Bill entered on its Committee Stage on the 13th December, some four weeks later.  In the meantime, no fact whatever had been mentioned that could justify, in any way, the grave charges which, during the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill, had been made by the proponents of registration.  Instead, as a substitute for facts, we had a strong element of emotionalism injected into the discussion in Committee by Senator Crowley who spoke in support of an amendment proposed by Senator Miss Davidson.  His argument in favour of it was&mdash;I quote from Volume 57, Column 124 of the Seanad Debates:</P>
    <P>We cannot possibly hope to get <Col N="1588" /> at the abuses that we all in our hearts do know to exist if we cannot even from this point on decide where we are to look for them.  Without registration, it is clearly impossible for anybody to satisfy himself that these abuses do not exist.</P>
    <P>It is well to review that statement in detail for this reason: it sets out succinctly, but comprehensively, the only case which those who want registration have been able to make in justification of their demand.  It is an entirely hypothetical one and, it is admitted, is based on no more than an apprehension&mdash;an apprehension, I may say, which is in no way supported by such facts as have ever been adduced, that abuses exist.  However, whether such abuses are hypothetical or actual, the House must consider what is assumed by the Senator's statement, what it admits and what it proposes.</P>
    <P>First of all, Senator Crowley assumes, in one broad sweep, that we all, that is, everybody, every Deputy in Dáil Éireann, not excluding myself, know in our hearts that abuses exist. Well, I, for one, do not know this, either in my heart or in, what is in this context the more appropriate organ to use, my head.  I repeat, not for the first time, that I have no positive knowledge that abuses exist, and I shrewdly suspect that this is the case also with those who followed Senator Miss Davidson in the Seanad.  At no time has there been put before me substantial and reliable evidence that abuses have occurred, indicating where they have occurred, and who has been responsible for them.  Not once has evidence of a kind which would withstand investigation been adduced to me, though I have sought for it eagerly. I have received some, not many, allegations about nursing homes in general. A few of these have been couched in strong, categoric language but when I have pursued them, they have all fizzled out.</P>
    <P>I am not, however, to be taken as affirming that there is no possibility of abuses occurring.  The possibility that abuses will arise in association with human activities is always with us.  But if abuses do occur in nursing homes, <Col N="1589" /> then, the lack of trustworthy evidence on that head, suggests that they must be of extreme rarity; they must be, indeed, highly isolated exceptions to the general rule.  This, in fact, seems to be admitted by the Senator whom I have quoted.  They are even so rare, he has told us, speaking for himself and his colleagues&mdash;and I quote&mdash;that &ldquo;we cannot even from this point on decide where to look for them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Nevertheless the Senator and his friends persist in demanding that the State should go looking for them. They, themselves, cannot find the needle which they believe to be in the haystack, but they want the apparatus of the State and the local authorities to be utilised in that frustrating quest.  An inquisition is to be initiated, a witchhunt is to be started, honest people, who provide a desirable service, are to be harried and chivied, in order that some Senators and those for whom they speak may be found to be justified in their suspicions.</P>
    <P>In substance this is the last ditch argument against the procedure which is proposed in the Bill.  Indeed it would appear to be now their sole maintainable argument in favour of registration.  Give us registration, says the Senator whom I have quoted, and I quote him again &ldquo;because without registration, it is clearly impossible for anybody to satisfy himself that abuses do not exist&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Thus no bones are made in admitting that the main reason why registration is demanded is to prove that the suspicions which some persons harbour are unwarranted; it is wanted by some people in order to dispel the poor view which they take of their fellows.  Now the nett issue which arises here is of fundamental significance, for it concerns the rights of the individual citizen within the State. It may be stated as follows: Should Dáil Éireann or perhaps even, may Dáil Éireann in order to satisfy persons coming within the categories to which I have referred, in order to prove conclusively to them, that they are wrong, in order to demonstrate for their personal satisfaction that their beliefs and their doubts are warped, jaundiced, biassed and superficial, compel men and women&mdash;but in this <Col N="1590" /> particular case principally women&mdash;to prove that they are good, honest, upright and humane persons, before they will be permitted to engage in the occupation for which they believe themselves to be, by disposition and training, best fitted.</P>
    <P>In short it would appear that the main reason why registration is being asked for is that there may be set up a sort of courtmartial procedure under which those who provide homes for incapacitated persons will be called upon to prove themselves, not only not to be guilty of cruelty, callousness and inhumanity towards their patients, but also not to be people of bad character.</P>
    <P>I must again revert in this context to Senator Crowley's statement and emphasise that he was candid enough to say that he did not even know where to look for the abuses which he declared he knew in his heart to exist. Nevertheless he proceeded to say&mdash;and again I quote from column 124:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I want merely to make this observation on that aspect of this problem, that I find it extremely difficult to accept a contention that either the Minister or his Department or his Departmental officials are not very well aware by now that abuses do exist and I do not think it is quite fair to suggest that they do not.</P>
    <P>Thus Senator Crowley, who had already admitted that he did not even know where to look for abuses, took me to task, because I said that I shared his dilemma because nobody, for all the racket that had been raised about this matter, has come to me and said: &ldquo;I know that in such and such premises old people, infirm people, invalids are being inhumanely used.&rdquo; Until this Bill was in Committee in Seanad Éireann&mdash;and I am coming to that&mdash;not one person ever said so much to me.  When I made this point, however, in the Seanad I was all but accused of lying, in the passage which I have just quoted; and when I protested, the Senator went on to say&mdash; again as reported in column 124&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just pointing out&mdash;and this is of particular importance&mdash;that I have not had any reliable statement or fact which would induce me to believe that registration and individual prior inspections of these places is necessary.  I was going on to mention what happened in the Seanad in that connection.  It is a matter of public record and I am quoting what is already in the report of the proceedings of that House and what was said there.  May I repeat it? The quotation is:</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's statement, as made now, but I think I am entitled to make the observation that I find it extremely difficult to accept a situation in which the Minister for Health and his Department at this stage of our knowledge of this problem are still looking for absolute evidence of abuses.</P>
      <P>Following this, the Senator referred to a letter, mentioning six specific homes, in which it was stated that abuses existed.  Finally, the Senator read the letter; and I am very glad that he did so because the sequel affords a lesson to us all.  Within a few days I received statements which left me, at any rate, in no doubt that so far as some of the places cited were concerned, the allegations had no substance in them.  I do not wish to say more on this matter just now, since it is possible that the letter may be the subject of legal proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said, and I have been leading up to this, that the provisions of the Bill do not go far enough.  On the basis, therefore, of such evidence as has been produced hitherto, there is no justification nor proven need to go further.  Furthermore, experience elsewhere has shown that registration and inspection do not, in themselves, provide the answer to our problem.  Conditions in Great Britain differ from ours in certain critical aspects; nevertheless, it is relevant, in this connection, to mention, in passing, the position in Britain where to deal with this particular problem four Acts of Parliament have been passed.  Yet, despite the fact that these Acts provide for registration and close inspection, in <Col N="1594" /> accordance with comprehensive regulations, it is alleged quite frequently that abuses persist, and that aged, infirm and incapacitated persons are exploited by those who maintain them for private profit.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that all homes, whether run for private profit or not, should be included within the scope of the Bill.  As Deputies will know, many of these homes for the incapacitated are places where the old and infirm are maintained and cared for by members of religious orders.  Many others are purely charitable institutions maintained by voluntary organisations of lay people.  It has been argued that, if a system of automatic and regular inspection of these homes were to become the rule, the authorities in charge of institutions, such as I have cited, would not object.</P>
    <P>The fundamental assumption, however, underlying the demand for inspection is that it is essential in order to prevent wrong being done, necessary in order to estop someone from doing something.  Clearly, the something in question, if not in its own nature intrinsically evil, is at best so undesirable that it should be made unlawful; and, in the case of the establishments to which the Bill applies, the &ldquo;something&rdquo; that is implied by those who are clamouring for compulsory registration and routine inspection, without warrant or proven justification for such procedures, is not only something which should be declared to be unlawful, but is, in itself, callous and inhumane.  I, for one, am not prepared to concede that callousness and inhumanity are likely to be found in institutions and homes for the aged and infirm which are operated from motives of the most profound charity.</P>
    <P>It is opportune at this point to refer to section 4.  It confers on the Minister power of exemption; so that homes which are operated by the type of body I have referred to, and which are known to be well-run and satisfactory establishments, will not be subject to interference and unnecessary controls. Some such places may have been approved already for special purposes <Col N="1595" /> under the Health Acts; and these will be exempted under subsection (1).</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) will give the Minister power to exempt other homes which may apply for exemption and to which after due consideration he determines that it might appropriately be extended.  This provision has been criticised on the grounds that it is far too wide; that it is contrary to the intentions of the Bill; and that it would, in fact, be used to negative its provisions.  I should like to say a brief word about these objections.</P>
    <P>First of all, is it not patently absurd to suggest that any Minister who introduced a measure, like the one we are considering, would subsequently take action to render it ineffective?  Section 4 is required to relieve certain institutions to which, were it not for the section, the Bill would apply.  The places in question are not operated for gain, but a few patients in them may be maintained at an element of profit. In general, these are patients whose relatives either maintain them wholly or contribute to their maintenance, or, in some cases, they may be the beneficiaries of a trust established for their maintenance in the institution.  By virtue of the definition of &ldquo;home&rdquo; in section 1, such establishments would automatically come within the scope of the Bill; but subsection (2) of section 4 will allow them to be exempted from it.</P>
    <P>I have introduced this Bill because it has been alleged, though, I must repeat, without any substantial evidence in support, that in some places persons infirm in body or mind or otherwise incapacitated have been treated inhumanely. In no instance, when definite charges related to specified establishments have been made, have such charges stood up even <i>prima facie</i> to investigation.  But, even though substantiated cases have not been brought to my notice, it is not outside the range of possibility, perhaps the range of probability, that some such places may exist.  If they do, the Bill will facilitate the appropriate health authority in &ldquo;smoking them out&rdquo; and will enable it in due course to have <Col N="1596" /> them closed down, should this be necessary.  I envisage that the measure will operate more or less as follows.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that individuals carrying on homes for incapacitated persons will be obliged, under pain of heavy penalty, to notify this fact to the health authority for the area in which the premises are.  Since heavy penalties may be inflicted on the proprietor of a home who does not comply with his obligations under section 3 it may be assumed that, in due course, the health authority will become aware of all premises within its area to which the measure applies.  Once it is made aware of a home's existence the health authority, acting on a complaint or otherwise, can conduct an inspection to see to what extent conditions may or may not be unsatisfactory. In this way it will be put in a position to investigate a complaint or even, whenever it believes the step to be warranted, without a complaint and of its own initiative, take action to establish what the conditions in any particular home may be.  If remedial measures are called for, the health authority can have them enforced, by prosecuting the proprietor.  It will be noted that the Bill provides for heavy penalties, including fines, imprisonment and even the prohibiting of the person concerned from operating or conducting the premises, or any other premises in the future, as a home for incapacitated persons.</P>
    <P>As with the British system, time may show that the procedure to be established by the Bill has its defects.  It may be that, as our knowledge and experience of the problems involved in the operation of homes for the incapacitated increases, we shall have to amend the law.  But what is here proposed has the advantages over any system of registration, in that it has that degree of flexibility which, at this stage, is an absolute essential in dealing with this matter.  To preach counsels of perfection may be all very well; but to aim at perfection in this Bill might well be to legislate some homes out of existence, and, thereby, to gravely narrow the choice for those aged and incapacitated people who need them most.  This, on the basis <Col N="1597" /> of information so far available to me, I do not feel justified in doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill directs the attention of this House, as it did that of Seanad Éireann, to a problem which exists in our society.  Under the manner in which we organise our health services, we do not provide under any comprehensive programme for old people with some means, for the chronically ill with some means available to them, for the person who suffers from some long-standing physical disability and who has some means available to him.  All these people, under the manner in which at the moment we organise our health services, are forced to fend for themselves.</P>
      <P>The Minister has brought the measure first to Seanad Éireann and now here because he was conscious of a suggestion or allegations that were made that many homes into which people had gone because they needed some form of comfort and help were not run in a proper way.  The Minister felt&mdash;and I think any Minister for Health would feel as he felt&mdash;that when allegations of that kind were made, some measure of a legislative kind should be introduced to deal with the suggestions made.  The measure the Minister has introduced in the circumstances is a fair compromise.  He has sought to deal in a limited way with the kind of home in respect of which allegations were made and he has sought to provide a system under which allegations made at any time in the future can be examined.</P>
      <P>Of course this measure is a stopgap. The desirable situation would be to provide for old and infirm people, persons suffering from permanent physical injury, under a comprehensive health scheme, a proper domiciliary nursing service and services of that kind.  Until we can do that, we have to appreciate that people in those circumstances will wish to make their own arrangements and they will tend to enter into a contract with a person running some decent home and they will provide under their contract that they will get at least the rudiments of home care in such homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree entirely with the Minister in <Col N="1598" /> this respect that if the State is to provide any measure of legislative control or supervision, it is of the utmost importance that the result of what the State does should not be to set such a standard that the homes at present available will be raised in price beyond the capacity of these unfortunate people to meet.  The State has a greater responsibility.  I should like to see the State introducing a new form of health service.  I should like to see these unfortunate people who are incapacitated by reason of age or infirmity cared for under a comprehensive health service. However, if we cannot have that, if we deny them that and if we continue to compel them to fend for themselves, let us not put out of their reach the plank that may be available to save them from distress and anxiety.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is right when he says that care must be taken by him or any Minister for Health that standards or regulations likely to be made under this Bill are not such as to require an expenditure which in itself would involve a price to those people which would force them not to avail themselves of whatever facilities are there at the moment.</P>
    <P>What the Minister says in his introductory speech with regard to the need at present being filled by these homes, which the Minister does not call nursing homes, will be generally recognised.  These homes obviously fulfil a social need.  In many cases old or infirm people do not have the benefits of a family who can provide for them or, for one reason or another, their care and maintenance in the family become impossible.  It is a fact that at the moment many of them find a very desirable hermitage in homes such as are dealt with in this Bill.  That is a fact which must be borne in mind and which we should keep before us in relation to this legislation.</P>
    <P>It would be very wrong if by any intemperate or hasty action, we prevented people from providing that kind of service.  It is in that respect I think the measure the Minister has introduced is a fair compromise.  It goes just sufficiently far, but it does not err by seeking to go further than it <Col N="1599" /> should.  On that ground, and subject to the reservations I have mentioned, I should like to see a different system.  I believe we will see a different system eventually, but, within the present health policy, we have to make do with this kind of independent effort by decent people providing decent homes for those who can afford to pay a little; and so long as we have to do that, I think this measure meets the requirements created by the allegations which were made and which, I agree, had to be dealt with by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Subject to that, may I make just one suggestion?  It occurs to me as a somewhat strange commentary on our sense of values that we recognise without question that the State is right in providing grants and loans to different people to improve their boarding houses, small private hotels and all the rest in order to provide pleasant rooms for welcome foreign visitors.  But it is strange that, in relation to a small insignificant home, where two or three old people might be kept for a mere pittance, the State would not feel it a good investment in relation to a more pleasant old age for our people, that some small grant be given in order to raise in some way the standards all of us would like to see obtaining in these homes.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it would cost a great deal.  I know well it is not the responsibility of the Minister for Health, but I suggest that at some stage in the future, while the regulations he will make under this Bill will not be unduly onerous on those who have to observe them, the Minister might consider canvassing the view with the Minister for Finance that in some way out of the proceeds of various items of taxation some system of loans and grants should be made available to improve homes of this kind.  After all, it may be only a small section of the community.  Unfortunately, far too many of our old people have, for one reason or another, to go to the institutions maintained by the health authorities.  Too few of them can be maintained at home.  I have strong views as to why that is so, but it is so.  In relation to the small <Col N="1600" /> section covered by this Bill, if you have sufficient means to provide a little for them in their old age, I think it would be a worthwhile effort by the State.  It fills a need in our health services.  I do not think the State would be acting in any way recklessly if it helped private people to do what, if they did not do, the State would have to do itself in a more expensive and lavish way.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this Bill, under its Long Title and definition section, was limited in its application to homes in which incapacitated persons were maintained for private profit. That indicates to me that the home, which may now be inspected if this Bill becomes law, is a home run by a private individual, who perhaps makes a little at the end of the week out of providing food, shelter and a little bit of comfort for the incapacitated person who stays with him.  It is obviously not intended to apply to homes run by religious institutions and communities of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That meets the point I had in mind.  The only other point is this.  It appears under the definition of &ldquo;incapacitated&rdquo; in section I that any sick person would, in fact, be covered.  An incapacitated person would be a person incapable by reason of old age, physical infirmity or physical injury, defect or disease. That is sufficiently wide to cover any kind of acute illness.  The Minister said specifically&mdash;he sought to emphasise it &mdash;that the persons to whom the Bill will apply are not in the normal sense of the word acutely ill, but the definition is wide enough to cover persons acutely ill.  Perhaps the Minister might indicate why that appears to be so under the terms of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  In the circumstances, it is a reasonable and proper compromise.  I think one could by impetuous action in a field of this kind do a disservice to the persons whose interests we obviously value in relation <Col N="1601" /> to this Bill.  What the Minister has done is reasonable.  The Bill goes sufficiently far and does not err by going too far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is usual to find a Bill of this kind initiated by a responsible Minister in pursuance of the duties imposed on him by the House.  The idea for this Bill started off with proposals by certain Labour members of Seanad Éireann drawing the attention of the Minister to something which, quite obviously, up to that he had not found worthy of recognition or alteration. Perhaps his vindictiveness today stems from the fact that humble Senators of the Labour Party presumed to show him, the Minister for Health, where he had failed to help out a section of the community who needed help.  Certainly, there can be no excuse for the scurrilous attacks on honest Labour Senators who tried to remedy in their own humble way a glaring defect in the health services.  I am surprised at the Minister allowing himself to be so led away as to suggest that because we have not produced names and addresses for him and his Department, every statement made by Labour Senators is ill-founded, untrue, and unjustifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates to private homes, non-registered homes, homes that have not been examined in any way over the past number of years, but there are other homes which come directly under the Minister's charge, county homes.  I do not want to tie myself too closely to dates but between 1945 and 1947, I was a member of a health authority and there was a county home in the area I represented which was under the jurisdiction of the Minister and his officers.  As a result of a visit I paid to that home as an appointed representative for a particular month, I found that old people confined there or kept there had not got a potato for six months, that their staple diet from the October to April preceding my visit consisted of cold milk and dry bread.  These things can be proved. The home in question was the county home in Dungarvan, under the care of a very respectable religious order.  I can say that the food menu as prescribed <Col N="1602" /> in 1914 had not been altered until my visit in 1945, 1946 or 1947.</P>
    <P>If that can happen in a home controlled by the Minister, subject to investigation by his officers and subject to monthly inspection by representatives of the health authority, what then can happen in private homes over which there is no control? Anything I say can be examined and proved.  There was an investigation, in which the Minister at the time was represented and I and Senator Butler, who made the complaint, were found to be justified in what we had said.  As a result, a complete change in menu and in conditions has since been brought about.</P>
    <P>If that could happen at that time, why does the Minister now accuse Labour people who suggest, and only suggest, that there is need for supervision, that there is need for inspection? Why does the Minister become so resentful?  I do not think for a moment that the Minister does not want to see homes improved.  The only reason I can suggest is that he is jealous of the fact that he had not thought of it in time.</P>
    <P>As to his suggestion that the Labour Deputies will follow the example of the Labour Senators and argue that this measure is not good enough, that more should have been done, let me say that the Labour Deputies accept the fact that this Bill is a good Bill, a step in the right direction.  We have no criticism to make of the Minister because he has brought in the Bill.  Rather do we welcome the Bill as some attempt to regulate a matter which up to this has been without any control, without any examination.  The fact that we say the Minister has not gone as far as we would wish does not imply in any way that we do not see the validity of his argument that if a person takes one single person into his home, by virtue of the fact that either he knew the person concerned or for some other reason, even though he made some profit out of that person being there, he should not be subject to rigid inspection.</P>
    <P>All we are asking, and quite honestly <Col N="1603" /> asking, and we hope to put down amendments to that end, is that these homes be registered, that the local authority should know what homes there are and that qualified officers capable of inspecting these homes should have the power to visit them and inspect the conditions under which they are run.  I do not think that is anything exceptionable.  We have not criticised the Bill other than to indicate slight weaknesses.  I do not understand why the Minister should feel it necessary to make a vindictive attack on the persons who made suggestions in regard to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not think for a moment that the ordinary health inspectors of the local authority will feel that they will have any function beyond that which they have to inspect a factory premises to see whether conditions are hygienic or not.  We are not dealing in this case with animals.  We are not dealing with dead meat.  We are dealing with human beings.  It is not so unforgivable of Labour Party Senators to suggest to the Minister that registration should be compulsory, that inspectors should have the right to go in and to check not only the air space, not only in regard to hygiene, but as to the type of staff ministering to the requirements of the patients, and their qualifications. If patients require medical attention, is it unreasonable to suggest that a person giving an injection should have some kind of training, whether it be as a nurse or otherwise?  We are dealing with human beings, people who are put into homes, in many cases people who have no knowledge of where they are being put.  It is all very well to say that in other countries when people have reached that stage there was another way out for them. I do not think we in this country subscribe to that.</P>
    <P>Nobody is going to make out that in homes in Ireland where old people are kept they are not treated decently. A point was made by the Minister. He quoted Senator Murphy, who quoted Senator Miss Davidson.  I quote from page 4 of the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy said: &ldquo;What she&rdquo;&mdash;that is, Senator Miss Davidson&mdash;<Col N="1604" />&ldquo;and many others have been saying&rdquo;&mdash;but not, may I interpolate, Senator Murphy&mdash;&ldquo;is that some of these&rdquo;&mdash; homes for the incapacitated&mdash;&ldquo;are badly run and they are operated by people of bad character&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister suggest that he has never heard of anything like that? Has the Minister ever heard of Hume Street?  It was in the papers not so many years ago?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not.  I suggest it was worthy of inspection.  When one finds a body thrown on the footpath at six o'clock in the morning, it suggests that some action is necessary. I suggest that the Minister need not be so surprised at the notion of people of bad character running homes in Ireland.  It has been proved.  I am sure he does not want it proved again in that manner.  Do not be surprised when Senator Miss Davidson and some other Labour Senators say that some of our homes in Ireland are being run by people of bad character and for bad purposes.  The Minister should not be so aghast at this.  He should remember some of the things that have happened.  When one of these things come to light, there may always be other undisclosed homes run by bad people as well as the majority of homes which are run by good people.</P>
      <P>The Minister's attack on the Labour people in the Seanad is uncalled for. His jealousy because these people have brought to light something which he himself should have brought to light should not stop him from doing something which he knows is for the public good.  If he does something for the public good, he will get the support and co-operation of the Labour Party but if he does not co-operate, he will find that the Labour Party can be as bitter as he can be himself.  We want a good Bill.  We want one that will remedy the evils we know are there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> I have here a communication from the Joint Committee of Women's Societies and Social Workers.  The address given is 112 Morehampton Road, Donnybrook, which the Minister probably knows better than I do because it is only a name to me.  It is headed &ldquo;Nursing Home Bill&rdquo; and it sets out a number of points as follows:</P>
    <P> (1)  We are dissatisfied with this Bill because it seems only to permit action on a matter to which the Minister's attention has been drawn over a period of years;</P>
    <P>(2)  The regulations should govern all nursing homes.  The law should be the same for all, and there should be no loopholes.  There are endowed homes and homes run by charitable and religious organisations. They should also conform to the minimum standards laid down;</P>
    <P>(3)  All nursing homes should be registered, and a list of them should be available to the public;</P>
    <P>(4)  No nursing home should be allowed to receive patients unless it is registered.  No home should be registered until it has been inspected by a qualified officer as to the suitability of the premises and the adequacy of the staff;</P>
    <P>(5)  A certificate of registration similar to that in hotels, should hang in a prominent place in the hall of the nursing home;</P>
    <P>(6)  The health authorities should have power to enter and inspect all parts of the premises at any reasonable time;</P>
    <P>(7)  Every nursing home should have at least one qualified nurse, and the proportion of nurses to the number of patients should be laid down by the Minister;</P>
    <P>(8)  The administration of drugs, sedatives, or injections, except by qualified persons under doctor's orders, should be prohibited;</P>
    <P>(9)  Penalties should be laid down for contraventions of the regulations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> I do not say that the Labour Party go all the way with that communication but it goes to show that, outside the Labour Senators who initiated these proposals, there is a view amongst the public, much as the Minister may not like it, that there is need for supervision and general control of these homes.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, instead of the type of address he gave us today, he should seek our co-operation and the help and co-operation of the Opposition in producing a Bill which, as far as possible, will meet whatever defects there are in these matters without inflicting unfair and unreal restrictions on anybody.</P>
    <P>I would say that the religious orders would welcome inspection.  They have nothing to fear and the very fact that they are omitted from inspection implies that they have something to hide. I have a fair knowledge of the religious orders doing charitable work and I am quite sure they have nothing to hide in any way.  They are prepared to have their premises inspected by the Minister's officials.  The Minister should accept that and extend the Bill to cover all people who run these homes for private profit.  If it is a charitable undertaking, let them do it for charity but let them be subject to inspection.</P>
    <P>If these things that have been mentioned could happen under the direct control of the Minister and the local authorities, much worse things can happen in non-registered homes, homes that are in existence without the knowledge of the people.  We welcome the Minister's efforts to remedy the evil and we know his difficulties.  We do not want to put any further difficulties in his way but we want to see this Bill put into operation as a measure that will eliminate any evils that may exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For one reason, if for no other, this Bill is welcome because it proves that where there is a will there is a way.  Without taking in any way from the efforts of the Labour members of Seanad Éireann, I want to point out that for some years past I regularly tabled questions in this <Col N="1607" /> House to the Minister for Health asking him to have regard to the need for a Bill to deal with nursing homes. On each occasion I was told that it was impossible to define nursing homes and that therefore it was impossible to introduce a Bill to deal with them.  It is good to know that we have now reached the stage in our political evolution when our parliamentary draftsmen are so skilled that they can define a nursing home as a home from which persons can make profit by providing care and decent comfort for the sick and infirm.</P>
      <P>While it is not easy for me to find in my heart a sense of gratitude to the Minister, I am glad he has succeeded in doing this and now that he has done it, perhaps he would go further and provide a system of registration. Has any reputable nursing home anything to fear from a system of registration?  I suggest that it has not.  Quite the reverse: it has everything to gain.  If a person is running a reasonably well conducted nursing home providing people with decent treatment, food and cleanliness, he has nothing to fear if his name is put on a list of registered nursing homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this Oireachtas has already seen fit to provide that no inn will be entitled to describe itself as an hotel unless it keeps certain standards, I do not see any reason why we should not say that any institution holding itself out as looking after sick and infirm people will not be entitled to describe itself as a nursing home unless it maintains certain minimum standards. I do not think it costs any money to keep certain standards of cleanliness and it is nonsense for the Minister to talk about the danger of prescribing by regulation certain standards which might make nursing homes so costly that many people who now are cared for in them would no longer have such homes to go to.  Cleanliness and such matters are so necessary to health that there is no excuse for not prescribing them or for refusing to withhold from the dirty house the description of nursing home.  Yet that is <Col N="1608" /> a step the Minister is not prepared to take and which I think he should take in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate the difficulty of defining in any great detail in a Bill such as this the minima considered necessary because, apart from anything else, medical science is something which changes from year to year and sometimes more often and even if we tried to spell out in the Bill what is now regarded as the ultimate in medical and scientific knowledge, we might, in a matter of months, have to change it. Therefore, it is probably better that detailed requirements should be left to regulation, but there are certain things which, because they are so simple and are matters which do not require any great medical knowledge or skill, matters of everyday knowledge, and, as things are at present, even those minima do not apply to nursing homes and any person can hold himself or herself out as running a nursing home and keeping in it people who are infirm because of old age or mental or physical infirmity.</P>
    <P>I share with other Deputies and with members of the other House the common knowledge that there are some people holding themselves forth as proprietors of nursing homes who have not provided proper cleanliness, food, or facilities for the people in them.  The Minister will not provoke me into reciting details because, for one thing, I would not trust the details to the Minister because if any particular case were submitted to him, his anxiety would not be to redress the evil but to prove the person who supplied the information wrong.  He has repeated himself in that particular manner so often that we who frequently hear cases of hardship must be chary of submitting them to a person whose main anxiety will be to blacken the character of the person furnishing the information.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, whether the rumours are well-founded or not, it is necessary that the people should be protected against ill treatment and in order to do that, to provide a proper system of registration from which the <i>bona fide</i> and qualified proprietor of <Col N="1609" /> a nursing home has nothing to fear, provided the Department of Health acts reasonably.  I do not blame the Minister for thinking that he or his Department might not act reasonably and might prescribe unreasonable standards.</P>
    <P>The record in respect of reason is not entirely unblemished but that is an administrative matter and I think Deputies are entitled to say that there are certain reasonable standards, certain minima which ought to be laid down, and that if you do not lay them down, you are providing an excuse of an Act, but not an Act which will protect the public.</P>
    <P>As things are, it is difficult to find accommodation for elderly people and there are many elderly people who are independent-minded and it is proper for their own welfare that they should be able to maintain their independence. They have great difficulty in finding nursing homes or homes of any kind into which they can go.  As things stand, it is a hit or miss system for many of these people before they get a suitable home and not infrequently they must travel round from one house to another before they find a decent standard.  That difficulty would not arise if we had a system of registration under which nursing homes would not be permitted to describe themselves as such unless they appeared on a certain register.  If that register were kept, I believe those homes which at present are not providing proper treatment and are therefore making exorbitant profit &mdash;it is not as much a question of being unable to provide proper standards out of the moneys they receive but rather that they fail to provide decent service&mdash;would do so, or else would find themselves out of business, just as many so-called hotels failed to maintain proper standards when registration was not compulsory but when it was made compulsory, improved their standards, and, while they may not have got on to the register in the first or second year of registration, they certainly have got on to it since then.</P>
    <P>The question of the cost of these homes is a matter that will depend on the regulations and requirements laid <Col N="1610" /> down but if these are reasonable, we have no reason to be worried about that matter.  Otherwise, I think the Bill in its general effect is one worthy of support.  If it is the most we can get out of the Minister&mdash;and I suspect it is&mdash;it is better than nothing.  If it does nothing else, it will show its own deficiencies within a short time and then it will be open to the House to bring in a further and more suitable measure.  If we do not tackle this problem now, so many more people will suffer.  I think we have a clear moral obligation to look after these unfortunate people who in the autumn of their days or who, due to infirmity at other times, must obtain accommodation in these homes.  I do not think it reasonable for us to say that those who profit, or hope to profit, by the infirmity or hardship of others should not be subjected to a certain amount of inspection and regulation.  It is necessary that the good of these people be achieved so far as practicable and that can be done by requiring these homes to be conducted in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>No reasonable, well-behaved home will object to a system of registration so long as the Department behaves in a reasonable manner.  Whether it will or not is again something we shall have to learn from the future but, by and large, I think hoteliers do not unduly complain about the inspections of Bord Fáilte.  Sometimes, they may think their standards are too high&mdash; perhaps they are&mdash;but we need not require from the average nursing home of modest means the kind of service paid for in the most luxurious of private homes, although I think that would be the ideal.  We would hope the day would come when that kind of service would be available to everybody but as a first measure, if certain minimum standards are laid down, a system of compulsory registration can be introduced, a system of denying inferior homes the title of nursing home and it will provide some degree of protection and start nursing homes on an upward spiral of improved standards and better accommodation for the less fortunate in the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is defective <Col N="1611" /> in the sense that it does not seek the registration of these homes.  Is it because the Minister is conscious of this fact, that if certain basic prerequisites to registration were set down&mdash;ones which we would all consider acceptable here&mdash;and if refusal to honour these prerequisites were made a matter for the courts, with power given to the courts to withdraw a licence or close down the establishment which did not honour those prerequisites, the net result would be that the majority of his county homes which are operated by the local authorities would automatically merit closure because of the very serious defects in so many of them in regard to the conditions provided by local authorities for old people under their care?</P>
      <P>That must be uppermost in the Minister's mind, the fact that for over 40 years we have failed to create such conditions within our county homes that it could be said the reasonable minimum requirements were being observed in relation to food, the standard of ordinary simple medical needs, recreation, comforts, and the general amenities that most of us think we would like in our old age.  I do not think there are many of us who know many county homes which would reach such a standard.  The Minister, inside that small sized glass-house, in my view, probably finds he is slightly reluctant to start casting stones at these people, outside the ambit of his activities, who are providing comparable services for incapacitated old people and old people generally in the community, in the form of private nursing homes and old persons' homes. As I say, it seems to me to be a sad commentary on our achievements over 40 years that the old people&mdash;who, with the young, should be the most cherished in our community&mdash;should be on the whole&mdash;there are a few notable exceptions among the local authorities&mdash;living in places where they are expected to spend the remaining years of their lives under substandard conditions, to put it at its mildest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can understand the Minister's predicament.  In fact, my own <Col N="1612" /> experience of homes and of old people's homes is that the only attractive ones that I know of, of the type which I should like to see universal as private homes or local authority homes, are a couple in my constituency in Dublin South-East.  They are the McGeough homes and the Methodist Women's Home, some place in Donnybrook. The reason I mention those two homes is that I do not think they are run for profit.  They are run by a religious group and are endowed and because they are endowed in a certain way, it is possible for those running them to give fine and humane conditions at a reasonable cost to the people living in them.</P>
    <P>If one must accept a society which in the public sector does not provide proper facilities for ageing people, as in our society as we know it to-day, I cannot see how it is possible to run any substantial sector of that type of service for aged people or incapacitated old people, and run it at a profit. The only way in which the service will be provided is under the local authority or in some way by private persons who are endowed and in that way able to reduce the direct charge on the people, if there is any charge on the people in the homes.</P>
    <P>The problem is a growing problem. We know the two reasons for this. One is that young people are emigrating and leaving an ageing population here, and the second is that because of the advances in medical science, people are living longer.  It is a problem which must be dealt with by this House.  One of our difficulties is that we are dealing with a problem the precise dimensions of which we do not really know.  I do not think we know the problem's true dimensions even in the broadest sense and it is a very difficult subject to discuss except in the most general terms for that reason.</P>
    <P>I believe there is no reason in the world why the Minister should not approach the problem by insisting on the registration of these homes, or whatever he may call them.  I do not agree with his assessment of the problem. He said somewhere that the amenities in a home of this kind need not be anything much greater than <Col N="1613" /> those one would find in an ordinary home.  I am paraphrasing him now. Generally speaking, he believes it is possible to nurse an old, incapacitated person in the average home.  I do not agree with that.  There are exceptional circumstances, where there would be a mother and daughter, or a mother and two or three adult children in a large house and living in reasonable circumstances, where this is possible; but dealing with the general position in which families find themselves, I do not think the amenities in the average home are such as to make it possible to nurse the person in the first place or to care for him, and I think nursing does enter into it.  Secondly, I do not think it possible to make any old person happy or content in the average simple amenities of the ordinary home. I think the Minister has to look for more than one would meet in the average home and there must be some nursing content in the staffing of that home.</P>
    <P>As Deputies have pointed out, drugs of one kind or another are almost inevitably necessary for the person who is incapacitated through old age and these should be administered under direct nursing supervision and indirectly under medical supervision.  The whole question of the care of incapacitated old people is pretty well a new science and certainly is not one that can easily be dealt with in anything except a well equipped home or institution. The Minister seems to think that, if there is humane treatment for these old people, then the average old person will be content with that.  He does not exactly say we should settle for that, but his general case is that the average old person will be content at any rate to have that treatment.  I do not think one necessarily rules out the other.</P>
    <P>The Minister says we cannot legislate for that, and, of course, we cannot, but we can legislate for the preconditions to a physically satisfactory home, and I think we should do that. Humane treatment is found in every hospital, whether local authority or voluntary, and in every nursing home and institution.  It is not such a scarce commodity that old persons, when <Col N="1614" /> they meet it, should grapple it to them with hooks of steel, and hang on to it at all costs.  I think they can have both humane treatment and satisfactory physical treatment in this set of circumstances, incapacity and old age.  Incapacity in old age presents a very difficult nursing problem and a very special care problem.  I do not think it is possible to do it properly unless there is some form of near nursing home conditions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made great play with the fact that we have not advanced serious complaints, that complaints have been made but have not been substantiated.  The Minister has, I think overplayed that argument.  He has suggested there was a certain amount of emotionalism in the case made for registration.  I suggest there is even more emotionalism in the case made by him against registration and the associated inspection which that registration implies.  No serious advances would have been made in relation to standards of behaviour and care in many of our present institutions, societies and organisations if we had not accepted, first of all, that there was need for change and, having decided there was need, introduced legislation to give us power to make the changes and ensure they were carried out.</P>
    <P>This is not an exceptional proposition at all.  It is a most mundane, ordinary and commonplace one.  I suppose no one, outside of the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Local Government, has more responsibility for inspections than the Minister for Health: shops, cinemas, schools, county hospitals, mental hospitals, and all sorts of State institutions of one kind or another, including county homes.  Yet, he suggests this idea of inspection is a form of courtmartial. He thereby puts his own inspectors in the role of carrying out courtsmartial. I do not think any of his inspectors can be said to be of the calibre or quality that they regard their function as acting as prosecutors in carrying out courtsmartial.  I do not think anybody has made any attempt to ensure a wholesale condemnation of the people <Col N="1615" /> who operate these homes but there are general principles which seem to many people to make likely, to make possible, if you like, abuses in these homes.  It is quite clear that, if these people are to make a profit, they can make it by cutting down on food, saving money on food, by cutting down on coal, on turf, on oil, on central heating, thereby saving money.  They can cut down, too, on domestic help and on nursing help.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We have seen in the past people operating a particular enterprise taking steps of the kind I suggest in order to make a profit or to increase their profit.  We have had to introduce legislation to deal with that situation.  The one Deputy Ryan mentioned comes to mind.  It is the most obvious&mdash;the inspection of hotels, and so on.  The fact that we give the Minister for Transport and Power, or the Minister for Local Government, certain powers of inspection does not mean that they will carry out courtsmartial on these places.  Giving the legislation does not mean that there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the people operating these businesses and institutions are not good people.  As the Minister says in his opening statement, &ldquo;they are good, honest, upright and humane persons&rdquo; making a living for themselves. The fact that we believe in inspection does not necessarily mean that we believe these people are inhuman Scrooges exploiting the old people who come into their power, but we think that everybody has the same right to our care in supervising the conditions under which they grow old and in which they may become ill when they do grow old.  It is not <Col N="1616" /> always easy to produce facts and statistics, but one person here has done so.  Indeed there is a curious contradiction in the Minister's approach.  On the one hand, he says nothing has been produced to substantiate the charges and he then goes on to say six cases were cited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot prejudge the case and conclude here how the judge will decide.  The main point is that these charges were made to the best of the ability of the people who made them in reply to the Minister's suggestion that they should substantiate the charges.  The difficulty about old people is that, through no fault of their relations, they are put into these homes.  The family may have emigrated.  Sons and daughters may have had to get out of the country, through no fault of their own and incapacitated old persons are left there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1617" /> That kind of old person is not exactly barricade material.  They are not able to do much fighting on behalf of anybody, even on behalf of themselves. The result is that the poor things have to put up with the conditions no matter how they may feel about them. There is nobody else to fight their battles for them.</P>
    <P>For that reason, we think we should have the right of access to these homes. They have nothing to conceal, if the conditions are as the Minister says they are, and I should imagine that in the majority of homes, they are as he says they are.  If the conditions are not satisfactory and if a person has a relation who can take him out of the home and bring him to some other home, that is a simple redress but there may be a number of incapacitated old people who are unable to take that redress, who are unable to move on to another home because of financial, physical or other circumstances.</P>
    <P>Nobody has any quarrel at all with many of the people who are doing this work.  The majority of them, as I can say from my own experience, do provide magnificent conditions for the old people but they are the people who are doing it under some sort of subsidy in the form of an old dispensation.  I have no experience of the other type of home which operates for a profit but I do not think the Minister has made any serious case for not allowing us the right of access to these homes.</P>
    <P>I agree completely that there is great difficulty in attempting to lay down the pre-conditions for the ideal home. However, I think the Minister does know it is possible to devise a set of conditions which would be broadly acceptable, such as running water, kitchens built to certain dimensions, lifts, certain sized rooms, a certain number of people in each room, recreational amenities, and so on.  It must be possible, as it is possible for an hotel, a cinema or shop, to lay down the basic requirements and to ask that those basic requirements be met before registration is granted to a home.  I do <Col N="1618" /> not see why that cannot be carried through.</P>
    <P>The case made by the Minister and by Deputy O'Higgins is that if these basic requirements were insisted upon then some homes would price themselves out of the market.  That is a tacit admission that there are homes which are operating and trying to cater for these incapacitated old people and in which there are not these basic requirements. The Minister should not accept that situation.  He should not allow people to make a profit at the expense of old people by cheeseparing on the amenities which we believe should be provided for them.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the general line referred to in passing by Deputy O'Higgins and by the Minister in his brief, that there are people who do not wish to be a burden on the rates, who do not wish to go into local authority institutions.  I do not like this idea that there is an implied slur on taking any amenity provided by a local authority through the rates of taxation or whatever it might be.  These amenities are provided by us.  Whether they are health services, educational services or services to care for ourselves in old age, they are provided by our own contributions in rates or taxes for when we need them.  We should give up this idea of implying that there is something not quite right in taking something which is provided from rates or taxation.  Everyone has a perfect right to take these amenities. They are our own.  It is a form of insurance into which we have paid in order to avail of these amenities when we need them.</P>
    <P>The main objection by so many people to going into the local authority old persons' homes is that the standard in them is so low.  That is the great objection because we found that when we upgraded the level of services provided in the local authority hospitals, not only were they holding their own with the voluntary hospitals but in many cases outstripping them and taking patients from them.  The ideal situation in a community is that it should be able to provide such conditions for its old people in their last <Col N="1619" /> years that every one of us would feel that these were conditions we would accept ourselves in our old age without any sense of slur or stigma at all.</P>
    <P>As I said on the Health Estimate debate, one of the most wonderful experiences I had was a visit to the old people's homes in Sweden where the facilities provided were as good as one would get in the best quality hotels.  In the initial period of old age without incapacity, one lives in a first-class flat with hotel-type conditions.  Next door is the hospital to which one moves in the incapacitated stage of old age. That, to my mind, is the way in which this problem should be tackled.  This is only a makeshift approach to it.  I do not know how anybody hopes to make any money significantly out of looking after incapacitated old people, that is, if he does it anyway well.  One of the things which shocked me about a few of the places which provide for old people, not the places I mentioned earlier, the McGeough homes, the Methodist homes and so on, but those run on the basis that everybody pays his way, was the enormously high charge that is made for keeping old people before and after they become incapacitated&mdash;ten guineas, 15 guineas a week, obviously outside the capacity of most of us.</P>
    <P>The Minister has seriously overplayed his hand in his suggestion that what everybody wants is the initiation of a witch hunt or that honest people should be harried and chivvied.  That is all gross exaggeration and distortion of the position as proposed by the Senators and everybody else.  All we are asking is that a law be passed here which would bear equally on everybody. Everybody should be subject to inspection.  Nobody would object to inspection who has nothing to conceal, and those who have something to conceal should be forced either to amend their ways or stop the operation of the nursing home or whatever they like to call it.</P>
    <P>The general principle of inspection is such a long accepted one now that at this late stage it is grossly unfair on the part of the Minister to suggest it <Col N="1620" /> is likely to be used as a form of inquisition for harrying innocent people. It runs through the whole gamut of our agricultural services, our local government services and our health services.  Even in relation to old people, there is inspection in regard to our county homes and in relation to the religious orders who run the county homes.  The Minister is trying to make a case for a minority.  Whatever the Senators did in substantiating their case against the bad homes, I do not think the Minister has given any serious basis for his case that inspection and registration would not be well justified by the results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Having looked at the Bill, it seems that all homes run for profit should be registered.  Under section 4, the Minister may exclude certain homes run by religious orders. Where there is more than one person of the kind described in the Bill, registration is necessary.  I accept all that.  The Minister said there were allegations without any specific information. I can understand that.  As a member of Dublin Corporation Housing Committee, I am approached by people every day making accusations that certain people got houses who were not any better than they were and that there must be a &ldquo;fix&rdquo; in it somewhere.  Of course, there is no truth in it.  We have had thousands of such complaints and never once was there any truth in the allegations.  What these people do not know is that the cases they refer to are different from their own.  There may be TB in a family or an extra person in the family.  People are fond of making allegations in which there is no truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the allegations mentioned by the Minister, the question of whether there is any specific ground for them does not arise.  I am guided by certain principles.  I say that what can happen does happen.  When the Minister for Finance brings in a Bill affecting revenue, he does not assume that everyone is honest.  He assumes that we will all break the law if we get a chance, and everything is covered.  In regard to these homes, whether there is any evidence or not is not the point. Human nature being what it is, when <Col N="1621" /> people are out for profit, they will try to make more profit.  I could give a thousand illustrations to prove my point.  Whereas 99 per cent may be humane enough to give these people a fair crack of the whip, one per cent may be callous.  If it only controlled that one per cent, this Bill would be justified.</P>
    <P>In many respects these people in homes may not be getting the basic requirements the Bill says they should get.  As a member of the Dublin Health Authority, I visit every three months the institutions connected with the Authority.  If the health authority welcome an inspection every three months, why should anyone else object, even religious orders?  We are able to make many suggestions which the health authority may have overlooked.  The people in the health authority institutions get the best of care.  The people in St. Kevin's get hotel fare.  We see to it they do, because we inspect.  But we give credit to the health authority in that they respect our recommendations.</P>
    <P>I have read a good deal about &ldquo;child farms&rdquo; where children are put into homes, substantial sums paid for them, and they are done away with or starved&mdash;eliminated in some way.  I am not saying these things happen here.  I have read of cases where elderly people surrendered their savings on the assurance that they would be kept for the rest of their lives and then received the most callous treatment.  In fact, there were a few murders where people were got rid of by poisoning.  To prevent those few cases we must ensure that every home is registered.</P>
    <P>In many respects the people in these homes may not get the basic requirements in regard to bedclothes, heat in winter, or the number in a certain cubic area.  In many cases it is possible that the proprietors skimp on food, because they are out for profit. Some of these patients have relatives who visit them and see to it that they get a square deal; but others have no relations and they can be, and often are, taken advantage of.  I know of cases where people's belongings, including money and jewellery, were held by the proprietors.  As I said, if <Col N="1622" /> a thing can happen, it does happen. How many of us would do the devil and all to get an extra vote?  That is why a Bill was passed recently to ensure that we would have less chance of getting an extra vote.  The Minister did not trust us.  Every angle is covered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only an illustration, to make my point clear to the Minister that in this respect also every angle should be covered.  There is no question of a witch hunt or anything like that.  Even if there were only five per cent of cases where inspection was justified, in order to ensure that that five per cent would be covered, there should be power to inspect all institutions.</P>
      <P>Finally, let me say that I would not exempt religious institutions although I have no ground for complaint. I would again make the point that if the local authority does not object to its institutions being inspected four times a year, why should anyone object?  I welcome the Bill.  It does not matter to me who proposed it.  The Bill is good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in welcoming the measure before the House.  My view is that all such homes should be registered.  I have not received any specific complaints but I have heard of instances, perhaps isolated, where old people who were being cared for at great sacrifice to their relatives, were not catered for as they should have been having regard to the outlay involved. I know of cases where the financial strain of keeping an aged mother or father in one of these homes was so great that he or she had to be taken out.  I do think that some system should be laid down whereby minimum standards of accommodation, medical care and supervision would be prescribed.  There is a strong case for the making of such regulations that would be consequential on registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While saying that, I should like to compliment the Minister on the efforts <Col N="1623" /> he is making to improve the lot of aged people.  As a member of the Dublin Health Authority, may I say that we were very grateful to the Minister some years ago for making available to us Crooksling Sanatorium?  I have had the privilege of visiting that institution when it was a TB sanatorium and when it was converted for the purpose of accommodating old people.  It is very well run, excellently furnished, well supervised and, although it is a good distance from the city, the relatives of the old people are very pleased with the manner in which they are looked after.</P>
    <P>Sections of Cork Street Hospital are made available for aged men and women.  Unfortunately, the building is unsuitable for the care of these people. It is well run but the amenities which a home of this description should have are lacking.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of asking the Minister to review the question of providing additional accommodation for our old people. The housing crisis that developed here since last June has highlighted the plight of some old people who remained in tenements in the city.  The welfare officers of Dublin Corporation who were fully preoccupied with the problem of trying to resettle these people have told me that a large number of them were really hospital cases or nursing home cases.  If there were more accommodation available for those people, it would help to solve the local authority housing problem and would ensure that these old people would spend the rest of their lives in better conditions and would receive better care.</P>
    <P>A large number of elderly people are living alone.  Some of them have no relatives; others have been neglected by their relatives.  It is a problem that deserves the constant attention, not alone of the local authority, but of the Minister.  I would urge the Minister to address himself to this problem in order to see what further action can be taken to deal with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When introducing his <Col N="1624" /> Health Estimate last week, the Minister made an excellent job of a difficult task.  He produced a very comprehensive document and dealt with it in a very fair manner.  Similar remarks would apply to his reply to the debate yesterday.  Today, however, the Minister has changed from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde.  He comes into this House and does something which, in my opinion, is unpardonable.  He attacks members of the other House in this House.  He had every opportunity that he required to make the comments which he felt should be made when he was replying to the debate in the other House.  It is not alone ungracious, it is unpardonable, that a Minister should be allowed to establish the precedent that in this House people who cannot defend themselves and who, because of the fact that the Bill has already passed through the Seanad will not have an opportunity of dealing with the Minister on this matter, should be referred to in the manner in which the Minister has referred to them in the document&mdash; let me say, the badly-prepared document&mdash;which he has presented to the House today.  There is an old saying that if your case is not strong enough to defeat an opponent, the way to defeat him is to abuse him.  That seems to be the line adopted by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Some of the things which have been stated by the Minister to day should not have been said in this House or anywhere else by a Minister in reference to members of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The Minister will get an opportunity of replying to what Deputy Tully has said when he is concluding the debate.  He can be assured that if he adopts the tactics which he has adopted in dealing with Senators, he will be replied to on further Stages of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister states in the very first paragraph of his document that the <Col N="1625" /> Bill which was passed by Seanad Éireann proposes in the first place to enable the Minister for Health to make regulations which will lay down desirable requirements for homes where incapacitated persons are maintained for profit and, as a corollary, it proposes also to empower health authorities to see that these requirements are met.  Would the Minister try to explain how this is to be done if there is no inspection laid down?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, of course, is misleading himself.  The issue here is not whether there would be inspection but whether before a home can be opened at all or conducted, it must be registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will not draw a red herring for me to run after.  He may try that on some of the people who are more gullible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>He certainly will not try it on me, because I am too used to that type of thing from the Minister and his friends.  The position is simply this: If the home is not registered and if no powers are laid down in the Bill for inspection, then there is no way, according to the Minister himself, in which a home can be inspected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has my speech in front of him.  He will see that under subsection (2) of section 1 there are powers of inspection&mdash;all the powers provided under the Health Acts of 1947 to 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Look; the Minister is trying to put a twist on this which he is not going to get away with.  The position is simply that he suggests that if responsible persons make a complaint, an inspection can be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would explain to the House how a poor old person who is in such a home and who is not able to leave the bed and who has no friends visiting him is able to convey to the health authority the necessity for inspection so as to ensure that the regulations are carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy be good enough to tell the House how he believes an old person in the circumstances he has outlined, that is, an old person without friends, could be in a bed in a private nursing home at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  I will tell the Minister now.  I did not know he was so innocent about these things. I was about to make a comment and he has made it for me.  The Minister is not in touch with what is happening in the country.  It is quite obvious that he has absolutely no idea, good, bad or indifferent, about how these things happen, nor has he any idea as to how they can happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that it is quite common for people, if they have money, to make arrangements with a nursing home whereby they go into the home and pay over a substantial sum of money which is reserved to look after them for a certain period. It is not unknown that after they have parted with their money, they are not treated in the manner in which they expected to be treated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it pleased some of his friends to whom he had opened the Gallery of the Seanad, the Minister thought fit to ballyrag some of the members of the Seanad.  However, if the Minister thinks he can get away in this House with some of the things he said there let me tell him he will not get away with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy thought he was in possession but the Minister has said more than I have said since I started to speak.  The position is that the Labour Senators, following a series of questions tabled by Deputy Corish over a number of years, introduced a Private Members' Bill in the Seanad. The Minister ballyragged that Bill, said it was unjust and unworkable, and then proceeded to bring in a Bill himself, although he said in his speech: &ldquo;There is no evidence that such a Bill is necessary.&rdquo;  Yet, although he said there is no evidence that it is necessary, he is still prepared to spend public money in having this Bill put through the Dáil and Seanad.  The Minister wants to ride two horses at the one time.  He has done that before but this is one occasion on which it is not going to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite a common thing in our cities and country for people who have an annuity to go into a home with the intention of remaining there for the rest of their days.  They are able to pay a fixed sum weekly.  If they are not able to pay it themselves, some relative will pay it for them and it is not unknown that those relatives are glad to have <Col N="1628" /> those people off their hands and are prepared to pay to ensure that they are kept in the home and looked after.</P>
    <P>There is no method of knowing when these people find that they are not getting the treatment they expected. The relatives who were glad to get them off their hands will not be prepared to visit them in the home.  If they have any complaint to make, they must be able to operate some form of mental telepathy to get in touch with the health authority for the area so that an inspector may be sent to the home to see what is happening.</P>
    <P>The Minister used the term `witch doctor'.  One would need more than a witch doctor to operate the section of the Bill which is designed to protect the people in these homes who would like an inquiry into their condition. The Minister says it may be necessary to alter the Bill following experience of its working.  The Minister says that a similar Bill in Britain had to be altered after a term of operation and he might well profit by what happened in England.  Surely it is not unreasonable to suggest that he might profit by the mistakes they made there and include a provision for compulsory registration in this Bill?</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to religious organisations.  There are quite a number of these organisations running homes in this country.  On page 7 of his statement, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>I, for one, am not prepared to concede that callousness and inhumanity are likely to be found in institutions and homes for the aged and infirm which are operated from motives of the most profound charity.</P>
    <P>Where did the Minister get the idea that those homes, even those run by religious organisations, are run in the main for motives of the most profound charity?  The hospitals and homes run by the local authorities are, to a certain extent, charitable institutions, to the extent that even if people have no incomes, they will be kept in them. It is true to say that if these people have incomes, portions of those incomes will be taken from them to pay for their support, but I do not think <Col N="1629" /> the Minister can give me the name of one institution where people go and are kept purely for charity and for no other reason.</P>
    <P>Institutions run by the religious orders have got to have some income and that income is got from the aged and infirm.  Very many of those homes, whether run by religious organisations or by private individuals, could more aptly be termed hotels rather than nursing homes or hospitals because there are no doctors attached to them.  While they are able to look after people who are in their health, they have no trained personnel to look after people who are ill. Those homes are only for aged people and those who are slightly ill mentally. We all know of people who go to ordinary hospitals and are discharged from these hospitals as incurable. These people have to go to their own homes, if their people are prepared to look after them, and, if not, they are put into homes for incapacitated people.  Even though there are neither doctors nor nurses there, they are left in those homes.  Many of them do not live very long&mdash;perhaps it is as well for themselves&mdash;but if they do, there is no way in which anybody can do very much for them.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister made a joking reference to the use of drugs and the fact that it was quite common for ordinary people not to talk of people in homes, at times to use a certain amount of drugs.  Certainly, at present, when there is such an outcry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

The Minister is answerable to this House and was answerable to the Seanad.  The Senators are not here and the Minister should not have attacked them, but if the Minister <Col N="1630" /> said, as I am told he said, that there was nothing wrong in somebody who was tired out, somebody who wanted to, in certain circumstances, taking certain types of drugs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Any joking reference to drugs, or anybody who in any way gives the impression that it is our right to take drugs in any circumstances, unless prescribed by a doctor must be, and should be condemned, and if those drugs are given to old people at times to keep them quiet, as I am told, then that is wrong and it is the Minister's duty to prevent such things being done.</P>
      <P>I should like to conclude with the statement that has been made here not alone by the Labour Deputies, and Fine Gael Deputies but by Deputy Sherwin and Deputies belonging to the Minister's Party: there should be compulsory registration of nursing homes and the sooner the Minister realises that, the better it will be for all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not really know, after the speech which we have just heard, whether I should address myself to the Bill or to the irrelevant remarks&mdash;indeed, the grossly misinformed remarks&mdash;of Deputy Tully.  We have had from him a ton of assertion but not an ounce of fact.  He &ldquo;knows&rdquo;, but he is afraid to say what he knows. What sort of nonsense is that?  I cannot conceive that Deputy Tully is aware of abuses occurring in places which are called nursing homes and he has not the moral courage, under the protection of this House, to mention a single one of these premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in a difficult position : I must act with responsibility and before I impose on any section of the community <Col N="1631" /> a statutory obligation, it is my duty to satisfy myself at least that there is an essential need for what I am compelling people to do.  I have not had any evidence which would justify me in doing more than I am doing now in relation to any place in which incapacitated persons may be maintained for private profit, that is, requiring such places to notify the local authority that they exist and empowering the local authority, when complaint is made to them by responsible people, to inspect such places in order to satisfy themselves as to whether or not the allegations are true.</P>
    <P>If it should happen that no complaint has been made in relation to a particular place but the reputation of the premises is such that the local authority has reason to believe that abuses exist, then it may inspect the place in those circumstances.  I do not think, on what has been so forcefully and emotionally alleged in respect of these premises, alleged in the spirit of the remarks of Deputy Sherwin, alleged by those who said that because evil can exist, it does exist, because evil can be done, it is done, any move is justified. My approach to the matter is different. I assume that the vast majority of people are decent people who will not do wrong, even if such wrong should be a source of profit to themselves.  I think most of the people who run these institutions in Dublin are trained in a profession which has dedicated itself to the care of the sick and I am prepared to believe that although they will receive persons in order to serve them and will be remunerated for these services, they will serve them with dedication and zeal and ordinary common humanity.  That is my approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who say and believe that because evil can be done, it will be done.  I am well aware it exists and that there are those who may even delight in doing evil, but I think the vast majority of people in this country, no matter what occupation they follow, are people who try to live according to ordinary, decent standards of Christianity and humanity.  Therefore, I have refused to give any weight <Col N="1632" /> to the representations that have been made to me by people who may have some vested interest to serve but certainly who have been, like Deputy Tully, afraid to give the evidence which would justify me in proceeding to the lengths to which they would have me go.</P>
    <P>To deal now with some other matters raised in the course of this debate, I welcome what Deputy O'Higgins said.  He has seen the Bill as a compromise.  It is, in fact, an exploratory measure designed to enable, first, the local authorities in their own areas to assess the situation for themselves and if they have good cause, arising out of a complaint made by a responsible person, to believe that abuse exists, or by reason of the reputation the establishment may hold, they have power to investigate such a case under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Arising out of that, we may find we must go further and require these premises to be periodically inspected but I do not think a case for periodic inspection has yet been proved and until it is proved, the Legislature, I think, would not be justified in imposing it on any section of our people who are engaged in providing what is a perfectly legitimate and desirable service for our people.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins suggested that grants might be made available for the improvement of accommodation in homes for incapacitated persons.  I welcome the suggestion but I fear if we did that, we should have to do it by taxation.  We could not do it out of the Hospitals Trust Fund.  In fact we are debarred by statute from using the funds for such a purpose.  I shall bear the Deputy's suggestion in mind and provided I can secure the acquiescence of the Minister for Finance and find some reasonable manner of assisting homes to provide improved standards of accommodation, I may be able to come to the House&mdash;or my successor may be able to come&mdash;with such a proposal. This Bill, of course, relates purely to houses run for private profit. Therefore some of the points raised by Deputy O'Higgins do not arise.</P>
    <P>It was said by Deputy Ryan that the <Col N="1633" /> introduction of this Bill was another manifestation of the fact that where there is a will there is a way.  He asked why was it not possible to have brought in this Bill earlier.  Why, he asked, was it not possible to deal with nursing homes as he and some others had suggested they should be dealt with.  Let me say that this is not a new problem.  This arose when I was Minister for Local Government and Public Health, in 1945 or 1946 when approaches were made to me by some of the nursing organisations.  But we just could not find how we were going to disentangle this question of what were called nursing homes from what were private hospitals and other institutions which cater for the acutely ill. But it did happen that somebody had a brainwave and we were able to say: &ldquo;We are not going to deal with nursing homes in a strict or narrow sense, but we are going to deal with those homes which take people in, care for them and maintain them, not because they are acutely ill but because they are aged or infirm or in some way incapacitated and require not highly skilled nursing but the ordinary human care and attention which a person may get in his own home.&rdquo; The motion of the Labour Party had nothing whatever to do with it. Strange as it may appear, we sometimes have ideas of our own about these matters and we do not have to wait for somebody to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Kyne said it was essential that we should have this system of periodic inspection and registration because of what happened in the Waterford county home.  It happened in the year 1946 and he translated that episode into a suggestion that these abuses had been discovered in a home which was under the control of the Minister.  Now, the Waterford county home is not under the control of the Minister, nor is any county home in this State.  They are under the control of the local authority acting as the health authority.  In this case, as the Health Act of 1947 had not been passed, the Waterford county home was under the control of the Waterford Board of Assistance of which Deputy Kyne and the late Senator Butler were members.</P>

Certain defects were discovered and were reported to the Minister for Local Government and Public <Col N="1636" /> Health.  When they were reported to me, I sent down an inspector.  Who was responsible for these abuses?  Not the Minister but the board of assistance of which Deputy Kyne and Senator Butler were members.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kyne went on to refer to a home in Hume Street and mentioned it in support of his demand for registration.  If I understood him correctly, the home which he had in mind was in fact a registered home, and the fact that it was registered did not prevent abuses occurring in that home. The whole point at issue is whether registration is of any avail at all in this matter.  It certainly has not proved to be the remedy in Great Britain.  They have had four enactments dealing with homes of various kinds.  Despite that fact, even so recently as 1963, they passed another Act dealing with the problem of registered homes and it is still alleged that the poor, the aged and the infirm are being exploited in these homes.  Registration, therefore, whatever else it may be, is not a cure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1638" /> We seem to have in this matter, so far as I can see, on the part of those clamouring for registration, a sort of divided mind, or dual purpose, because we are always hearing that all homes should be registered, irrespective of whether they are run by religious or charitable organisations or run by private individuals for private profit.  I do not think it is necessary either to register all homes or impose inspection upon all homes.  As I said, the first assumption underlying this power of inspection is that something undesirable is being done, something so undesirable that it should be made unlawful to do it.  People are entitled to proceed on that basis and that is the only justification for inspection.</P>
    <P>Deputies have spoken here about inspection of cinemas, hotels, food-processing industries, shops, and so on.  In all these cases, experience has shown that it is necessary that there should be powers of inspection.  We have had fires in cinemas and in hotels.  We have had outbreaks of disease as a result of unsatisfactory conditions in food-processing industries and in shops.  It is because certain things have occurred that the need for inspection has been established.</P>
    <P>The need for inspecting these homes, on the other hand, has not been established. If it were established, then we should have to have inspection, but we cannot proceed on the assumption that homes into which the aged are taken and in which they are cared for&mdash;in the vast majority of cases, by charitable organisations&mdash;anything seriously wrong is being done, or that the people are being treated with inhumanity, subjected to unkindness or neglect.  That is the only basis upon which this demand for absolute periodic inspection should be imposed upon them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne referred to a committee of social workers.  It is a very nice title.  In the letter addressed to the Labour Party, but not addressed to the Minister for Health, who is introducing this Bill, they had a great deal to say.  They outlined what was, in fact, a very penal, punitive code which they <Col N="1639" /> wished imposed upon all institutions, charitable or otherwise, in which incapacitated persons are cared for and maintained.  We shall have an opportunity, perhaps, of studying that epistle at some length.  What I should have liked to hear from Deputy Kyne was some justification for the demands this body makes and some indication of the status of this body and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It does not matter what reputation a person may have; it does not matter what service he has given to the community or what services the community has recognised him as giving.  Because people can do evil and will do evil, every person must be inspected.  The justification for that line of action is this: the religious orders have nothing to hide.  That is what Deputy Kyne said.  Therefore, because religious orders have nothing to hide, we are to send functionaries prying into their premises in order that we may satisfy ourselves that, in fact, they have nothing to hide.  I do not think that is the right approach to this matter and I am not prepared to adopt that attitude. As regards these charitable institutions with which we are all familiar and to which many of us have good reason to be grateful for what they have done for our friends on occasions, I am not prepared to assume we are justified in sending public functionaries in to inspect them from attic to cellar.</P>
      <P>Again, Deputy Ryan was very much like Deputy Tully.  He said he shared common knowledge in regard to places calling themselves nursing homes where cleanliness was not maintained but, of course, he refused to disclose the information which he claims to have in this regard.  Deputy Ryan vies for respectability and reliability with that scourge of society, the anonymous letter writer. When he says in this House that he has knowledge which he will not disclose, then, like the anonymous letter writer, his assertions are not worthy of the credence of any honest man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne suggested one of <Col N="1641" /> the reasons why the Bill is as it is.  He says it does not provide for registration and for periodic inspection, because I am too conscious of the conditions which exist in county homes.  The provisions of this Bill do not deal with county homes, nor are its provisions in any way related to such institutions. We know the conditions in county homes and while the amenities are not what I hope in time they will be, nevertheless, I think that kindness and consideration for those who are maintained in them are the general and prevalent characteristics of such homes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne challenged the Bill on another ground.  He suggested that I was wrong in saying that those who had to avail themselves of the services rendered by these homes required nothing more than mere family care. He took the line that family care will not suffice.  He does not believe&mdash;I am paraphrasing his speech&mdash;that the customary amenities to be found in an ordinary middle class home will content old people or be good enough for old people.</P>
      <P>What justification in life or experience has the Deputy for his scepticism in this regard?  I have some personal experience and personal knowledge of what is likely to content the old.  It would be an understatement to say I am in my first youth but my parents lived until they were in their nineties.  They lived in their own family home and I am perfectly certain they were happier in that home, surrounded by their children, than they would be elsewhere, no matter how well equipped from the point of view of skilled attention.  Deputy Dr. Browne thinks otherwise.  He thinks they would have been happier if they had been segregated from their children and confined in an institution where they would have been provided with drugs specially suited to elderly people: I suppose, sedatives when they were excited and purple hearts when they were depressed by loneliness because they were deprived of having their own kith and kin around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> Deputy Dr. Browne's whole philosophy would seem to be based on the principle that we are all children of the State, that we must be taught to look to the State for everything from the cradle to the grave.  At one end of the spectrum we have Deputy Dr. Browne telling us what the State should do for the mother and child&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was not here to listen to Deputy Dr. Browne as I was.  At one end of the spectrum, we have Deputy Dr. Browne saying the State must look after mother and child. I am not disposed to disagree with the fact that the State has obligations to mothers and children where the parents are not able to provide for themselves.  I am not at all averse from that.  As adolescents, people are to be provided for, education, school fees and everything else.  Medical care for every citizen is to be provided by the State and then at the end of it, according to Deputy Dr. Browne, the old people are to be provided for by the State and have to be segregated in special institutions.  They cannot be allowed to go to ordinary homes, humble homes, if you like, from the point of view of equipment and of the kind with which this Bill proposes to deal.  I wonder if that is, in fact, the Labour Party philosophy.  I do not think it is, but Deputy Dr. Browne is now a member of the Labour Party and that is his philosophy.</P>

The one thing we are conscious of is that the best place for persons at the end of their days is in the midst of their own families, being looked after and maintained by their own people.</P>
      <P>I have kept the House a long time, and perhaps I have been a bit polemic about it.  The Bill is the best that can be devised.  It is exploratory.  We have never yet had any real investigation of this problem.  As a result of it, we shall get further information and if necessary, if the case can be made&mdash;I think it will be difficult to substantiate&mdash;we can go a bit further.  As far as registration is concerned, I want to repeat that it has not worked in Great Britain.  It has not been the cure-all for the abuses said to exist.  As far as periodic inspection is concerned, I do not think we should impose it until the case for it has been clearly established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Although this may be to some extent a technical Bill, there is a very important matter of principle of some general concern involved in the amendments which I propose in the beginning of the Bill and in the later sections.  The object of a patent is in fact to encourage industry. We must be careful that when new legislation is introduced, we do not introduce new concepts and provisions in that legislation which would to any degree affect the desired amendment which the legislation proposes to achieve.  The Bill, as drafted, would appear to be introducing a departure from our patent legislation, a departure not in the comparable English legislation and a departure which could conceivably have serious consequences for industrial development in this country.</P>
      <P>Up to this Bill, the law stood, and indeed has stood for hundreds of years, that when considering the grant of a patent or the objection to the granting of a patent, the matter which was the concern of the authorities considering this was whether there had been publication of the material in the country concerned with the granting of the patent.  In England, the law was, and is, that what the patent authority was concerned with was whether or not there had been publication of the material in England.  In Ireland, the law up to this Bill was, and is, that what the authority is concerned with is whether or not there has been publication of the material in Ireland.  This is now being departed from, as I understand the Bill as drafted and as I understand the explanatory memorandum. It is now proposed that one of the grounds of invalidity will be that the invention has been made available to the public by disclosure anywhere and not merely by publication in the State.</P>
      <P>This is a very radical departure from our existing legislation.  It means that it might be possible to challenge the validity of a patent on the ground that there had been disclosure of the invention elsewhere in any part of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1646" /> This could conceivably cause very serious difficulty in the operation of this legislation and very serious difficulty in the granting of patents and the development of industry pursuant to the granting of patents.  I should like to know the justification for such a serious departure from our existing legislation and from legislation which exists in England at present.</P>
    <P>As I understand the explanatory memorandum, it is being suggested that the change may be necessary because of the adoption by this country of an international Convention which is being proposed by the Council of Europe.  I do not know whether this is, in fact, the situation, but I should be glad if the Minister would indicate to the House if this is so.  If this is the position, it should be borne in mind that the international Convention which this country has signed has not yet been ratified, and before the Convention can be ratified, eight instruments of ratification have to be deposited.  As far as I am aware, no such instruments have been deposited as yet.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if the Minister would inform the House what the position about the Convention is.  If in fact we have undertaken an international obligation to widen the whole scope of the definition of &ldquo;published&rdquo; and &ldquo;publication&rdquo;, it would be reasonable that we should not legislate for such a contingency until in fact the Convention comes into operation. I would suggest that if we have undertaken this international obligation, we should not change the law until it becomes necessary for us to do so.  We should keep the law in the position it is in at present and, if necessary, amending legislation could be brought in at a later time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the fundamental things in this Bill is that an invention or patent, before it can be accepted as such, must have absolute novelty.  If an invention has not got absolute novelty, the contention is that it is not an invention any more. I believe that to adhere to what was the law and the practice formerly, whereby as long as a patent or an <Col N="1647" /> invention was not published within the State but may have been published elsewhere, would be archaic.  The law as it stands now was consistent with means of travel and means of communication that existed many years ago, but, means of travel and means of communication having been improved so considerably, the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that we bring our law into conformity with these modern concepts, these modern means of communication.</P>
      <P>There are 101 reasons why a patent which was published in one country and not published here should not be accepted as being novel in this country. One can take the extreme case that Deputy Costello quoted, about the patent having been published in some obscure country, perhaps in some obscure language, that the person seeking a patent for the same specification or the same invention should not be denied a patent here.  But, on the other hand, if one took the other extreme, the publication of a patent, say, across our Border, in Newry or somewhere like that, should not be held to prevent a person receiving a patent for the same specification in this part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any case for retaining what is now an outmoded concept, an outmoded piece of legislation. The rest of the world has accepted this basis of absolute novelty. The existing law has been retained only in Britain and Ireland so far.  So far as we are concerned, and indeed the same applies to Great Britain, we are a party to international Conventions that will require us, in any event, to conform with the international view of this matter and as far as the signing of these Conventions is concerned&mdash; there are a number of them&mdash;so far as the Council of Europe Conventions are concerned, there are two relating to patents in addition to a Convention recently concluded on unification of law.  One of these has been ratified by 13 countries, including Ireland, Great Britain, France and Germany; the other, relating to international classification of patents, has been ratified by <Col N="1648" /> 11 countries and these include Ireland, Great Britain, France and Germany also.</P>
    <P>The new Convention on laws is not yet in force.  It was opened for signature in Strasbourg in November, 1963 and has been signed by nine of the Member countries of the Council of Europe, including Great Britain, France and Germany, and arrangements are being made for this country to sign the Convention in the near future.</P>
    <P>So, on the basis of keeping our laws in conformity with the laws in other countries and in conformity with our obligations under these Conventions, it is necessary to remove this archaic anomaly from our law and I have no doubt that in the very near future it will also be removed from British law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I thought.  The earlier Convention, as I understand it, did not effect this procedure. The earlier Conventions would not make it necessary for us to change the law but this new Convention does. Am I not correct in saying this new Convention does require, according to Article IX, that the Convention will not come into force until three months after the deposit of the eighth instrument of ratification?  The point I wish to make is: If, in fact, we do not become bound internationally to change our law until this is ratified and as it is quite possible that this ratification may not take place for some considerable time, I would suggest that we do not make this change, which could bring about very serious difficulties for us and for the development of industry in this country, until it becomes absolutely necessary for us to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I must disagree entirely with Deputy Costello's suggestion <Col N="1649" /> that the amendment of the law as we now propose will seriously interfere with the development of industry in this country.  On the contrary, it would be possible if a patent were well known in other countries and if an industrialist sought to use it here and got permission to use it, that somebody else could come along and by registering it in this country, could probably prevent its use for industrial purposes.</P>
      <P>In any event, apart altogether from that, it is not only because we adhere to international Conventions that we propose to amend the law in this respect.  It is mainly because it is the sensible thing to do.  Again I go back to the question of novelty which is essential to any invention and unless it has that novelty, then it is not right that we should mainain novelty within the State when it is not a novelty in other countries.  Apart from other reasons, one of the main reasons is that it is the sensible thing to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>You are creating appalling difficulties of proof, the difficulty of proving, for example, that it is the spoken word anywhere in the world.  I cannot really see how anybody is going to be able to prove it and how the Minister can maintain that the spoken word in any part of the world is capable of reasonable proof, even supposing I accept, which I do not necessarily do, the Minister's view that it is desirable to restrict purely to novelty.  There is some sense in requiring proof of a document that is in written general circulation, as apart from personal circulation, but in relation to the spoken word, as I read that definition, if one person has a private conversation with another, it is sufficient to come within the terms of the definition in the Minister's Bill and I do not think that is what it means.  Or, if one person writes a private letter to another, it is made available to the public, once that is repeated.  That is not what is concerned. If something is in wide and general use in another country, I can see the Minister's point.  If something is freely written about, lectured about, spoken about in the country, in wide and general use in another country, that is in, but, if we take the reverse <Col N="1650" /> example, that somebody from Japan was bound by something in a letter that is hidden away in the archives of the National Library, that is available to the public and nobody, in fact, has turned it up, but under that definition it would be caught if a similar law were made in another country. That is not what is intended in the Convention.</P>

      <P>This amendment, is, in fact, contained in the British Patents Act of 1949 and I do not know why it has been left out of our Bill.  It is obviously a good practice to maintain the principle that is in the British section and if, after 50 years, nothing further is heard of a disclosure contained in a patent specification, this should not hinder in any way a new claim being put forward. This is part of the British law on the subject and it seems to me to be reasonable.  Our two legislations are very close on this matter and I do not see any reason why this has been left out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the 50 years is provided for in existing British law and in our existing law.  The historic reason is that a useful idea might be lost sight of after 50 years but all the other countries of the world who have patent legislation have moved away from this idea for the reason that if somebody unearths an idea that was patented more than 50 years ago, it was then and still is a matter of public knowledge.  It is considered that it is not right that a person, because he can unearth such an idea which has been in public use for a considerable time, can come along to our Patent Office and establish <Col N="1653" /> an absolute right in that idea for himself to the exclusion of the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Apart from that quite fundamental reason, I again quote the Council of Europe Convention which requires any limitation of this kind to be abolished. Britain, Germany, and many other countries have signed this Convention. An idea which was published 50 years ago is no longer anything to which a person could claim an exclusive right just because he finds it out by some chance or by research.</P>

      <P>In page 13, line 56, after &ldquo;section&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or under rules made under this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 17, as it stands, provides that an application for a patent shall be void unless within a certain period which may be prescribed certain requirements are complied with.  The purpose of the amendment is to meet representations of patent agents and it is thought, by giving the opportunity of the limit being provided for by rules rather than by legislation, it would give wider discretion and would be better suited to the cases that might arise from time to time.  If the limitation were in the section itself, that flexibility would not be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister is prepared to accept the reasonableness of the view that this section should be applied in as reasonable <Col N="1657" /> a way as possible and that there should be some flexibility in it.  It is very desirable that the section should not work hardship and should not be applied in too draconian a fashion.  I understand the Minister is proposing that, by rules and regulations, he will make it possible for an application not to be treated as void if, in fact, there is some unavoidable delay which has the effect of not complying strictly with section 17.  In the amendment which I suggest later, I suggest that this power to extend the time and the discretion given to the Controller should be written into the section rather than left to rules.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to consider the advisability of providing that, instead of these matters being referred to rules made under the Act, he should write it into the section as I have suggested in amendment No. 22.  It seems to me to be desirable that this section should work in a reasonable way.  Things can happen in the best regulated offices which could result in an application being marked &ldquo;void&rdquo; and I suggest, rather than leave it to regulations, the Minister should accept the suggestion I have made in the later amendment and actually write this into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two considerations arising here, first, to facilitate agents or applicants for patents who might encounter unavoidable delay and secondly, there is the necessity to speed up the processing of applications. It is suggested that, rather than have a rigid time limit in the Bill, providing a time limit by way of rule which can be changed to suit changing conditions, would be a better idea and would obviate any hardship that might not be anticipated now and could arise in the future.  I think the making of the limitation by way of rule is a better idea in the long run.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing the later amendment at the moment and I shall reserve what I have to say until we are discussing it. I understand that the Minister's amendment gives him power to alter the time limit by rule.  While that may be desirable, <Col N="1658" /> it is also desirable to give an overall discretion to the Controller in exceptional cases not to impose the full rigour of the section, in the rules that may be made.  We can discuss that later when I move my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I had better not agree too hurriedly with it.  I am grateful to the Chair for bringing that to my attention.  I do not agree with this because I want to move the amendment to the section.  The deletion of subsection (3) which I suggest, and the substitution of the new subsection was in order to endeavour to bring about a situation in the Act which would enable the Controller, if he thought fit and without the payment of any fees, to grant an extension or a series of extensions.  As I understand the position as to how the section will operate as now amended, the Minister will make rules from time to time <Col N="1659" /> which may be varied according as times may change or as his experience indicates the wisdom of change, but there will still be the overriding requirement to comply, in a rather vigorous way, with the time limitation imposed by the rules.</P>
      <P>I am suggesting that we should put a provision into this section so that where the Controller is satisfied that the information which he requires or the evidence which he requires cannot be furnished in the times that will be laid down by the rules, or if there are official requirements which are involved and the applicant has no knowledge of these requirements or for any other circumstances in which hardship would be caused, the Controller would have a general power to grant an extension of time.  The operation of legislation such as this depends very much on the degree of co-operation and commonsense that must and does exist between the Controller and the patent agents.  What I am suggesting would appear to be a reasonable piece of legislation by which the Controller would have power, where there are no avoidable delays and where hardship might result, to extend the time and get rid of what could in certain circumstances be real hardship as a result of the stringent application of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I suggest that the amendment I propose on subsection (1) of this section will adequately meet most cases that are likely to arise.  As I said, there is more in this than just facilitating an applicant who meets with unavoidable difficulties. There are applicants, particularly from big firms, who prefer to delay publication of their inventions for their own reasons and therefore are dilatory accordingly.  I think there should be power for the Controller to apply sanctions in cases such as this in order to ensure that these applicants are kept up to the mark.  I think I can say that the time limit that will be prescribed under subsection (1) as amended will be considerably longer than the longest time reasonably needed to supply the evidence Deputy <Col N="1660" /> Costello mentions in paragraph (a) of his amendment.  The time limit should also leave adequate time for official action after the evidence comes in.  The extension he seeks under paragraph (b) is hardly likely to arise.</P>
      <P>As far as paragraph (c) is concerned the Deputy mentions:</P>
      <P>Any other circumstances existing in which hardship would be caused to the applicant by voiding of the application on the expiry of the said period or of any permitted extension thereof,</P>
      <P>The circumstances under this paragraph represent something outside the applicant's control or some excusable error in order to justify an extension and again the Controller will be able to ascertain the reasons for this and be able to act accordingly by amending the time by way of rule rather than writing it into the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>Do I understand that we would have to bring in a new statutory instrument?  That is what is involved.  There would have to be a new statutory instrument to deal with cases of hardship.  I do not think that is desirable.  As I understand the mechanism which is being proposed, the Minister will have power to make rules but in the case of hardship, I suggest that there should be an over-all discretion to the Controller to extend the time.  If that is not there, the only way it can be done is by <i>ad hoc</i> legislation, by the making of new rules.  That seems to be an extraordinarily cumbersome way of dealing with something which we would like to see dealt with effectively.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>In page 21, before subsection (7), to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) The grant of a patent of addition shall not be refused, and a patent granted as a patent of addition shall not be revoked or invalidated, on the ground only that the invention claimed in the complete specification does not involve any inventive step having regard to any publication or use of&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  the main invention described in the complete specification relating thereto; or</P>
      <P>(b)  any improvement in or modification of the main invention described in the complete specification of a patent of addition to the patent for the main invention or of an application for such a patent of addition;</P>
      <P>and the validity of a patent of addition shall not be questioned on the ground that the invention ought to have been the subject of an independent patent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section deals with patents of addition and there has been excluded from the section a subsection which <Col N="1667" /> appears in the English Act.  I am not quite certain why it has been excluded. It seems to me the subsection is a valuable one and should be retained. The authoritative textbook on this subject, the 1951 edition of Terrell and Shelley, refers to the English subsection which we are now deleting.  It refers to the fact that there are no separate renewal fees and then it says:</P>
    <P>This advantage has been retained, but there has now been added the remarkable provision that the grant of a patent of addition shall not be refused and a patent granted as a patent of addition shall not be revoked on the ground only that the invention claimed does not involve any inventive step having regard to the publication or use either of the main invention described in the complete specification relating thereto, or of any improvement in or modification of the main invention described in the complete specification of any previous patent of addition.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this well-known author regards this as a very desirable subsection and we would want to have good reasons, I think, for its deletion. I should be interested to know why the Minister is not keeping it in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We have never had a provision of this nature in the Irish law, for the reason that, when there is a main invention patented, simple modifications or extensions do not justify further applications for patents. It is considered that they would be a nuisance and contrary to the general interest.  As well as that, to include the provision now would not conform with the Council of Europe Convention. Even though it is in British law as late as 1949, it is thought that by their adherence to the Council of Europe Convention, the British will require ether to repeal this provision or amend it drastically in order to conform with the Convention.</P>

The report on the draft Convention relating to <Col N="1668" /> European patent law suggests that the provisions which exist in the British law have proved a great benefit to patentees and, in fact, this report would indicate that some similar provision might be included in the Convention. I do not know whether the Minister has considered that aspect of the matter or not.</P>

      <P>I wish to throw out the general suggestion which I have made already on an earlier section. We do seem to have undertaken some international obligations which the Minister may think are desirable. Be that as it may, it seems we must alter the law in order to comply with these international obligations.  Of course, we must do that when we have entered into them but the point I wish to make is that if these international obligations arise under the Convention on Reunification of Certain Points of Substantive Law on Patents for Inventions which was signed in Strasbourg in November last, it may be some considerable time before this Convention operates. What I am suggesting is that the Minister should not alter the law until it becomes necessary for him to do so and that he should leave the law as it stands until the Convention has been ratified&mdash;I do not mean signed but ratified&mdash;and as soon as it has been ratified, then it may be necessary <Col N="1669" /> for us to comply with our international obligations by changing the law.  We know only too well what happens to Council of Europe Conventions.  It is quite possible that this will remain a dead letter as has happened time and time again.  I suggest that if we are only changing this to comply with the Convention which is not yet in operation, we should leave it and perhaps it may never be necessary to change the law.</P>

      <P>Before we sign international Conventions we naturally examine them and unless we agree with what they contain, we do not sign them.

      <P>We all know how these Conventions operate.  There are years of negotiations sometimes and in Conventions of this sort, there is usually compromise.  It is absolutely true to say that every part of a Convention is not embraced wholeheartedly by every member of the Council of Europe who has signed it. Some of them sign it with reservations; some of them sign it not liking it but because certain compromises have been reached.  It would be wrong to suggest that there would be universal acceptance of every Convention by every member who signs it.  Probably a member does not wish to hold out because some of these Conventions require the unanimity rule before they are adopted.  As I say, we should wait until this Convention has been ratified before we change the law.</P>

      <P>Representations have been made to me to the effect that this problem of prior claiming is a very <Col N="1672" /> difficult one.  It has been engaging the consideration of experts in many countries and at present there is full-scale inquiry in Britain.  It has been suggested to me that the effect of the amendments may interfere with the right of applicants, because they would have the effect of including in the prior art anything described in a patent application of earlier date which had not been made public on the priority date of the latter application.  It is agreed this may be necessary when considering the scope of the protection claimed in the latter application, but it should not be taken into consideration when considering the question of obviousness on the ground that an invention cannot be said to be obvious on account of some description which was not published when the invention was conceived.</P>
      <P>It is also suggested that this deals with the valid claim in an earlier specification.  Recently, a warning was given in a report issued by the Committee of National Institutes of Patent Agents on the draft Convention relating to patent law.  Page 6 of that report deals with the matter.  It says:</P>
      <P>If, for instance, everything disclosed in a patent of an earlier date forms part of the state of art, then it becomes impossible to obtain in a later patent protection for a matter which, though so disclosed, is not the subject matter claimed in the earlier patent.</P>
      <P>It suggests a distinction should be drawn between that part of the description of the earlier part which is clearly the basis of the claims and the other part which is possibly not directly relevant to the claims, for example, a description of a device which may be used entirely in association with the device which is the subject of the invention claim.  I understand this represents the considered opinion of those in the patent agency profession in Europe and those who are generally concerned with the principles of patent law.</P>

      <P>There is in the Council of Europe Convention a similar provision to the subsection now proposed.  In view of conflicting opinion as to how different countries may interpret the Convention, it is thought desirable to impose this time limit of six months.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 54:</P>
      <P>Before section 71, but in Part VII, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to any provisions of this Act requiring the Controller to hear any party to proceedings thereunder, or to give to any such party an opportunity to be heard, the Controller shall give any applicant for a patent or for the amendment of a specification, an opportunity to be heard before exercising adversely to the applicant any discretion vested in the Controller by or under this Act.</P>
      <P>This amendment is taken from section 87 of the British Act.  Again, it is designed to try to make the working of the Act a little easier.  It seems to me to be a reasonable provision. What is suggested is that, without prejudice to any of the provisions, the Controller may give to any party an opportunity to be heard.  The idea is that the Controller, having considered the matters and the representations made in the various forms sent to him, may exercise his discretion against the applicant.  It seems to me that in many cases this could not only cause annoyance but hardship.  Where the applicant would like to have the possibility of making his case known to the Controller, certainly he should be given an opportunity of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This type of case arises in many circumstances where there is a discretionary power vested, sometimes in <Col N="1675" /> a Minister, sometimes an official of his Department, and where he exercises it against the applicant's wishes.  The applicant is naturally disturbed and annoyed by the fact that the Minister has exercised his discretion against him.  Very frequently this could be got over if, in fact, a hearing could be arranged and if, in fact, an opportunity could be given to the applicant to be heard.  It does seem to me that as this type of legislation is very common now and a great deal of power is given to the Minister and given to officials of his Department, that it is desirable that justice should not only be done but should be seen to be done and where a Minister is going to exercise his power against the applicant or where, in this case, the Controller is going to exercise it, he should give an opportunity to the applicant to be heard.</P>
    <P>It might mean that the Controller in this instance, would not for one moment change his opinion but the applicant would have had the benefit of being given a chance to get him to change his opinion and it is quite possible that in certain circumstances the Controller might so do.  We should not be shy about copying British legislation in this regard where it is obviously good.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposed by the Deputy would require that section 71 as in the Bill be deleted. Section 71 in the Bill is the same as the words of the corresponding section in our own 1927 Act.  There is no difference in substance seen between it and the substance of Deputy Costello's amendment, which is the wording of the British Act.</P>
      <P>The fact is that no difficulty has arisen in interpreting the section since it was first introduced, no hardship has been created for applicants, and the wording of the British section was examined before the Bill was drafted but was rejected in favour of the wording of our own 1927 Act which has worked in practice and without any hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations have been made to me and to other Deputies, and may well have been made to the Minister on this matter, on behalf of the solicitors' profession, possibly also on behalf of the Bar, on the ground that the provisions in the Bill as drafted, as contained in section 75, alter the existing law to the detriment of the legal profession by enabling persons other than solicitors and counsel to undertake legal work.  While the sole interests of the profession may not be the most important aspect of it, it is suggested that there is no sound justification in the public interest because it is an established principle of public policy that legal services should be rendered by duly qualified legal practitioners and that the Bill as at present drafted contravenes this principle because section 75 makes provision for appeals to the High Court and in such appeals the right of audience shall extend to the principal or principals in the proceedings before the Controller and to registered patent agents and to other representatives appearing on his or their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, I believe, correct to say that there is no precedent in the existing law here, in the North or in Britain, for conferring on person other than duly <Col N="1678" /> qualified lawyers the right of audience in the High Court in matters of this kind and, so far as I know, there can be found no precedent for this innovation in the English Patent Acts of 1949 to 1961.</P>
    <P>A number of matters contained in the section and, indeed, in earlier sections, are eminently justiciable controversies which when brought within the jurisdiction of the High Court on appeal, should be conducted by lawyers who are versed in procedure and practices as well as the rules of evidence.</P>
    <P>I should be glad, therefore, if the Minister would indicate that he is prepared to consider between now and Report Stage this aspect of the matter. It has been the subject of the most serious consideration by the professions concerned.  Personally, I can speak on this matter with some detachment. The Minister should seriously consider the representations which have been made and which probably will be conveyed to him.</P>
    <P>This is, as I understand it, and as the solicitors' profession and the barristers' profession consider, an innovation which is not provided for in the patent laws in Britain and is a distinct departure from established practice in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I just very briefly support the remarks made by Deputy Cosgrave in this matter and urge the Minister to look at this section more carefully?  I should be inclined to agree that the number of lawyers, taken as individuals, who are likely to be affected in any way by this section is negligible but there does seem to be a point of broad principle involved here and one which I think the Minister, as a lawyer, will appreciate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave has made the case, and I believe it to be a fact&mdash; I should like to know from the Minister whether it is or not&mdash;that the proposal he is making in this Bill to allow people other than properly qualified lawyers a right of audience before the court in these matters of appeal&mdash;and, remember, that extends to a whole lot of matters under this Bill&mdash;is establishing a precedent; in other words, that it is at the moment <Col N="1679" /> without precedent either here or in England, so far as the patent law is concerned.</P>
    <P>I believe that is the case.  If it is, I think the Minister should approach the matter very slowly and very carefully. Perhaps he would indicate to us when dealing with this section whether his reason for bringing in this proposal, which to me seems quite unnecessary, was that it is one of the matters contained in the Convention to which we are subscribing by this legislation.  If that is so, then it presents a different complexion in that it may be intimated that similar provisions will exist in legislation elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave did not exaggerate when he emphasised the fact that any principle such as this must obviously be regarded by members of the legal profession, whether of the Bar or of the solicitors' profession, as a matter of gravity, not only from the point of view of the members of the profession but also from the point of view of the ordinary people whom the members of the profession serve in court.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter very carefully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a little historical background to this which Deputies may not have considered.  In the first place, the old law provided for appeals to the Law Officer as well as to the court.  That Law Officer being the Attorney General, who is mainly responsible for advising Ministers, it is held that he should not be the appellate.  Therefore we are removing the Law Officer from the provisions of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so.  The second reason is that the appeal to the court is an appeal to a special court. The court in this context is not necessarily the High Court as such.  The President of the High Court nominates a judge to deal with these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Hitherto a patent agent had the right to appear <Col N="1680" /> before the Law Officer on behalf of his client.  Now since the Law Officer has gone, to deny him the right of appeal before what replaces the Law Officer would be a reduction of his rights of appearing on behalf of his client.  Up to this, he could go before the Law Officer.  There is no Law Officer now. Therefore he cannot conduct an appeal on behalf of his client if we exclude him from the court.  As Deputies are aware, if any person is involved in a law suit, he is entitled to appear personally before any tribunal in the land.</P>

      <P>The Minister may have left the impression without intending to do so that this is the same as the British legislation.  The British set up a special tribunal specifically declared not to be a branch of the High Court.  We have not done that.  I think these amendments are something more than drafting amendments, as the Minister said they were.  I should like the Minister to consider carefully if it would be possible to set up an appeal tribunal, a tribunal that would not be part of the High Court.  The Minister is not doing that in this Bill.  He is still setting up an appeal to a court which, in fact, is the High Court.  A very considerable principle is being affected. <Col N="1681" /> I should also like to know if the Minister has had any representations from patent agents that their rights are being affected.  My information is that that is not so, that there has not been any demand for a right of audience by patent agents in the High Court.  If there has not been any demand for that, the Minister would be right in re-examining the section carefully.</P>

      <P>The object of amendments Nos. 64 and 65 is to deal with the particular position of patent agents under this legislation.  It is suggested in amendment No. 64 that a patent agent should not be an alien.  This is, in fact, the law as it applies in Britain and I should think that it would not be unreasonable to suggest that a similar type of provision should be inserted here.  The second amendment is designed to make quite clear that persons whose names are on the existing register should not be affected by the section in any way.</P>

      <P>To restrict the persons within the limits suggested by the Deputy would exclude aliens.  In the British law, there is a provision that British citizens or British subjects, I think, and citizens of the Irish Republic may practice as patent agents.  It is possible that will have to be amended in Britain also, particularly if they, as well as we, become members of the Economic Community <Col N="1682" /> because the Treaty of Rome operates to prevent restrictions of this nature.  In any event, under subsection (11) of the section, the Minister is empowered to make rules prescribing who will be eligible for registration and that will enable the Minister to provide for future commitments in regard to this matter without writing it into the Act.  I think it would be undesirable to introduce this amendment at this stage.</P>

      <P>I do not want to have a similar situation arising to that which arose in relation to the Companies Bill.  I got the memorandum from the Incorporated Law Society only this morning and my information is different from that which the Minister has given.  It is to the effect that the amendment is not acceptable to the Law Society, as such.  The section now, even with the Minister's amendment, does not correspond with the English section.  Section 88 of the English Patents Act of 1949 limits the exemption to any document other than a deed.  The Minister's amendment goes in a different direction and I suggest that the exemption or exception&mdash; whichever you call it&mdash;should be included.</P>
      <P>I am not happy about this.  I admit frankly that I do not understand the amendment; &ldquo;a deed assigning the right to make an application for a patent&rdquo; is clear but &ldquo;a deed assigning a patent granted to a patent agentel&rdquo;&mdash;does this mean that under the section it is not possible for anybody, other than a qualified solicitor, to do an assignment of a patent from one commercial person to another?  And that exemption is only to cover the case where a patent agent has, so to speak, applied for a patent as a nominee?  Is that what is intended?</P>

      <P>This is due to three or four different causes, one of which is the new system of accountancy and bills are being paid more promptly, with the result that accounts for 17 months will be paid in this Financial Year.  As well as that, there have been more competitions advertised this year than usual, due to the fact that it is harder to get enough applicants.  The result is that sometimes two competitions had to be held where formerly one was held.  There has also been a ten per cent increase in advertising costs.

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £94,200 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964, for Pensions, Superannuation, Compensation (including Workmen's Compensation), and Additional and other Allowances and Gratuities under the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1963, and sundry other Statutes; <Col N="1688" /> Extra-Statutory Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities awarded by the Minister for Finance; fees to Medical Referees and occasional fees to Doctors; Compensation and other Payments in respect of Personal Injuries; etc.</P>
    <P>First of all, in regard to Subhead A and Subhead B, increases are attributable to a larger number of retirements than had been expected and in particular, to the discharge from the Department of Social Welfare of a certain number of officials who were regarded as redundant and were offered very favourable terms to retire. There was no pressure except that they were offered favourable terms.  The savings from the deaths of pensioners were less than anticipated.  The expectation of life was longer.</P>

I do not think I would be in order in referring generally to pensions so I shall leave anything I have to say for the main Estimate which will come along almost immediately after the Easter recess.  I should like, however, to take the opportunity to urge on the Minister that one of the most serious and hurtful effects of an inflationary spiral is its effect on the pensioner. Starting with recent weeks, the cost of living has clearly started to rise in a substantial way and from what we have all heard of notifications to retailers in the past three of four days, it is going to rise more substantially in the weeks ahead.  When that happens, the first people to get hit and to get hurt will be those on fixed pensions and I would strongly urge the Minister to consider that aspect of the matter when he is coming to the House shortly.</P>

      <P>This supplementary sum is required to meet an additional expense from printing, paper, publications and office equipment for public services.  These will be offset in part by increased appropriations in aid.  The total increase in the subhead comes to £93,500. Printing and binding have been more than was anticipated at the beginning of the year on account of a greater increase in the requirements and in the speeding up of deliveries to the various Departments.  We also had to purchase more paper for printing envelopes and notepaper and so on, and this accounts for £40,000 of the Supplementary Estimate.  An increase in the price of books and periodicals accounts for £2,000.  Against that, there has naturally been an increase in the appropriations in aid by increased sales of £11,500.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £620,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964, for Expenditure in respect of Public Buildings; for the Maintenance of certain Parks and Public Works; for the Execution and Maintenance of Drainage and other Engineering Works; and for a Grant-in-Aid of the River Shannon Navigation.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is for increased expenditure on Subheads A, B, C, D and F of the Vote for Public Works and Buildings.  The gross additional expenditure is estimated at £745,000 but this is offset in part by expected savings on other subheads and increased receipts from appropriations-in-aid, Subhead K.  The increase in receipts is £37,000 and the savings on other subheads are £88,000 leaving a net £620,000 to be voted.</P>
      <P>Subhead A covers the purchase of sites and buildings.  It is difficult to forecast expenditure on this item accurately because of unexpected demands for accommodation, and to meet these, premises have to be purchased as they become available.  Properties to be purchased during the current year include:</P>
      <P> (a)  premises which will be used as a central architectural workshop by the Office of Public Works.  For some years past, the Commissioners, in the interests of efficiency, have been seeking to centralise their architectural workshops, at present scattered throughout the city in over a dozen different and mostly unsatisfactory premises.  Suitable premises have now become available;</P>
      <P>(b)  a building to be used as a new headquarters by the Irish Red Cross Society and;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  premises in Kildare Street which will be used as Government <Col N="1691" /> offices.  Present indications are that the original estimate for the current year will be too low by about £50,000.</P>
    <P>The increase in Subhead B is one which I feel Deputies will welcome as it is due mainly to the success of our efforts to produce more and better national schools.  We will need £500,000 extra for those but as some savings are expected on other items in the subhead the net additional requirement will be £450,000.</P>
    <P>It had been considered that making the best use of the staff and facilities available the most that could be achieved in dealing with the problem of worn out school buildings was that they should be replaced at the rate of providing near 100 schools a year and at the same time to carry out about 50 major improvement and renovation schemes.  The organisation of the Office of Public Works has now been geared to produce plans to service that programme. In introducing the Estimates for Public Works and Buildings last May I spoke of the acceleration in the school building programme and I quoted figures to show what had been done at that time and the number of school building projects in course of construction was 198 &mdash; 137 new schools, and 61 major improvement schemes.  The corresponding figures now are 235&mdash;161 new schools and 74 major improvement schemes.  During the ten months ended 31st January, 1964, a total of 163 contracts were placed&mdash;98 new schools and 65 major improvement schemes.  The gross provision of £1.9 million for schools in the current year's Vote has been exceeded already and it is expected that a further £500,000 will be needed to meet commitments.</P>
    <P>I think you will agree that we are following the right course in pressing on with the replacement of old schools as fast as possible and the work still to be done in this respect is formidable. The Minister for Education informed the House some weeks ago that there were some 650 schools scheduled by his Department for replacement.  These will be replaced in <Col N="1692" /> the next six years but as time passes additional old school buildings fall due for relacement at the rate of perhaps 50 a year.  There are about 4,800 schools in the country and of these some 1,600 have been built and 800 have undergone major improvement since 1922.  That is to say that about half the schools in the country have been erected or renovated since the foundation of the State but some of these, done in the early years, while structurally sound, are unsuited to modern educational requirements and need improvement.</P>
    <P>To cope with a programme of this size in a reasonable time and to ensure the best return for the considerable capital which will be required it is essential that old methods and old ideas should receive a critical reappraisal and that we should be bold enough to examine objectively all new proposals which make for speed and economy.  We must bear in mind also that needs are changing and that standards are constantly rising.  I have outlined previously some of the steps which had been taken in this direction by the Office of Public Works in collaboration with the Department of Education.  The research and development of which I spoke has continued and last September a prototype of a classroom with sanitary and cloakroom accommodation, designed to a new modular plan, was erected in Dublin.  In this building, factory-made timber units were used extensively for roof and wall cladding.  The building has weathered well during the winter and a permanent school of this type will be erected in County Dublin shortly.</P>
    <P>I must stress that this is an experiment but, if it proves sucessful, as I believe it will, then we will have a method by which we should be able to expand very greatly the number of new schools to be provided each year. That is, of course, dependent on several considerations not the least being the provision of suitable sites and the co-operation of the building trade which I have little doubt will be forthcoming.  An essential feature of any great expansion in such building would be bulk tendering and that is a <Col N="1693" /> matter which I will have to examine very closely.</P>
    <P>We are very anxiously concerned with solving the school building problem as quickly as we reasonably can and for that purpose the Office of Public Works is continuing research into all aspects of school building techniques to find the best solution.</P>
    <P>Subhead C covers general maintenance of more than 2,000 buildings and properties all over the country as well as parks and harbours.  Many of the buildings are old and while normal maintenance requirements, such as redecoration, can be estimated fairly accurately it is not easy to foresee all the repair works that have to be done. Increases in wages and rising costs contribute to the extra £175,000 which is needed.</P>
    <P>Subhead D provides for the furnishing requirements of all Government Departments.  Costs of furniture generally have risen and the Departmental demands were greater than was expected, for instance, for expanded agricultural services and more desks, etc., to cater for the additional candidates at the Department of Education examinations.  £40,000 more is needed.</P>
    <P>Subhead F provides for the needs of Government premises in the matter of heating and lighting.  The extra £30,000 required is due to increases in fuel costs, coupled with the unusually cold weather of last spring, as well as to an expansion in the use of electricity in common with the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>It is established policy to use native fuel wherever practicable, and already three-quarters of the sum voted under this subhead is expended on turf and electricity.  As existing heating plants wear out they are replaced by equipment suitable for the consumption of native fuels.  The old coal fired boilers which served the major heating installation at the Central Hospital, Dundrum, were recently replaced by turf-burning equipment.  As we expected, the new boilers are giving excellent results and turf is proving to be a highly efficient and economic fuel. Deputies may be aware that the heating system of Leinster House and the surrounding Government Buildings is also <Col N="1694" /> being changed and it is expected that it will be entirely turf-fired as from October next.</P>
    <P>On Subhead K&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;we are getting rather more than was expected&mdash;an increase of £37,000 on £280,000.  This is made up of various items, the most important being for sales of surplus property which is producing £16,000 more than the Estimate&mdash;to some extent due to a carry-over from the previous year because some sales effected in 1962/63 were not completed until the current year.</P>
    <P>I trust that these few remarks will explain the need for the Supplementary Estimate.  If any Deputy would like more information, I shall do my best to give it to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what one might call an open and shut Supplementary Estimate.  There are only a few points I should like to make on it, but, first of all, I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the Parliamentary Secretary for his courtesy in supplying me with a statement so early.  That is a practice I would commend to his colleagues.</P>
      <P>Under Subhead A&mdash;purchase of sites and buildings&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary refers to premises in Kildare Street which are being acquired for use as Government offices.  I hope that these premises are near the National Library and I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should make some part of them available to the staff of the National Library.  There is a great deal of overcrowding in the Library at the moment.  I know a new one will be built, but, at the same time, more and more books and documents are pouring in to the Library and there is simply no accommodation for them.  I draw his attention to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wholly admirable that the State should interest itself in the provision of a new headquarters for the Irish Red Cross.  We were on the receiving end of bounties from countries all over the world in our poorer days.  The Irish Red Cross Society have helped people throughout the world who suffered disaster, famine and so on and it is a good <Col N="1695" /> thing that Ireland, in the words of Emmett, can take her place among the nations of the earth in a matter like this and it could not be done better than under the banner of the Irish Red Cross.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has referred to the erection of prefabricated schools.  I know this is an experiment and if it were a failure, I would not do what the Parliamentary Secretary's colleagues would do, come into the House and jeer him for it.  I would commend him for taking a calculated risk.  He is taking a chance which may not click but, if it does not, he will receive no criticism from me. I realise that as far as is humanly possible, he has investigated this.  I saw a film of it on television and it looks all right.  According to the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, it is expected that one of them will be erected in Dublin shortly and I am sure the House will join with me in wishing him well in this venture.</P>
    <P>Looking at the figures mentioned here, 4,800 schools throughout the country, we realise the great task that confronts the Office of Public Works. There is often agitation about schools being in bad condition, even strikes being called, but only a certain number of schools can be built in one year. There is a very high figure indeed for the number of schools being newly built or reconstructed and we on this side of the House would raise no objection to providing the money for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Subhead D provides for the furnishing requirements of all Government Departments.  Costs of furniture generally have risen.  A lot of costs have gone up and we know why.  We know that wages have increased.  However, I should like to compliment the Office of Public Works on their good taste in the furniture they buy.  They deserve credit for the way in which they plan and furnish these offices, including the rooms in Leinster House and the various Government Departments.</P>
    <P>There is reference here to parks and harbours and that always brings the name of a certain place to my mind <Col N="1696" /> which I shall not mention to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am glad his Office are active there after all these years.  We are prepared to give the Parliamentary Secretary his Estimate.</P>

      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of paying a tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary. I do not wonder that he looks at me because it is probably something he was not expecting to hear. I believe that if a man is deserving of a clap on the back, he should get it. May I say to him that particularly in the past 12 months I have noticed a higher degree of courtesy from him than I have experienced previously? Furthermore, I admire the courage with which he is tackling many of the problems of his Department.  I have very clear evidence of a high degree of progress in the Office of Public Works. If there is a high degree of progress in a Department, it cannot be without the knowledge of the Minister.  From the volume of work I see undertaken by the Office of Public Works, I believe there must be a certain amount of drive from the Parliamentary Secretary. I want to express my appreciation of that and I feel this is the place to do so.  I have over a long period been extremely critical of the manner in which the Parliamentary Secretary dealt with many problems, many of them affecting my own constituency. May I say that on this Supplementary Estimate I have no axe to grind?  As Deputy Lynch has pointed out from this side of the House, I believe the Parliamentary Secretary has done as much as it is humanly possible for him to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to express for the record my appreciation of the observations he has just made that Government offices, instead of being heated by coal, will in future be heated by turf.  That is something I welcome very much.  Turf is our native fuel.  The constituency I represent is probably the greatest turf-producing area in Ireland.  I am glad to note that the Government are now taking steps to see that turf will be used for the heating of all Government buildings, including Leinster House.  I want to tell Deputies I am absolutely convinced that when turf is used here <Col N="1697" /> there will be no grounds in future for complaints about the heating of this House.</P>
    <P>The best fuel we have for heating in Ireland today is turf.  That is why I am glad steps are being taken to use as much native fuel as possible. Our bogs can be developed, giving employment to our workers and cutting down on imports of foreign fuel.  I have always maintained that we have as good fuel from our bogs as we ever got from the coal mines abroad.  I hope an effort will also be made to use as much Irish anthracite as possible. Some of the coal production areas are in my constituency and considerable employment is given there. Between Laois and Kilkenny, we can produce as good as can be produced in Britain or anywhere else.  I do not know why we Irish are bashful in boasting about what we can produce ourselves.  In the line of fuel, we can produce the best in the world.  I welcome this step and I believe our native fuel will be more successful than any heating medium tried in Government offices previously.  Our fuel is the best in the world.</P>

      <P>I represent a constituency that produces the best turf in Ireland.  I know the great source of wealth that lies in our bogs. All our briquettes are produced in my constituency also, and there is no British coal but would have to take second place to them.  I appreciate the action of the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department in introducing this system of heating, and I assure him he has my active co-operation in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A vast amount of work remains to be done in regard to national schools. In some of our national schools, over 80 children are crammed into unhealthy classrooms.  In some of them, the sanitary conditions are a disgrace and the accommodation for recreation not worthy of comment.  In many of our schools the cloakroom facilities and the facilities for the children to take lunch in bad weather are to be deplored.  Any money the Parliamentary <Col N="1698" /> Secretary asks for in this connection will gladly be given.  I appreciate the improvements that have been undertaken in many national schools in my constituency and throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The target which the Parliamentary Secretary has set himself in this Estimate could be extended.  I wonder if he would furnish Deputies of all Parties&mdash;not his own Party alone&mdash; with details of what he has in mind for the various schools in the different counties?  It has come to my notice that there are a number of schools in my constituency with which the Parliamentary Secretary's Department and the Department of Education have been dealing for a number of years, but because the school managers are not throwing their weight behind them, nothing is being done.  That is why I wondered whether the Parliamentary Secretary is considering taking suitable action in the interests of the children to see that proper schools are provided for them and that in areas where he is not getting co-operation from the school managers, the necessary steps will be taken to see that the children are provided with schools properly heated and ventilated and with classrooms that are not overcrowded.</P>
    <P>I have known schools a person would be afraid to enter.  I have visited schools in the midlands that are entirely unsuitable.  There is one school at Clonaghadoo, Mountmellick which has been under the notice of the county medical officer for a long time and in respect of which strong representations were made to have it condemned as unfit.  The Parliamentary Secretary's Department has recommended that a new school be provided there.  For some reason, the school manager is deliberately putting the matter on the long finger and refusing to co-operate with the Office of Public Works and the Department of Education. It is wrong to have children attending a school coming under the notice of the county medical officer as unfit for human habitation.  There is no proper water for the children to drink, the sewerage and toilet facilities are a disgrace and the stench from the school is alarming.</P>

Where he is not getting co-operation in the matter of school building, he should advise those people that, unless co-operation is forthcoming, he will take other steps.  Our children must be provided with good schools. It is not in the national interest that co-operation in this regard should not be forthcoming.</P>

I am most anxious that something should be done and this is the only occasion we have of giving the Parliamentary Secretary money for this purpose and, as he is the agent for the Department of Education in this matter, I presume that he applies for the money and the Department of Education spends the money, and that he has no say as to the schools on which the money will be spent.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the furnishing of Government offices.  On the whole, the furnishing of Government offices is reasonably good.  I do not know what the procedure is, whether the furniture has to be requisitioned by the offices concerned or whether the Office of Public Works inspects the furniture in the various Departments.  I have occasion to frequent the Land Commission Office and the Valuation Office.  In the Valuation Office there are tables which must be 200 years old.  The officials in the <Col N="1701" /> Valuation Office should be provided with suitable desks.  There are four or five senior officers in the main office. There is no privacy.  The chairs must be as old as the tables.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are either very valuable or no good at all.  The tables could not be described as antiques but they are old and shabby. I should like to see suitable desks provided in which there would be drawers, and lockers in which the officers could keep files.  Suitable seats should be provided. The accommodation provided for the public is most unsuitable, as also is the furniture in the hall.  Furniture which is out of date and useless should be put out of sight of the public.</P>
      <P>The furnishing of Government offices is an expensive item but officials should be provided with proper equipment and facilities for the carrying out of their work.  The money provided in the Estimate for that purpose is money well spent.  I hope the Office of Public Works will undertake a survey of Government offices and will replace useless and unsuitable furniture.</P>
      <P>A good deal of work is carried out by the Office of Public Works in regard to the provision of parks.  In this connection, I presume the Parliamentary Secretary is acting as the agent of the Department of Local Government. Most towns should be provided with suitable parks for children and such parks should be equipped with the usual amenities for amusement.  We read of many fatal accidents involving young children on the roads and on the streets.  An effort should be made to provide suitable parks for children in towns.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the speakers for the manner in which they received the Estimate and to assure them that anything that can be done to solve the problem of wiping out the evils of the slums of some of our schools will be done.  I should like to thank the Deputies for the kind remarks they have made about me and my officers.  Any suggestions <Col N="1704" /> or policy laid down by me could not be put into operation or implemented without a careful and expert staff. The Office of Public Works is a much maligned body but I am convinced that we have some of the most efficient members of the Civil Service attached to it.</P>
      <P>I have not received a specific complaint that the staff over in Kildare Street are actually working under unsatisfactory conditions but I do agree that conditions could be improved. The new National Library is to be built at Morehampton Road and will solve the problem in connection with both books and staff.  However, I shall look into the point raised by Deputy Lynch.</P>
      <P>Reference was also made by Deputy Lynch to the prefabricated or system-built type of school which we are investigating. The sample which Deputy Lynch saw on television was a classroom plus unit combined.  It was not a complete school.  There is at the moment a prototype school under construction in County Dublin and when it is completed, I hope to invite all Deputies to visit it and give their opinions on it.  It will be a very useful experiment.  One of the main considerations is that it should be aesthetically suitable.  Nothing could be worse than to dot rural Ireland with buildings that would not blend in with their surroundings.  I think Deputies will be satisfied with what will be produced.</P>
      <P>There is no question of these being temporary buildings.  They will be just as good in 50 or 60 years' time, even though we may have completely new schools by then.  There is nothing temporary in their appearance, finish or design.  We have already raised the standard of our schools and the number of square feet per pupil in our national schools and that standard will be incorporated in the new design. We are spending this year on schools more money than has ever been spent in the history of the State.  Everyone would like to see the amount increased and the number of schools being built stepped up but I think that this time next year we shall be able to report a substantial increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall convey that to the Minister.  On the question of sites, the Office of Public Works are called on to advise on the site when the school manager has selected it.  If such a site is not suitable, we see to it that the Minister will not make the necessary funds available.  I do agree that there are areas in Ireland today crying out for schools and, in certain instances, due to the lack of co-operation, I am sorry to say, by the managers, these schools are not being built.  These managers are not carrying out their duty to the State and to the community.  There is lethargy and apathy.  I do not know how we can improve that position.  It may be possible that when regulations are made under the new Planning and Development Act, provision will be made for schools and playgrounds.  No such provision was made in some of the housing estates of the past.  Latterly, a more enlightened approach has been adopted by local authorities but in some cases no cognisance has been taken by the local authority of the needs in their localities, with the result that we have vast housing areas built up and no sites available for schools.</P>
      <P>There is now a more enlightened policy and local authorities are ensuring that sites for schools be provided in future housing estates.  There are isolated instances in the country where the necessary sites are not being provided by the school manager and it is difficult to see what can be done in such cases, except to enlist the co-operation of members of the House and of local authorities.  When my Estimate comes around, I may furnish Deputies with a list of areas in the country which are in need of schools. That might enable them to use their good offices with the local managers if they are not carrying out their work.</P>

      <P>It is true that there are cases of overcrowding.  From time to time statements appear in the newspapers that such and such a school is grossly overcrowded.  The moment I read such statements I kick up a row in my office and ask the reason.  However, I have not yet found any ground for criticism of my officials because, in the main, the managers have been at fault.</P>
      <P>There was a case of overcrowding recently in Dublin which got a certain amount of publicity.  On investigation, it was found that a large number of children were coming in from an outside area and this was not envisaged when the school was designed.  Actually, there are certain proposals before the manager in question and the sooner he accepts them the sooner the work can proceed.  The money is there and the co-operation and it is up to this manager and managers of other schools to co-operate in solving the problem.</P>
      <P>I do not object to criticism, which I think is a useful spur to Ministers and holders of other offices, when it is constructive but before it appears in the papers, we would welcome communication from the various newspapers and we shall give them the information. They can come to the Office of Public Works at any time and if we are at fault, they can criticise us, but before they write, in fairness to the public and all concerned, they should get the true picture. We will make available to them information from our files so that they can write a factual account of the position as they find it.  We do not mind criticism after that.</P>

      <P>Furniture for Government offices was mentioned.  We act very quickly when we get a request from Government offices.  For instance, in Subhead D. the Revenue Commissioners in connection with PAYE, <Col N="1707" /> required furniture and some £10,000 is included in this subhead for the purpose of supplying modern office equipment.  Some £3,000 worth of furniture is being provided for the Department of Agriculture for new local offices for the bovine TB eradication scheme and there is provision for additional examination equipment for the Department of Education for an expected increase of about 750 in the number of examination candidates.  A great deal of furniture in Government Departments is fairly old and there is a growing tendency to weed that out in favour of more modern equipment. I shall look into the point mentioned by Deputy Flanagan.</P>

      <P>The only other point mentioned was on Subhead C., Parks. I should have made clear at the outset that the parks mentioned are the only parks for which the Office of Public Works has responsibility, the Bourn Vincent Park, Garnish, Phoenix Park and St. Stephen's Green.  I have seen letters to the papers and very interesting articles written about these parks in Dublin.  So far as Phoenix Park and St. Stephen's Green are concerned, I can assure the House that no building whatever in any form will be erected in any of these parks.  It is not contemplated and certainly there will be no proposals from the Government in any way to despoil any of them. They are there for the public but if the precedent of putting even a small building on them were created, it would be very dangerous and would make it very hard to resist further demands.  The Government have not the slightest intention of locating any building, concert hall or anything else in these areas.  I should again like to thank Deputies for the manner in which they have received this Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Tuesday, 18th February in Question No. 36 on the Order Paper, I asked the Minister for Local Government:</P>
      <P>If he is aware that the September, 1963 monthly meeting of Laois County Council gave authority to the county manager to make a clerical appointment in the motor taxation office; that the county manager then decided to create a new post of staff officer in the Motor Taxation Department; that this post was not advertised; and that no opportunity was given to existing members of the county council staff to apply for it; why this position was not advertised; if he will state the method by which it was filled; if he is aware that the county secretary has informed members of the Council that the Minister is aware of all the circumstances surrounding this appointment; and if he will make a general statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>I raise this in all sincerity and not for the purpose of causing the Minister any political embarrassment.  I would not do so and I am not doing so now.  I am raising the question solely to elicit information because this appointment is a departure from all other appointments made in the county and one which calls for an explanation.  I raise the matter now in the hope that the Minister and those of his Party who are present will be able to discuss the matter in a cool, calm atmosphere. I do not intend to arouse the Minister's anger in any way but I want to ask him to explain to the House and the country, and particularly to the county in which the incident occurred, why there was this extraordinary departure in the making of this appointment.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his reply stated that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Laois County Council's proposal for the creation of an additional office of staff officer in the motor taxation office was sanctioned by me on 6th December, 1963.  It was stated that the county <Col N="1709" /> council at their meeting of 30th September, 1963, had consented to the creation of the additional office.</P>
    <P>That is not so.  Laois County Council, on 30th September, at its monthly meeting, first heard of this matter when there was a notice on the agenda asking the council to provide extra clerical assistance in the motor taxation office.  There was no question whatever, and no indication was given by the county manager, that a staff officer was to be appointed.  It was clearly stated that owing to the volume of work in the motor tax office, another official was necessary to cope with the increase.  At the same meeting, I proposed that the necessary consent be given to the appointment of a clerical assistant in accordance with what appeared on the agenda and that proposal was passed unanimously.  At no time was there mention of a staff officer.</P>
    <P>At the October meeting of the county council, the minutes of the September meeting were signed, unobserved by the members, stating that the resolution referred to the appointment of a staff official and not a clerical assistant, as was indicated in the resolution on the agenda of the previous meeting, and which was passed unanimously by the county council.  Shortly afterwards, a member of Laois County Council, Councillor Keenan, directed the attention of the chairman of the council to this inaccuracy.  At the monthly meeting held in January, the same councillor asked the county manager if the post was to be advertised, or when it would be advertised, in view of the fact that a similar post in Offaly had been advertised by the Offaly County Council.  The county manager replied that it was not his intention to advertise the post.  He was asked why, and he made no answer.  The members of the county council made inquiries to find out what happened and we discovered that an appointment had been made by the county manager.  We inquired who the successful appointee was and it gave us grounds for extreme suspicion.</P>
    <P>This appointment led to my question and to this Adjournment Debate. <Col N="1710" /> I want to point out that the county manager,when asked why he appointed this person, stated that there was a competition held in August, 1963, and that as a result of that competition, the appointment was made.  I want to ask the Minister for Local Government whom the Minister or the county manager thinks is being fooled when they tell us that a competition was held in August and a man appointed from that competition when it was only on 30th September that Laois County Council decided to create the post and make the appointment. As there has been no explanation from the Minister or from the county manager, I say this appointment is wrong; it &ldquo;stinks&rdquo; and it is a bad appointment.  I am not criticising the person appointed but the method of appointment, which is wrong.  Everyone will agree that what happened in Laois may happen in any of the other counties if this procedure is not stopped right away.  It is a bad system.</P>
    <P>The county manager went on to tell the council that there was a competition in June, 1963, for a position as staff officer in the accounts section of the department and that it was confined to all the officials of the Laois County Council, but none of the people, not a single one, qualified in the June examination.  One of the candidates who sat for that examination sat a month later for a competition open to all Ireland and gained first place and has been appointed staff officer in Donegal County Council. Was it not very strange that a competition was held in Laois amongst the staff and none of them qualified, but then one of the entrants went in for an examination open to all Ireland and gained first place?</P>
    <P>That calls for an explanation.  The serious part of this entire matter is how lightly the Minister and the county manager have taken it.  I understand that some members of the Laois County Council staff felt they were qualified for promotion but had been overlooked.  Their trade union is dealing with that and looking into the matter.  The duty of a county manager is to cater fairly and fully for the staff under him and to create an atmosphere <Col N="1711" /> of goodwill and co-operation.  Is it to be generally accepted that all future appointments in this State are to be made secretly and behind closed doors and no opportunity given to people, no matter how highly qualified they may be, to apply?</P>
    <P>There is still a more serious aspect. It has now come to the ears of the members of the county council that this new staff officer appointed for the motor taxation department is now, in addition, to be given full charge of the electoral list and the compiling of the register.  That is another function that has been handed over and now comes within the ambit of the county council. This is the most serious part of it. We have this appointment secretly made, without being advertised, without reason being given for it, and now we find that, in addition to the motor taxation post, he has been appointed to control the compiling of the electors list.  He is a very useful official for any political Party to have on their side, or for any Fianna Fáil Deputy to have, or for any political organisation to have.  That is why I say this matter is very serious.  There is a growing tendency to allow appointments of this kind to go unnoticed and that is why I asked the Minister to make a statement why the county manager, from behind closed doors, appointed the cousin of a Fianna Fáil Deputy to the post.</P>

      <P>It is quite evident that this matter which has been raised by Deputy Flanagan, despite what he said originally, is a typical attempt by him <Col N="1713" /> to slander me as a Fianna Fáil Deputy and one of the representatives of the Fianna Fáil Party in Laois-Offaly. Quite obviously, the heat has become so intense so far as Deputy Flanagan is concerned, that he is now resorting to his system of 20 years ago of throwing as much mud as he possibly can in an effort to try to do as much harm as he can to the Fianna Fáil organisation. It is nothing new for Deputy Flanagan, but from my point of view I find defending myself in face of such an onslaught is not too easy because I have never had occasion before this to defend myself from an attack such as that which Deputy Flanagan has made.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan knowing that, knows quite well obviously that all he has to do is fling as much mud as he can in the hope that some of it will stick.  He has alleged that the minutes of the Laois County Council meeting of 30th September last are incorrect.  In that allegation he impugns <Col N="1714" /> the integrity of the county manager, the county secretary and every member of the county council inasmuch as he states, by inference, that they were associated in a lie.  It is very easy to come in here and state that something that appears on the record officially, signed by the chairman of the county council, is out of order, just because it suits Deputy Flanagan's book to say so.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the intention of the Deputy is to make as much of an attack as he can and, in doing so, ridicule his opponents as much as he possibly can.  He is obviously feeling very shaky.  He sees all his castles in the air tumbling down around him and he, therefore, resorts to this type of attack. I want to assure Deputy Flanagan now that it just will not work.  The only people to whom I am anxious to get my message across to are the decent, respectable people of Laois-Offaly who know and appreciate what Deputy Flanagan has been doing over a period. I hope these people will accept the denial I make of the allegation that I made any sort of representations to anybody.  I have already denied that at a council meeting.  I do it again tonight because Deputy Flanagan is in the fortunate position here of making statements, which he knows have no foundation, under the protection of the House, statements he would not make outside the House.</P>

The allegation made by Deputy Flanagan is, as has been said, merely a throw-back to what we have come to know him for, to what he has been notorious for down through the years. He makes out that something has been done which is unusual and suspicious. He finally makes the allegation that something was manipulated because a Deputy on this side of the House had some well-removed relationship with the person successful in getting the job.  He also makes it appear that, not only is Deputy Lalor implicated in this particular matter to a degree that brings no credit on him or on this House but that the whole staff of his own county council are not to be trusted; he alleges, by inference, that they are people who should not be performing the duties they now perform, that they have trimmed and fixed the minutes of the meeting of 30th September last, a meeting at which Deputy Flanagan was not only present but was, in fact, the proposer of a motion which reads:</P>
      <P>That in pursuance of the provisions of Section 6 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, we hereby consent to the creation of an additional office of Staff Officer in the Motor Taxation Department.</P>

It is a follow-up of Deputy Flanagan's conviction, which he brayed all over County Kildare, that Fianna Fáil were a doomed Party. That was the preparation for a mudslinging campaign, a campaign that he <Col N="1717" /> and his supporters felt was the only campaign they could avail of to try to tumble Fianna Fáil, if they could get a general election, which, of course, the people in the two constituencies answered with an emphatic &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan should be wary of falling back into this old bad habit of his.  We had thought that the years might have mellowed him, that his connections made during those years would have brought some sense of propriety to him, if nothing else, and that we had finished with what we had known of him when he made even fouler accusations, accusations that were just as untrue, and accusations, as a result of which, Deputy Flanagan was branded as a purveyor of untruths by the courts of this country.  Apparently Deputy Flanagan has failed to learn the lesson.</P>

    <P>Nobody, neither Deputy Lalor nor any other person, approached me at any time in relation to this appointment either on behalf of the successful candidate or any other.  Mark you, this candidate emerged No. 3 on the list from an open competition.  The first man on that list, in the competition for an existing vacancy in that county we are talking about, did not take up the post when it was offered to him. The second man got it and when this post was created, created after it had been proposed by Deputy Flanagan and seconded by his friend in the council, that post was then open to be given to the man who was next in order.  When that man turns out to <Col N="1718" /> be by name &ldquo;Lalor&rdquo; and I believe, according to Deputy Flanagan&mdash;it is the only thing he said tonight that I do believe&mdash;a cousin of some kind or another of Deputy Lalor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I repeat that there was no question of collusion or influence. There was nothing unusual about the method of appointment and Deputy Flanagan is really stooping to the lowest form which we have known him to show over the years and he brings no credit on himself.  I would not mind that, because it really does not matter, but it is bringing this House into disrepute, as it has also brought his own council into disrepute in its last couple of meetings during which this squabble has been going on.  Deputy Flanagan should be ashamed of himself but since we know he is not capable of any such feeling he should at least remember that there may be some respectable members of his family or connections of his down the country who have some shame in them.</P>

      <P>Rural postmen are ordinarily required to perform their posts on foot and pedal cycle, but permission to use his own transport, including a motor vehicle, is given to any postman who wishes to do so subject to his undertaking to maintain regular deliveries and to comply with certain conditions, mainly relating to insurance.</P>
