      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) the total number employed full time in the Civil Service, excluding the Garda and Army, (b) the total number employed in the Garda and Army, including all ranks, (c) the total number in the full time employment of all local authorities, and (d) the total number employed in the State-sponsored organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The number of civil servants, as recorded at the Civil Service Census, relating to 1 January, 1964, was 30,383.  This total does not include industrial staff, civilian employees of the Department of Defence, scale-payment subpostmasters, branch managers of employment exchanges, collectors of taxes and casual staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> (b)  The total number in the Defence <Col N="1192" /> Forces on 31 March, 1964, excluding officers and men of the reserve, An Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí, was 8,221.  The number in the Garda Síochána on 30 June, 1963, was 6,401.</P>
    <P>(c)  It is not possible to distinguish those in part-time and full-time employment by local authorities and it is estimated that for the year ended 31 March, 1963, the average total employment by such bodies, including vocational education committees and county committees of agriculture, was 51,100.  This figure does not include employees of harbour authorities for whom data are not available.</P>
    <P>(d)  The term &ldquo;State-sponsored organisation&rdquo; is not well defined and there may be some doubt as to whether or not certain bodies should be so classified.  The definition has been taken as including autonomous corporations and companies, etc., with their wholly-owned subsidiaries, to which the Government or Ministers appoint directors, etc., and whose staff are not civil servants.  Aggregating the available data, which relate to various dates in 1963-64, it is estimated that the average number employed by such bodies was 52,500.  Universities and university colleges are not included in this total. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary)</i> asked the Taoiseach the percentage of the population (a) primarily engaged in agricultural work, and (b) engaged in secondary agricultural work, that is, work arising from the processing and/ or distribution of primary agricultural products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the Census of Population, 1961, persons at work in Agriculture, excluding Forestry, numbered 371,316 representing 35.3 per cent of the total population at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is not possible to identify precisely the group of persons referred to in section (b) of the Deputy's question the following categories appear to correspond approximately to what is required:&mdash;manufacture of food and beverages, tanning and dressing of leather, dealing in livestock, wool, skins and leather, seeds and agricultural <Col N="1193" /> merchandise, wholesale distribution of food and drink, retail distribution of groceries, milk, meat, fish and poultry, vegetables and fruit, bread and flour confectionery and other food and drink.</P>
    <P>The total number of persons engaged in these industrial groups at the Census of Population, 1961, was 103,846 or 9.9 per cent of the total number at work.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the above figures relate to persons whose principal occupations were in agriculture and in the other industrial groups mentioned.  The Census of Population, 1961, revealed that many persons whose principal occupation was not that of farmer were the rated occupiers of agricultural holdings.  The total number of such persons was 101,424 of which 22,096 had holdings of under one acre, 46,201 holdings of one to five acres and 33,127 holdings of five acres and over.</P>

      <P>A separate booklet on health services is not issued by my Department but all relevant information of a general nature will be found in the Guide to the Social Services published by the Stationery Office, the twelfth edition of which was issued some months ago. I am forwarding a copy to the Deputy for his information.  In addition, health authorities have leaflets setting out the detailed arrangements applicable <Col N="1194" /> to their areas in relation to hospital, specialist, maternity and infant services.  These leaflets are for the most part based on models supplied to them by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the Deputy could more appropriately have addressed his question to the Dublin Health Authority, of which he is a member.  In order to facilitate him on this occasion, however, I have obtained the following particulars from the health authority:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Thirty-five prosecutions in respect of contraventions of the Food Hygiene Regulations in the Dublin city area were instituted in 1963.  Convictions were obtained in 18 of these cases and the Probation Act was applied in 12 cases; in two cases the proceedings were abandoned, in one case the summons could not be served and two cases are not concluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of patients it is possible to accommodate in the Richmond Hospital, Dublin; whether plans for the building of a new hospital to replace the present Richmond Hospital have reached his Department; if so, on what date; when he expects to be in a position to give his decision on this proposal; if plans have reached his Department for a new nurses' home for the Richmond Hospital; if so, on what date; and when he expects to make a decision on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that in referring to the Richmond Hospital, the Deputy has in mind the institutions formerly known as the Richmond, Whitworth and Hardwicke Hospitals and now constituting St. Laurence's Hospital.  The information requested by the Deputy in regard to that hospital is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bed complement of St. <Col N="1195" /> Laurence's Hospital is 366.  In periods of pressure the number of in-patients may be close to this number.  The average bed-occupancy for 1963, however, was 319.</P>
    <P>The provision of a new St. Laurence's Hospital on the site acquired at Cabra was one of the major projects included in the postwar hospital building programme. Planning had reached an advanced stage when the difficulties of the financial situation, which reached critical proportions in 1956, forced the Government of the time to curtail and eventually withdraw the Exchequer grants-in-aid of the Hospitals Trust Fund that were necessary to enable the approved building programme to be carried through as scheduled.  In the re-assessment of the position which was then necessary, it was not found possible to proceed with more than two of the four major hospital building projects for the Dublin area which were included in the original programme.  As the Deputy will be aware, work is at present in progress on those two projects, namely the new St. Vincent's and new Coombe Hospitals.  The St. Laurence's Hospital project is one of those which are constantly under review in relation to the position of the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>
    <P>Plans for a new nurses' home were included in the plans for a new hospital to which I referred earlier. Tentative proposals in regard to the location of a nurses' home at the existing hospital were also made in an outline scheme submitted subsequently by the hospital authorities for a hospital based on the present site.  The question of proceeding with the erection of a nurses' home depends on where the new St. Laurence's Hospital will be located and a final decision has not yet been reached on this matter. Less than a week ago, my Department received a request from the hospital authorities for my approval in principle to the renting of premises to house members of the nursing and resident medical staff.  A decision on this matter will be conveyed to the hospital authority as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell <Col N="1196" /> us how much money has been spent to date on consultants' fees for planning a new hospital and nurses' home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an entirely separate question which it would require some research to answer.  I suggest the Deputy put it down at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister visited this hospital or has he any idea of what the staff accommodation is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be under a misapprehension.  It is no part of my function to visit hospitals. I am not an inspector or a supervisor.  I have a competent office staff to do that.  I have not visited this hospital any more than I have visited each one of the other 400 hospitals in the 26 Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not right to say that the Minister has a particular responsibility for the Richmond Hospital, in view of the fact that he appoints the members of the board?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of a Ministerial Order made in 1950, the maximum number of members of the Board of St. Laurence's Hospital is 21. At present the number of members is 17.</P>
      <P>I am considering certain matters in connection with the government of this hospital, including the appropriate number of members of the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy puts down another question, I will answer that; but I must say that I do not think it is really a matter for investigation in this House as to how many times any member of the board attends. I have written to those members who I think have not been very consistent in their attendance, and I have suggested to them that if the responsibility of being a member of the board imposes too much of a burden on their time, they might consider resigning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    <Col N="1202" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The death of a person having the right of residence on land will give rise to a charge to Estate Duty on the benefit accruing by the cesser of the right and I see no reason to amend the law in this regard.  The value of the benefit is that of the &ldquo;slice&rdquo; of land corresponding to the right.  The value of this benefit will usually be very small; and, unless there is other property of substantial value passing on the death, no duty will in fact be payable on the cesser.  Every claim for Estate Duty on real estate is a charge on the property in the hands of every owner but after 12 years the charge will not affect the lands in the ownership of a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if, having regard to the fact that the price paid for many commodities and services includes a proportion which is payable to the State as tax, he will now provide that instead of imposing on air passengers the additional inconvenience of paying a separate passenger service charge the charge will be included in the price of tickets when issued.</P>

      <P>The desirability of including the passenger service charge in the price of the air ticket or devising some other method of payment which would obviate a separate charge, as at present, has always been accepted by me and indeed by many other airport operators.  The Deputy will appreciate however that a large proportion of air tickets for departures from Ireland are sold abroad and furthermore that a ticket may cover departures from many airports with different levels of passenger service charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> The position continues to be studied by international aviation bodies with a view to improving the present system.  In the meantime, I have taken steps to ensure that, in so far as is possible, passenger service charges will be collected from passengers at time of purchase of air ticket.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy in my reply to his Question on 4th December, 1963, Aer Lingus have ordered four short-haul jet aircraft for service primarily on the company's Continental routes; no proposal has been made to me by the company for the purchase of jet aircraft for normal use on the Dublin-London route.  The purchase price of the four aircraft, including equipment and development expenses, is approximately £5 million and delivery is expected in the spring of 1965.</P>

      <P>Aer Lingus made an estimate of the time when it would be desirable to have jet aircraft on the <Col N="1208" /> European routes.  Their estimate has proved to be satisfactory.  There continues to be some increase on the European route and jet aircraft are being introduced at a time when it is estimated that there will be so much competition on these European routes that without them no further increase of traffic could be obtained and in fact that there would be reductions. In the past two years, since these aircraft were ordered, the estimate has been that 1965 would be about the right delivery date.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining 4 per cent comprising some 12,000 premises, are in locations remote from the supply lines and the cost of extending supply to them is very high.  In their case, despite the maximum subsidy of £75, high charges are necessary to remunerate the capital which the Electricity Supply Board would have to lay out in extending the supply to them.  Unfortunately, there is no way in which these charges can be reduced, short of an inordinately high subsidy, which I <Col N="1211" /> would not recommend to the Government. I should add that the same principles of charging are applied throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to holidays under the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1961, is related not to the calendar year but to the employment year. An employment year is reckoned from the date, or anniversary of the date, of entry to employment.</P>
      <P>If the agents referred to by the Deputy are employed under a contract of service, the Act has always applied to them and they are entitled to holidays with pay in each employment year.</P>
      <P>If they are employed under a contract for services and paid solely by way of commission on premiums collected by them, they were brought within the scope of the Act by Regulations made on 22nd July, 1963, and are entitled to holidays with pay in each employment year begun since that date.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy refers to the recommendation made by the employers' organisations and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that revised wage and salary agreements <Col N="1212" /> should provide for increases in basic rates not exceeding 12 per cent.  This recommendation was not limited to particular classes of workers but it included a provision that, in the event of employers and trade union interests being unable to reach agreement on wage increases in any particular occupation or trade, the usual machinery for the peaceful settlement of disputes should be utilised and, if necessary, the parties should have recourse to the Labour Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the amount of local government grant, and the local authority grant, which entered into the cost of providing an unserviced rural cottage (particulars supplied), the date on which the dwelling was completed, and the reason why no septic tank was provided by the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will now sanction the local authority proposals to erect the single rural cottages mentioned in replies of 3rd April 1963, and 18th July 1963, in view of the subsequent provision of an unserviced rural cottage (particulars supplied) by the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 50 and 51 together. I understand that the cottage at Balcunnin to which the Deputy refers was completed in June, 1963, at a cost of £1,806.  The cottage was provided in replacement of an existing privately-owned unserviced cottage which was demolished as part of a road improvement scheme.  The full cost is being defrayed out of the main road improvement grant for the scheme.  The house plan was not submitted for my approval.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other single rural cottages to which he refers, I indicated in a reply to the Deputy on the 2nd July, 1963, my reason for not approving proposals for unserviced cottages on this site.  I understand that the housing authority is now investigating the feasibility of providing fully serviced dwellings for the applicants and I shall await their further proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not <Col N="1220" /> agree that it is rather peculiar that when a local authority is erecting a house, it fails to provide the necessary water and sewerage facilities, while the Department of Local Government insists it must be done if houses are being provided for those in condemned or overcrowded dwellings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal was not sent for my approval and therefore my approval was not at any time given. Furthermore, the contract for this house was signed some time in October, 1962.  No grants of any kind have been, or can be availed of in this case, so far as housing is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the entire cost of the house was provided by the State and there was no question of grants, would the Minister not consider taking the matter up with the county council concerned and finding out why they should have one set of rules for one type of house and a different set for another?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that since this was a replacement, there was a predetermined deal in regard to the acquisition of the land on which the house was then sited.  That, I take it, would be a matter of negotiation as regards the value of the house to replace the old one.  It is a matter into which I was not brought at any stage. While it is true that moneys from the Road Fund, to the extent of 100 per cent of the cost were used, these came from that county's Road Fund allocation for that year so that, in a sense, it was their own money they were spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that since the money came from the Road Fund, there is no point in talking about a grant from the Department of Local Government and surely he agrees the council should not be allowed to erect a sub-standard house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The only possible solution I see in the matter is that we might dock the grant by the amount the house cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might also consider having the necessary facilities provided.  That might be a more Christian approach.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the number and amount of advances under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts in 1963-64 in the form of a reply of 24th October, 1963, and the number of housing grants for private houses in each case.</P>

      <P>The actual planning of arterial road improvement schemes in their area is a matter for Kildare County Council in the first instance.  I have no general plan of the council's proposals in this regard.  The improvement to dual carriageway standard of the council's section of the Dublin-Naas Road, at present in progress, is being financed by special arterial road improvement grants from the Road Fund.  The current work on the section north of Naas is expected to be substantially completed in this financial year and the question of the priorities to be observed in the further development of the arterial road improvement programme in the county is at present the subject of correspondence with the county council.  It may be taken that this programme will be continued in the years ahead, under the arterial road grants scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an underlying principle of the scheme of old age (contributory) pensions which came into operation in 1961 that receipt of such a pension or an allowance as part of such a pension in respect of a spouse was a disqualification for a non-contributory pension, including blind pension.  The allowance in respect of a spouse is 37/6 which is greater than the present maximum rate of blind pension, and, of course, a married couple in receipt of an old age contributory pension are substantially better off than if both where in receipt of non-contributory pension, whether on grounds of age or because of blindness.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a general principle of the social welfare schemes that only one type of benefit should be paid to a claimant in respect of any period even though more than one of the contingencies for which benefit is provided under the various schemes has arisen in that period in the particular case. This principle has, however, been considerably modified in its application to widows by the Social Welfare (Overlapping Benefits) Regulations, 1953 to 1963, under which unemployment benefit can be paid in addition to widows' contributory or non-contributory pension.  Under the regulations, a widow in receipt of a contributory pension who qualifies for unemployment benefit is paid half the appropriate personal rate of unemployment benefit; if her pension is non-contributory, the rate of benefit payable depends on the rate of the pension and can range from half of the appropriate personal rate of unemployment benefit to as much as the full rate, plus appropriate <Col N="1227" /> adjustments in respect of any dependent children.  It is considered that these are generous concessions&mdash; which, I might add, also apply to disability benefit&mdash;and it is not proposed to alter them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Chomhairle, I shall take Questions Nos. 78, 79 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>The full rates of capitation grant in 1926 were £7 for each junior pupil and £10 for each senior pupil.  There was an overall increase of over 50 per cent in the rates of grant with effect as from the school-year 1953-54.  I have recently notified the recognised school associations that they are now being increased by a further 20 per cent.  I have also notified the secondary schools of a scheme of direct building grants.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my statement in the House on 20th February last that it was so proposed. The detailed scheme was issued to the schools on 27th April.</P>
      <P>Grants under the scheme are payable to eligible schools in respect of a new school building or a major extension to an existing building.  The grants will meet up to 60 per cent of loan charges on the sum raised by the school for building.</P>

    <Col N="1238" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that it was felt necessary for Comhairle le Leas Oige to provide educational facilities in Dublin city through youth clubs and the fact that the suburbs of Dublin city have now spilled over into the county administrative area, is the Minister aware that the existing legislation prevents the County Dublin educational authority giving education facilities through youth clubs whose premises are situated in the county council administrative area?  Although boys attending such youth clubs may all come from the city area, Comhairle le Leas Oige cannot give grants or any assistance or encouragement to these clubs if the premises are situated in the county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee of the county is in a position to give educational help to youth clubs of other committees.  The Macra na Tuaithe organisation is a case in point.  The Dublin city committee would not be entitled to do it in another committee's area but that does not preclude the other committee from helping.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will have steps taken to permit Comhairle le Leas Oige to extend their activities to the areas of Dublin County Council and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, having regard to the fact that many youth clubs catering for youths in Dublin suburbs are hampered in their activities by being situated in the County or Dún Laoghaire Borough administrative areas, or partly in the city and partly in other areas.</P>

      <P>As from the 1st May, 1964, the occupiers of all men's married quarters erected prior to 1954 are being required to pay at ESB local rates for electricity consumed by them.  This is already the position in respect of men's married quarters erected in 1954 and subsequent years.  The deduction in respect of the former type quarters was 5/- a week which covered the quarters, furniture, light and water. Under the new arrangement, the deduction has been reduced to 3/- a week to cover the quarters, furniture and water.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of all the other quarters, since 1954, payment has been made direct to the ESB by the occupants and they are supplied with current for space heating, cooking and other purposes now usual. These pre-1954 houses had light only.</P>

      <P>As I stated in a reply of 11th July last, the Garda Síochána, acting on legal advice, are not bringing any prosecutions merely for failure to stop at &ldquo;stop&rdquo; signs.  It can often happen, however, that such failure constitutes dangerous or careless driving and in such a case the gardaí would, of course, prosecute for that offence in the ordinary way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that what is being done, in fact, is that the Stop signs are being removed and they are being replaced by Yield right of way signs.  Would the Minister take steps, in collaboration with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, to speed up the process because it is undoubtedly confusing? Quite recently I saw a statement from the Bench to the effect that Stop signs were still operative to impose the obligation on a person to stop.  That does not seem to be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Stop signs are still authorised signs.  They are in some places being replaced by Yield right of way signs but this is not general.  In fact, new by-laws covering the whole matter are at the moment in course of preparation.  These by-laws are a matter for the Commissioner of of the Garda Síochána in the first instance and are subject to the approval of the Minister for Local Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think I made it as clear as I can.  Stop signs are still authorised signs, although, because of certain legal complications, the gardaí are not any longer bringing prosecutions merely for failure to stop at Stop signs.  Failure to do so, however, could in many instances constitute careless or dangerous driving.  In such case a prosecution can be brought.</P>

      <P>Persons involved in road accidents, their legal advisers or insurers, or other interested parties may on receipt of a written application, be supplied with an abstract of police report, and copies of statements of witnesses, subject to the following conditions:&mdash;</P>

    <P>A fee of 10s. is payable for the abstract of the Garda report and a fee of 5s. for each statement supplied.</P>
    <P>Apart from the foregoing, no information may be supplied except with the prior sanction of the Commissioner. I am informed that there is no record of any such sanction having been sought in recent years.</P>

While it is not the normal practice to supply information in regard to what is exclusively a matter of internal Garda administration, I am of opinion that an exception is justified in this case.</P>

      <P>The question seems to suggest, on the one hand, that begging by children on the Dublin streets at night is on a very wide scale and, on the other hand, that it is something that can be eliminated overnight by Garda action.  I do not accept either of these suggestions.</P>
      <P>I am, however, aware that there is some begging by children at night on some streets in the heart of the city. The matter is one to which the Garda Síochána have been giving special attention, including attention by plainclothes personnel, and last year proceedings were instituted against 81 children and 21 parents in respect of this offence.  The Garda Síochána are, of course, fully alive to the fact that in many cases it is the parents who are to blame and they act accordingly. Recently, special additional instructions were issued to the Force in Dublin in connection with the matter and ways and means of dealing with it have been discussed at the regular meetings that take place between officers in the DMD.</P>

      <P>Deputies will have learned, with profound regret, of the death, last night, of Deputy James Burke.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
      <P>He first became a member of the Dáil in 1954, and was re-elected in the general elections of 1957 and 1961.  He was elected to Roscommon County Council in 1950, and remained a member until his death.  An extensive farmer himself, his chief interest was agriculture, and he had been Chairman of the Roscommon County Committee of Agriculture since 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the welfare of the farmers &mdash;and the small farmer particularly&mdash; was his special concern, he gave generously of his talents and his <Col N="1256" /> energy in the interests of all sections of the community.  His contributions to our debates were characterised by a fund of commonsense and a most valuable and practical approach.  His chief characteristics were sincerity and imperturbable good humour.  He was deservedly very popular, and his death, in the prime of life, is mourned by all of us.  He will be missed particularly by his constituents, for whom he worked so tirelessly.</P>
    <P>I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey to his widow and family the deepest sympathy of Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 14, line 6, to delete &ldquo;three&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;six&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>We had begun to discuss this amendment on Committee last January.  I do not expect the Minister to have retained the arguments I advanced at that time, so I think I had better go over them very briefly.  Section 25 is the section which, in effect, means that when the Bill comes into operation no transaction shall be effective&mdash;in fact, it will be null and void&mdash;unless registration is completed within three months of the date of the transfer of the deed.  I think amendments Nos. 1 and 2 might be taken together.  I am suggesting, first, that instead of a time limit of three months, we should prescribe six months.  Later on I suggest, in the second amendment, that the time limit should run from the date of the application for registration and should not be dependent on the actual date of registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1258" /> This matter is one of very considerable importance.  I can see that a person without practical experience in land registration matters might say there is no reason why a deal should not be completed in three months from the date of the deed&mdash;that if A and B agree to sell land and if they execute a transfer of land from A to B, there is no reason why that should not be dealt with and completed inside three months and, therefore, the period of three months suggested in the section is adequate.  I can assure the Minister quite definitely that that point of view is conceived in ignorance of the practical effect which it is likely to have.</P>
    <P>Before a dealing can be brought for registration at all, it must be stamped. Nowadays, particularly in the case of building leases&mdash;many areas of registered land are being developed for building purposes&mdash;it is practically an invariable requirement that the lease should be adjudicated and adjudged duly stamped by the Stamping Branch of the Revenue Commissioners.  In order to have that done, it is necessary to satisfy any requirements of the Adjudication Office.  It is necessary to discharge any queries that may arise with regard to the particular lease or whatever the instrument in question is.</P>
    <P>I want to say&mdash;and I am talking from personal, practical experience&mdash; it could very well happen&mdash;indeed, I have here on the desk before me an example of it&mdash;that a lease might not be stamped for a period of six, eight or nine months after it is first presented for adjudication.  I want to make it clear I am not in any way faulting or criticising the officials of the Adjudication Office.</P>
    <P>What has happened in the particular case I have in mind is that it has not been possible to proceed with the stamping of the lease.  I can give the Minister very briefly the reason for it. It is not a matter that arises in his Department so much as in another Department.  In this case it is a lease of a new house being taken by a non-national. In the ordinary way, unless there were special circumstances with which he could comply, that lease <Col N="1259" /> would attract stamp duty at the rate of 25 per cent.  In the case of buildings where a grant is paid or payable, the stamp duty is reduced to one per cent. Alternatively, if the non-national obtains a letter of recommendation from the Land Commission to relieve him of the 25 per cent rate, it would be stamped at three per cent.</P>
    <P>In the case I had in mind&mdash;it is one with which I was dealing myself&mdash;a situation has arisen where agreement with regard to the State grant has not been reached between the builders and the Department of Local Government. As I understand the position, it has not been positively refused, but negotiations are going on with regard to the grant.  Because of that, the Land Commission will not deal with the application from the lessee to relieve him of payment of the 25 per cent stamp duty rate.  Again, I am not criticising them. I have no doubt they are simply carrying out the job laid down for them in the Finance Act.  Their attitude is that so long as there is other legislation covering the position, they cannot deal with an application.</P>
    <P>This lease was lodged for adjudication&mdash;I am talking from memory&mdash;on 9th November, 1963.  It has not yet been stamped.  Possibly it will be&mdash;I hope so anyway&mdash;in the near future. Because it has not yet been stamped, it is impossible to present it for registration at the Land Registry.  On the Minister's proposal in this section, that lease, or any other dealing in a similar position, would be ruled out and would have no force or effect at all.  I hope it is only necessary to give the Minister come concrete example of what may happen to persuade him to change his mind on this.  If he insists on the provision in the section, he is going to create an extremely difficult position not only for the lawyers concerned with the particular conveyancing matters in the Bill but also for vendors and purchasers.</P>
    <P>What this section is doing is providing that, if registration does not take place inside three months, the transaction is of no force or effect.  We must remember also that the ordinary conveyancing practice is&mdash;I cannot see <Col N="1260" /> any other way of dealing with the matter&mdash;that a man agrees with another to sell him a particular property. The title of the vendor is investigated by the purchaser's solicitor.  Eventually, the deed of transfer or deed of assignment is drawn up and executed by both parties and the deal is closed.  The purchase is completed and the money is passed over. In return for handing over the money, the purchaser gets a deed of transfer from the vendor.  The land comes for registration but it does not end there. The purchaser still has to get the deed registered before it is of real force or effect.  The Minister is saying, in this section, not only must you get it registered, but you must get it registered inside three months from the date of the lease.  If you do not do that, the deed has no force or effect. You may have paid out the money; you may have spent a considerable amount of money and paid it over to the vendor; but you will get nothing in return unless you succeed in registering within three months.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the difficulties which may arise before a deed can be presented for registration.  I think many members of my profession would be able to tell the Minister&mdash;I do not want to be misinterpreted in this or to be deemed as criticising the officials of the Land Registry&mdash;that it is not an uncommon matter to find that the registration of dealings which are lodged for registration in the Land Registry will not be completed within a period of three months.</P>
    <P>I made inquiries recently in the Land Registry regarding two particular matters.  One of them was in connection with the type of business I deal with in my profession and the other was on behalf of one of my constitutents. The dealing was not registered inside three months in each of those two cases.  I think one took about six months and the other, the case of my constituent, had taken five months at the time I inquired about it. I assume it has since been dealt with. I do not know because there is no obligation on the Land Registry to tell me whether it has, or has not, been dealt with.  It was, to my mind, quite <Col N="1261" /> a simple transaction.  It was a case where a man wanted to get a charge removed from the folio and the deed of release was lodged in the Land Registry.  At the time I inquired about it, about five months had elapsed from the date of the deed and, indeed, I think, from the date of making the application to the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>At present it could be that it will take even longer than three months from the date on which the dealing is lodged in the Land Registry.  I know the Minister might answer me in regard to that argument by saying, when this Bill goes through, and when it is in operation, that there will be, and must be, a vast expansion in the personnel, that there must be a difference in the methods, and so on, in the Land Registry which will cut out any delays. That may be so.  If it is so, I should be very glad indeed but it will not get over the obligation which I mentioned first, the obligation in respect of the dealing which cannot even be presented for registration for a considerable time after the date of the deed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support Deputy O'Higgins's view in regard to this matter.  There is no doubt that any of us who have practical experience of it will feel that the limitation of three months in this section is quite unrealistic.  I know the Minister's anxiety.  He is anxious to provide, partly what I might call the sanction and partly what I might call an inducement to people to register quickly and to provide in the only way he can that registration will be brought up to date.  At the same time, doing it in this way will do either of two things.  There will either be some transfers that cannot be registered in the manner in which Deputy O'Higgins has indicated or it will mean quite unnecessary application to the Registrar. The burden being put on the Registrar under this Bill will be a very heavy one, if, in addition to that, he will have unnecessary applications for the extension of time under section 25.  It seems to me quite indefensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section gives power for extension. The extension can be produced as a matter of routine, if you ask for <Col N="1262" /> it, which is nonsense, having asked for it in those circumstances.  It may mean that various reasons will have to be given to the Registrar.  In that connection it will take more of his time in quite an unnecessary manner.  My own view is that the extension which Deputy O'Higgins has asked for is too short, when you take into account the difficulty in relation to mapping particularly. I want to refer to that later on, in section 84, which was the section I could not find.  Transactions in building estates will be virtually impossible to complete even in the extended time which Deputy O'Higgins has suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins is in fact looking for two things.  First of all, he wants an extension of time to six months, and secondly, he wants to provide that one must only apply within the six months' period, whereas the Bill provides that the registration must be completed within a three months' period.  I think three months is long enough for the normal type of case.  There may be exceptional cases of the type to which the Deputy has referred.  In those cases, as Deputy Sweetman has mentioned, the Registrar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be amazed to hear, in my experience, three months is the exception at present, not the rule? I do not want to speak about my own profession but I do a substantial Land Registry business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be prepared to accept such a considered statement by the Deputy, naturally. As he knows himself, we have given a great deal of thought to the reorganisation of the Land Registry. Indeed, at one stage, we had arrived at the stage where delays were practically eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that is only one step.  That is where the Minister completely misses the point.  There are several steps, of which that is only one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is understood. As I said to the Incorporated Law Society, the provisions of this Bill will <Col N="1263" /> not be operated to extend the area of registration until we are adequately equipped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me give a practical case.  You close a sale to-day and you pay, for the purchaser, the purchase money in respect of a new house.  Having done that, you get it executed by the purchaser tomorrow. You send it to the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Local Government, for his certificate in order to qualify for the one per cent stamp duty.  I do not know what Deputy O'Higgins's experience in regard to this is but a substantial period elapses before you get it back.  When you get the certificate, it has to go for adjudication and a query may arise.  If a query does not arise, the stamp duty has to be assessed and paid.  The adjudication stamp has then to be impressed on it.  All that has to happen before it goes near the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>Even in the simplest case, where everything is absolutely crystal-clear and above board, half the Minister's period will be gone.  I can tell the Minister it is a matter of routine practice.  The real trouble, in relation to building estates, is mapping trouble. There is no difficulty in relation to the form of the words in the document to be registered.  It is the mapping difficulty that arises and I venture to say that, in the case of nine building estates out of ten, there is considerable difficulty in relation to the mapping, largely because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is overlooking is the fact that nowadays because of the taxation under the stamp duty code, there is a great deal of time-consuming work which has to be done before the deed can be stamped.  Under the Finance Acts, there is machinery for an application to the Land Commission to have non-nationals relieved in certain cases from paying the 25 per cent stamp <Col N="1267" /> duty.  That replaces the provision that used to be there under which a non-national was allowed to purchase purely residential property for residential purposes, if the property did not consist of land exceeding five acres, simply by giving a certificate to that effect, and he was thereupon relieved of the 25 per cent stamp duty.  That has been altered, and it is now necessary to go to the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>I assume the Land Commissioners apply the same principle because the legislature obviously did not intend to alter that situation.  But there is an obligation on the Land Commissioners to examine each case individually. They have to make certain inquiries. They have to satisfy themselves that the purchaser is not using this simply as a dodge, that he is not taking in a great number of different properties. Consequently, whenever an application is made, they issue a questionnaire and the answers to the questions have to be verified by the applicant by means of a statutory declaration.  The questionnaire is very comprehensive, requiring all sorts of details.  That has all to be examined by the Land Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I had occasion to complain of the long time it takes to get a decision on one of these applications.  While I have made that complaint, I appreciate that they are simply doing their work conscientiously.  The Legislature has imposed a particular obligation on them and they must discharge that obligation.  They cannot discharge it without making inquiries, and the inquiries necessarily take some time.  I would guess that in most cases, if not in all, in which it is necessary to seek a letter from the Land Commission, the three months will be up before the decision from the Land Commissioners is available or, if it is not up, certainly two-thirds of it will be gone.  It then has to go back to the Adjudication Office and the procedure Deputy Sweetman mentioned has to be gone through.  That will account for the remaining month, even if it only takes two months before the Land Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These cases occur every day.  I do <Col N="1268" /> not know the volume of work before the Land Commissioners in this respect, but I do know that it must be considerable.  That is all before the dealing can be even presented to the Land Registry for registration.  If the Minister would concede that six months is more realistic&mdash;and I assure him it is&mdash;I think the Bill would be improved, and as Deputy Sweetman said, it certainly would not do any harm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The only issue between us is whether the Registrar should have this discretion.  In the type of case which Deputy O'Higgins describes, let us assume it is seven months before all these formalities are settled, and the purchaser is in a position to make application for registration. He will make his application and then apply to the Registrar to extend the time.  He will explain why he cannot make the application within three months and he will, almost invariably, as a matter of course, provided some satisfactory reasons are advanced, get the extension he requires, and no difficulty will arise. We must assume the Registrar will act reasonably, and in the event of his acting unreasonably, the purchaser still has the right to apply to the court. We want to provide that where it is possible to apply within three months, the person will do so.  It is only where it is impossible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that he is going to impose very great difficulty and strain on legal practitioners. Ordinarily what happens is that a dealing is lodged with the Land Registry for registration and the solicitor lodging that dealing does not hear anything more about it until he gets notice saying the dealing is completed, <Col N="1269" /> except in a case where queries are raised by the Land Registry.  If I lodge a dealing for registration in the morning, I regard the case as closed unless I hear something from the Land Registry raising some query.  Suppose I do not hear from the Land Registry for four months.  Under the section, it is out.  The application to have the time extended should come presumably from the person who has lodged the dealing, and he does not know anything about it.  Will the Land Registry say to the solicitors: &ldquo;We want to give you warning that you have lodged a dealing and we have not got it registered.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, surely the Registrar would, of his own volition, grant an extension.  The section does not stipulate that an extension must be applied for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to direct the Minister's attention to another case.  He regards three months as being sufficient for the normal case, but he must take notice of the position, as indicated by Deputy Sweetman with regard to schemes of building development and building estates. In such a case, quite apart from the question of non-nationals&mdash;the case to which I have already referred&mdash;the ordinary procedure is that the intending purchaser enters into a building agreement and an agreement for a lease with his builder or developer. Generally speaking, once he has done that before the house is erected on the site, he is liable only for whatever stamp duty is attracted by the site fine and the ground rent imposed in the lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Adjudication Office must satisfy themselves in those circumstances as to what was the stage of erection of the house, not on the date of the lease, but on the date on which the contracting documents were entered into.  In order to satisfy themselves on that, they normally require the solicitors to obtain from the county council or the <Col N="1270" /> local authority a certificate showing the date of commencement.  It used to be a certificate showing the various dates of inspection of the building, foundation, roof level, and so on.  It takes some time to get that from the local authority.  I have had cases where it took several weeks to get that simple certificate from the local authority.  It is virtually an invariable requirement of the Adjudication Office in the case of building estates, and a month or eight weeks would be eaten up while waiting for that certificate.</P>
    <P>When you get the certificate, the officials in the Adjudication Office may still have some doubts.  They may look at the date of commencement as given on the local authority certificate, and compare it with the date on the contracting documents and the lease, and still be in doubt as to whether the house was erected, or substantially erected, on the date of the contracting documents.  They may write to the solicitor concerned and ask him to furnish a statutory declaration from the builder setting out the various stages of the development.  That also takes some time.  The builders have to look up their records to try to find out what stage the house had reached on particular dates; that has to be put in the form of a statutory declaration by the solicitor; and the matter is relodged in the Adjudication Office.  That would be a perfectly normal, unexceptional case.  It is not a case of a non-national, or anything else, so I think the Minister is misleading himself when he talks about three months being sufficient for the normal case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has delivered himself to me completely.  It is utterly impossible for the Minister to get anything like all his ten day streamlining in three months.  The Minister is not merely depending on the Land Registry as one entity under his control.  In addition, he has got to consider in these cases the local authority and the Land Commission. The Minister, as a Deputy representing a city constituency, had not much to do with the Land Commission. Those of us who represent rural constituencies do not regard the Department of Local Government as being synonymous with speed.  Had the Minister, as a Deputy, any experience of that Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Did he discover that speed and that Department were synonymous?  I am sure he did not. Apart from that, the Revenue Commissioners do deal with this problem very speedily.  However, it is just not practical in the year 1964 to have a three-month limit without a flood of extension orders by the Registrar.  Why put the Registrar to that trouble and why put people to the trouble of getting extension orders from him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister suggested the Registrar would give an automatic extension. I should be amazed if the Registrar took upon himself the responsibility of automatically extending anything that comes in for a period beyond the three months.  If he does not, it will mean a system of <Col N="1272" /> diarising for practitioners that it will be virtually impossible to keep without mistakes occurring.  There is no loophole in this section for the genuine mistake.  If there is a genuine mistake, there is no loophole at all here because the application must be made within the three months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me give the Minister an example.  These things should not happen but they occasionally happen in all offices&mdash;solicitors' offices, accountants' offices and everywhere else.  A small transfer is given to a clerk for stamping.  I say &ldquo;small&rdquo; because the money is given in ready money.  It is not stamped and the money unfortunately goes into his pocket instead of on to the deed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In order to cover up, that clerk hides the deed away in the papers and pretends he has lodged it for registration in the Land Registry.  After a while, the solicitor concerned, unless he keeps the most elaborate system of diarising, asks: &ldquo;What happened to that case? Why is it not through?&rdquo;  At present, we lodge documents and we hear nothing more until we get back the printed slip saying that the dealing is completed and that the registration is completed.  In such circumstances as I have mentioned, we ask: &ldquo;What happened to it?&rdquo;  and we find that the person concerned has not done what he was sent out to do and that the three months have gone.  I accept that solicitors are liable for the acts of their servants but there is no method of applying to the court because the three months' period has passed.</P>

The Registrar can extend the time for registration as long as he likes&mdash;12 months, two years, at his discretion.

      <P>In subsection (2), page 21, to add to the subsection &ldquo;but on registration the estate of the transferee in such land shall date from the date of such instrument.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When we were dealing with the previous amendments, the Minister referred to this question of the equitable estate in the land.  Dealing with transfers, subsection (1) of section 51 provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" /> Subject, in the case of a limited owner, to the Settled Land Acts, a registered owner of land may transfer the land or any part thereof, and the transferee shall be registered as owner of the land transferred. </P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides:</P>
    <P>There shall be executed on the transfer an instrument in the prescribed form, or in such other form as may appear to the Registrar to be sufficient to convey the land, but until the transferee is registered as owner of the land transferred, that instrument shall not operate to transfer the land. </P>
    <P>I do not know whether that was deliberate or not but, as a preliminary, I want to raise this query.  It concerns the phrase: &ldquo;any estate in the land.&rdquo; Is it deliberately designed to cut out the question of an equitable estate rather than a legal estate in the land?</P>

What I am saying is that on registration the estate of the transferee in such land shall date from the date of such instrument, not the question of his being registered as owner at all. You would have a ridiculous position arising otherwise.  Take the example I gave already.  If the Minister buys land from me, pays his money and gets his deed and then lodges it for registration and it is not registered for a couple of months, under the Minister's proposal here, he is not the owner of the land and has no estate in it.  I still have the estate in the land and I could sell that estate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>Section 52: in subsection (2), page 21, line 49, to delete &ldquo;it&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the registration shall carry a note to that effect and the transfer&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point involved here is simply to require that there shall be some note on the folio or the land certificate when a voluntary transfer is made. The Minister is probably aware that there is this difference between Land Registry titles and Registry of Deed titles.  Normally in a Registry of Deed title, the purchaser's solicitors are furnished with copies of documents for whatever period is prescribed in the contract and consequently they are in a position to examine that title. If the last deed on it is a voluntary deed, one without valuable consideration, and if the grantor were to die within three years, then the question of the liability of the property for <Col N="1281" /> death duties and estate duties would arise and the solicitor is on notice and will ask for a certificate in discharge of death duties from the Estate Duty Office and will allow his client to complete.</P>
    <P>But when you are dealing with Land Registry title, all you get is a copy of the land certificate or a copy of the folio.  You do not get copies of the deeds of transfer which have preceded the date of the contract.  Consequently the solicitor has no notice at all of whether or not the conveyance might have been a voluntary one.  I am suggesting in these two amendments that as the people who have the notice and knowledge of it are the Land Registry officials when the dealings are presented to them for registration, they should indicate by a note on the folio what the position is.  I do not think there would be any great difficulty for them and I should think it would be a considerable ease to the minds of many practitioners and their clients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very largely a theoretical matter from my point of view.  I understand it was the practice in former times to put such a note on the folio but this practice disappeared about 40 years ago on the instructions of the then Registrar, who, I am also led to believe, was one of the greatest authorities on all these matters.  In his opinion, any question of how the owner became registered is no concern of the purchaser.</P>

      <P>The point is quite a simple one.  As I understand the position, if there is a voluntary transfer of property and the donor dies within three years, then estate duties will attach to the property.  The duty can be recovered by the Revenue Commissioners but unless there is some notice of that on the folio, neither the purchaser nor his solicitor will know about it at the time the contract is placed.  He can raise his requisition on title later and may be blandly told: &ldquo;This is so&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>As Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, if we were to accept these amendments, it would mean that the statutory prohibitions against alienation would have to be noted on the register and, if they were not so noted, they would be inoperative.  I am told that, as a matter of practice, statutory prohibitions against alienation are always entered on the register. However, in a number of cases transactions in contravention of the prohibition are declared void by the relevant statute.  For that reason, it is necessary to continue the provision that these prohibitions shall affect registered land without being registered. If we did not do this, a transaction which is in contravention of a statutory prohibition would be validated by registration where the prohibition was inadvertently omitted from the register.</P>

      <P>Under section 59, the Minister is imposing a definite <Col N="1285" /> obligation on the Registrar, with which I agree, that he should note any restrictive or prohibitive provision on the folio.  If the Registrar falls down on that and does not do it, it is abundantly clear that anyone buying land and inspecting the folio, with the knowledge that this section is here and that there is an obligation on the Registrar to show these restrictive provisions, and seeing they are not shown on it, must assume there are no restrictive or prohibitive provisions. On that understanding, he then enters into a contract to purchase land, possibly for the purpose of building development.  He does so, quite secure in the belief that he can develop that land without any prohibition or restrictive condition imposed by any Act of Parliament in relation to that land.</P>
      <P>When he gets his transfer and succeeds in getting himself registered, he then proceeds to develop the land as a building site, and the Land Commission step in and say: &ldquo;You are not entitled to do this because under such-and-such an Act, you may not subdivide or sublet without our permission.&rdquo; He does not know anything about that until then.  He has paid his money, got his deed and had himself registered.  He then finds that because of a slip in the Land Registry, he has been completely misled.  I see the Minister's point of view but I should like to know from the Minister how it is proposed to deal with such a situation.</P>

      <P>I am talking very much in regard to the Land Registry.  Surely one would normally expect that the land certificate would be held by the owner of a charge? What the Minister is doing here is contrary to what I certainly would regard as a normal provision.  I speak subject to correction on this but, to my mind, if the owner of registered land wants to create a charge in respect of the land certificate by way of equitable deposit in the bank, or anything like that, it is quite an ordinary thing to do.  Why should the owner of the charge, whether he be a registered owner or not, not be entitled to hold the land certificate?  If the owner of a charge by way of equitable deposit is entitled to hold the certificate, why should the owner of a registered charge, perhaps a very substantial registered charge, not be entitled to hold it?</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister that it does.  I think the Minister, in addition to talking without any very great knowledge of the particular subject, is also misreading the amendment which I have put down.  It is subsection (2) of this section that I am opposed to.  Subsection (2) provides that even if both sides are agreeable that the registered owner should hold the land certificate, that cannot be done.  I am not objecting to subsection (1) which reads:</P>
      <P>The registered owner of a charge shall not, merely by reason of his being such owner, be entitled to the possession of the land certificate in respect of the registered land which is subject to the charge. </P>
      <P>But subsection (2) goes on to say:</P>
      <P>Every stipulation in relation to a registered charge on land (whether made before or after the creation of the charge) whereby the custody of the land certificate in respect of such land is to be given to the registered owner of such charge shall be void. </P>
      <P>Even if both parties agree with their eyes open that for the greater security of the owner of the registered charge he is to hold the land certificate, that cannot be done.</P>

I believe there is greater security but, whether for that reason or any other reason, if the two people with their eyes open and with full legal advice agree that the owner of the charge is to hold the land certificate, the Minister says, for no apparent reason, he cannot do it.  What is the object of this?</P>

      <P>I should like to warn the Minister that if he persists with subsection (2), he may make things extremely difficult for people who want to buy their houses through building societies, for example.  He may find this being quoted as precluding the building society from requiring that, if the house is registered land, the land certificate should be handed over to them as registered owners of a mortgage and he may find building societies' solicitors saying that in those circumstances they will not advise the building societies to advance money on registered land.</P>

Both sides agree to that. The Minister now says that that is void and that it will not be allowed after this.  It seems to me that the natural result of that will be that in cases where, either because they think they have not great security or for any other reason that they may regard as valid, for example, if they feel that there might be difficulty about realising on that security or anything else, they will be very reluctant to lend money on those conditions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred earlier to the arrangement on 19th February last and the Minister asked me if I could name the section I required recommitted. It is this section.  The arrangement <Col N="1294" /> was that if any section required recommittal, we could recommit it.  On this section, my whole difficulty in relation to compulsory registration relates to urban areas and to mapping problems.  I should like to refer to the Minister's explanatory memorandum issued with the Bill.  It refers to this section which, it says, deals with the maps to be kept in the central office for registration purposes.  It goes on:</P>
      <P>In practice much of the mapping effected in the Land Registry since 1891 is on maps which have become out-of-date.  Furthermore, in the case of some holdings, photo-mapping was used as an emergency measure at one stage. </P>
      <P>As I understand it, the significance of that is that in photo-mapping scale does not necessarily correspond.  The Minister's memorandum goes on:</P>
      <P>Again, in the case of certain building sites it is not possible to show the necessary detail on the available Ordnance Survey Maps and, accordingly, the architects' maps furnished on application for registration have had to be used for the purpose.  Subsection (3) is designed to validate the practice which has had to be adopted in the Land Registry in such cases. </P>
      <P>Subsection (3) is an entirely new subsection and it is the legislative permission for the practice that has grown up. We are all aware that in the mapping section of the Land Registry the greatest difficulties arise.  Delay in obtaining Land Registry maps is at present of the greatest dimensions.  The reason for it is that there is not sufficient staff and that the maps there, in the Minister's words, are in many cases entirely out of date.  Apart from the maps themselves, the Minister may not be aware that in country areas you will find you cannot read the maps because of their condition.  They have become so frail and so worn in certain places that they are quite unreadable and it seems to me that where that is so, it would be of very great benefit to bring these maps properly up to date before tackling the general job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regardless of that, in rural areas the <Col N="1295" /> task is capable of fulfilment.  However, I came across a case the other day where I found it was possible to read the maps through reconstruction from a key which can be had on payment of a fee.  In that way I got what I wanted and a great deal more cheaply, I might say, than if I had spent my own time or the time of my staff on it. I got an excellent job done on payment of the fee.  That was in a rural area and the map had got wrinkled and impossible, otherwise, of verification.</P>
    <P>When we come to urban areas, the situation is entirely different.  The plain fact of the matter is that the basic system of mapping which we have in the Land Registry is totally and entirely unsuited to urban areas.  We have not got in urban areas throughout the country an adequate basis of mapping suitable for re-mapping all the titles necessary for the compulsory registration of urban areas, as this Bill provides.  The 25-inch map will not do it.  Subsection (3) is the proof it will not do it and cannot do it.  If the existing Ordnance Survey maps were adequate for the job, there would not be any necessity for subsection (3).</P>
    <P>There was an amendment put down by Deputy O'Higgins, which the Minister treated with scant courtesy, that urban areas should be excluded.  I know the exclusion of urban areas would spoil the homogeneous nature of the Minister's plan.  The fact is that it is not within the Minister's competence, nor within the competence of the Land Registry, to provide a scheme of registration for the urban areas until, first, there has been a re-mapping of urban areas on an entirely different scale.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the Minister has allowed what is undoubtedly a blot on his Bill to remain, because in other respects the general movement towards registration in rural areas is a desirable move, particularly when the amount of freehold registered land in rural areas is so microscopic compared with the number of cases where compulsory registration has been going through under the Land Acts.  The whole effect of section 84 will be that in urban areas <Col N="1296" /> we shall have, not an easy system, but a chaotic system.  We are trying to do a job which is not capable of being done.</P>
    <P>In relation to the vast majority of registered land, a job has been done on that initially by the surveyors for the owners and then a substantial verification of that survey, not on the maps but on the land, by the Land Commission surveying officials.  As it went through the Land Commission Court, the effect of the application of that map to the task of the Land Commission has been that a great many imperfections have been ruled out. Although the boundaries are not binding, by and large they are right.  You get the odd case where the boundaries are not as accurate as one would wish. All this will mean that you will have in urban areas a vast addition of registered land on maps that are not good enough for the purpose.  You are going to get one architect for one housing estate putting in a map to one scale and in one manner and another architect for another housing estate putting in a map on a different basis. Instead of getting what the Minister wants&mdash;an easy method of getting the picture of the titles in an urban area&mdash; he will get exactly the reverse, one that will be much more confusing and much more open to mistakes.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister wanted to gallop before he was able to walk.  It seemed clear to me that the mapping situation was such that the method we have adopted heretofore in the Land Registry was not adequate.  The Minister would have been wiser to have taken all his rural land and brought in compulsory registration virtually at once.  He could do it.  If urban areas were excluded&mdash; when I talk of &ldquo;urban areas&rdquo;, I am not necessarily talking in terms of the Local Government Act of 1898; I am talking of built-up areas&mdash;the rest of the picture could have been completed fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>Now, however, we shall have a situation in which the map in relation to any urban area will be virtually no use.  In a situation in relation to urban titles where there are two flats in a house, it will be difficult, if not <Col N="1297" /> impossible, to show that on the same map.  You are going to have to have in a very small space on the map the registration, perhaps, of half a dozen different interests and indexing on the map will be virtually impossible.  The whole system or registration fails completely unless one is able to go down to the Land Registry, pick up the map, look at the place on the map in respect of which one wishes to find the owner, trace that place and, by going to the index, see who is the registered owner of folio No.  So-and-So. In urban areas, it will be impossible to do so.  So long as it is so impossible, the task of the registration of urban areas is not going to achieve anything. In fact, it will make the system more confusing than it is already in the case of unregistered land.</P>
    <P>I must confess I am one of those people who like on every possible occasion for any deed, be it for registration or otherwise, to try to get a map on that deed.  It saves immense trouble.  If I have not a map on one of the earlier deeds of conveyance, I try to get a new map.  I try to describe my parcels with reference to that map. But the map in relation to which my description is made is a map that has been made, not on paper, but on the spot.  That is one place where section 84 will completely fall down, because it visualises that the Land Registry in relation to urban areas will be built up on a system of maps not verified by any Land Registry officials on the spot, as the rural areas were verified by the surveyors for the Land Commission. That will be one of the fundamental failures in relation to this Bill.  So long as the Minister keeps the method he has adopted in this system, he will find that discrepancies will grow and grow, and he will have in relation to those discrepancies very considerable difficulties in the future.</P>
    <P>I happened to know a case in which I was asked to intervene as a Deputy, not a case in which I was dealing professionally, where a builder down the country&mdash;he alleged it was through one person's mistake and somebody else said it was through another's&mdash; had slightly diverged from the original <Col N="1298" /> plan.  In fact, when you looked at the original plan produced for the Land Registry, it was impossible for anyone to tell the divergencies because the scale was much too small.  The scale in relation to all Ordnance Survey maps would be much too small.  It took something like nine months in circuit court cases to rectify six folios and, pending that rectification, in five cases, documents were held up for nine months.  It was somebody's mistake perhaps&mdash;not anybody's fault in the ordinary sense of the term.  It just arose from the fact that the scale was too small to cope with the problem. The Minister will find that is fundamental to the problem of registering titles in an urban area.</P>
    <P>Imagine a plot in O'Connell Street and what it will look like even on the 25-inch scale.  It may not be desirable, but, in fact, I know of one plot, a reasonably sized shop in O'Connell Street, where there are eleven different interests, one above the other.  I do not say it is desirable.  I do not think it is, but they are there, and it will not be possible on any of the existing ordnance maps to find room to put eleven different references to its folios. You will have to adopt a most cumbersome scheme of coding in which you nearly want a deciphering expert to discover when you look at a folio what the exact mapping characteristic in the Land Registry is, because of the different interests concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister has completely ignored the fact that in relation to rural land, the fundamental reason for registering land was that there was to be one interest and only one interest.  Leaving out the executions of mines and minerals and leaving out spoiling rights, there is only one interest in rural land and there is no superior interest in land that is registered as such because these varying interests have been redeemed in the Court of the Land Commission.  It was because the superior interests were redeemed in the Court of the Land Commission that the whole system of the registry of land under the 1891 Act became successful.  Indeed, the Minister is trying to short-circuit it and is trying to do something that is quite impossible <Col N="1299" /> in our circumstances here.  Instead of making a register that will be not merely complete but easy to understand and clear, he is going to emerge with something for an urban area that will make confusion worse confounded in what otherwise might be quite a good Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to make it clear that this Bill will not of itself extend compulsory registration to any single area in the country. It merely gives us a legislative basis on which we can proceed step by step to extend compulsory registration.  I have already said on a number of occasions, in the course of discussions in the House on this Bill, that we will not extend compulsory registration provisions to any area until we are satisfied that we can cope with the situation which will result from such action.  Of course the mapping situation will be one of the very important factors which we will keep in mind in deciding whether or not to extend compulsory registration to any particular area.  I am told, first of all, in regard to this country, that there are a number of urban areas for which adequate maps exist and, furthermore, that in some towns, like Thurles, for instance, the majority of the premises in the town are already registered in the Land Registry.  In London, of course, they seem to have got over the difficulties to which Deputy Sweetman has referred and which he regards as insuperable.  I am told that in London at the moment this system of registration of urban property works satisfactorily and well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, there are properties in Dublin which are at present registered in the Land Registry.  The reconstruction of the existing Land Registry maps, which I agree with Deputy Sweetman are to some extent defective, is proceeding and we have in operation at the present time an arrangement for a survey of the whole position in regard to these maps and an expert study of the situation.  We will, of course, only introduce compulsory registration in urban areas when we are satisfied that suitable maps of a sufficiently large scale are available.  We <Col N="1300" /> are in touch with the Ordnance Survey people about this whole problem.  We have their expert advice at our disposal and, from what we can gather, there is, at this stage at any rate, no grounds for believing that any insuperable difficulties will arise, provided of course we proceed in a sane and rational manner and do not extend compulsory registration to any area until we are satisfied we have the mapping facilities and resources to take it on.  It is also accepted Government policy that the whole country should be re-surveyed within the next 10-15 years.  That process of re-surveying will be going on side by side, I hope, with our gradual expansion of compulsory registration throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I want again to reassure Deputies in regard to this Bill that we are not going to rush into anything.  We are not going to impose on the Land Registry machinery a burden which it cannot bear.  We must be satisfied, on the administrative side, on the mapping side and in all directions, that we can proceed to extend the provisions of the Bill to any particular area, whether urban or otherwise.  If we have the capacity to take on an urban area for which suitable large-scale maps are already in existence, I do not see why we should not attempt to do so as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he was foolish enough to refer to the practice in London and the London registration. Does the Minister know how development work is done in urban areas in the Land Registry in England?  Does he know that the basis of mapping there is that the Ordnance Survey people revise every three months while a development is going through <Col N="1301" /> and that the maps in relation to the building development area in England are brought up not by the developer himself putting in a map which fits into the Ordnance Survey as such but the developer putting up a map which the Ordnance Survey revise on the spot not less than once every three months after the development work has started.  If and when the Minister is able to tell me that the Ordnance Survey here has been so staffed as to enable that to be done, then there might be some point in his quoting the London system to us but, until such time as that is the position, he would, I think, be wiser not to quote the London system.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Justice if he will state as at the latest available date in respect of land registered <Col N="1302" /> under the Registration of Title Acts the number of current folios in each (a) county, excluding urban areas, (b) borough, and (c) urban area and the estimated number of holdings which are not registered in (a), (b) and (c) respectively. </P>
    <P>I got the information in regard to (a), (b) and (c).  I was bound to get it but, at the end of his reply, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I have no information which would enable me to formulate an estimate of the number of unregistered holdings. </P>
    <P>That clearly showed that the Minister did not consider the problem at all before he brought in this Bill because anybody bringing in a Bill of this nature would have taken steps to ensure that he understood and appreciated the size of the problem with which he was dealing.</P>

      <P>That is an unworthy suggestion.  We do not envisage anything will happen overnight.  We envisage a gradual elimination of the Registry of Deeds and the extension of compulsory registration over 15, 20 or 25 years.  The procedure envisaged is that an area will be taken and considered to see whether it is feasible to extend compulsory registration to it. It will be done step by step, carefully and, I hope, intelligently.  As I said earlier, we will not create a situation in which overnight all the premises in a particular area will be thrown into the lap of the Land Registry.  Registration will become compulsory only when there are new dealings involving premises in that area.  The process will be a gradual one.</P>

      <P>In page 35, line 13, before &ldquo;entitled&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;absolutely&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The point here is in relation to liens which may affect deeds.  Section 94 provides:</P>
      <P>Where&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  an application is made for the registration of an owner of land, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> (b)  the Registrar has occasion, in the course of his duties, to investigate the title to registered land or to a burden on registered land,  </P>
    <P>if any person has in his possession or custody any deeds, wills or instruments affecting the title, to the production of which the applicant or any trustee for him is entitled or the production of which the Registrar considers, on any such occasion, to be necessary for the purpose of such investigation, the Registrar may require that person to show cause, within a time limited, why he should not produce such deeds, wills, or instruments, or any of them; and, unless cause is shown to the satisfaction of the Registrar within the time limited, he may order that the deeds, wills or instruments, or any of them shall be produced at the expense of the applicant, at such time and place, and in such manner, and on such terms as he thinks fit. </P>
    <P>The Minister is probably aware that, from time to time, it does happen that a client owes a solicitor for costs and the solicitor is entitled to retain the deeds of that client in his possession and have a lien on them until his costs are discharged.  As this section is worded, it seems to me it could impinge on a very longstanding legal position in relation to liens of this sort. I feel sure the Minister did not intend that that should be the effect of this section.  The suggestions I make in my amendments are designed to clarify the position and to make it clear that these powers, so far as they relate to the requirement to produce or show cause why documents should not be produced, should apply only in cases where there is no lien affecting them. I suggest the insertion of the qualification &ldquo;absolutely&rdquo; so that the section will read &ldquo;if any person has in his possession or custody any deeds, wills or instruments affecting the title, to the production of which the applicant or any trustee for him is absolutely entitled....&rdquo;  The Minister may want time to consider this further.  I urge on him that, if he is not satisfied with my amendments, he should himself <Col N="1305" /> bring in some amendments on the same lines to meet the point I have raised.</P>

It is not the intention that the Registrar should be in a position to compel the production of documents where they are held subject to a lien or encumbrances.  That is the existing practice, of course.  The very fact that a person can show that he has a lien on documents will be sufficient cause for the Registrar to indicate that they need not be produced to him.</P>

      <P>I want some explanation from the Minister in relation to section 100, which enables trustees to apply to the court for directions and provides for the award of costs which may be finally ascertained and declared by the Registrar.

      <P>The Taxing Masters are there, in any event.  I do not know to what extent the Registrar may already have a function in this regard.  The Minister says he has, and I accept that, but if he has it already, that does not alter the validity of the point I am making.  For all I know, he may have had it before the office of Taxing Master came into being.  At any rate, the position now is that the <Col N="1306" /> Taxing Masters are obviously the proper persons to deal with the question of costs, and if the Registrar has power, I do not see any reason why that power should be continued.  I suggest to the Minister that he should accept this amendment which involves the deletion of the last 2½ lines of subsection (2).</P>

      <P>We are dealing with trustees here, and it has always been the position that, in a case of this sort coming before him, the Registrar could assess the costs and determine them.  Unless Deputy O'Higgins can persuade me that there is some very valid and sound reason why the existing practice should be changed, I am in favour of leaving it as it is.  It has worked well, and there have been no grounds for complaint.  I think it would be a bit of an imposition to make people go to the Taxing Master rather than have the costs settled by the Registrar.  I am all for making life easy for people.</P>

      <P>When I was speaking on this Estimate last Wednesday, I made it clear that, in my view, some substantial changes were required if the services provided by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were to be such as would accord with what is needed in modern times.  In my criticism of the present situation, I made it fairly clear that I regarded a new and radical approach as being urgently necessary.  I also made it clear that, in my criticism, I did not desire to imply that I had ever received anything but the utmost courtesy from the officials of the Department.  I want to make it quite clear now, in case anyone thinks otherwise, that in putting it that way, I was not in any way implying that I received any discourtesy from the Minister himself.  On the contrary.  If courtesy alone were the mark of efficiency, the Minister and his officials would be entitled to claim that theirs was the most efficient Department.  Unfortunately, efficiency involves more than courtesy and, as I said already, unless we have a really efficient means of communication in these days, we will not be able to achieve the greater production, and the economic growth, which both sides of the House urgently desire to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It so happens that last night I was at a meeting in Kildare and I put to that meeting the criticisms I had made here last week of the telephone system in so far as it affects my constituency. I repeated the criticism I had made here of the trunk line between Naas <Col N="1308" /> and Dublin, and in that I include the satellite exchanges in Newbridge and Kildare.  As I said, people have the greatest difficulty and must dial repeatedly to get the number they require. I came across what I think was one of the most amusing examples which I have yet met.  A subscriber in Kildare told the meeting that he dialled a Dublin number and instead of getting that Dublin number he got Liverpool.  A subscriber in Celbridge told the meeting he had dialled a number in Naas on 11 occasions without getting any result at all, much less getting the right number.</P>
    <P>I am afraid it is a fact that however accurately the telephone system may work in its own exchange in Kildare, when it comes to getting a Dublin number through the trunk dialling system, it does not work properly.  It is virtually impossible to get a number from the Celbridge group of numbers through the Naas, Newbridge and Kildare dialling systems, the first time. I have experience only of what I have to do myself.  I find, in relation to my constituency, that since the fault was found in the Newbridge exchange, local calls can now be got reasonably accurately.  However, it is not an exaggeration to say that if we get one out of three calls correct, dialling up to Dublin, it is about all one can get and that, across the county, the average is very much worse.  That was the experience of a cross-section at a meeting last night of between 60 and 70 people, all of whom have regular occasion to use the telephone.</P>
    <P>Human error does sometimes come into it and one cannot grumble too much about that when it falls down. A few days ago, I was endeavouring to dial my own home from here.  After half a dozen shots and having failed, I rang the exchange and I asked the man who answered me if he would please give me 0457200.  I said that I had dialled it six times and could not get any dialling at all.  The man replied: &ldquo;Of course, you cannot.  There is no such number.&rdquo;  It happens to be my own number at home.  I thought I would be a reasonably good judge of what my number is.  It shows that there must be some fairly widespread <Col N="1309" /> confusion in the telephone exchange system that I could get such an answer that there was not any such number when, in fact, I should have thought everybody in ordinary life would know that there would be four digits and the 045 prefix as well.  I do not know what the explanation of that is.  I am quite certain that the man concerned did not say it out of pure stubbornness or to annoy me or to prevent me from getting the number.  It showed that the organisation in the Exchange was not such as it should be.</P>
    <P>Now, we shall have to pay substantially more for telephone calls. The burden of my objection in relation to these increased charges is that every Minister in the Government, particularly the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, are going out and saying, and properly saying, that increased costs must be absorbed as far as possible by greater productivity. But the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs takes the easy course merely of slapping on increases in costs in the very way that his colleagues are advising, and correctly advising, it should not be done.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also, I must say, speaking immediately after the Budget, gave away his Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in a very unfortunate manner for the Minister.  On the day following the Budget, the Taoiseach announced that the Minister was then going to look into the matter to see what new procedures could be initiated. I want to make it clear that in my view the Minister should have been looking at this for months.  Everybody knew, from the beginning of December last, that the ninth round was coming and that methods of productivity to offset to some degree ninth round increases were necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister was doing from the beginning of December onwards but the Taoiseach has put it on the records of the House that the Minister was doing nothing until 15th April.  I must confess that I imagine there have rarely been cases before when a Taoiseach showed so clearly that he had found out a Minister <Col N="1310" /> failing in his duty to such an extent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The words of the Taoiseach are crystal clear that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was going, then, to initiate an examination of the problem.  I want to say clearly to the Minister that if he was only going, then, to initiate an examination of the problem he was not doing his job and, if the Taoiseach was wrong in that phrasology, he was not, as a Minister should, keeping his boss acquainted with what was transpiring. But, regardless of whether or not it was done, it has been stated categorically that it was not and the very system that was strongly advocated by the Minister's colleagues in Government has not been adopted by him in relation to the postal and telephone systems.  I must confess it is not out of keeping either with another matter that occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here in my hands the commercial accounts for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for the year ending 31st March, 1962.  I admit I did not inquire today but I did inquire last Wednesday and last Wednesday I was told that these two years' old commercial accounts are the last accounts that the Department have produced.  They may have produced those for another year since last Wednesday&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but I inquired a week ago and a week ago I was told that the accounts for 1961-62 I have in my hands are the last accounts published.  It seems to me pretty much an indication of an out of date concept if accounts can only be produced two years, or thereabouts, <Col N="1311" /> after they are due.  Perhaps that is an exaggeration because the accounts for which I would look are now 14 months overdue.  The accounts in respect of the year ending 31st March, 1963, should surely be ready for discussion by the Dáil in May, 1964, 14 months after the period has closed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley is an experienced person in commercial affairs.  Does he know of any single commercial undertaking in this city where the accounts of that commercial undertaking are not produced 14 months after the year has closed?  Of course, he does not. There is not any such commercial undertaking in the city where accounts are not available for a period of 14 months.  Indeed, if there were, the Companies Act of 1963 which the Minister for Industry and Commerce brought in would have that company in serious trouble because the company is bound to hold a meeting once every 12 months and one of the statutory duties of the annual meeting is to consider the previous year's accounts. If, therefore, the criticisms that we make of the position in relation to the Post Office and its subsidiary account, the Telephone Account, are out of date, the person responsible for that is the Minister who does not think it desirable or worthwhile, or possible, to publish a more up-to-date account.</P>
    <P>Looking at this financial analysis, I may say in passing, giving praise where it is due, that although this may be two years old, it is a valuable book and the method by which the financial analysis is presented is definitely worthwhile.  The tragedy is that it is not up-to-date and that we cannot therefore draw the deductions for the up-to-date picture that we should like to have.  The financial analysis of the telephone service on pages 32 and 33 show that in 1961-62 there was increased business on the telephone account of £437,000.  The expenditure increase in that year was £582,000.  Of that expenditure increase, pay awards for existing personnel appear to have come to £147,000. Additional staff costs were £72,000.  I presume these were for further personnel to service the increased business. Other increases accounted for <Col N="1312" /> £86,000 and there was a sum of £277,000 for capital charges.</P>
    <P>I am not clear, and find it difficult to ascertain from these accounts, what those capital charges are.  Are they sinking fund as well as interest charges or merely interest charges?  On what basis are the capital charges, so-called here, brought into the account? Over what period of years is the depreciation of the system brought in for sinking fund purposes.  Over what life has the equipment been amortised? In these commercial accounts, apart from ordinary accounts, is the picture one of sinking fund provision based on the capital as borrowed or is it based on the material as provided for it?  Does it provide for increased costs and for the undoubted fact that unfortunately replacement charges are bound to be higher than existing installation costs?</P>
    <P>It appears in the two-year-old picture that increased business was not able to meet the cost.  Was an evaluation made of whether, by still further providing for increased business, the income could catch up on expenditure or was it the case that the outrun of expenditure over income had reached such a pitch that it was inevitable for the future that such expenditure would outweight income?</P>
    <P>On page 34, there is a similar financial analysis of the manner in which each £ of income and each £ of expenditure was received and paid in that year.  What is the change in the picture since then?  What will be the change in the picture as a result of the new increases by which business lines will now go up from £3 10s. per quarter and the charge for private subscribers' lines will also be increased?  Will it be the position that for every £1 of income in subscriber rentals, there will still be about 5/3d.?  One cannot prognosticate exactly but I want to know whether the balance thrown up here in this two-year-old analysis still remains the balance and whether it will be altered as a result of the new charges which have so unfortunately been thrust upon us by the Minister?  What in 1964-65 will be ratio of expenditure on salaries and wages out of each £1? In 1961-62, the ratio was approximately <Col N="1313" /> 7/9d.  Where did we stand in 1963-64 and where will we stand in that respect in the current year?</P>
    <P>I mentioned depreciation.  I notice that 4/6d. in the £ was being set aside for depreciation.  Is that depreciation based on material or is it merely something based on the terms of the loan made available for capital development?  A general study of these commercial accounts makes one wonder where the development of the services under the Minister's command is leading and whether he realises that the services for which he is charging us can be a brake on progress or can accelerate it.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions I remember discussing a very trifling aspect of the postal and telegraph services, the issue of stamps.  I said I was amazed to discover some 30 years thereafter that the Department was still running on a dictum of a famous gentleman who was head of the Department in 1927 and that they had not changed from that dictum and that their outlook was the same as when the 1927 dictum was given in relation to stamp issues. What worries me is that in other respects also we have not moved on from there and there is the danger that because of that neglect to move, we shall find our communications, destroyed in respect of railways as they are by the Minister for Transport and Power, will be delayed and charged out of recognition by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only now when this section has been debated at length that its provisions are becoming known in the country.  I want to appeal again to the Minister for Lands to introduce some commonsense and <Col N="1314" /> intelligence into this section.  The section is objectionable, unreasonable and I feel it is unconstitutional.  Within the past few days, I received a deputation from the Central Executive of the NFA and they asked that their views on the section be made known. They oppose it very strongly and they feel it interferes with the rights of ownership of land.</P>
      <P>It does interfere with those rights as we can see if we look at the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the Bill.  It says: &ldquo;Section 12 provides that the subdivision, letting and subletting of all agricultural land in the State shall be subject to Land Commission consent.&rdquo;  Further to that, if we read the first few lines of the section we find that &ldquo;an agricultural holding shall not be let, sublet or subdivided without the consent in writing of the Land Commission&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum goes on to state: &ldquo;It is intended as a global provision taking the place of the unsatisfactory patch-work of control operating under existing enactments which are listed for repeal in the First Schedule.&rdquo;  Members of this House do not realise the seriousness of this matter.  We have asked the Minister to write into the Bill that conacre lettings, agistment and lettings for a temporary convenience be excluded from the terms of the section.  That is all we want.  Why is the Minister remaining so silent?</P>

Members do not realise the serious consequences which would follow the passing of this section.  It is all very fine for the Minister to assure the House that conacre lettings and other such lettings are excluded but, as has been pointed out, if legal proceedings are instituted in any case it will be no use going into court and telling the learned judge that the Minister for Lands said <Col N="1315" /> in the Dáil that conacre lettings, sub-lettings, agistment and other temporary lettings were excluded from the terms of the Bill because the judge will only be concerned with what is written into the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do. The Minister has had time to consider the implications of this section.  Bearing in mind that every landowner is opposed to it and bearing in mind that he is depriving landowners of the right of fixity of tenure and the right to do as they wish with their property, I feel that this is the thin edge of the wedge for the introduction of a Communistic type of legislation and those of us who realise the seriousness of interfering with private property should not be reluctant to speak out.  The Minister has remained silent and has not convinced the House of the need for such a provision.  I am asking him to drop the idea and to amend the section in view of the appeals made to him by the farming community and those familiar with conditions in rural Ireland, who know the feelings in rural Ireland and know the manner in which landowners can be aggravated by interfering with their rights, rights which they have won dearly and cherish very much.  I would appeal to him to come to his senses and see that this objectionable section is removed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In what way will section 12 help in the relief of congestion? The Minister will probably use the stereotyped reply that because the question of letting, or the definition of letting never arose, that it does not apply now to conacre, or the letting of meadows or agistment, but it is no harm to remind the House that once this Bill is passed, with its present wording, that will no longer apply. From now on, no matter what the law was in the past, whether common law or statute law, because the Minister has written it into the section, letting is now definitely put in and, as has been pointed out, any judge trying a case will not read what the Minister <Col N="1316" /> or what I said about it but he will read the Act and I am afraid he can only come to one conclusion and that is that letting of any kind is prohibited except by the permission of the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>Again, I should like to ask the Minister in what way, if the Minister is serious in his intention to relieve congestion and bring small farms up to 45 acres, does it help him to do that?  If he can point that out to me, I shall not say another word about this section and I shall withdraw my objection to it.  As I said on a previous occasion, there are good parts in the Bill but this is a very bad provision, whoever slipped it in, whether it was the Minister or somebody else, and I shall not hesitate to speak out about it.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an unwarranted and impertinent interference with the farmer's rights to do what he likes with his own property.  One would imagine the farmers were out to sabotage the country or to plunge the country into misery that they are regimented and browbeaten in this way. Our fathers and grandfathers fought a fierce battle to achieve the position we are in today of owning our own land.  One of the first things about ownership is that a man may do what he likes with what he owns, provided it is not against the common good or against the law.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a member of the legal profession.  If some other body tried to bring in a law circumscribing the members of the legal profession as the farmers are being circumscribed in this Bill, I wonder how would he take it.  There is one question to which I want an answer: in what way will this help the relief of congestion about which the Minister has so much talk?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In any reply which the Minister gave to the arguments put up to him on this section, I understood him to state the section was for the purpose of procuring more land, of ensuring there would be sufficient land to deal with the congestion that exists in different parts of the country.  I do not think there is any foundation at all for that.  Apart from the fact that I agree <i>in toto</i> with what <Col N="1317" /> Deputy Blowick, Deputy Flanagan and others have said, that it cuts across the freedom of the individual, I do not know why land owners should be treated in this manner.  Any other property owner is entitled to do what he likes with his property.</P>
      <P>The Irish Land Commission were created for the purpose of giving the people land, as far as possible, and giving them security and fixity of tenure. There are many instances in which it is necessary to let farms.  I understand the mind of the Minister in introducing this Bill was that he believed he was going to create a land revolution in the west of Ireland, that he was going to confer considerable benefits on those who live in that area where the majority of congests exist. Surely this is not the right way to go about it?</P>
      <P>As the Minister must know, many people, due to economic circumstances, have emigrated from the west of Ireland, as they have from many other parts of the country.  Although they have been forced to emigrate because they are not in a position to carry on economically on the small holding, that holding is possibly as dear to them as is the property of any other owner in the State.  Very often the land has been in the possession of the family for generations.  Under this section if they find it incumbent on them for economic reasons to emigrate and to seek employment elsewhere, and they want to let the land, instead of doing what they did before, going to an auctioneer, as they should be entitled to do under a free Constitution, to sell that land, they must inform the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What puzzles me about this&mdash;I am sure it puzzles many other people, too, because the Minister must know there is tremendous opposition to this section and the section which we shall be discussing later&mdash;is that foreigners can come in and buy land and not be asked to go to the Land Commission and register there.  An Irish citizen, if he wishes to let his land, must trot along to Merrion Street and inform the Minister and his officials what he intends to do.  In the glorious redistribution <Col N="1318" /> of land envisaged in this Bill, this unfortunate person from the west of Ireland or from County Cavan, Deputy Dolan's area, where the farms are not so big and the farmers not so rich, will find his farm seized by the Land Commission and handed over to his neighbour.  That is the system embodied in this Land Bill from beginning to end, as far as I can read it.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on the Minister to explain to the House what exactly is in his mind in this section, why it has come about that he is introducing legislation like this which is contrary to the ordinary principles of freedom. There seems to be a great advance in State control generally these days, but when State control is advocated, it is for a specific purpose.  The Minister says the purpose of this is to enable him to get more land, to enable him to deal with the situation of congests as a whole.  This House is entitled to a full explanation as to how he believes that will operate, how he believes this will enable smallholders, not only in his own part of the world but throughout the country, to benefit.</P>
    <P>On the question of there being any difficulty on the part of the Land Commission in getting land, there is none in the wide earthly world.  The Land Commission have today more land than they are able to deal with.  In fact, as I ascertained in reply to questions, in my own county, the Land Commission are doing the very thing they do not want the ordinary tenant farmer, the person who owns a farm, to do.  The Land Commission are letting land and they are not letting it for three months or six months but for two years.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question I asked recently in this House as to the amount of land held by the Land Commission in my constituency, I was told it was somewhere in the neighbourhood of 1,500 acres, and the Minister hurriedly said they had distributed 850 acres since 1962.  This is now 1964.  He did not say what the Land Commission are doing with the land they had on hands. I can tell him.  They are doing the same thing as the Minister is endeavouring to stop the farmer who owns the land from doing.  Why should <Col N="1319" /> there be one law for the Land Commission and another law for the ordinary people of Ireland?  We Irish farmers, by our contributions to the State, by the payment of taxes and land annuities, are contributing to maintain the Land Commission in existence.  Why should they have rights over and above any of us?</P>
    <P>The Minister knows the struggle that went on so that the people could own the land.  He knows the difficulties with which they had to contend, how their forefathers had to fight and go through every danger, how in many cases they were forced to emigrate, never to see their native shore again. Nevertheless, we have reached the unhappy situation in 1964 when a Fianna Fáil Government bring in a Bill like this.  The Minister must know there is widespread opposition to this Bill.  There have been representations from the National Farmers Association, from the Landowners Association and from practically every group concerned with land in this country.  This section and the subsequent section have aroused the indignation of everybody. They have aroused not only indignation but a feeling of insecurity for the future.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest assets of land and a very necessary prerequisite of owning land is land security and fixity so that one can plan in advance what one will do.  I have referred to emigrants.  Wexford is considered rather better off than some of the counties on the western seaboard.  I do not think it is but it is supposed to be. Even in Wexford, it is a regular occurrence that people let their land and go to England for the purpose of saving capital and returning to restock their lands.  That is very desirable.  They save money and come back, bringing assets into the country.  They buy stock and set themselves up in a strong position in the farm.  When they come back, they may find that the Land Commission have seized their land because they have to go to the Land Commission and say: &ldquo;Please, may I let my land?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Minister, who is supposed to be a member of <Col N="1320" /> what claims to be a democratic Party, should introduce in a democratic State with an agricultural history such as we have had over the centuries, a Bill such as this with a section such as this, which is absolutely dictatorial, giving to the State powers that he will not allow to the ordinary farmer.  If the Land Commission themselves took land and divided that land straight away and had a plan for the division of land, or if they even left it to the owners to let it until it was ready for division, it would not be so bad but they want to take the land from the individual and do the letting themselves. If that is justice, I do not know what views the Minister must have of the cardinal principles of justice in relation to Irish landowners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As other Deputies have stated, this is, undoubtedly, a most revolutionary provision in section 12, that an agricultural holding shall not be let, sublet or subdivided without the consent in writing of the Land Commission.  I understand the Minister has given some indication as to what will happen where a farmer dies and his widow is left with young children and may seek to hold the farm until such time as the son has left school and is in a position to operate the farm.  Is it a fact that such a person must now apply to the Land Commission for permission to let the land and, in the event of permission not being forthcoming, how is such a person to maintain the productivity of the farm and to carry it on so as to ensure that it will be in a proper condition when the son is in a position to work it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We require more than the Minister's word for this because there was an occasion in relation to other legislation where we accepted the word of the Taoiseach in respect of a measure that will be before the House tomorrow &mdash;the Transport Act.  On that occasion a verbal undertaking was given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as he then was, and was flagrantly broken subsequently when branch lines were closed.  Therefore, we have to ensure on the Committee Stage of this Bill that there is something more than <Col N="1321" /> a pious affirmation from the Minister. We want it in black and white that this provision will not be used to the detriment of people placed in such unfortunate circumstances that they are unable to work a farm for some few years and will be prohibited from letting it to somebody with the machinery, capital and capacity to make a profit from it in that period.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that it is not intended that the provision should apply to conacre or agistment lettings but there is nothing in the Bill to indicate that such exclusions may be made and if there were a case submitted to the courts at any time, the courts would not be bound by any declarations by the Minister in the House but would be bound by the terms of the Bill as enacted by the Oireachtas.  Consequently, we are opposed to the passage of section 12.</P>
    <P>There is growing in our community today something which distresses me, something which we thought was finished many years ago.  I refer to the jealousy, the envy and the positive efforts to disturb and unseat persons in the possession of land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite, Sir, but this is part and parcel of a growing attitude of disrespect for what was won for us by our forefathers in regard to the ownership of land.  This opens up all kinds of reporting.  If you have any animus against a neighbour or any grievance, real or illusory, you can immediately report to the Land Commission that he is letting his land without approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many additional officials will <Col N="1322" /> be required to control the letting of land as a result of this section?  What expense will be involved?  At Budget time we are told of the expenditure on State Departments.  What additional staff will have to be recruited to control every letting of land?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister and the Government to review this matter. They can be informed by Deputies sitting behind them as well as by Deputies on this side of the House that this section is causing nation-wide concern. The Minister laughs and smirks. How frequently have Deputies been stopped within recent weeks and been obliged to satisfy somebody that they would avail of the opportunity provided by the Committee Stage to ensure that the Government would be prevented from enacting this section?</P>
    <P>This is something which strikes at the very roots of private ownership. The Government have alleged that they are moving to the left.  How far left, they have not indicated until this proposal was brought in to make people insecure in the holdings that were won for them over centuries and in which they thought they were secure from the imposition of such requirements as are contained in this section, that they must inform the Land Commission in writing and must secure the consent of the Land Commission if they want to let any part of their holding.</P>
    <P>I want to know, if the Government will be so foolish as to persist in putting this section through, what limitation of time is involved.  If a person notifies the Land Commission that he proposes to let land for a certain period and advances cogent reasons for doing so, how long will it take to reach a decision and, if the person is not prohibited from letting the land within a limited period, can he accept it that approval has been granted or will such person be left awaiting a decision for as long as applicants for housing grants are left at the moment waiting some indication as to the result of their applications?</P>
    <P>If the Minister succeeds in enacting this section, will he give some assurance that there will be a limited period within which a clear indication will <Col N="1323" /> be given to the applicant that he is at liberty or is not at liberty to proceed to let?  I am saying that only in the event of the section being passed by the House.  Even if the Minister agrees to the conditions I have referred to, it is my belief that the people responsible for enacting this provision will be very sorry for doing so.  It is for these reasons that we feel the section should not be pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, it is not, and I do not think it will be agreed.  In England, during the war years and since the war, a situation arose whereby the Government had to take notice of production on the land.  It became purely an economic necessity.  Now what happens?  In England, though conditions there are different from here, they want to ensure that land is properly worked, but instead of giving the power to one central authority, as is proposed in section 12 here, they have set up county committees composed, say, of neighbours and fellow farmers of a particular landowner whose land it is alleged is not being worked properly from the national viewpoint.</P>
      <P>Here we are going a step further. We are bringing the entire 26 counties under the control of Merrion Street.  I would not oppose the section if it contained a proposal providing for committees like that established in England&mdash;on the lines of our county committees of agriculture&mdash;who would be empowered to inquire and report on a farmer who, it was alleged, was not working his land properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past 20 or 25 years, we have been engaged in a steady pursuit of small farmers, driving them off the land as hard as we can.  Not one of those farmers turned his back on his holding, turned the key in his door, put up the shutters willingly.  Every one of them had to go because of Government neglect.  Now that they have gone we are trying to seize their holdings.  First of all, we drove them out by our contempt and our absolute neglect of their economic necessities. <Col N="1324" /> Now that they have gone this Bill pursues them to wherever they have been scattered, in all corners of the globe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing nothing of the kind.  Certain powers are being sought under the section in regard to subdivision and I have no fault to find with it, but I am seriously perturbed about the use of the words &ldquo;letting&rdquo; and &ldquo;subletting&rdquo; of agricultural land. There is a vast area of land which has to be let simply because we chased the owners into exile.  It is all around Castlebar, the Minister's own area. Some of the Minister's friends have fled and have let their holdings.  What will happen to them?  Must they come with caps in hands, bowing and scraping to the Minister or some official saying: &ldquo;For God's sake, can I let my land?&rdquo;  They are in America, in Australia, in Canada.  God knows where they have scattered to.  They have been banished.</P>
      <P>Every one of them has the hope of returning home, of rebuilding or of putting the old home into order, of buying stock and furniture and, in the holding that belonged to his father, grandfather or great-grandfather, ending their days.  We have succeeded in doing what the landlords never did: we have followed our people into exile.  I have a file of letters from such exiles asking me what has come over the Government, what does this mean.  It means they can never come back to the homes they left.  I know the Minister has got scores of similar letters because every other TD in Mayo has told me he has got such queries.  One has come from as far away as Canada.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tells us this does not apply to conacre lettings for grazing, tillage or meadow.  If that is so, what is the harm in writing a few simple words into the Bill so that no judge with jaundiced eye can put a wrong interpretation into the first words in section 12?  What is wrong about that?  I must say I do not see anything <Col N="1325" /> wrong with the rest of the section if the Minister safeguards farmers in that way.  If it is a fact that letting or sub-letting by virtue of common usage in the past does not mean conacre, either agistment or tillage, what is the harm of putting in a few words to say so?</P>
    <P>I do not care what the Minister says.  In a year, in two years, in five years, if the Bill goes through, a judge can put no other interpretation on subsection (1) of section 12 than that the Oireachtas, in passing this measure, meant that no land was to be let or sublet.  To my mind, &ldquo;sublet&rdquo; is the more dangerous term from the legal point of view.  What is the harm in putting in a few simple words to set our fears at rest?</P>
    <P>Surely it is not too much to ask the Minister to give way in that respect to appeals made to him.  I shall not go further than point out that responsible bodies in the country are thoroughly alarmed, whether the Minister likes it or not.  The NFA are one of those bodies.  A bishop spoke today very strongly on this subject.  Groups of people whose strength or influence I do not know have gone to the trouble of preparing documents and getting legal opinion.  Surely the Minister cannot turn down the NFA and Macra na Feirme.  If he only promises the inclusion of a few simple words of amendment on Report Stage I shall be quite happy, but subsection (1) as it stands proposes the adoption of powers the effects of which I do not know, if it is not to establish a kind of tyranny that will not for one moment be tolerated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's stand has been that the power was there before.  Without going into legal details, the matter is there for all to see in the Minister's explanatory memorandum which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> It is intended as a global provision taking the place of the unsatisfactory patch-work of control operating under existing enactments which are listed for repeal in the First Schedule.  Without effective control over subdivision, etc., the other proposals for land reform could be impeded or frustrated. </P>
    <P>I agree with the last sentence, but in relation to the letting of land, no assurance by the Minister that this Bill will not be imposed in relation to conacre lettings, and no undertaking of any other kind can be looked upon as anything but personal undertakings.  The Minister's statement that he had this power previously is no good to us.  His explanatory memorandum suggests he is now consolidating what was regarded as an unsatisfactory set of powers into one global power.</P>
    <P>What has been said by Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Blowick in relation to the storm of fear, perturbation and real concern aroused by this Bill is directly related to the Minister's remark that he will not give way one inch and will not amend this Bill by one word.  Will he finish up with the power to do what Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Blowick fear: consolidate holdings in the West to which people want to return?  Everybody knows that in the West there comes a decade when people are poor or where people, for health reasons or some other reason, are not in a position to work their own land.  I think this is a legitimate fear on the part of Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Blowick.  In my county and other counties on the eastern seaboard, there is a different situation, but it is similar in some respects.  There comes a decade when people, who might be better off than the less fortunate congests in the West, are unable, because of health or other reasons, to farm their land.  The Minister says that if they keep letting on the 11 months system, he will not prohibit it, but he has taken power to prohibit it.  He refuses to accept any amendment or introduce any amendment himself.  All we want to ensure is that the 11 months system is excluded.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to wave any past Act of Parliament <Col N="1327" /> at us and say that this power was held before.  That section is being repealed and replaced by section 12. The Minister tells us he will not use this power.  God forbid it should happen, but the Minister could walk under a bus tonight.  We could have a new Minister.  We could have a new Government in the next six months. There probably will be another Government in the next six or 12 months.</P>

All that is required is an exchange of portfolios in the present Government and you can start on a line which will prohibit lettings on the 11 months system.</P>
      <P>There are good reasons why this system should be preserved, apart from the personal reasons and economic reasons I have given.  Very often a man may feel that a machine would be too large for his own holding, so he takes land on the 11 months system.  He knows he will get no personal profit, but he will get profit which he can set against the cost of the machine&mdash; a machine which would be uneconomic on his own small farm.  We do not accept the Minister's statement that he will not implement these powers and we feel we cannot let this through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, having introduced so many amendments to this Bill, might add another one.  I cannot understand why there is such opposition to introducing the short amendment which has been requested, that is, to include the condition that a certain type of letting will be excepted. The Minister says that has always been so and will continue to be so. While I might differ with the people on my left on occasions, I must agree that their interpretation of this section, and particularly of the explanatory memorandum, is the same as mine. I must also agree with them that subsection <Col N="1328" /> (1) of section 12, which says that an agricultural holding shall not be let, sublet or divided without the consent and writing of the Land Commission, can only mean one thing outside this House.  I appreciate that if the Minister says he intends to exclude conacre and agistment lettings, he means that.  Unfortunately, the people who would be dealing with these matters outside the House would probably take a different line entirely. Almost certainly the fact that it is laid down in subsection (1) of section 12 would ensure that in future the interpretation taken would be that it would include all lettings.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is the problem that certain of the people who deal with these matters have had a rather inhuman approach to this question of letting or subletting.  In passing, let me remark that if I make a comment on a matter of this sort to the Minister through the Chair in this House I want a reply, if a reply is to be given, from the Minister and from nobody else.  If I want to raise a matter with the Minister in this House, I do not want an official of the Land Commission to reply to me in writing.  It has nothing to do with him.  It is a matter between the Minister and myself.  The Minister could save himself and the House a lot of trouble by agreeing to have another look at this section and by including the very slight amendment asked for from this side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put a question in regard to dairying.  In my constituency quite a number of people take land on the 11 months system for dairying.  They have no land of their own, but it has been traditional for them over the years to take land and engage in this occupation.  I know of several cases.  One, which was brought to the attention of the Land Commission, concerned a farm in Limerick where people had been in occupation of this land year in and year out on the 11 months system.  Eventually, they found themselves without any place in which to put their cattle. They felt the Land Commission was going to take this land, but the farm was sold and they found themselves <Col N="1329" /> looking about for land.  There are people like that and people with very small amounts of land who have been enabled to make a living for themselves and their families from this type of husbandry.  I should like to hear from the Minister that the interests of these people will not be affected by this section and that they will not be prevented from engaging in this type of husbandry.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see, the section seems to govern any letting of land. There must be permission to let it. While the Minister might tell us at this stage that the Land Commission might not be unreasonable in this matter, I should like to feel assured that this type of husbandry, which has contributed very valuably to the national economy and has enabled whole generations to live on the land though not owning land, will not be interfered with.  It is a very valuable national asset in its own way.  It is also a very valuable outlet for young men who, at the present time, are unable to obtain land for themselves or where the holdings which their people own are not capable of maintaining a number of young men.</P>

      <P>I am compelled to intervene by the continued representations that have been made to me by various people in my constituency. There is one example I want to bring before the Minister.  There are many young men, whom the Land Commission would call landless men, in my constituency of Waterford and in the constituency of South Kilkenny who take various small holdings of five to six acre and ten acre plots.  They often have 60 acres of land which they till themselves.  That is their way of making a livelihood.  If there is any interference with the leasing or letting of those holdings, we will turn ourselves into a complete bureaucracy.  I do not like it and I would say to the Minister that he should look at this again.  In fact, he must look at it again.  It is against all the principles that the Irish people ever held in respect of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure every Deputy realises the land hunger that has always been in <Col N="1330" /> the Irish people and the way people love the land and love the place they were reared in.  Even though many of them had to leave it, they do not want to part with it.  It could be said that if many of these farms were given over to the Land Commission, they would be available for division amongst these young men for whom I am appealing.  I want to point out to the Minister that these men would be termed landless men and they would not get any share of the land available. They would not be considered for any portion of such land.</P>

I want to point out also to the Minister that there is no use in his saying to me that he wants to buy up this land and offer it to these men because these men will not be eligible for it.</P>
      <P>Many people who might be called old-fashioned have made representations to me.  Those people remember what they had to suffer, and what their fathers had to suffer, in getting fixity of tenure that was won for them by the various Land Acts in the 1880s and the early 1900s.  One of these people said to me: &ldquo;Did I ever think I would see the day we would have an Irish Government who would prevent me if I wanted to&rdquo;&mdash;this man does not want to let his land&mdash;&ldquo;from letting my land to my neighbour?&rdquo;  I suggest to the Minister that the teeth should be taken out of this section. The Minister says that he does not need these powers.  If he does not need them, why is he taking them?  I would ask him to reconsider this matter.</P>

      <P>It is the old argument.  Whenever anybody opposes Fianna Fáil on anything, it is obstruction.  We are supposed to agree with Fianna Fáil, no matter what they do.  If the Minister thinks the Fine Gael Party will line up behind him to pass such a Bill as this, he never made such a big mistake in his life before.  I would advise the Minister, if he wishes to get this Bill through, to treat the House with the courtesy it deserves.  I saw him sitting there sniggering when Deputy Blowick was making a good contribution just now.  It is obstruction when anybody opposes anything which Fianna Fáil wants to introduce.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister does not intend to give much away, whether it is by instructions from the Government or whether he has been advised by his officials that he should try to put this Bill through without amending it in any way.  I have come to the conclusion that that is the Minister's intention and that he does not intend to give an inch.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will answer this question.  If a person wants to let land and makes application to the Land Commission for that purpose, how long will he have to wait for an answer, under this coercive legislation introduced by the Minister?  A situation may arise in which there is an opportunity for a person to let his farm over a certain period of years, which will be of advantage to himself and to the district.  In my constituency at the moment, a farm of land has been let for a great number of years and it has been to the advantage of both the people who took the land and the people who let it.  The Land Commission have not interfered in this matter.  They left it as it is.  I do not know whether they had sufficient powers in the existing legislation to take over that land.  If they had not up to this, they will get it under this Bill, if the Minister has his way and gets it through this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I, or any other landowner wishes to let his land and has an advantageous <Col N="1332" /> offer for it, which he wishes to accept, and which will give a stable livelihood to him over a period of years, how long has he to wait for an answer to his application?  I cannot see anything in this section to indicate that it is mandatory on the Minister, or the Land Commission, to decide the issue one way or the other.  If a person has such a reasonable offer and makes application to the Land Commission, it is quite reasonable to assume that he might have to wait 12 months for an answer.  If you go for an interview, you have some opportunity of getting a decision, but if you write to the Land Commission, I can assure the Minister it is a very long time before you get a reply.  I can also assure the Minister, when you get a reply, it is very hard to interpret completely what it means.</P>
    <P>It would be to the advantage of this House, if the Minister instead of sitting there sulking and talking about obstruction, got up, was constructive and replied to the queries addressed to him.  I am asking the Minister a definite query now.  With respect to you, Sir, if the Minister does not answer, I shall assert my right as a Deputy and keep putting the query, even if we have to stay here all night.</P>

      <P>In the 21 years during which I have been a member of this House, I have never before had the experience of seeing a Minister sitting, resting his face on the palm of his hand and remaining dumb, despite a plea for a simple answer to a simple question put for the purpose of getting guidance for the landowners of this country.  Last week and the week before, the Minister gave certain guarantees. What I am afraid of is that these guarantees will be of no use because we have no guarantee that the Minister will be Minister for Lands next week.  I fail to understand why this terrible threat should be allowed to hang over the heads of our farmers. I join with Deputy Esmonde in appealing to the Minister to use some commonsense and not behave like a child who has had his toffee filched from him.  The Minister is sulking.  Surely the Minister is sufficiently adult to be able to exercise commonsense and intelligence?  Surely he should answer reasonable requests?  It is a very serious matter for landowners to lose the right to ownership.  This is a matter on which the Minister should not remain silent.</P>

      <P>No member of the Fianna Fáil Party, not one Fianna Fáil Deputy, has spoken on this matter. It shows the contempt in which Fianna Fáil hold the right to ownership of <Col N="1334" /> land and the right of those who own the land to do what they like with their own property.  This is an outrage. It is a calamity.  The Minister's attitude is an insult to Parliament.  It is an insult to the Irish people.  Deputy Esmonde asked the Minister a reasonable question: he asked the Minister how long it will take the Land Commission to reply to a person asking for permission to let land.  The Minister smiles broadly and ignores the question.</P>
      <P>I will go a little further than Deputy Esmonde.  May I ask the Minister what the procedure will be under this section?  What speed, what efficiency, will there be so that a landowner seeking permission to set his lands will know how long it will take to get that permission?  How long after receipt of his application can he expect to have an answer?  There is nothing in the section to say that the permission or the refusal, as the case may be, will be conveyed to him within a period of 14 or 21 days.  What will happen to the landowner who sits down and writes to the Land Commission for permission to set his land: &ldquo;Dear Sir, I wish to apply to the Irish Land Commission for permission to set my land. It is important that I should set it because I am unable to work it.  Please honour me with a favourable reply.&rdquo; After three weeks, maybe, he will get back a short acknowledgment, in Irish, mark you.</P>

      <P>I take it the Land Commission will use the same type of acknowledgment as they use now.  What will happen when a man receives this acknowledgment in a language he does not understand?  Does he then proceed to set his land or does he take this as a refusal?  This matter is too serious for the Minister to sit silently.  Deputy Jones has dealt with the circumstances of the dairy farmer in his constituency and in the dairying areas in which tracts of land are set for grazing.  He asked the Minister to give a guarantee that those who take these grazing lands will be exempt <Col N="1335" /> from the provisions of section 12.  The Minister did not give that guarantee. He did not even take the observations made by Deputy Jones seriously, and Deputy Jones spoke with commonsense and intelligence out of the knowledge he has of the landowners in his constituency and the benefit that system confers on those landowners and on the community generally.  Deputy Blowick asked the Minister why he was seeking power to deprive the owner of land of his full rights of ownership and his right to do what he likes with his land, without making application to a group of civil servants or to the Minister.</P>
      <P>We are dealing here with the principle of the right of ownership and the right of the owner to do what he likes with his own property.  There is a serious implication in this.  After the passage of this Bill, nobody's land will be his own.  It will be tied up in red tape.  Before he can do what he likes with his property, he will have to seek permission.  As the explanatory memorandum says he must apply for permission. The Bill says he must obtain it in writing from the Land Commission. Deputy Blowick received no answer to the point he raised.  Neither did Deputy Donegan.  Deputy T. Lynch dealt with the circumstances prevailing in his area.  All through the Minister has remained silent.  I fail to understand this silence on the Fianna Fáil benches.  Is it because the Minister, when dealing with this section before his Party, met with such very serious opposition from the Fianna Fáil Deputies in rural Ireland?  I ask the Minister now to apply to the Chair for permission to adjourn this debate and go back to the Fianna Fáil Party with this section.  If he does, I venture to say he will be met again with the hostile opposition he met with previously in the Party on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Minister realises that a battle was fought in this country for quite a long time in order that our fathers, our grandfathers, and our great-grandfathers could enjoy the ownership of land.  Yet here we have, as Deputy T. Lynch pointed out, an Irish Government, by a stroke of the pen, by section 12 of this Bill, depriving <Col N="1336" /> the people of the benefits of the great sacrifices which were made in the past.  The Minister for Lands of this Fianna Fáil Government is sitting with two men behind him who have remained as silent as himself.  There has not been a single voice on that side of the House to defend the landowners of this country, nor a single voice to prevent Civil Service control over every acre of land within the State.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the guarantee he gave a fortnight ago that conacre lettings, temporary lettings, agistment lettings, and temporary lettings for convenience were exempt from this section might be all right if we had a guarantee that he would be Minister for Lands permanently.  We have no such guarantee.  The Minister for Transport and Power might be Minister for Lands in a month's time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then where would the guarantee of the Minister stand?  This is probably the most serious question to be decided in this House since the State was founded. Many serious questions were decided, many serious problems were debated, and many serious motions were discussed carefully and fully, but never before was such a serious matter debated in this House as the matter of preventing the owners of the land of the country from doing as they wished with their own property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I want it to go on record that the Minister has remained dumb, that the two men behind him have remained silent, and that no explanation has been given by the Government as to why they are taking these powers which the Minister says he may not use, which he says may be unnecessary, but, at the same time, he would like to have enshrined in legislation in case he wants to put them into effect.  This might be a reasonably good section for Fidel Castro to enact. <Col N="1337" /> It might be a good section of a Bill framed by Tito or Khrushchev but here we have an Irish Minister for Lands in an Irish Parliament, putting legislation through the House which, in plain language, will make it a criminal offence for any landowner to set his land without the consent and permission of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, through the Chair, in all fairness to treat this House and this Parliament with courtesy.  He has been treated with courtesy from this side.  It is not our intention, and it never has been&mdash;it is not our pattern of working&mdash;to obstruct.  It is our duty as the Opposition to be constructive, and that is what we are.  It is also our duty as the Opposition to see that the present Government, or any Government, do not impose on the people a law which is unjust, unfair, unreasonable and, in my opinion, unconstitutional. That is why we are very strongly opposing the powers the Minister seeks in this section.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the attitude of the NFA, the attitude of the Irish Auctioneers and Estate Agents Association, the attitude of the landowners, and the attitude of every organisation which viewed this matter with concern, does the Minister think that silence is the way to treat the views of such representative bodies?  I have a feeling the Minister does not realise his responsibilities in this matter, because any Minister who would ignore the pleas of the people outside this House, in the same way as he ignores the pleas of the people inside the House who speak on their behalf, is unworthy to occupy the high office of Minister for Lands.</P>
    <P>Probably one of the most serious aspects of this whole matter is the manner in which the Minister has treated the pleas made by three Parties in this House who view this section with the highest suspicion, and the gravest possible concern.  If, as the Minister said a fortnight ago, the section is innocent and harmless, is there anything now to stop him from standing up and saying: &ldquo;A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am now satisfied that in order to ease the minds of the people <Col N="1338" /> outside the House, as well as the people inside the House, I should come back on Report Stage and submit a further amendment of three or four lines saying that conacre lettings, temporary lettings, agistment lettings and temporary lettings for convenience are excluded from the terms of this section&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For some reason or other, the Minister will not give us that amendment, and he has not explained to the House or, indeed, to the country, why he has refused such a reasonable request.  Is it because there are queer, undisclosed and strange motives behind the section? I think there are very strange, undisclosed, political motives behind it.  I now view it with greater suspicion than I did when I read the Bill last October.  I feel that the motives behind the section are ill-conceived. Whatever the reasons for it are, the Minister is afraid and ashamed to disclose them to the House, and that is why I join with other Deputies in making a serious plea to him to speak, not to remain dumb, while depriving the landowners of the country of the right to ownership of their own land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested by the Minister responsible for this Bill that our opposition to section 12 is ill-considered and, indeed, he ventured to say, obstructive.  I have left the conduct of this Bill confidently in the hands of Deputy Flanagan and my other colleagues who have spoken on this matter, in the knowledge that they would fully express our views on it.  I expected that when our views had been adequately ventilated, the Minister would recognise his obligation to go some way to meet the legitimate reservations we had in regard to this provision.  He is not prepared to go any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say with a full sense of responsibility that our opposition to this section is dictated by a grave sense of responsibility on the merits of the proposals it contains.  I am as certain as I am standing here that there must be some members in the Minister's Party who themselves remember or who have heard their parents talk of the three F's in defence of which the Land War was fought and won.  Those <Col N="1339" /> three F's were fixity of tenure, fair rent and free sale, which at that time were denied our people by the landlords.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the meaning of the word &ldquo;subdivide&rdquo;?  These rights were withheld from our people by the landlords and we challenged their claim to do that.  They joined issue with our fathers and our grandfathers in a long and sanguinary struggle, the issue of which was that we cleared the landlords out of this country and established these three rights for all our people.</P>
      <P>Now, let us get this clear in our mind.  Anyone who knows the story of rural Ireland knows that, down through the ages, there were good landlords and there were bad landlords. A good landlord never interfered with fixity of tenure amongst his tenants. A good landlord never exacted an unfair rent.  A good landlord conceded the right of free sale of your tenant right.  There were thousands of landlords who voluntarily conceded the right of the tenant to compensation, not for his ownership of the land but for his tenancy of the land.  There were good landlords in this country who conceded that although there was no legal obligation on them to compensate a tenant for his improvements, there was a moral obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People often asked me and my father and those who went before me: &ldquo;Why did you attack all the landlords then?&rdquo; The answer is that because the system was open to such abuse, we could not allow it to continue.  Do not forget that if the first Lord Lucan was a bad man, <Col N="1340" /> the next Lord Lucan was a good man. Do not forget that you had the exact reverse.  You had a good landlord who reared a bad son.  Our fathers and grandfathers said: &ldquo;We cannot allow our people to live under that perennial Sword of Damocles that their landlord will rear a bad son and the day the good man is buried, fixity of tenure, fair rent and free sale will be taken from the tenants by the passing of their landlord.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This section purports to do in 1964 what was never proposed in this country before since we dealt with Clanrickard. We fought Clanrickard all the way, with all his resources, and we beat him in the end and nobody has made the claim since which is made in this section today.  This is not a proposal that where a Land Commission annuity is outstanding or that while a parcel of land which a person is buying from the Land Commission is outstanding, there shall be no dealing in the land without the consent of the Land Commission.  This is a proposal to control all the land in Ireland. The last people who made that claim were the Landlords' Convention.  Did we fight the Land War to abolish that right in the Landlords' Convention in order to re-vest it in a bureaucracy? Is it any less difficult for an owner of land to find himself entangled with a Government Department or the Minister for the time being or his nominees, the Land Commissioners, for the time being, than it was for their grandfathers to wrestle with a landlord whom they knew and who was their neighbour?</P>
    <P>What is the need for this section? How can an Irish Government claim to exercise such a power without limitation of time?  How can they assert what certainly is not true, namely, that the Government own all the land in Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the claim of section 12.  What section 12 claims is that it does not matter how you got the land, how long you have held your land, whence you got it, your title is no longer good because you hold it by leave of the Government of the day, <Col N="1341" /> and if you want to sell part of it or to set part of it, you can do so only with the permission of the Government of the day.</P>
      <P>Do not let us close our eyes to the fact that today there are certain reserved functions of the Land Commission. We used to regard the Land Commission as a judicial person into whose hands we might commit many great powers with reluctance, with circumspection and with unremitting vigilance, but, in a later stage of this Bill, some of those reserved powers are being qualified.  Where the acquisition of land heretofore was a reserved function of the Land Commissioners, now land is to be examined at the instance of the Minister for Lands for the time being through his Chief Inspector and many restrictions are to apply to that land consequent on that inspection at the instance of the Minister for Lands.  I very much doubt if a position of this kind is in accordance with the Constitution but whether in law it may or may not be, certainly the spirit of the Constitution of this country never envisaged the claim of this State to own the land of Ireland. I deny that claim and I venture to say that no legislation of this House can ever take from our people the right to own their own land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In all the debates that have gone on here, the great fundamental issues that are here involved are easily lost sight of.  The issue raised in section 12 is: &ldquo;Do the farmers of this country own their own land?&rdquo;  I dare anybody to say, if section 12 becomes law and survives the Constitution, that a man owns his land if he may not let it, sublet it or subdivide it without the permission of the Government Department.  I can only assume that, perhaps, the Minister and the Government stumbled into this proposal without a full realisation of whither they are going, because in their explanatory memorandum, they say that subdivision, letting and subletting of all agricultural land in the State shall be subject to Land Commission consent.  It is <Col N="1342" />&ldquo;a global provision taking the place of the unsatisfactory patch-work of control operating under existing enactments which are listed for repeal in the First Schedule.  Without effective control of subdivision, etc., the other proposals for land reform could be impeded or frustrated&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is nothing the Government want to do that is not impeded or frustrated by the fundamental rights of our people set out in the First and Second Constitutions of the State.  The purpose of a Constitution is to frustrate and impede the activities of a dictatorial Executive when they no longer realise the right relationship that ought to exist between them and those who are their masters and whose servants they should be proud to be.  These are fundamental rights.  The right to own land is fundamental and if it is lost, make no mistake, the whole social pattern of our society is fundamentally altered.  We shall fight that section with all the resources at our disposal. It is a claim on the part of the State, without limit of time, to control free sale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.  I shall read it again:</P>
      <P>An agricultural holding shall not be let, sublet or subdivided.... </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is that word put in for?  Why not leave it out?  We are told this section does not refer to conacre lettings.  That is what the Minister said.  I think as the text stands the courts will interpret it to mean that it does.  But that can be easily settled because if the Minister says it does not apply to conacre lettings, let him <Col N="1343" /> put in an amendment specifically excluding them.  That is what we asked for.  If he says subdivision does not relate to sale of land let him bring in an amendment saying that the Government do not claim to control the sale or subletting of land.  If the section does not mean what it says, then, of course, we do not object to it.  We object to it for what it says, not for what it does not say.  If it means something different from what it claims to mean&mdash;because in his own explanatory memorandum he says:</P>
    <P>It is intended as a global provision taking the place of the unsatisfactory patch-work of control operating under existing enactments....  Without effective control of subdivision, etc., the other proposals for land reform could be impeded or frustrated. </P>
    <P>If you look at subsection 4, there is no intention to leave out any acre of land in the country:</P>
    <P>In this section &ldquo;holding&rdquo;, in relation to a particular tenant or proprietor, means all the property held by him at or after the passing of this Act under a single demise, whether fee simple, fee farm grant or leasehold or from year to year, and whether held jointly or in common or alone or in severalty, and whether or not purchased under the Land Purchase Acts, or registered or deemed to be registered under the Registration of Title Acts, 1891 and 1942; provided that where two or more than two such holdings stand consolidated they shall be deemed to be one holding; &ldquo;agricultural&rdquo; in relation to a holding means substantially agricultural or pastoral or substantially agricultural and pastoral in character. </P>
    <P>How very specific the Minister is here. There is no ambiguity.  This section is designed to take cession of every acre of arable land.  No ambiguity is left there.  If the Minister can afford to be so specific in subsection (4), which extends the scope of the section, could he not meet the Opposition, which speaks with some authority in respect of the question of free sale in regard to the question of that type of land which <Col N="1344" /> may be the difference between the survival of a family on their holding and the compulsion to abandon it through family circumstances for which they have no responsibility?</P>
    <P>I adopt all that has been said from these Benches and I warn Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party that, if they do not already know it, in their name are now being struck down the three F's which most of them were reared to revere, fixity of tenure, free sale and fair rent.  If Clanrickard could not make a breach in them, I do not believe Fianna Fáil will be able to do so.  Of this they can be certain: we shall fight them every inch of the way in Parliament, in the country and in the courts, and if they beat us, one day we shall be in their place and I now pledge this Party to undo what they are attempting to do today.</P>

      <P>He starts off with the extraordinary assertion that such a proposition as is enshrined in this section was never proposed here before.  That obviously indicates that he did not take the trouble to read the debate on the section. In case anybody should be misled by these crocodile tears that are alleged to be shed about the three F's, in the much-vaunted Land Act of 1923, enacted by the Fine Gael Party's predecessors, there is a subsection which has been the law of the land for the past 40 years.  It reads word for word with this section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the Land Commission have after the date of the passing of this Act made any advance for the purchase of a holding or parcel, the proprietor thereof shall not subdivide or let the holding or parcel without the consent of the Land Commission, and every attempted subdivision or letting in contravention of this provision shall be void as against all persons, and on any <Col N="1345" /> such contravention the holding or parcel shall at the option of the Land Commission vest in them. </P>
    <P>That section applies to 80 per cent of the land of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The unvested land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because 80 per cent has been purchased under the 1923 Act.  Every rural solicitor, where there is a question of subdivision, has spent much of his time filling up application forms for the Land Commission's consent, week in, week out for the past 40 years.  Because under this section, on this question of subdivision and sub-letting, I am applying the same law that applied to 80 per cent of the land for the past 40 years, we have Deputy Dillon coming in at this hour, after approximately ten hours of the time of the House having been devoted to this section, to die at the mast for the three F's.  This is the position.  This has been the law of this land for the past 40 years as regards subletting and subdivision.  It has been the law that any letting of land for more than one year, for two, four or five years, was absolutely void between all parties unless they got the consent of the Land Commission.  There are people in Deputy Dillon's Party who could advise him on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Dillon in his wisdom decided to leave the responsibility for dealing with this to Deputy Flanagan, he might have invited some of the lawyers in his Party to brief him on the law of the land for the past 40 years on these issues.  It is true I have said that section 65 of the Land Act, 1923 does not apply to temporary convenient agistment or what are called 11-months lettings because these are not legal lettings.  In one case it is what is called a licence for eatage of the grass, or the taking of hay, as the case may be, and it has always been excluded.  Just the same as it was not necessary to say on the passing of section 65 that these provisions did not apply to temporary lettings, pasturage, or 11-months lettings, so it is unnecessary under this section because this section merely reenacts the law that applied to 80 per <Col N="1346" /> cent of the land for the past 40 years.</P>
    <P>If Deputies are interested enough in getting clear definitions of the difference between a legal letting of land and a temporary interest in letting, or an 11-months letting, they might go to the trouble of looking up what the Supreme Court had to say in 1944 in <i>Fitzpatrick</i> v. <i>Beehan,</i> in which they deal specifically with the reasons why the Land Acts did not apply in these temporary convenience lettings.  This is what the section is dealing with.  It is applying the same law that has been on the Statute Books of Dáil Éireann since 1923 in respect of 80 per cent of the land to the other 20 per cent.  Why should not the same provisions be applicable?  I do not know what Deputy Dillon is thinking about when he says it is a crime to stop people subdividing land.  Does anybody in his sane senses believe that an uneconomic holder should be given, at very great expense to the taxpayer, an addition of 15 or 20 acres to bring him up to an economic level and then the following week after the Land Commission had parted with the land to him, that he should be allowed to go on the open market and sell that land in parcels of two, eight or ten acres?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most innocuous section in the Bill inasmuch as there is nothing new in it.  We started dealing with this matter on the 14th of April when four hours of the time of the House were devoted to it; then on the 22nd April another four hours were devoted to it.  Tonight we have been about two hours on it, for the sole purpose of endeavouring to create a feeling in the minds of people outside that there is something revolutionary or extraordinary being done under section 12 which, as I said, is merely a re-enactment of the law that has been applicable to 80 per cent of the land and is now applying it to the other 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the people in rural Ireland to realise that this performance is going on in this House and to realise that the sale of all the lands now being sold in anticipation of this Bill to deprive <Col N="1347" /> the Land Commission from getting it is being assisted by the deliberate misrepresentation, the deliberate filibustering that has gone on on this section for hours and hours, with repetitive speeches being made time and time again by Deputies opposite.  In my view they know quite well what is being enacted.  They know that this section purports to do nothing except what was done in 1923 and extend that law to the rest of the land and they have their own doubtful purposes for holding up the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this bluff goes any further, I want to nail one falsehood. The Minister has fallen back on section 65 of the 1923 Act.  He said that that applies to 80 per cent of the land.  The position is that when this State was established the late Mr. Hogan was Minister for Agriculture and Lands and at that time there were 11,000 landlords holding over one million acres with something like 150,000 tenants.  That section was brought in by the then Minister to deal with the lands they were about to hand out to the tenants until the tenants would be vested in that one million acres.  There is no comparison at all.  I suspected that the Minister was using a ruse to put something serious across and now I am convinced of it.  He said that the same conditions as applied in 1923 now apply to vested land.  All these conditions have vanished and this is nothing less than an act of tyranny on the free landowners of this country. If this is as innocuous as the Minister says it is, why has he changed the wording there?  Why has he deliberately set out that in this section a holding &ldquo;in relation to a particular tenant or proprietor&rdquo;&mdash;the 1923 Act did not mention a proprietor&mdash;&ldquo;means all the property held by him at or after the passing of this Act under a single demise, whether fee simple, fee farm grant or leasehold or from year to year....&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but when I was Minister for Lands I made myself as conversant as I could with the land law and with the history of land ownership in this country, and I shall not be sidetracked by the Minister. There is no doubt that the Land Act of 1923 paved the way for making every tenant the owner of the land. There were 150,000 tenants to be dealt with and about 11,000 estates.  It was absolutely necessary then to bring in that section dealing with unvested land.  The wording of that Act did not mean and has not meant since that it would apply to any tenant once he is vested.  The Minister now wants to reduce all the farmers of this country to the status of unvested tenants, as they were under the landlord system, by the very peculiar and clever way this section is worded.  The Minister can call it obstruction if he likes but while I have a tongue to wag no Minister will put across something tyrannical and try to browbeat the Opposition by calling it obstruction.  I shall certainly obstruct any tyrannical move and be proud to call it obstruction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In quoting section 65 of the Land Act, 1923, the Minister was chancing his arm right up to the armpit.  It is quite obvious that section is intended to cover the situation whereby a holding would be transferred from one person to another and while there were still land annuities to be paid on it, and the Land Commission would not immediately find they had a new payee.  That is what this is for.  However, even by the Minister's own definition and his quoting of section 65 of the Land Act, 1923, if you want a deliberate change as between section 12 of the Bill with which we are now dealing and section 65 of the 1923 Act, then that change is that this covers all land.  If the Minister <Col N="1349" /> gets a question next week as to when all the land annuities are coming to the stage of being paid up, I think that question will reveal that it will not be very many years until a very large portion of the land of this country is freehold.  As acre by acre fails to become completely freehold it is caught under section 12 and if the Minister, by his own definition, wants a difference, there it is for him.</P>

I did not speak at all on the Land Bill until today and I came in through pressure from my constituents.  The Minister said just now we are trying to stir up agitation against this.  The people are concerned about this matter and there is no need to stir up agitation at all.</P>
      <P>What I am concerned about is that the Minister has given certain guarantees and undertakings in regard to the previous sections that have been passed, and the Minister has asked the House to let this section go through, that everything will be all right as long as he is Minister.  I remember the Taoiseach looking into my eyes here the night the Transport Bill was going through and saving: &ldquo;There is no need to put this down. There is no need to put down every comma.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am travelling on these old railway lines and I am looking at this Minister now.  He has given us undertakings, too, but we have been over the course before.  We have had undertakings before where Ministers said: &ldquo;We shall do this&rdquo; and they did not do it.  We must take a stand here that it should be put down. We must protect the landowners of Ireland, maybe not from this Minister but perhaps from his successor or successors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned disparagingly what Deputy Dillon said about <Col N="1351" /> Balaclava.  It was about the time of Balaclava that the people had no real rights and it was about the time of Balaclava that they were thrown out on the roads in their thousands.  What will happen under this provision if the people ignore this, as Irish people will do and if they let their land in spite of the Minister and the Land Commission? Will the Minister evict them?</P>
    <P>I shall give the Minister another opportunity of answering this question in case the section goes through: how long will it take for the landowner to get a reply when he makes an application to the Land Commission?</P>

      <P>The section says</P>
      <P>Any attempted or purported letting, subletting or subdivision in contravention of this section shall be null and void as against all persons. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will the Minister do if people pitch this to blazes and let their land? I should like the Minister to make a statement in the House, to tell us that he is going to take them to court, that he has power to take them to court, that he has power to evict, that he has power to take over the land.  Will <Col N="1352" /> the Minister tell us that?  Is he going to do that?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the lawyers in the Fine Gael Party and suggested that we should have asked their advice. I am sure that the members of any Party will not go to the lawyers in the Party and ask their advice.  We are able to read as well as anybody else and we are able to react to pressure from our constituents.  It is good that we are able to do that and that we come into this House to put their point of view.  I am convinced that if there were a free vote, this section would not go through.  I appeal now to the Minister to bow to the pressure of Deputies because they are speaking for the people who own the land.  He is the Minister for Lands and he should change the section and take the teeth out of it, because, if he reads section 65 of the 1923 Land Act again, he will see that it is not the same as the section in this Bill, as he said it was.  It is not the same.  I would ask the Minister to reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say this&mdash;and I shall not intervene in this debate again because I think I have said all that needs to be said in my original intervention&mdash;either the Minister himself does not understand what he is doing or he is trying to mislead the House.</P>
      <P>The 1923 Land Act provides in section 65:</P>
      <P>Where the Land Commission have after the date of the passing of this Act made any advance for the purchase of a holding or parcel, the proprietor thereof shall not subdivide or let the holding or parcel without the consent of the Land Commission,... </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who wanted to buy a parcel of land under section 65 of the Land Act, 1923 knew what he was doing. Here is a proposal to say to all those who bought land under the Ashbourne Act, under the Wyndham Act, under the Birrell Act: &ldquo;Without any regard to what you, in fact, or your father bought under these Acts, we now propose to come along unilaterally and to tell you the bargain your grandfather made is now no longer valid.  We, by <Col N="1353" /> law, in 1964, propose unilaterally on behalf of the State to qualify the bargain that your grandfather made.  We are going to change the whole basis of that bargain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to ask this House to consider carefully where are we going?  When before has the Oireachtas claimed to go to any citizen of this State and to say: &ldquo;Whatever bargain you made before, we are now going to intervene and declare that there is a new condition that you, your father, or your grandfather never heard of and, though we made this condition in respect of future purchases 40 years ago, we have acknowledged for 40 years that that condition did not apply to your land; but now we have changed our mind and, just because we have changed our mind, we have written section 12 into the Land Bill of 1963, and Oireachtas Éireann, when they have passed it, are no longer interested in what your right or title to your land has been&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Are we all going daft?  If you have the right to do that, is there any right of property left sacrosanct in this country?  Have you not the right to go in to anybody who owns property and say: &ldquo;Yes, we know you have owned property under a code for the past 40 years or for the past century, but we think you should not hold it that way any more.  We are going to pass a nice, neat, Act of Parliament and you will wake up one morning and find that what you thought was your own is your own no longer&rdquo;?  If you can do this in regard to land, what property remains sacrosanct in this country?</P>
    <P>The justification for this is that it is necessary as a global provision to take the place of the unsatisfactory patch-work of control operating under existing enactments which are listed for repeal in the First Schedule and without effective control over subdivision, <i>et cetera,</i> the other proposals for land reform could be impeded or frustrated.  This is a Land Bill of bureaucratic insanity.  This is the claim, the traditional claim, of every totalitarian State in history, that it is too much trouble to recognise your neighbour's fundamental rights and, if they impede or frustrate the desires of the Executive, the sensible thing to do <Col N="1354" /> is to wipe them out and get on with the job.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister knows the distinction between the purpose of section 65 of the 1923 Land Act and the purpose of section 12 of the 1963 Bill.  I do not believe that Deputy Millar does know the difference.  I do not suppose that he had been born when the 1923 Land Act was passed into law but he heard this story from his father and his grandfather.  They were on the right side when the fighting had to be done.  I happen to know that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He might never have been born, and if he were born, he might be a native of Brooklyn or of Birmingham.  What enabled him to be born here was the wisdom of those who went before him who said fixity of tenure, fair rent and free sale were the prerequisites of rearing a good family on the land of Ireland.  They were right.  It is the fruit of their work which has established the social pattern of rural Ireland today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Fianna Fáil Party believe the time has come to start a great clearance of the land of Ireland. They have declared it is their intention to clear 60,000 or 70,000 people off the land of Ireland in the course of the next seven or eight years.  We do not agree that is necessary, any more than Deputy Millar's father or my father, or his grandfather or my grandfather were prepared to accept that ukase from the respective landlords on whose estates they dwelt.  When they started the clearance then, we said: &ldquo;If there is any clearing to be done, it will be Lord Lucan who will have to go&rdquo;, <Col N="1355" /> and he went and we were left with fair rent, freedom of sale and fixity of tenure, and on that foundation I declare all the institutions we now operate in this State are founded.</P>
    <P>Without the vindication of those things, we would not have a Dáil; we would not have an Oireachtas.  It was because of those things that we got the independence of our people.  Take those things away and transfer them either to an anonymous bureaucracy or an absentee landlord and you take from the people the spirit of independence that made it possible for our fathers and grandfathers to achieve the prodigies they did.  Is it not an interesting thing to hear Deputy Millar say: &ldquo;Sure, that was a long time ago.&rdquo;</P>

It is a foolish man who does not concern himself with the future, but it is an even more foolish man who refuses to learn the lessons of the past.  They held our people down in the past by the denial of fixity of tenure which would have made every man, every family in this country insecure and vulnerable, and every man and every family of our people combined to abolish that insecurity and they combined to lay for all time that vulnerability and it was easy then to mobilise them because the antagonist was recognised as an alien.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let Deputy Millar never make this mistake.  It is just as bad to surrender your independence to the State as it is to the foreigner.  If our people ever become tenants of the Government of this country, they are taking the first step towards servitude as serfs of the State.  I deny the right of the Government of this country, of the Oireachtas of this country, to interfere in a consummated bargain and say, though that bargain was sealed, signed and delivered, 40 or 50 years ago, that it <Col N="1356" /> is no longer convenient to the State to recognise its validity.</P>
    <P>We are to pass section 12 in order to tidy things up a bit and introduce a new condition into all the agreements that our people made under the Ashbourne Act, the Wyndham Act, the Birrell Act.  You cannot do it. You ought not to try, and I pledge myself not to intervene again.  I shall conclude by renewing the undertaking that I shall not be forced by the misled majority, including Deputy Millar, to enact this.  We shall contest it and in God's good time, repeal it, if that necessity arises.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> When this matter was discussed here recently, we appealed to the Minister to include in the Bill some assurance to the public that this question of letting and subletting did not apply to ordinary conacre.  The Minister said every lawyer schoolboy knew that or should know it.  However, when a simple request is made to him to have this protection incorporated in the Bill, he is prepared to sit here three, four, five, six hours getting more and more stubborn every minute of every hour.  Why?  Each time he stands up, he protests vigorously that we are misinterpreting him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely Deputy Blowick, who has been Minister for Lands and who has, as he stated, in an attempt to fulfil the functions of that office properly, made a close study of the history of land division here and of the various Land Acts, would not have sat here hour after hour questioning the Minister if he were not seriously disturbed by the implications of this section?  It would only be sensible for the Minister to include a subsection here which will satisfy the criticism from this side of the House.  His failure to do so only accentuates the doubts and suspicions <Col N="1357" /> we hold concerning this section. Ten minutes ago, he proceeded to quote from section 65 of the 1923 Act. When we come to try to interpret his quotation, we find he is dealing with two entirely different things.  He tries to pretend that he is merely applying now to the other 20 per cent of the land what already applied under section 65 of the 1923 Act.  Apparently, that section applies to land where the Land Commission have already made an advance with a view to purchase.</P>
    <P>I do not know what interpretation the Minister puts on &ldquo;advance&rdquo;.  He probably knows more about advances than I do.  I assume that where the Land Commission move in to buy land, this section 65 of the 1923 Act is meant to apply, whereas in this case this is, in effect, an attempt to unvest all the land of the country and give the Minister&mdash;through his officials; not through the Land Commission&mdash;a degree of control over land which no Minister has previously sought here. He can now direct one of his officials to move in on land merely on this question of letting, subletting and subdividing. The question of fixity of tenure, fair rent and free sale&mdash;these hallowed slogans of rural Ireland which many of the forebears of the Deputies opposite subscribed to&mdash;are now being set aside.  The Minister is merely depending on the regimented support of those behind him who deep down are very doubtful about the propriety of this section.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister to a free vote of the House on this issue.  I wonder how his various supporters, given a free vote on this issue, would behave, but, of course, the Minister will not allow a free vote because I am quite sure that in a free vote this section 12 would be amended and altered on the lines we have suggested here.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the absolute obstinacy the Minister has brought to bear on this section.  He is prepared to sit here hour after hour defending this section 12 for some purpose which I do not understand.  Deputy Dillon thinks the Minister has initiated something he does not understand.  Of course, he will undoubtedly say that <Col N="1358" /> the lack of understanding is on this side of the House.  Surely a simple request to include a simple amendment, which has been paraded before him here hour after hour, should not be resisted?</P>
    <P>Several people in my constituency have spoken to me since this Land Bill first came to be considered.  I can assure the Minister there is considerable anxiety about this Bill amongst responsible, hard-working farmers up and down the country.  This section has been mentioned and another section dealing with the three mile limit has been mentioned.  Several people called to my house and asked me if this would upset their rights to their land.  I wonder how other sections of the community would feel if some such section were incorporated in a Bill in which, for instance, a person's right to sublet a room was questioned and some Minister for Local Government would have to send down his inspector to give permission before a room could be let?  Everybody recognises that the letting of land is sometimes an economic and social necessity, but the Minister will not incorporate in the Bill the simple statutory statement to cover our doubts on that aspect of it. That is why he has been sitting here for the past four or five hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess to some disappointment because we have had quite an assembly here of Fianna Fáil Deputies behind the Minister.  Whether they were brought in to support him in his loneliness or whether they were expecting a division, I do not know.  I hoped when they came in that somebody from the benches over there might have offered an opinion one way or the other as to whether they agreed with the Minister introducing this extraordinary legislation. It would have been a good thing if they had intervened and, if they agreed, if they explained to us on this side their reason for wishing for this type of compulsory legislation.  That is the only name one can call it by.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was also very disappointed with the Minister.  When he intervened, I thought he might have dealt with some of the very reasonable questions <Col N="1359" /> posed to him from this side instead of getting up, drawing a red herring across the trail and referring to an Act, which, as I understand it, deals with parcels of land and does not relate to vested land at all.  The Minister knows quite well that what we are objecting to is that anybody who owns a farm by right and title will not be free to do with that farm what he was free to do with it before this Act was passed, if it is passed.  If the Minister can get up and reassure the House that what I am saying now is wrong, I personally would be quite happy to withdraw my opposition to this section.  Nothing the Minister said in the few minutes he was on his feet, drawing red herrings across the trail, allayed the anxieties of any of us.</P>
    <P>I want to pose a question for the third time, if you will bear with me, Sir.  I said that in a free society one is allowed in a parliamentary assembly to ask questions of a Minister, and, in a free society, one expects an answer. I have asked twice already this evening if the Minister would tell the House in a few simple words if this section is enacted and if a person is going to let the land&mdash;the landowner who has right and title to the land&mdash;and it is made mandatory on him to ask the Land Commission for permission to do so, when may he get a reply.  In other words, how long will he be forced to wait until he gets a reply?</P>
    <P>The Minister purported to answer Deputy T. Lynch when he posed a question, but he did not answer it.  He drew another red herring across the trail.  He talked about parliamentary obstruction and that kind of thing.  I want to ask the Minister other questions as well.  I want to ask him if this section goes through, where nobody has any longer the right to let his land, if he notifies the Land Commission to that effect and the Land Commission do not give him the right to do what he wishes, and if he seizes that land and divides it, will he lose his right of appeal to the Commissioners? Is this authority, which the Minister is seeking, vested fully in him as Minister for Lands?  Are we still in the same quasi-judicial position, in which we have been all along&mdash;that <Col N="1360" /> we have the right of appeal to a Land Court?  If such is the case, it makes the situation even more serious than one had believed it to be.  I do not know why the Minister cannot see the light of reason.  I do not know why he cannot come in like any other reasonable individual and reply courteously and lucidly to questions put to him.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down I again want to express my regret that no member behind the Minister has seen fit to give the House an opinion on the Bill.  I think my guess is as good as anybody's guess.  They are silent because they have been told to be silent.  I know perfectly well that the vast majority of Fianna Fáil opinion is totally opposed to this Bill and I know that many of the Deputies on the opposite side of the House are opposed to it as well.</P>
    <P>It is easy for Fianna Fáil Deputies to laugh here in Dáil Éireann because nobody sees them laughing.  I can assure the House that not many of them would go out to the hustings and try to uphold this Bill and laugh if they were heckled.  They know the answer they would get.  I see a Deputy over there, whose name escapes me, is convulsed with laughter.  Perhaps when I sit down, the House will hear his views.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (1), page 8, lines 52 and 53, to delete &ldquo;until the termination <Col N="1362" /> of proceedings under the Land Purchase Acts for the acquisition of the lands&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;until the expiry of a period of not more than three months from the date of publication of the original list&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to limit for three months the period from the date of notice by the Land Commission <Col N="1363" /> to acquire the lands and the right of the owner to sell or transfer his land without the consent of the Land Commission.  These amendments are reasonable and the Minister should see his way to accepting them.  There are many reasons why they should be accepted.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us what the position will be in the event of the owner dying.  The lands would certainly pass to the next-of-kin. That is something the Land Commission could not prevent.  The fixing of a period of three months should help considerably to expedite acquisition proceedings.  It would also be helpful to the owner of the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Flanagan.  I have the greatest trepidation about the whole of section 13, particularly subsections (1) and (2). Subsection (2) can put a stay for a year and subsection (1) can put a stay to the end of the acquisition proceedings. If the Minister is empowered, in the first instance, to institute an inspection of the lands, and if he invokes subsection (2) of this section and puts a stay of a year, and during that year institutes acquisition proceedings, is it not true the Minister can thereby freeze land as and from any given date?  The Minister can, for the first time, through his officers now freeze land.  That is my particular objection to this section and I think the amendments help because they bind completely and absolutely these powers to a period of three months. We deal with the power the Minister is taking through the Department of Lands to institute inspection in another section but at least these two reasonable amendments should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section on which the Labour Party do not see eye to eye with the Fine Gael Party, because we believe there is a necessity for something of this sort.  Whether it is too drastic is a matter of opinion. We all know that if the Land Commission intimate that they are even remotely interested in a farm&mdash;if they even send an inspector to look across the hedge&mdash;immediately, if the land is held by a person who is not a proper <Col N="1364" /> person to own the land, that person rushes off and attempts to get rid of it as quickly as he possibly can.  Very often we find that farms which should be acquired and divided among deserving local applicants by the Land Commission, are sold to a German, a Frenchman, a Belgian, or an Englishman, and the Land Commission do not apparently pursue the matter any further.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission have the reputation of being a great body, but if there is anything that moves more slowly than the Land Commission we have not yet found it.  It is said that great bodies move slowly, so the Land Commission must be a great body. Perhaps that is why they want 12 months.  If the Land Commission decide they must have a year, and that that would be the fairest all round, we will support the suggestion of the Minister that the provision should be a year.  I am not talking about the small man with a few acres of land on which a greedy neighbour has cast his eye, or the unfortunate widow who is trying to hold on to the farm until her children grow up.  We believe there are far too many people holding vast tracts of land, and making little use of them.  We believe the Land Commission have not only the right, but the duty, to see that land is inspected, acquired and divided in the proper way.  If that requires 12 months, we are prepared to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential for the Land Commission to have powers of this kind to deal with situations that arise from day to day.  We find under the existing cumbersome procedure that lands which were brought to the attention of the Land Commission, and which would take months to acquire, are being sold overnight, and in many cases the sales are negotiated mainly for the purpose of frustrating the Land Commission and preventing them from acquiring land for the relief of congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to what has been said about the reasonableness or otherwise of the freezing period.  It is suggested as 12 months in the Bill, and the Opposition suggest three months.  I am prepared to reconsider the time <Col N="1365" /> factor between now and Report Stage but in my view, anything less than six months would not be useful for the purposes of this section.  Let me say to Deputies who may fear the time limit that in this House very full use is made of Parliamentary Questions, and if any Deputy thought there was unreasonable delay on the part of the Land Commission in dealing with a case about which notice under section 13 was served, the Land Commission, or whoever was their political head, would know about it in a very short time.</P>
    <P>I suggest to this House that to make this section effective the Land Commission would require at least six months, particularly to deal with a case in which an individual deliberately sets out to frustrate Land Commission purposes.  If Deputies are prepared to leave the amendment we are now discussing on that basis, I undertake to reconsider the time freezing order between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move substitute amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (2) to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Land Purchase Acts regarding the periods of time allowed in proposed acquisition proceedings, in a case where an agricultural <Col N="1366" /> holding has been purchased by an alien or aliens and where such holding is deemed necessary for the relief of congestion or the provision of a migrants holding or holdings, such periods may, if the Land Commission think fit, after publication of a provisional list of such lands under subsection (2) of section 40 of the Land Act, 1923 be reduced to a period of one month.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment does not go as far as I should like it to go.  What I want to do is to give the Land Commission power, when a holding is being purchased by an alien, to step in and offer not less than the same price, within one month, provided they deem such offer necessary for the relief of congestion. Hitherto it seemed that there was some reluctance to acquire such land.  I do not see why there should be any difference in the case of land acquired by a person from outside the State, or why we should be more harsh with our own citizens than with others. I do not think there is anything in this amendment at which any person, either a citizen or an alien, could take offence.  There is no element of confiscation about it, and I have made it clear that the price will not be less than the price paid by the former owner.  As the Land Commission will move inside a month, there will be no question of the property having increased in value, or of taking it at a price less than it is worth.  That is one of the reasons why I put down this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment goes some way towards achieving the object we had in mind.  In fact, we would go much further.  As our amendment also was ruled out of order, we would support Deputy Blowick's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does appear a little too much that an alien can purchase a holding which, up to now, he is free to do if the Land Commission inspector has inspected it but before the Land Commission have intimated they are about to acquire it.  We believe there is nothing at all wrong with the Land Commission having the powers to acquire that holding back from the alien and using <Col N="1367" /> it in the way in which it would have been used originally if the alien had not succeeded in getting possession of it because the person who originally owned it would rather see somebody from outside this country in possession of the holding than see one of his less well off neighbours getting portion of it to use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, as far as I can gather, is apparently intended to telescope times allowed under the Land Act for the lodgment of an objection, for the hearing of the objection and for appeal on price in cases involving aliens.  This amendment has nothing to do with stopping aliens from buying land.  What it purports to do is to cut down the time that is available under law to any landowner to file an objection against the Land Commission taking the lands or to bring an appeal on the question of price.</P>

      <P>Without wishing to interrupt the Minister, might I say that the question of proceedings might not arise at all?  The Land Commission could almost acquire by <i>fiat,</i> if I might use that word, under that amendment.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the Deputy intended, may I quote his amendment:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (2) to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Land Purchase Acts regarding the periods of time allowed in proposed acquisition proceedings, in a case where an agricultural holding has been purchased by an alien or aliens and where such holding is deemed necessary for the relief of congestion or the provision of a migrants holding or holdings, such <Col N="1368" /> periods may, if the Land Commission think fit, after publication of a provisional list of such lands under subsection (2) of section 40 of the Land Act, 1923, be reduced to a period of one month.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The existing law is that a person on whom a notice is served by the Land Commission or who acquires land has one month to file an objection against the acquisition.  The objection having being heard, he has two months to appeal to the Appeals Tribunal on the question of price.  Whatever we write in here, on grounds of natural justice, on an issue of this kind, if, through any fatality a man was not ready within a month, the court would extend the time for him and does extend the time if there is a reason for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick's amendment seeks to provide that where the Land Commission serve notice on an alien who has purchased land, he will not have the same time to object to the acquisition and to appeal on the question of price as would an ordinary citizen. That is something that should not be accepted by the House.  That certainly would create a new reputation outside this country for our type of justice if it were accepted on the question of discriminating in procedures that are there for the purpose of protecting landowners as a whole.  I am quite sure, in any case in which the Land Commission serve their notice for acquisition&mdash;let it be on an alien or on whoever it might be&mdash;that, if he is not ready within a month to meet his case in court, he would get an adjournment: so do they all.</P>
    <P>This has nothing to do with the wider issue if the Dáil at some time decides that nobody is entitled to buy land in this country except a citizen of this country.  The legal effect of this amendment is to discriminate against the alien who has bought land, and in respect of whose land the Land Commission have moved, by cutting short the time which he has under law to appeal against the Land Commission's acquisition order or to appeal on the question of the price the Land Commission propose to pay him for it.</P>

      <P>In my view, it is contrary to natural justice.  I submit to the House that it is contrary to natural justice.  When the Land Commission move in to acquire land, irrespective of the owner, we have a procedure that he has a month in which to object to the acquisition and two months to appeal on the question of price.  That is the law as it stands.</P>
      <P>I can see nothing more utterly objectionable than having to reduce the time in respect of one individual as against the general run of our people.  Remember, this applies solely to procedure.  It will not expedite the acquisition of these lands one whit, any more than it would expedite the acquisition procedure if we cut down these times for the general run of our citizens.  Many of these cases take time.</P>
      <P>A person whose land is being taken and who is objecting in the court needs time to prepare his case: it is quite a regular feature, to those familiar with this line of country, for the landowners concerned.  For instance, if it is called an outlying farm, he may have to bring agricultural experts to prove that it is essential to the economy of the home farm which he is running.  All these matters take time.  In many of them, counsel have to be briefed, and so on. In any event, if there should be a fatality or if the man happened to be ill or, for any other reason, if he was not ready to meet his case within the month laid down, the court invariably gives him an adjournment to the next court.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that, whatever we write down here, even to discriminate against any alien against whom the Land Commission may bring proceedings, the court will give him reasonable time to present his side of the story, as with everybody else, let it be good or bad.  That is why I must reject this amendment.</P>

      <P>There is, I will admit, a certain amount of discrimination against an alien if this amendment is accepted but it is only in a case of an alien purchasing land which the Land <Col N="1370" /> Commission need for the relief of congestion.  That makes it very clear that our own citizens want it.  No matter how badly the alien wants it, our citizens want it more.  The Land Commission are a judicial body and decide that such a farm is needed, say, for the relief of congestion.  No matter how badly an alien wants it, our citizens need it more.  That is why I put down the amendment.  While it can be truthfully said there is some discrimination against an alien, I do not think any reasonable foreigner would blame us for that.  It is our duty to legislate for and protect our own interests, not to featherbed aliens no matter how nice they may be or what they bring here.</P>
      <P>The amendment does not allow any long time lapse because within one month of the purchase of the land, the Land Commission say: &ldquo;We want that land more than you do&rdquo;.  Only a very unreasonable alien could find fault with that.  However, if the Minister says the amendment is so objectionable, I shall not press it.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  There is nothing in the Bill to discourage aliens from coming here.  That is why, if the lands are in a district declared to be congested under this Bill, and are required by the Land Commission for the relief of congestion, Deputy Blowick's amendment would help, if not to expedite the proceedings, at least to discourage aliens from purchasing such lands.  In parts of the country, holdings have been purchased by aliens which are required for relief of congestion but, for some reason the Land Commission have not moved with the necessary speed or urgency.</P>

      <P>I cannot see how the Deputy can argue on this amendment about the purchase of <Col N="1371" /> lands by aliens.  This section relates to the time allowed for acquisition proceedings and Deputy Blowick's amendment is for the purpose of reducing the period to one month. That is all that is before the House.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Blowick.  Why should we have the same facilities for foreigners?  It may be an encouragements to aliens to come here&mdash;if there is no speedy way of dealing with them &mdash;and to purchase land required for relief of congestion.  The Minister claims that if such aliens or others have not sufficient time to present their case, any court will give them an extension of time in order to do so. That may be so, but I feel the idea behind Deputy Blowick's amendment is sound and certainly would be likely to discourage aliens from purchasing land required for the relief of congestion.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider accepting the amendment even if it were never used?  It would discourage foreigners from purchasing land.  I should be the first to feel ashamed and sorry if I were discourteous to any foreigner but when land is such a red-hot question here, when it comes to the purchase of land here by aliens, I think no decent alien would say we were deliberately offensive to him or his country if we say: &ldquo;We have not enough land to go around among our own people and, to put it bluntly, we do not want you to buy our land.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not get our lines crossed on this matter.  The amendment has nothing to do with the lands purchased by aliens.  The final words of the amendment are the operative ones, &ldquo;.... after publication of a provisional list of such lands under subsection (2) of section 40 of the Land Acts, 1923 be reduced to a period of one month.&rdquo;  This means that where the Land Commission have served a notice to acquire lands purchased by an alien, where they have moved in to take them over, the time allowed to the alien to object and to appeal on the price, would be cut <Col N="1372" /> down to one month.  That is all this amendment says.  You are dealing with a case where the Land Commission have already made up their mind to take over land purchased by a foreigner and have served the necessary notice on him.</P>
      <P>What you are asking the Dáil to do is to say that we are not going to allow that man to make his case in the same way as an ordinary citizen would be allowed to make it, by not giving him time to object to acquisition before the court or to appeal on the question of compensation or the price the Land Commission propose to give him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>He is entitled under the Constitution to the market value of his land under our law.  The Deputy is asking us to make a special law for people who are not citizens and who have acquired land in respect of which the Land Commission have moved to take over.  They are not to get the same chance to make a case under the law of the land as ordinary citizens.  In my view, that is contrary to natural justice and I have doubts about its implications on the constitutional side. Thirdly, this amendment would not expedite by a single hour the acquisition of these lands already earmarked for compulsory acquisition by the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that in some way this amendment would have the effect of stopping aliens purchasing land.  The amendment is designed to cut down the rights of aliens who have already purchased land but in respect of whom the Land Commission have compulsory powers to take over their lands.  Either from a commonsense or a natural justice point of view, I cannot see how this amendment can be accepted by a reasonable Deputy. Perhaps Deputy Blowick had a different idea in mind in putting down the amendment and believes that it would have a prohibitive effect on aliens acquiring land, but the position is as I have explained.  I think the Deputy is under some misapprehension.</P>

      <P>If the Minister looks at the amendment disallowed by the Chair he will find it more in accord with what I had in mind.

      <P>There is not, but if at any time the Government of England or America wish to bring in one, I am sure they will not consult the Irishmen concerned if they want to protect their citizens.  I cannot see where an alien has a case if a few days after he has purchased land, when he has had no time to settle his roots, the Land Commission say: &ldquo;We want that land for our own people.  We mean no offence; it is the law of the land; and there are probably other farms which we are not interested in which you can buy&rdquo;. It does not prohibit the foreigner from purchasing some land somewhere but it gives the Land Commission an easy way out in regard to the land they wish to acquire for the relief of congestion.</P>

      <P>I have an entirely personal view on this point.  I think the Minister is right.  It would be wrong if we were to make one law for aliens and another for our own citizens.  The case has been made that an alien would have no case to make if he had just bought land and had no time to settle.  I can think of certain aliens in my constituency who have been involved in industry and who have been responsible for employing quite a number of our citizens, probably some hundreds, over the past decade or two.  They are still aliens, as we know when we look at the Voters Register.  If one of those wanted to buy land, I would be quite hurt if I felt there was a law whereby he was treated differently from me. When you examine it, it is unbalanced. As I say, this is entirely a personal <Col N="1374" /> view.  It is not a Fine Gael amendment&mdash;we have never considered it in our Party&mdash;but that is my opinion, that it would be wrong in individual cases to take the steps suggested by Deputy Blowick.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 31 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) All land which has been sold within the eighteen months preceding the coming into operation of this Act shall be inspected by the Land Commission with a view to acquisition.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a substitute amendment.  If the Chair had permitted, it would have been much stronger, but as the Chair did not, it has to be in this form. Its object is to bring to the notice of the Land Commission the farms referred to in the section.  According to the amendment which has been passed, we have decided in future we will not allow an individual to jump the gun by rushing to sell his farm as soon as he finds that the Land Commission have been looking at it. That is all right but we all know that farms have already passed out of the hands of people who were not using them but were holding them as soon as they found the Land Commission intended acquiring them.  All we are asking is that the Commission should take action against those people.  We think this is an excellent idea and see no reason why the Minister should not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to resist this amendment because it is impracticable. It would entail the inspection of all lands sold during the past 18 months.  There is no point in ordering indiscriminate inspection.  The Land Commission must be free to choose land likely to be suitable for their purposes.  Deputy Tully will realise that this is an impossible request and the amount of inspection would seriously disrupt the ordinary work of the Commission for a year or two if this proposal were accepted.  The <Col N="1375" /> implication is inherent in the section that some recent dealings were objectionable in the context of the land reform programme and undoubtedly that is so, but that is a long way from saying every dealing, every sale during the past 18 months, should be inspected and investigated by the Land Commission.  In the normal sale I should like to see what would happen the unfortunate inspector who would go investigating it.</P>
      <P>It is equally true to say that where sales have taken place of land that would be suitable for the Land Commission purposes, where people from abroad have jumped the gun in anticipation of powers being sought by me, there is nothing to prevent the Land Commission from examining these cases and exercising whatever powers the House may decide to give them in order to bring these lands into the Land Commission machine for the relief of congestion.  This is an amendment I could not accept and the Deputy should be satisfied with the assurance I have given, that in cases brought to the attention of the Land Commission, where lands wanted for the land reform programme have changed hands, they may re-examine them when they get the additional powers under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a super-optimist. He referred several times to the &ldquo;past 18 months&rdquo; as if the Bill <Col N="1376" /> were about to pass.  The Labour Party were better judges of the time it will take to pass through the House.  If the Minister starts making a list of farms sold, he will have no trouble when the Bill has been passed.  We do not say this must be done within any particular time.  The Minister has all the time in the world to do it and we still believe it should be done.  There is no use in the Minister saying that the Land Commission can do it anyway. I had the unhappy experience of bringing to their attention a couple of farms which were about to be sold and which some local smallholders could have used, and what happened?  The farms were sold within three to six months and the Land Commission did not inspect them.  They told me they had not been able to get around to looking at the land.  If that is the way we are to deal with this matter, it will be quite a long time before we get around to looking at some of the farms to which the Minister has referred.  While I did not intend pressing this amendment, I would ask the Minister to have another look at the matter to see if something of this nature can be introduced before the Bill is considered here again.</P>
