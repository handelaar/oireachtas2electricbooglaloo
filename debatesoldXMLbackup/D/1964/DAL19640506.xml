    <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.  &mdash; (Deputy Crotty.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned last night, we were discussing the outlay on capital development in the Department.  I suggested that, as this was a Department where the income practically balanced the outlay, when moneys were required for capital development such as that mentioned in the Estimate, it might be possible to borrow for that purpose and thus avoid a blister on the taxpayers.  On considering the matter further, I wonder <Col N="1070" /> if the Government ever thought of establishing a quasi-State body to run the telephone service.  We have a number of such bodies, the Sugar Company, the ESB and Bord na Móna, all run very successfully.  They usually borrow the moneys they require for capital development and have no difficulty in doing so.  In other countries, quasi-State companies and private companies run the telephone service. This is something that might be considered here.  I do not know if it is practicable or not but it is well worth looking into as it might avoid this annual blister for capital development which the Estimate envisages each year.</P>
      <P>I wonder what will be the effect on the economy of the increased charges which the Minister proposes.  There is to be a minimum charge of 5/- for a telegram.  The Minister did not tell us what the charge for an overnight telegram will be.  Up to now such a telegram cost 1/6d.  I question whether ten Deputies know that such a service is provided and I question if more than 50 per cent of the postmasters know it is provided.  I have practical experience in some rural post offices of inquiring about sending overnight telegrams and in at least one case I was told they had never heard of such a thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was very careful to remain mute when it came to telling us what the charge for an overnight telegram will be?  Will it be 2/6d or half the normal charge?  If he would make known to the public the hours at which overnight telegrams may be handed in, it would be welcomed.  A number of Deputies have referred to the fact that the telegram is a means of conveying a message of sympathy in cases of death.  Many people may refrain from sending such telegrams in future but if they knew they could send a telegram at the overnight rate, for half the normal cost, they might take advantage of the service.  I should be glad if the Minister would make some announcement on this point and also in regard to the hours.  I know he will say they are published in the post offices but, if so, they are printed in very small type and displayed in <Col N="1071" /> parts of the offices where it is impossible to locate them.</P>
    <P>The increase of 1d on the ordinary letter will have a serious impact on the business community.  The ordinary person who writes an occasional letter may not be materially affected, but in the case of the business community who depend on correspondence as their ordinary means of communication with their clientele, it will have a very serious effect.  I know a certain business concern where the postage at the moment comes to a few pounds per day.  An extra 1d per letter will increase the outlay very considerably.</P>
    <P>A short time ago the Minister told us there was a backlog of 30,000 applications for telephones.  I may be wrong in that figure but I understand that some of these applicants have been waiting for 18 months and they will now have to pay an additional £10&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not in the case of applicants whose applications were in before 15th April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that from the Minister.  That is very fair and a very reasonable concession.  It was through no fault&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>From before 15th April, there is no charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  Even that is some concession because it was no fault of these unfortunate applicants that they have had to wait down through the years and it would be very unfair to have an additional connection charge of £10.  However, the rental is going up and I would not be surprised if a number of these applicants cancelled their applications as a result of these increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, receiving telephones are not receiving&mdash;if I might make a pun on the word&mdash;the publicity they deserve. It is not generally known by the public that they may have a telephone installed by which they may receive incoming calls but from which they cannot send out calls.  These are provided at a very nominal rental and if many applicants knew that they were <Col N="1072" /> procurable, I venture to say there would be a greater number of applications for them.  Economic services of the Department, such as the overnight telegrams, are never advertised.  Some Deputies have already pointed out that the telephone is the normal means of communication now and once we find a facility such as this being used by the people generally, we immediately impose a tax on it.  Up go the telephone charges and up go the local and other calls.  In my opinion, it is an unfair method of taxation.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to television, television aerials and the unsightly forest of aerials to be seen in the cities and their suburbs.  No person is to blame for that but the Minister.  When the Minister was preparing to set up Telefís Éireann, I approached him and I told him that one of the best known companies in Europe were prepared to instal piped television in this State.  I told him this in private and I mentioned it several times in this House and I undertook as an ex-Minister to use whatever influence I might have with the Minister for Local Government to try to obtain permission under town planning for such a piped service.  Under this piped system, there would be no necessity for individual aerials and the same number of stations which are now available would continue to be available to licence holders.</P>
    <P>I begged the Minister seriously to consider the establishment of piped television here and to avoid this unsightly forest of aerials.  Not only are users of television sets put to the expense of buying aerials for two or three different channels but they are also put to the expense of insuring the aerials.  Piped television would have avoided that and I assured the Minister from the figures I got that piped television could be provided for every person in the State at a much cheaper annual cost than the cost of purchasing and insuring these aerials.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised me at that time that he would consider the matter seriously.  He said there were obstacles and that town planning was probably the biggest obstacle, but one of the purposes of town planning is to do <Col N="1073" /> away with unsightly buildings and structures and there is nothing, in my opinion, more unsightly than this forest of aerials.  I am certain that the town planning people would be only too anxious to row in with the Minister on this question of piped television and I am sorry he did not see fit to accept the advice I gave him, or the services which those friends of mine were prepared to give.</P>
    <P>I am not here to criticise the programmes of Telefís Éireann.  I have nothing but the greatest faith in the Director General of Telefís Éireann, Mr. Kevin McCourt, and I am not going to criticise the programmes.  I shall, however, criticise the reception in various parts of the country.  Some time ago the Minister assured us that booster stations would be set up in various areas and pockets to facilitate reception.  One of these isolated pockets is Donegal and in the principal town in Donegal, Letterkenny, Telefís Éireann cannot be received.  No effort is being made by the Minister to erect these booster stations.  People have been paying their licence fees for the past 12 months or longer.  Perfect reception is obtainable from UTV and the BBC but there is still no trace of Telefís Éireann programmes.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to assist such places, including similar places in Kerry and the west of Ireland, where Telefís Éireann is not obtainable.  After all, television is now one of the social amenities which we all hope will be a means of persuading people to remain in rural parts.  Unless we are going to make an effort to provide reasonable reception from our Broadcasting Authority I do not think that the attractions advertised from UTV or shown on the BBC will encourage them to remain in parts of rural Ireland.  I would appeal to the Minister to see what he can do in this matter and to do it as soon as possible. I know people who have been prosecuted for failing to pay their licence duty, prosecuted by the same Minister who is a defaulter himself in that he cannot provide a service for them.  He knows they are receiving UTV and BBC programmes and <Col N="1074" /> simply because they are getting that service, he insists on their paying a licence fee.  That is wrong.  He should first of all put his own house in order.</P>
    <P>A Deputy last night referred to the erection of telephone kiosks in rural Ireland.  The Minister is very concerned about the setting up of these kiosks and says that they would not be economical.  If we want people to live in rural Ireland&mdash;we know it is not very economic for them to do so&mdash; amenities must be made available for them and if a kiosk is not economical, it will balance up with some other kiosk in an urban or a city area. Wherever there is a demand for a telephone kiosk in rural Ireland, I would ask the Minister to consider erecting it.  He will be providing an amenity for the people in such areas.  Places such as these are no longer catered for by CIE.  The transport system which was provided has been taken from them by an Act of this House and no alternative method of communication has been provided for them.  I would appeal to the Minister to see to it that these kiosks are provided in rural parts.</P>
    <P>On the question of the location of letter boxes in rural areas, there should be a letter box outside every national school in the country parts of this State.  Practically every householder has some member of the family attending the national school.  Giving letters to the children going to school is a simple method of posting them.  The fact that it is situated near a national school would tend to preserve the box from vandalism.  Proximity to the national school, not proximity to the residence of the secretary of the Fianna Fáil cumann, should be the test, and the Minister knows what I am referring to.  I would ask him to see that wherever there is a demand for these rural boxes they are provided.</P>
    <P>The rural postmen are still foot-sloggers. We have done away with the foot-slogging infantry in the Army but the rural postman is supposed to go round summer and winter in his hobnail boots, if he can afford them, or, alternatively, in his wellingtons. <Col N="1075" /> Surely in these days of mechanisation we could provide some sort of mobile transport for the rural postman so as to ensure that he will have some better method of getting around than the primitive method of 60 years ago. The Minister is permitting postmen, at their own expense, I understand, to procure transport, and it is a good thing, but he should provide it for them.</P>
    <P>There is the type of postman who is not entitled to have unemployment insurance cards stamped.  The Minister and his Department have a peculiar method of arranging hours of delivery so that a postman employed permanently in parts of rural Ireland is just a few hours short per week of the qualifying period for the payment of unemployment insurance.  The result is that when he retires, he is not entitled to a contributory pension.  If a postman is employed even for only one day in the week, he should have his unemployment insurance cards stamped.  He would be paying his contribution and it would give him an opportunity of qualifying for a contributory pension on retirement.</P>
    <P>The last matter to which I wish to refer is the Irish language and the postal service.  Practically every post office in Ireland has a sign outside it informing the public that this is the post office of such a town or village, and that sign is in Irish.  In certain Irish-speaking localities, the postmaster, postmistresses and assistants are most anxious to transact business in the national language with any person who desires to do so.  However, no matter what post office or telephone exchange one rings, whether it is situated in the Gaeltacht, breac-Gaeltacht or Galltacht, one will never get a reply in the Irish language.  On ringing up, the first thing one is told is: &ldquo;This is Ballydehob speaking&rdquo;. There is no question of the correct Irish name being mentioned by the operator.  It would be a very good thing if certain natural phrases were used by sub-postmasters and assistants in communicating with the public by telephone.</P>
    <P>Again may I refer to the courtesy of <Col N="1076" /> the officials?  I know they do not mean to be discourteous.  They are most helpful when you explain to them the predicament in which you are but when you ring a sub-office, the first thing you hear is: &ldquo;Ballydehob.  What do you want?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am merely using it.  The name appeals to me.  I have had experience of other countries and when one makes a similar call, the first thing one hears is: &ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo; and when one says: &ldquo;Thank you very much&rdquo;, the usual reply is: &ldquo;You are welcome.&rdquo;  I appealed to the Minister before to look into this and I appeal to him again.  If he does, he will be enabling us to live up to the good name we have of &ldquo;Ireland of the Welcomes&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on the Budget a few weeks ago, I took exception to a statement by the Minister for Finance that it was proposed to treat the Post Office in general as a commercial firm and to increase charges so that the Post Office would, from the point of view of expenditure and income, break as near even as would a commercial firm.  That is a wrong attitude. The Post Office is a social service in itself as is the railway or any of the State concerns which are run not with the idea of breaking even or even making a profit but with a view to giving to the people the services to which they are entitled and the best service possible.  Should that cost money the people who are getting the service are the people who will have to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for instance, as Deputy O'Donnell mentioned, the provision of telephone kiosks in inaccessible rural areas.  The yardstick the Post Office applies to the need for a telephone kiosk is the amount of revenue that will be derived from that kiosk if installed.  They do not look to the social good that will flow from the installation of that kiosk, the fact that people who are isolated from doctors, priests, nurses, hospitals and from human contact in general, will have at hand <Col N="1077" /> a means of getting in touch with neighbours to call for help, if help is necessary.  That is a badly needed social service and the question of cost should not direct whether or not the service will be provided.  In my county the county council has offered to help on a number of occasions but the fee demanded was such that we were unable to meet it.  The Minister should examine the social need for the service just as carefully as the question of the revenue to be secured from the kiosk. Very often, the less revenue to be derived indicates the greater need for a means of communication at the particular place.</P>
    <P>On the question of telephone kiosks in general, might I say that I am always surprised that when a recommendation is given by an urban authority in regard to the installation of a kiosk at a remote spot on the outskirts of a town, the Post Office engineers seem to favour siting the kiosk on a main road, not at a place where it will be available to the majority of the inhabitants.  In Dungarvan, the kiosk is almost always placed at a corner where, if passing motorists pull up to make a telephone call, as they will, immediately adjacent to the kiosk, they represent a danger to oncoming traffic.  I can show the Minister or any official who would care to visit Dungarvan, two very glaring examples where the Post Office insisted on siting kiosks at the most dangerous corners in the town and refused to accept the suggestion of the local council to place them where they would be of much more use to the inhabitants and where they would not be a danger to traffic.  It was not a question of economy because it would have been cheaper to erect the kiosks at the places suggested by the council.</P>
    <P>I object very strongly to the atmosphere that has been developed of making Post Office employees the villains of the piece because they demanded and got a just increase in wages and salaries.  It is quite true that there was a substantial increase granted recently to Post Office employees, taken against the normal increase that has been granted within the past few months, but it must be <Col N="1078" /> realised that Post Office employees have been fighting for a number of years for a just wage for the work they carry out and that the increases recently granted in no way overpay them for the services they give.</P>
    <P>Everyone in this House will agree that the Post Office service is carried out efficiently.  That includes the service given by postmen, counter clerks, telephone personnel and all employees of the Post Office.  There is no complaint about the service apart from the ordinary grumble about delays in getting telephone calls and delays at counters, due mainly to pressure of work or understaffing.  Occasionally, we all indulge in a grumble but, on the whole, nobody has any great complaint. On the contrary, praise is expressed in regard to the very efficient Post Office service.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in respect of which I should like the Minister to give me information.  By what rule of thumb is priority given in respect of the installation of a telephone?  As I understood it, priority was given in the past where a business employing a certain number of workers applied for a telephone.  Such a case was worthy of priority over the ordinary applicant.  It is a good rule. If a man intends to establish some business which will employ or continue to employ a number of people, in all justice he should receive special attention from the Post Office and be facilitated by the installation of a telephone.</P>
    <P>There are two cases in Dungarvan&mdash; one of a clothes cleaner employing some eight or nine persons and the other of a garage&mdash;where applications were made for telephones.  In the first case, if a telephone is not installed immediately a number of men will have to be disemployed.  The lack of a telephone will seriously impair the prospects of the business being able to continue.  It may seem extraordinary in the case of the garage that an established business has not already got a telephone or should be applying so late in the day.  The explanation is that an existing business was sold, the telephone in which was an extension from another business premises in the area. <Col N="1079" /> When that extension is removed, as it will be very soon, the new owner will be depending on a kiosk that is some distance from his business.  I have already communicated with the Minister in respect of both these cases and I should like to know if priority is given to people in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I regret, in particular, the long delay in connection with applications for telephone service in Dungarvan.  I find that people have been waiting for as long as two years for telephones. Nevertheless, I know of cases where persons, who do not give employment, have been able to secure a telephone within six weeks of application.  Some explanation is needed.  If the Minister doubts my statement, I can cite the case of a man living some 100 yards from the post office who has been waiting over two years for a telephone, which has been installed recently, and of a newcomer who took up residence in the area and whose telephone was installed within five weeks.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how such things happen unless somebody gives preference to somebody or there is some influence or some pull in the case.  I make no suggestion of political bias.  I make no suggestion of any sort beyond stating the fact.  One man waited for two years and a newcomer to the town had a telephone installed within five weeks and the man who waited for two years had to wait for several months after that.</P>
    <P>I should also like some information from the Minister on a matter which I raised on the Estimate for the Post Office last year or the year before. What is the position in regard to the proposed new post office for Dungarvan? I understood from the Minister that a site had been purchased. The post office stands in the square in Dungarvan, or as the local people say, is about to fall in the square in Dungarvan. The building was erected some 150 years ago and is now derelict.  It was understood that a site had been selected in the town, that agreement had been reached and that, in fact, the purchase money had been paid.</P>
    <P>Within the past two or three months, <Col N="1080" /> a number of workers, probably engaged by a contractor to the Office of Public Works, have been engaged in painting this old building.  I am sure I could learn the amount of money that has been spent if I were to put down a question to the Minister, which I am not too anxious to do, but I think I am safe in saying that hundreds of pounds must have been spent in redecorating this tumbledown building. Premises completely inadequate for the services, either from the telephonic point of view or the public accommodation at the counters, are being patched up to last for a number of years to come.  Can the Minister say whether a site for a new post office has been bought and if so, when work will begin on it?  Money spent on the premises at present in use is utter and complete waste.  When the Dungarvan exchange becomes automatic and when the new equipment is installed, the premises now being used will be absolutely inadequate.</P>
    <P>I have one complaint to make on Radio Éireann.  I have been told that when requests for records sent in by the public are played on Radio Éireann concerts, the record used is not the one asked for but a substitute disc with a different singer.  Usually the record requested is for an Irish composer and an Irish artiste.  It has been suggested, and I put it to the Minister for his consideration, that there is a scheme of preference on foot to boost particular record manufacturers and particular singers by disc jockeys.  I am told it has nearly become a commercial racket.  Requests for particular records are being completely ignored by disc jockeys to the detriment of Irish composers and Irish artistes.  I do not know the individuals responsible for this but I am putting it to the Minister for what it is worth.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with Deputy P. O'Donnell in his appeal for greater mechanisation in connection with the delivery of the mails by rural postmen. In this advanced age, it is pitiable to see a man either walking the roads or pushing a bicycle, heavily laden with letters and parcels, over quite long distances in all sorts of weather.  In this day and age, something better is <Col N="1081" /> expected.  Some form of mechanisation would not only ease the hardship of the postmen but would bring about economies in the service.  It might extend the routes of some postmen but the hours of those affected could be extended so as to give them a full day's work and thus qualify them for pensions on retirement.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one more comment on Radio Éireann.  It involves the reception of sound broadcasts in the west Waterford area after nightfall. Could the Minister say if the proposed VHF station will help out?  After six o'clock in the evening, winter and summer, it is practically impossible to hear Radio Éireann because of interference from other stations or by the morse transmissions from Land's End. Can the Minister say if the VHF station will ease this situation, and could he also say if the necessary alterations to enable present sets to receive the station will involve heavy cost?  It is a pity that after nightfall radio listeners in vast areas of the country have to resort to British stations or to Radio Luxembourg while paying their licence fees to Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Leneghan, I wish to say a few words on Telefís Éireann.  Deputy A Barry last week commented on what he called the high tone and quality of TE transmissions.  I cannot help wondering whether his remarks related to &ldquo;Mr. Ed&rdquo;.  I do not wish to comment on the quality of &ldquo;Mr. Ed&rdquo; or its entertainment value for children.  I realise Telefís Éireann programme setters have a difficult task because of the varied audience, extending from the very young to the very old, some wanting light material, others serious, political talks, still others wanting sports, including soccer and Gaelic football.</P>
    <P>As I say, it presents a difficult task for the programme setters, in spite of which the transmissions give a reasonable amount of satisfaction.  I am a pretty avid viewer and enjoy many of the programmes, but I join Deputy Leneghan in saying that it sets my teeth on edge when I find an Irishman imitating a garda and making a clown both of himself and of the garda.  It is disgraceful to try to hold up our <Col N="1082" /> national police force to odium and ridicule.  We are supposed to be amused by that.  I for one am not.  It is but a continuation of this attempt at the stage Irishman of which I thought we were getting rid.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has no function in the day-to-day working of the station and cannot be responsible for all these little matters, but I am sure a suggestion from him to the Director would have the desired effect and we would have less of the stage Irishman and more of the natural talents of our people.  On the whole, I feel Telefís Éireann have done an excellent job and deserve our congratulations.  They are new to the television business, but within a very short time, they have given us programmes that I feel are really worth while.</P>

      <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs has always been regarded as a Department that has been able to pay its way.  Now, the costs of providing some services are to be increased.  It would be hard to expect it to be able to pay its way and provide the same services without an increase, because the cost of most articles has gone up in the past few years.</P>
      <P>It is heartening to see that the amount of money invested in the Post Office Savings Bank has increased enormously over the past few years. The Post Office Savings Bank is the first introduction most of us get to saving.  I remember well the day I opened my own account at the Post Office.  I remember how proud I felt when asked to sign my name on the form.  Money invested in the Post Office is put to good use throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot of criticism about delays in phone calls.  We all have had experience of this and we know how irritating it is.  However, we must cast our minds back a few years. In 1958, 1959 and 1960 when money should have been spent on the telephone service, whatever money we had was being used to develop our economy.  First things must be put first. As a result of that development, we have been able to have a Bill to provide <Col N="1083" /> £30 million for the expansion of the telephone service.  If the Minister had looked for money of that nature at that time, he would not have had a hope of getting it; but, as a result of our planned development of agriculture and industry, we are able to provide that money at present.</P>
    <P>We hope in the future to have a telephone service second to none in Western Europe.  We are laying solid foundations.  The exchanges and cables being provided at present will be able to deal with a great expansion in the number of calls.  Coupled with the growth in the economy has been the growth in the number of applications for telephones.  At present I believe we are keeping pace with the applications, which are running at 14,000 a year.</P>
    <P>At present we are in the process of making the system automatic and, at the same time, dealing with increased applications for phones.  As a result, we are bound to encounter trouble.  The old system is carrying more calls than ever expected of it.  During the holiday period, it is much harder to get calls through because of the increased number. We are working with an overloaded system at present, but it will only be a matter of time&mdash;and not very long&mdash;until we will have a good service.</P>
    <P>To make sure that the best use is made of the available men and machinery, the Post Office have been developing area by area.  It may be annoying that a person who applied only a couple of months ago gets a phone at once because he happens to be in the area being developed.  But if they dealt with the matter in the order of applications received, these men would be running all around the country, and we would find that in the long run the phones would not be installed as quickly.  You must keep your labour force together in order to make the best use of it.</P>
    <P>Our postmen have been giving exceptionally good service over the years. In view of the modern trend towards mechanisation, I should like to see the Department providing them with motor cycles.  I saw in last night's paper <Col N="1084" /> that a motor scooter had been provided for a postman in Naas in my constituency.  We should have that all over the country.  It would speed up deliveries.  Where the postman has to go down long boreens and open a gate, these scooters would be as easy to use as a bicycle.  It is a step in the right direction, and I hope it will not be long until these scooters are provided all over the country.</P>
    <P>The postmen have had the same uniform for many years&mdash;the same pattern and the same material.  The uniforms for the personnel of other State services have been improved&mdash;we have had a new Army uniform&mdash;and I believe the postmen should also be given a more up-to-date and distinctive uniform, a uniform with much more appeal.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that auxiliary postmen can now sit for an examination to become permanent postmen.  That is a very desirable step, because over the years the only way a postman could become permanent was to qualify as a telegram boy and gradually work his way up.  That was all right in the big towns and cities, but in the rural areas a telegram boy is rarely employed, and there was no way for a man to become a permanent postman.  There is nothing a postman would like better at the end of his days than to be able to draw a pension as a reward for the good services he has rendered over the years.</P>
    <P>Our stamps have been changed frequently.  In doing so we are honouring our patriots, or someone of international importance or something that is happening in the world.  Stamp collecting has become very popular all over the world.</P>

      <P>Stamp collectors like to see new stamps being issued, and our stamps help to make Ireland known throughout the world.  People like to compare their stamps with the stamps of other countries.  The designers of our stamps are to be commended because they compare favourably with the stamps issued by other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> Coming back to making the Department a paying concern, I am glad that other Departments have either to pay cash to the Department or enter transactions in their ledgers for services that were provided free before. This gives the Department a chance to operate like any commercial organisation. They have to account for everything.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs should be the same as any other Department.  When other Departments get services from them, they should be paid for them.  I am surprised that has not been done before.</P>
    <P>We can all be very proud of the services Telefís Éireann have provided. We may have had our doubts originally when the service was mooted.  We wondered whether, with our small resources, we would be able to compete with the services in England provided by the BBC and ITV, because they had so much money at their disposal. Ours is a small country, and we had very few television sets here. We certainly have provided a better service than that provided by the big concerns across the water.  Sitting at home, a person has only to press a knob to turn on either Telefís Éireann or the BBC, and I think it is seldom that anyone leaves Telefís Éireann. The amount of advertising they are getting is proof that they are providing programmes that anyone would be pleased to watch.</P>
    <P>They have selected very good programmes. I know some are from America and elsewhere, but every television service has been doing that.  It would be impossible to provide 100 per cent Irish-devised programmes. We should provide some outside programmes to widen our views and to let us see the way other people live. In this modern age, with the world getting smaller, we should also be able to project our ideas to other countries.  I am sure some of our programmes will go out to other stations. I know that people in other countries, particularly in Europe, are curious about Ireland.</P>
    <P>In our situation, with England between us and the rest of Europe, people <Col N="1086" /> from the continent are inclined to stop in England and not come here, although that practice is breaking down now.  Quite a number of people would like to see what Ireland is like. We take programmes from other places, and we can send out our own programmes to them.  Films made here will go out from here and will be a help to our tourist industry.  I should like to compliment Telefís Éireann on providing programmes of which we certainly can be proud.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the morning collection service for Tyrrellspass, Rochford Bridge and Milltownpass&mdash; three towns within an area of six miles. Although there is a morning mail delivery in the three towns, the postman does not collect the mail until the afternoon.  The post office van comes from Mullingar and Kilbeggan to those three towns.  The post is collected at 8 o'clock in the morning in Kilbeggan and the van then comes to Tyrrellspass, Rochford Bridge and Milltownpass but it does not collect the post.  The business people in those towns would greatly appreciate that service if they had it.  In the past few months Bord na Móna have changed from Derrygreen to Rhode. They also would appreciate this extra service because the post is collected around 4 o'clock or 4.30 in the afternoon.  It is difficult to have business finished up at that time and if business letters were posted at five or six o'clock in the evening, they could be collected in the morning and sent on their way.  Post for Dublin would be delivered that afternoon. The people down there feel that they are neglected.  My suggestion would not mean the postman having to work any longer hours.  He is there delivering the mail and all he need do is collect.  I ask the Minister to look into the matter to see if there is anything that can be done.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to pay tribute to the Department officials for the courteous way they have always treated me, either through correspondence or in interviews.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to make one thing quite clear.  The increase in postal charges is a cruel taxation <Col N="1087" /> device designed to collect a further £2 million for the Exchequer, and everybody knows that.  It is levied on the letter, which will now cost 5d, and which must be one of the highest rates obtaining in the civilised world.  It will be levied by an increase of 50 per cent on the cost of telephone calls and by a virtually prohibitive increase in the cost of telegrams.  Who will pay it?  We have 300,000 emigrants in Britain, with whom, I suppose, their families have to correspond; they will pay it.  Everybody who makes a telephone call, whether on personal or business matters, will have to pay 50 per cent more than heretofore.  That is a tax not only on the ordinary people who use the letter post but it is a very material charge on every business in the country.</P>
      <P>The alibi for this is that we must make the Post Office a profitable commercial enterprise.  I want to say most categorically that, in my opinion, it is a cheap device to impose further taxation on the people and the case in relation to the commercial accounts of the Post Office is a fraudulent attempt to conceal the true facts.  Can you imagine anybody having the effrontery to come forward and say that he proposes to insist on the Department of Posts and Telegraphs being operated on a purely commercial basis and, in the next breath, announce that there are 14,000 applicants for a telephone, waiting anything from six months to two years to have the telephone installed? What is commercial about that?  In countries where the telephone is operated as a commercial institution, countries like the United States of America, all the most expensive advertising media available are habitually employed to induce people not only to put in one telephone but to put in three telephones. Here, unless you belong to a very privileged section of the community, unless you are a doctor, or a clergyman, or something of that nature, you are lucky if you can hope to get a telephone within two years.  There is nothing commercial in that kind of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> If you look at the record of the Post Office, you find that it contributed by way of surplus in 1958-59 £277,000, in 1959-60 £389,000 and, in 1960-61, £368,000.  I did not hear any outcry by the Minister in those years relative to reducing the charges because the surplus which came into the Exchequer was of that dimension.  Now, surely, if we are to have it on the swings we ought to get it on the roundabouts.  If people are to be blistered, because the Minister says he had a surplus last year of only £46,000 when he had £389,000 in 1959 to play about with, then there ought to have been a corresponding reduction in the charges he demanded from the public in that year.</P>
    <P>The explanation is, of course, that such a thought never occurred to the Minister's mind.  The surplus was surrendered to the Exchequer and went into the general revenue.  The trouble now is that the Government think they will not get enough out of the Post Office this year as an additional source of taxation.  There is an easy way to collect more money from the masses of the people in order to provide for the ever-rising requirements of an Exchequer which is spending this year £250 million in comparison with the £108 million they spent six or seven years ago.  We have Deputy Crinion now so perfectly brainwashed that he tells us everything is going up so we must all keep going up with it.  Of course, that is a glorious philosophy under which to live.  But that is what is wrong.  Everybody is getting more money but the money is buying less, and less, and less.  The further we travel along that road the more disastrous will be our awakening when we reach the end of it.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister some specific questions now.  I am informed that there are 3,000 members of the Post Office Workers Union who have some wage claim outstanding with the arbitration machinery and they are impatient for a hearing and a decision. Perhaps the Minister would be able to tell us what the situation is in regard to that and whether there is an early prospect of the case being disposed of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not know that.  It is the Minister for Finance <Col N="1089" /> who deals with pay claims.  The arbitrator has to make an award and one cannot just tell an arbitrator to make his award.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand the position and I appreciate the Minister's difficulty, but would I be right then in saying that the matter is in the hands of the arbitrator&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the evidence having been completed on both sides and the Government are awaiting the arbitrator's decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be unreasonable, would it, for the Minister to indicate either directly to the arbitrator, or through the Minister for Finance, that he has been hatching on the matter long enough and he must make up his mind sometime? While no unreasonable pressure should be brought on the man in that position, there comes a time in the affairs of men when a man has to make some decision.  We do not expect him to be impatient.  We expect him to make the best decision he can. Brooding on it indefinitely will not bring about any better decision. Indeed, it may create a very understandable impatience and illwill among the body of the men who are awaiting an award.  I am sure the Minister will do all he can to stir the arbitrator into activity.  I want to draw his attention to the fact that there is a sense of grievance in that the excogitation of this award appears to have gone on too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having dealt with the fraudulent misrepresentation in that this excessive increase in postal rates is actuated by nothing but a desire to restore economic stability to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, I want to recall that on previous occasions when this Estimate was before the House, I directed attention to the fact that the persecution which telephone subscribers were getting from trying to dial 31 and 10 was wellnigh intolerable.  I remember counting the number of times the bell rang.  I counted up to <Col N="1090" /> 40.  I want to tell the Minister quite frankly that that situation has materially improved.  I find now that the service in the city of Dublin in respect of 31 or 10 has materially improved.  I suspect that has been done by increased staff.  I do not know why the Minister did not do it sooner.  That can be done, and has been done and it would be a good thing if it were done a long time ago.  Now that it has been done I am anxious to combine criticism with a fair acknowledgment of the improvements that have been made.  An improvement has been made in respect of that modest matter.</P>
    <P>I do not want to depart from the fraudulent misrepresentation that every Government service must be made to pay its way.  I find that a peculiarly irritating fraud from a member of the Government who is operating a wide variety of enterprises.  We do not hear in regard to CIE that it must be made to pay its way.  On the contrary, we are about to legislate to give it £2 million a year on the assumption that it will not pay its way.  We do not lay it down as a law of the Medes and Persians that Irish Shipping must pay its way.  It is losing about £750,000 a year.  We do not say that it is absolutely essential that Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. should pay its way.  It lost £250,000 last year.  We do not say that the Verolme Dockyard should pay its way. We gave it a grant of £900,000 last year and we are undertaking to give it additional free grants this year.  But when it comes to the Post Office, it is trying to make its contribution to the revenue and it will do so at the expense of everybody who wants to post a letter or make a telephone call.</P>
    <P>I do not mind people who are incompetent.  I do not mind people who are unable to do their job because I am prepared to assume that they are doing their best.  I do, however, very much dislike fraud and hypocrisy, which I suggest to the Minister are fair descriptions of his representation of his position now that he has been marshalled by his colleagues in the Government into becoming a supplementary taxgatherer, as he has been on this occasion.</P>
    <P>There has been some discussion here <Col N="1091" /> to-day, and on previous days, about Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann.  In that connection, I want to say a word about the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra.  It is a very good little orchestra and I am told that we are in danger of losing perennially first class musicians because the rate of pay we provide for them is not sufficient to keep them in the orchestra.  I want to be as fair as I can in that regard.  I know the difficulties.  The best instrumentalists in our orchestra are naturally attracted by the opportunity of securing similar employment in larger centres.  Even though the pay rates may be approximately equal, there are wide opportunities in large and popular centres like London, Birmingham, and Edinburgh where supplementary employment of one kind or another&mdash;teaching or giving recitals &mdash;can be obtained, which may not be so readily available to supplement their professional incomes here at home.</P>
    <P>There is a fairly generous provision being made from the resources of Radio Éireann for the symphony orchestra.  I think it is a matter the Minister could well discuss with the Radio Éireann authorities as to whether something further does not need to be done to ensure that the best talent in the orchestra is not habitually tempted away because an orchestra could very easily over the years become secondrate if there were a continued haemorrhage of the best talent it had.  I think the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra has a fine record and is a very valuable national asset.  The Minister would be well advised to discuss with the Director of Radio Éireann whether anything further requires to be done in order to enable the symphony orchestra to maintain its reputation.</P>
    <P>The immense influence of television cannot be over-emphasised.  I often think that as between the atom bomb and television far the most dangerous and, at the same time, far the greater potentiality for good is in television as compared to atomic power.  At first glance, that might sound an extravagant thing to believe.  I do not think <Col N="1092" /> it is, because when all comes to all atomic power in all its forms, both for the service of mankind and for the possible destruction of mankind, can do no more than serve a body of mankind or destroy them.  Television coming so intimately into the home of every family in every country operates perennially on the minds of the people, and not only the mature but the very young.  It operates on them in a way which I do not think the radio has ever done or ever can do.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when we consider television, I think we should realise we are considering perhaps one of the most important powers that exist in the world today.  Some steps have been taken here of a very preliminary kind to use television for education in the schools.  I think that is a very good thing too, and I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that the use of television is steadily expanding.  When you realise how effective it is as a medium of education, it begins to dawn on you how formidable it is as an influence on the minds of us all and how irrevocable its effect can be on the minds of the young.</P>
    <P>With that thought in mind, I think we are constrained to ask ourselves, if we are determining the policy for television, what must be the primary purpose of the Television Authority.  I often wonder how many of us ask ourselves that question. I think the answer to it is that the primary purpose of the Television Authority must be to entertain and unless you recognise and accept that fact, you ask of the Authority the impossible.  If you set a variety of standards, dismissing from your mind the overriding obligation of the service to entertain, you will easily reach a stage in which a whole series of programmes would be on the air with nobody looking at them.  But when you have recognised that the primary purpose the Authority must have in mind is to entertain, you must also recognise that that very capacity to entertain gives them an audience on which they can have a devastating influence if it is not properly directed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1093" /> On the whole, I feel the Television Authority has been doing a reasonably good job.  It is quite impossible to please everybody but generally the programmes put out by the Authority are reasonably good.  I have heard many people talking about the quantity of canned material televised here. I know no country in which there is not a great deal of canned material televised and I do not see how you can construct a full day's programme without using a good deal of canned material to which I have no objection if the canned material is good.</P>
    <P>We should review again the proportion of time given to commercials.  We are getting dangerously near a point when the commercials constitute a very serious blot on our programme. It is, I think, true to say that in Ireland the commercials do not constitute the same kind of annoyance as they do in the United States.  There are a great many commercial stations in the US carrying a higher percentage of commercial advertising but, then, ours is not a commercial station; it is being operated as a public service and the advertising revenue is merely a contribution to the Exchequer for providing the service at all.</P>
    <P>I shall go no further at this stage than to say that I think we have reached the very limit of what should be permissible in appropriating time for commercial advertising but I suggest to the Minister that this is something on which vigilance must be maintained or we may lose the entertainment quality of the programme. Personally, I find I am irresistibly drawn to the BBC programmes simply because they are not perennially interrupted by commercial advertising.  I find exactly the same objection to the Ulster television service.  I wish the day would dawn when we could provide our people with a service on the same basis as the BBC and, perhaps, some day we shall. Is the Minister in a position to say offhand what is the total revenue received by the television service here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it means there would be that much of an additional charge on the revenue if that income from commercials were not available. Given that the television service is, on the whole, providing a reasonable programme and doing its best to improve it, I want to emphasise the urgent necessity for objectivity in the news service.  I was once asked by an interviewer whether I favoured the present system of an independent board running the television and radio service here and I said I did, although I felt sometimes that in the reporting of news, their objectivity was not beyond question but I felt they were really striving to the best of their ability to achieve that stage of objectivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is true, but there are certain difficulties with which a new service naturally has to contend.  One is that the Government have at their disposal a number of opportunities for portraying themselves on occasion before the television cameras and they take every opportunity of exploiting that.  The Television Authority has to report in its television news what is presented to it as news.  I think we carry that a little beyond the limits of reason.  The Television Authority on one occasion recently felt obliged to film a hunt&mdash;I think it was near Leixlip&mdash;when one of the star features of the news item was a picture of the Minister for Justice in his red coat and riding boots and silk hat riding away into the middle distance.  It was actually an agreeable event but I do not know that our television screens need necessarily be encumbered with that inuring spectacle.  That sort of thing can be arranged and it is hard for the Television Authority, if a Minister is prepared to go cantering <Col N="1095" /> off in a blaze of glory, to turn the cameras elsewhere.  Perhaps my rebuke might be better addressed to the Minister for Justice rather than to the Television Authority.</P>
    <P>There are certain specific matters on which I think I could make helpful suggestions.  We have a programme relating to the proceedings of Dáil Éireann which I think is called &ldquo;Mostly About Politics&rdquo;.  I think there is an error of judgment involved in it but I believe it is an error made in perfectly good faith.  In order to introduce a note of variety to the programme, the practice is to employ a number of persons to speak the words attributed to various Deputies.  I think that is a mistake because the actual tone of voice employed by a person giving a broadcast can carry in it a wide variety of implications.</P>
    <P>If you purport to reproduce what a Deputy actually says, I suggest that should be done by what we were told in school is <i>oratio obliqua</i> instead of <i>oratio recta.</i> If it is to be done <i>oratio recta,</i> then the same voice should be used for all the Deputies the reporter purports to report.  Otherwise, individuals may take legitimate offence at the voice employed which is designed to ceate the impression among listeners that it accurately represents the voice of the Deputy reported.  In these cases objectivity, in my judgment, is best served by using the same voice and leaving it to the public to pass judgment on the merits of the contents of what a member of the House has said rather than to the reporter's understanding of the form in which he says it.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that the primary obligation for maintaining objectivity and equality rests on the Television Authority and, therefore, if the Minister for Justice wishes to canter about unduly for the purpose of publicity the Television Authority must either limit its reportage of his cantering or take steps to ensure that the public activities of other political Parties are correspondingly reported. What I want to emphasise is that I think the obligation rests on the Television <Col N="1096" /> Authority that, if through no fault of their own, an undue amount of publicity comes from one side, they must cut that down and balance on the other side in order to maintain fair objectivity.  I think this has been achieved to a very remarkable degree by the BBC in Britain and from every other point of view, I think that is a peculiarly desirable thing.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word about the radio. There is a great danger that with the advent of television, we will all assume that Radio Éireann has no interest or significance at all.  That would be a very grave error because a very odd revolution has taken place since the inception of television here and elsewhere, that is, the introduction of the portable transistor radio.  But for the emergence of the portable transistor, radio broadcasting would have very largely ceased to have much significance, but now it has had a complete new birth of value and influence and forms a very important and valuable part of the lives of a great many people. Anyone who is familiar with the domestic scene, with the woman of the house carrying around her transistor as she goes about her daily chores, will realise how important the entertainment value of the portable radio is, not to speak of the value it has for all the people who are confined to their beds or to their rooms.  To them the transistor radio has made an immense difference and the radio programmes are of great value to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy A. Barry spoke about the different kinds of music that are provided and we all recognise that it is reasonable and necessary to cater for every taste.  Some of these programmes are quite excellent but I recognise that they do not appeal to everybody.  I think particularly of Tommy O'Brien's operatic record programmes which are not only a delight to hear but contain such a wealth of charming history of music and opera, and they are a joy to anybody who shares his interest in the opera and music of the world.  I appreciate, however, that we have to bear with patience pop music and jazz and all the rest of it and that everybody is entitled to his own share.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> I think on the whole it would be fair to say that the Director General is deserving of congratulation on the work he has done since he took control of the station.  I am approaching the whole problem with as critical an eye as I can and the only real complaint I would have would be in regard to the failure to obtain complete objectivity in reporting.  I am not putting the thing any higher than that at present.  I welcome the evidence of some improvement in that respect.  I am quite prepared to accept that the best is being done to attain the ideal.  I shall continue to watch that development with interest and where there is real progress to offer my congratulations and where there is regression to make my criticism emphatically heard.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister has allowed himself to be used for the purpose of taxing not only those elements of our community least able to bear such tax but also for imposing a tax on business and industry which it is peculiarly inexpedient at this time to impose on them.  The necessity for this charge is purely in relief of the Exchequer and has nothing to do with any general principle about the Post Office paying its way.  When the Post Office is in a position to provide a commercial service, as that is generally understood in the world, then it will be entitled to set for itself standards of profit and loss which are associated with that kind of service, but when the Government are sponsoring a whole series of enterprises which are using anything from £2 million a year downwards, it ill becomes them, when they want to use the Post Office as a tax gathering instrument, to seek to justify that on the grounds they are doing it to make it a commercial institution which it certainly is not and which it has no right to claim to be until it is prepared to give those who patronise it the services they would expect from a commercial undertaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very trying at times waiting in this Chamber for hours and hours at a stretch for the privilege of getting the floor.  It was pleasant yesterday evening to hear so <Col N="1098" /> many compliments paid to the Minister. I, too, would say the very same things, perhaps in other words.  As an individual, I hope he will always be my friend.  His Department is now under review and last night I was pleased to hear that he has now acquired machinery for turning out special stamps, or will have it in the very near future.  I would suggest to the Minister that one of his first stamps should be one to commemorate that very wonderful patriot, the Irish Joan of Arc, Countess Markievicz who had the distinction of being the first lady to be elected to the British Parliament, and I think the first lady elected to the Irish Parliament, or at any rate the first Minister for Labour in this Parliament. After all that she sacrificed, it would be only fitting for the Minister to strike that stamp without delay.  It would mean so much to the youth of the country who can read about somebody so great.</P>
      <P>With regard to telegrams, and, indeed, the postal services generally, I wonder what would have been the position if, as mentioned by a Deputy, they had been let out to a company such as the Bell Telephone Company in the United States who go out of their way to encourage people to use the telephone or two or three telephones?</P>
      <P>The 5/- charge for a telegram here is equivalent to the cost of a telegram in New York City, 60 cents.  Surely there is no justification for that.  The Minister should consider a special charge at least for telegrams of greeting and condolence.  In the United States a postcard with a greeting not exceeding five words needs only a five cents stamp.  From the tourist point of view alone that is worth considering.  The increase in wages was only 12 per cent but increasing the cost of a stamp by a 1d. represents a 25 per cent increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never been one to query expenditure on the improvement of any service but I am not satisfied that the present increases are to improve the service.  I have been in the habit of sending telegrams of condolence in my constituency but at 5/- each that would be something about which one <Col N="1099" /> would have to think twice.  Will it mean that people will revert to letter writing instead of sending telegrams? I do not think this is a step in the right direction.  The Minister would be well advised to consider a special rate for telegrams not exceeding five words irrespective of the address.  I do not see any justification for this expenditure. I know we can throw £2 million to CIE or other bodies but here we are not throwing anything at all.  We are deliberately hurting the populace.</P>
    <P>In a question some weeks ago I asked the Minister if he would consider adopting the system of reversing the charges.  The reply was that he did not consider there was a necessity for it. It could happen this would be an advantage, say, to a motorist who might find himself down the country wanting to ring home.  The subscriber will not be hurt in this regard.  The subscriber has only to say: &ldquo;No; I will not agree to a reversal of the charges&rdquo; and that would be the end of it.  Assuming the subscriber did, would the Department not benefit from that call?  It makes me wonder whether the Department are serious when they say they want to make money.</P>
    <P>Quite a lot has been said about Telefís Éireann.  There has been a great influx of western films.  I have nothing against them; they are entertaining in their own way, but surely with the talent we have here films about the War of Independence could take the place of the war of cowboys and Indians in the United States.</P>
    <P>The Minister should endeavour to get closer to the working of Telefís Éireann.  I know that when a man is given a job he should not be interfered with unduly but the Minister is&mdash;I shall not say divorced because he has never been there&mdash;not close enough to the workings of Telefís Éireann from the point of view of administration. If he were I think there would be changes.</P>
    <P>As regards the introduction of politics into Telefís Éireann programmes, undoubtedly we must accept in future that television will be a medium for politics and electioneering. In view of the very few times I <Col N="1100" /> get the opportunity of speaking, it does not affect me very much but I do agree with the Leader of the Fine Gael Party that one voice should be used for the complete half hour of the programme to which he referred.  It would be no strain on the vocal cords and would obviate the irritation of listening to many changes of voice. Even if the Director of Telefís Éireann does not think it is a good idea, he should take cognisance of the fact that it has been expressed in this House that Deputies do not approve of the present arrangement.</P>
    <P>Postal boxes are not adequate in the city of Dublin.  Telephone kiosks are not adequate in the vast areas of Crumlin, Drimnagh and Ballyfermot. I have had replies from the Minister in this regard that he was advised that the kiosks were not so far apart and that it would not be a monetary benefit to instal them.  However, up to this we have never lost money on the telephone.  In the area I represent, Crumlin - Drimnagh - Ballyfermot, one would need to be in one's health to be able to walk the distance to the nearest telephone kiosk.  That is particularly serious in the case of an emergency. Last week I attended a funeral service in Mourne Road Church.  Someone wanted a taxi.  The nearest telephone kiosk from which to call a taxi was at Inchicore Bridge.  Some of the officials of the Department reckon that that is not too far.</P>
    <P>It is no pleasure to me to complain. I realise that Ministers have done their best and that the present Minister is doing his best.  In a way I feel sorry for the Minister because of the burden he has to bear.  If the Minister requires another £20 million for the telephone service and for television, I would be the last to say one word against it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister deals with the points I have made, quite a number of people will be very satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Tremendous progress has been made by the Department for which the Minister is responsible.  It is not so long ago that many rural post offices were without telephones.  The stage has been reached when not only <Col N="1101" /> are there telephones in all post offices, and telephone kiosks in prominent places in the larger towns and cities, but the demand for public and private telephones has increased enormously. That of itself has placed a strain on the Department, particularly in view of the fact that a good deal of the equipment in hand was obsolete.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years, anyone who wished could readily see for himself on most public roads huge cartwheels of cables being laid down by the Department, P. and T. men working in every area and the familiar sign &ldquo;Fir ag Obair&rdquo; on all roads.  The Minister and his Department are trying to lay a solid foundation upon which to build a good and efficient service and to make provision for better communications in as short a period as possible.  In order to do that, it is necessary to have the material and skilled men.  Last, but not least, it is necessary to have the money to purchase the equipment.  Therefore, I would totally disagree with motion No. 4 on the Order Paper, which says:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should not impose the increased postal, telegram and telephone charges announced by him on the 14th April, 1964.</P>
      <P>Deputies cannot have it both ways. They cannot expect to have all this expansion, to instal all this equipment, some of which has to be imported, and refuse to provide the money to pay for it.  That has never been the policy of this Government and certainly they will not adopt it now.</P>
      <P>It is only reasonable that the Minister would increase postage rates.  I admit that it may be a hardship but there is no form of taxation that is palatable to the average citizen.  In any case, the only method of getting the necessary money is to increase charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Post Office in general, I feel they are giving a very good service and are to be complimented on that service.  I refer in particular to the Savings Branch.  They are responsible for the very large <Col N="1102" /> amount of money placed in the Post Office Savings Bank each year and it is to their eternal credit that that money has been handled honestly and that public confidence has been created so that the amount deposited is increasing annually.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to Telefís Éireann.  My view is that the ordinary people do not seem to have grasped as yet the enormous significance of television and the influence any television authority can exercise over the people in virtue of the fact that television programmes can penetrate into the most backward parts of the country and anyone who has a television set can have access to those programmes. It is, therefore, vitally important that the Minister keep an eye on televised programmes in order to ensure that they are suitable for the youth of the country.  Slick propaganda can penetrate where armies have failed in the past.  I respectfully suggest that, while Telefís Éireann are doing a reasonably good job, there are many aspects of our culture and of our life that could be featured in television programmes. A watchful eye should be kept on programmes.  There should be an annual review of programmes to see if changes are necessary or if certain personnel should be taken to task.</P>
    <P>I am particularly glad to know that Telefís Éireann will be used as a medium of education.  School programmes have been televised for secondary schools.  Ultimately there will be a television set in every national school.  There should be no avoidable delay in that respect.  Programmes should be prepared by expert teachers for use in these schools.  Electricity should be available by now and it should be possible to provide a television set in each school so that, at least, the senior pupils could have the benefit of school programmes from Telefís Éireann.  Such programmes could be of tremendous importance in fostering the national language and giving stimulating lessons in history, geography and other subjects on the national school curriculum.  There is great potential in television in that respect.  At present it is only in its infancy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> Radio Éireann still plays a very important part in the entertainment of people in rural Ireland.  There are many families who cannot afford a television set and many who have not a radio but who gather into neighbouring houses and listen to Radio Éireann. Much more use should be made of Irish music and culture generally, and a greater search made for undiscovered talent.  Very often we get the same people week after week.  Thus, greater efforts should be made to contact new talent, people who are not heard of possibly because they cannot afford the cost of travelling to Dublin for auditions; or for other reasons.</P>
    <P>I shall make only one passing reference to the symphony orchestra, to which I referred at some length last year.  The orchestra is, to my mind, burdened too much.  Certain people in both Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann seem to think that the majority of our people were reared very close to high-class music, whereas in fact the only type of music the vast majority of our people had the opportunity of hearing in their young days was that of the ordinary concert flute and fiddle.  I do not think we should fall over ourselves to foist on our rural population these high-class performances of foreign music.  I do not say there is not a place in our broadcast programmes for the symphony orchestra, but too often the programmes are overloaded with such performances in proportion to the time allotted to other types of music.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to refer, in his reply, to a matter that concerns my constituency&mdash;the building of the new post office at Cavan.  I know the money has been made available but there is some delay, whether from the legal point of view or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I shall end by congratulating the Minister and his Department for their work during the past year.  I honestly think they are doing a tremendous job. We cannot expect either the Minister or the Department to do the impossible, but they are doing their utmost to push ahead with the much needed improvements to the services.</P>
    <Col N="1104" />
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The public have very short memories and many Deputies seem to suffer from the same complaint. About ten years ago, if you wanted to telephone somebody outside my constituency, you had to lift the receiver, put it to your ear, sit down and smoke a cigarette while you sat and said: &ldquo;Hallo, hallo, hallo&rdquo;.  That was about a decade ago.  I look back and consider that we have made immense improvements since then.  We have jumped about a half century in terms of time.</P>
      <P>Now in ordinary circumstances, one can get a Dublin number in a matter of minutes.  However, I do not think the Minister and his Department are hearkening sufficiently to the law of supply and demand.  We are told by the Minister that there are 13,000 applicants still clamouring for telephones. If that number were not waiting now, you would still have 13,000 ready and willing to take the service if they felt they could get it in a reasonable time.</P>
      <P>For that reason I am sorry the Minister finds it necessary to assume an apologetic mien when he comes in here each year to explain which services are responsible for increases in the Estimate.  An expanding market exists for the use of the telephone and I submit there is every excuse for borrowing money to improve an amenity which, though not fully enjoyed by the present population, will be used by posterity.  There is every good reason, therefore, why posterity should be asked to pay part of the improvement cost by way of loan repayments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increases in the Estimate caused by such improvements are not profligate. They are increases that every citizen should welcome.  Most of the increases the Minister has asked for are to pay for additional engineering staffs, for stores, contract work and for additional operating staff.  All these matters, particularly in relation to engineering and operating staffs, will mean more work for young people leaving universities and technical schools.  That is a very good thing.  A lot of the stores will come from Irish factories and a lot of the contract work <Col N="1105" /> will be done by Irish firms, meaning more work at home for Irish people. All this will go to bring about a modernisation of our system of communication.</P>
    <P>Though we have improved to that extent during the past decade, we are rapidly becoming old-fashioned again because of lack of drive, because the Department have not kept up with the needs of the times, and I would appeal to the Minister to do much more from this point of view during the next ten years.  I have said there have been improvements in the telephone system generally in the past decade.  That does not mean that I, in my personal capacity or as Deputy for my constituency, am 100 per cent satisfied with the system we now have.</P>
    <P>The direct dialling system between Cork and outside areas is certainly an improvement on what we had in the old days, but it is not 90 per cent or, in my belief and in the belief of many of the people by whom I have been sent here, even 80 per cent efficient. You can dial 01 for a Dublin number and you can get a subscriber anywhere between the house next door and Malin Head.  You are lucky if you get anywhere sometimes.  Yesterday I dialled 01 and got nothing at all.  I did not get nothing just once; I got it 10 or 12 times and had to dial the very courteous young lady at the other end and tell her that I got nothing and that I had dialled 01 with the intention of getting something.</P>
    <P>That is very wrong.  I am not raising this as a personal protest only.  A number of people who are paying a lot of money for the service and who will be paying a lot more money in the coming years, are having the same frustrating experience.  It is bad enough to get your next door neighbour's house when you dial 01&mdash;that might be interesting sometimes&mdash;but when you get nothing it is a very bad business.</P>
    <P>As I am on that, I would sincerely ask the Minister to investigate the occurrence, which seems to be very prevalent at least in Cork city, that when you dial one number, due to some mechanical fault, you break into a private conversation between two <Col N="1106" /> other people.  In Dublin, that must be embarrassing enough, but in Cork, where so many know so many others, it can be more than embarrassing. On several occasions I have broken into a private conversation.  I have known the two parties at the other end and I could if I wished, and had the time, have listened to these private conversations.  It is wrong that when a person takes the telephone he should be put in the position, possibly, of inviting anybody else attached to the telephone system to come into his drawing room and listen to a private conversation.  It is an important thing and I would ask the Minister to request those in charge of that part of the system in Cork to investigate it.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a question I asked the Minister on the 30th April last about a very serious matter.  It is a local question, but it is undoubtedly of national importance and application. It referred to the dialling of 999 in emergencies.  This was a case of dialling 999 while a house was on fire in which a woman lost her life. It is questionable whether she would have lost her life had the 999 system worked in Cork city on the night in question.</P>
    <P>The Minister's answer did not give satisfaction to me or to the people of Cork.  All he said was that before and after the crucial moment the 999 system worked.  But during the crucial moment when six different people, including newspaper men, were trying to dial 999 it did not work.  The Minister gave no explanation.  He said it might have been due to a mechanical fault. The incident occurred around midnight. He said a mechanical fault was discovered at 2 a.m. and rectified quickly. In a half-hearted way he did his best to exculpate the staff.  He said there was no question of failure to answer immediately any 999 signals received in the exchange.</P>
    <P>In a serious matter like this I would expect the Minister categorically to assure the House that no element of human error or negligence was involved. I would expect him to say that a most searching inquiry would be made.  It is not sufficient that this matter should be investigated by a <Col N="1107" /> coroner at an inquest.  It is a matter of such importance nationally that the Minister should investigate it very fully and not dismiss it in the rather cavalier manner he showed when answering my question.  In his reply he said there was a number of calls on the 999 system that night before the crucial call was put through.  There were calls at 9.21 p.m., 8.10 p.m., 11.30 p.m. and 11.36 p.m.  Then there was the time during which the abortive call came.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to refer to bogus calls.  The feeling was in Cork that maybe in the Cork exchange and in other exchanges throughout the country they are not inclined to reply to these 999 calls because there are so many bogus calls.  We all deprecate bogus calls.  It is very hard to look into the mind of a person who would engage in that sort of pastime.  I would seriously suggest to the Minister that he have a chat with his friend, the Minister for Justice, and suggest that police patrols should pay more attention to telephone kiosks, from which most of these calls emanate.  I have seen three or four children packed into a kiosk.  I have remonstrated with them.  They were obviously there for the purpose of putting through some sort of bogus call.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice could well ask the gardaí to pay more attention to telephone kiosks in cities and towns.  I have never seen a garda in the vicinity of a telephone kiosk, although they could well be there.  Not alone are bogus calls made on 999 but a very objectionable habit has grown up in Cork and Dublin of people using the phone to make immoral, vulgar, upsetting or threatening remarks to lone women and old persons.  A lot of that could be avoided if the gardaí showed more activity round kiosks.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal further with the question of the increased charges the Minister in levying on the public. Enough has been said by my colleagues on that matter.  I shall not go further beyond endorsing most of what was said from these benches and from the Labour benches.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> I would ask the Minister to ensure that the Department keep pace with the growth of housing estates in cities, both from the point of view of providing kiosks and from the point of view of providing better postal facilities. The Post Office seem to overlook the growth of housing estates in the suburbs of Cork.  The same number of postmen are engaged in the same areas, although the number of houses there has doubled.  It becomes patent to everybody that they are left for years and years.</P>
    <P>I should like to add my voice to those who have spoken highly of Telefís Éireann.  There is no need for me to reiterate&mdash;Deputy Dillon has already done so&mdash;the immense importance of Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann and the part they have to play in both the cultural and intellectual life of the country.  Telefís Éireann is teacher, journalist, leader writer and entertainer all rolled into one.  For that reason I have always regretted that this House has not kept some control over Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his opening remarks on broadcasting that he does not interfere in programme matters. I would much prefer if he were in a position to do so, but I know that by statute he is not.  However, any time he gets an inquiry from a Deputy he should try to elicit the information and give a reply in this House.  It is important that those who have the immense power in their hands, given to them by the people through this House, should be given the benefit of the criticism levelled at them here by way of Parliamentary question.  I would ask the Minister not to use the device of saying he has no function in the matter.  At least, he can forward these criticisms to Telefís Éireann and ask them to give an answer.  He can still add his own comments if he feels strongly about the matter.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the programmes on Telefís Éireann or Radio Éireann are objectionable.  They are not.  There have been occasions when I felt like phoning the programme editor myself about something.  But I have never done it, and the sun has <Col N="1109" /> never gone down on my anger.  Therefore, it must have never been very grave.  Generally speaking the standard of the programmes is good, too good sometimes for the man with a growing family.  Now, while this may sound farcical, I seriously suggest to the Minister that he might suggest to Telefís Éireann that there should be some sort of good light programme about 8.30 p.m. to cater for the children, with a reminder at the end of the programme that they should go to bed.  From the point of view of getting children to bed, Telefís Éireann is becoming quite a problem.  Most of us who have children know the persuasive powers they have when they want to stay up longer at night. Previously it was difficult for them to find an excuse but now there is always the excuse to stay up an extra ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, or, indeed, an hour.  If Telefís Éireann were to introduce some spurious finality into its system at night, it would be of tremendous benefit.</P>
    <P>Whilst, on occasion, one might find something about which to protest in regard to programmes, the advent of Telefís Éireann has been, I think, of immense significance, importance and usefulness to the country.  The political programmes have been very useful.  They have in many ways introduced a new interest in politics. I must respectfully now dissent from the views expressed by Deputy Dillon that the voices in the programme &ldquo;Strictly Politics&rdquo; are not a good idea.  I like the voices very much, particularly the voice that mimics the Minister for Transport and Power. That always amuses me greatly.  I think the voices introduce a note of diversity and make it easier to listen to the programme.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment Telefís Éireann on the programme &ldquo;Rebellion&rdquo; and I suggest that programme should be revived.  It dealt with the period 1916 to 1922 or 1923.  It was inspiring.  If it were revived even once more, it would be beneficial where the younger generations are concerned.  It should be revived, of course, at a time when they are available to look and <Col N="1110" /> listen.  There is one plea I would make. Deputy Dillon referred to the matter, too.  It is the new rash of commercials to which we have to listen.  No matter how beautiful the lady who uses the shampoo may be, when she comes in every threequarters of an hour in an otherwise interesting programme, one is inclined to get fed up.  Neither are we interested in the fellow who smokes a particular cigarette, nor in the Educational Building Society.</P>
    <P>There are no two ways about it. I am quite certain the ordinary TV watcher would be quite ready to pay an extra £1 a year in order to banish some of these commercials from the programme.  Advertising on TV is the sort of advertising that cannot be got anywhere else.  In other words, the advertising market is a restricted one, and economics is the science of scarcity.  Therefore, if Telefís had fewer commercials, they could charge more for them.  If the Authority showed the same consideration as the Minister has done in relation to increasing the cost of the services supplied by his Department, there would very quickly be a fall in advertising on Telefís.  The Minister will mulct those who use telephones, the little girl sending a Valentine to her boy friend, the man who sends a telegram of sympathy to someone bereaved, or a telegram of congratulation to someone who is being married.  Let Telefís charge in the same way for advertising and thereby ensure we will have less of them.  Obviously advertisers think it is worth the money.</P>
    <P>We live in an age of propaganda and the sooner we realise it the better. Nearly everything that emanates from a news agency has a value of some kind.  I believe we should use TV unashamedly to impress on our people the importance of Christian principles. We should make quite sure we keep out the kind of vulgarity which is the pseudo-sophistication people look for nowadays in entertainment.  They have had their palates whetted for it by nearly every second film.  I hope and trust that Telefís Éireann will not at any time fall for that type of entertainment. Let us avoid that sort of sophistication.  I do not object to <Col N="1111" /> sophistication but sophistication nowadays seems to deteriorate into vulgarity. I hope that will not happen on Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked the Minister to keep his eye on the programmes; he thought that was necessary.  I think the House should keep its eye on the programmes.  I know we have tied our own hands in this matter but I would suggest that not alone should the Minister keep his eye on Telefís and Radio Éireann but that every Deputy, if he sees something objectionable or hears something questionable, should immediately ask the Minister by way of Parliamentary Question for his views.  It is not sufficient that a service of the importance of Telefís and Radio Éireann should be subject to review only once a year; it should be subject to day-to-day review in my opinion.  If the Minister receives inquiries he should send them on to the Authority asking for the Authority's views on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter that interests me most is the increased charges for the services rendered by the Post Office.  I believe people who use services should pay for them.  It has been suggested that the Post Office should be subsidised like CIE and other bodies.  I wish that these services, with which comparisons have been made, could increase their charges to the level at which they would be able to carry on without subsidisation.  In the case of CIE the problem is one of losing traffic.  In the case of the Post Office it is a question of increasing demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the Government embarked on a programme for the development and expansion of the telephone service at a cost of £30 million.  It is only right and fair that those who demand services should pay for them. It surprises me to hear Deputies, particularly Labour Deputies, suggest that the Post Office should be run out of general taxation.  I do not see how they can find anything to be gained by that argument.  A general taxation levy to meet the bill would reach into everybody's pocket, irrespective of <Col N="1112" /> whether or not the person uses the services.  From that point of view the argument surprises me somewhat. Speaking as one who spends a good deal on these services every year, I would personally gain considerably if this cost were met from the Exchequer. Ordinary commonsense dictates that the payment should be made by the people who use the service rather than having it as an impost on the people in general.</P>
    <P>Who will pay this bill?  It will certainly fall on the business people who use the services to quite a considerable extent, and on those in the private sector who write an occasional letter. Perhaps they write a letter once or twice a week.  If we try a comparison, it would probably take 1d, 2d or 3d on the bottle of stout to provide the necessary couple of million pounds, or it would take an equivalent increase in income tax, and the person who would be hit would be the ordinary wage earner.  He would have to pay the bill for the people who write letters or use the telephone.  It is right and proper that those who use the services, whether often or occasionally, should pay the bill.</P>
    <P>We are not entirely satisfied with the services we get for the money we pay.  This follows on the demand by the public for telephones.  There is an accelerated demand for telephones.  I am sure every Deputy, many times during the year, has to write a letter to the Department saying: &ldquo;Please instal a telephone for someone who wants it urgently.&rdquo;  The usual answer we get is: &ldquo;We cannot do it until certain development takes place.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the sum of £30 million which is earmarked for development.  I would ask the Minister and his Department to accelerate the spending of that money to the greatest possible extent.  If we delay too long, and if this programme runs for five, six or ten years, I have hardly any doubt in my mind that the £30 million will not meet the bill.  If there is immediate action to assist in the construction of these services, they will be of benefit to all.  The quicker the services are made available, the sooner income will accrue from them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> The Minister and his Departmental chiefs and officials should immediately call upon the services of everyone they can, including, if necessary, experienced outside contractors to do this work.  I remember many years ago when work was given to outside contractors. They did excavation work and the laying of cables.  That has been stopped, and, so far as I know, the work is now left entirely to the employees of the Post Office.  That may have its own compensations but, in the long run, if the work is left to those people only it will take many more years to complete &mdash; probably double the time&mdash;and it will lead to ever-increasing demands and ever-increasing pressure on the postal services, and at the same time, poorer services for those using them.</P>
    <P>The demand for telephones is increasing at a rapid rate.  Indeed, one could say that in this day and age, people are proud of the fact that they can give you their telephone number. I should like to see not only the urban areas being serviced by the telephone but also a growing demand from the rural areas.  In all parts of the country, no matter where they live, people want to be in closer touch with all the services they need, including being able to ring their friends and relatives from time to time.  The Minister can look forward to an ever-expanding demand for the telephone service.  He should seriously consider accelerating the construction of the service to meet that ever-growing demand.  If he does not, there will be continuous complaints from the public about an inadequate service and a growing demand for even the service that is possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Post Office trying to sell their services.  In conjunction with the development of this new construction programme, and the investment of the £30 million, the Minister should consider selling the services and getting more people to use it.  It would be an easy seller and a ready seller.  It may be possible over the years to stabilise to some degree the telephone and other Post Office charges.  The more people use the services, the greater the turnover to the Post Office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1114" /> We find in selling anything today that the thing to do is to make it look attractive and neat.  I cannot say I am enamoured of the way the telephone, the telegraph and the Post Office services are displayed generally. We see the harp and a lot of green colouring.  The Minister and his staff should consider very seriously adopting the international sign of the Post Office, that is the post-horn. That is the international symbol and most people know it.  It is truly indicative of the services being offered. In addition the Minister should consider changing the colour.  We see CIE have had some success in that matter.</P>
    <P>The Post Office should adopt some different and distinct colour for their purposes.  My suggestion would be dark blue with an orange or chrome band, and no matter where people saw it, on a telephone kiosk, on a post office, a sub-post office or a Post Office truck or van, they would know it was the symbol of the Post Office.  It could also be used on pillar boxes and they could be placed in different positions. Now they usually obstruct the footpath. Such improvements would be helpful to the people in general.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with television. I cannot say I have much time for looking at television.  I am very pleased with what little I see on television.  I think it is a very excellent medium of entertainment.  The programmes are certainly all excellent, as far as my tastes go.  I cannot say I have heard much criticism about the television service.  I think the educational programmes are excellent too.  I like looking at &ldquo;On the Land.&rdquo;  There is certainly something to be learned from this programme.  Urban dwellers find the programme both educational and entertaining.  The Television Authority and the Director General deserve a little clap on the back for the job they are doing.  There are things which will have to be checked in relation to certain aspects of the programmes and I doubt if they will ever succeed in satisfying everybody's taste.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Dillon's remarks about political debates.  I cannot <Col N="1115" /> see that anything could be usefully achieved if the Minister and the Television Authority were to adopt his suggestion.  I just wonder how you could entertain the public and balance programmes.  When any Party supporter looks at political broadcasts he feels there is a certain amount of political bias against his Party.  I feel there is a certain amount of prejudice at all times against us.  No matter what we can do, I think, at times, it is safe to say that we are a wee bit sensitive and that we will not be entirely pleased.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose, when it comes to television news, is to give the news.  I know it happens, from time to time, that Ministers of State are reported more than others.  If I were in charge of television I wonder how I could keep them out of the news.  If you keep them in the news, how can you get compensating factors, as suggested by Deputy Dillon?  I feel confident that the programme arrangers and managers do their best. I certainly am not going to harp on any particular person.  As far as I am concerned, they are doing an excellent job and I hope they keep it up.  We should let it become known, if we find something obnoxious to our particular tastes.</P>
    <P>I cannot say a lot about Radio Éireann as I do not listen to the radio at all, except when I am travelling. When I am driving west of the Shannon and put on my radio, I get a lot of interference, which I cannot explain.  As regards programmes, I am afraid my interest lies generally in the field of sport.  I like to listen to the news if I have the time.</P>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs covers many services, radio, television, post, telephone services and the Savings Bank.  Indeed, it is also cashier for the Department of Social Welfare.  One wonders if certain economies could not be adopted.  We hear, sometimes, grievances from temporary postmen about their pay, their hours of employment and their routes.  I think all these matters should be examined <Col N="1116" /> with a view to effecting economies.</P>
    <P>I know we all like our letters delivered right to our doors.  I wonder whether in future we will be able to afford to have postmen cycling up half a mile of a boreen or walking probably 200 or 300 yards across a field to deliver a letter.  We will ultimately have to become realistic in this matter. We will have to get down to the fact that more of our services must pay for themselves.  There must be a review generally of all these services.  Do we need all the sub-post offices we have throughout the country, or could other Government agencies handle some of that business?</P>
    <P>There are Department of Social Welfare offices in most towns and I wonder could these offices not cash the pension cheques for the Social Welfare recipients?  Many subpostmasters work very long hours and stay up at night to keep the telephone lines working, but this will not be necessary any longer with the introduction of the automatic telephone system.</P>
    <P>There should be a re-examination of the number of sub-post offices to see if they are all absolutely necessary. The sale of stamps can be very easily arranged and post boxes can be erected in many different places. There is a very good service in this regard except for pockets here and there.  There should be some reorganisation of the sub-post office services in order to bring about, if at all possible, a degree of permanency in this type of service.  Subpostmasters would, after a while, cease to exist and we could have properly graded post offices with all postmasters in pensionable jobs.  I have great sympathy with the subpostmaster who has a very small income for a service which is very onerous at times because of the amount of business done.  It is very hard to justify economically and then we come back to the old story: &ldquo;It is a service; let the people pay; it does not really matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The whole matter of Post Office services should be re-examined to ensure that the services are adequate <Col N="1117" /> and that economies can be effected. It merely requires searching, checking and probing along the lines I have indicated.  If that is done, I am quite convinced that the Post Office can be made to pay its way, reasonably at least.  After a time charges can be held at a certain level and I think every means should be adopted to achieve this very desirable end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Minister has presented an Estimate for the coming year of £15 million odd, and that is, I think an advance of some £2 million on the previous year.  The Dáil can recall, in the autumn of last year, that there was an increase in the charge for radio and television licences.  Despite the increased income from that, it was necessary, in February last year, to introduce a Supplementary Estimate of £330,000.  I have no doubt that, despite the increased telephone charges planned by the Minister, and estimated to bring in £2 million odd in the coming year, probably next December or next February, there will be again a Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are owners in fee simple of 43 acres, 2 roods and 25 perches of lands on the Hill of Tara. This area was acquired from the Land Commission in 1954 and contains Rath na Rí and Rath Laoghaire.  The remainder of the lands on the Hill, about 70 acres, is owned privately.  On those lands are situated The Rath of the Synods, the Banqueting Hall, Rath Gráinne and the Sloping Trenches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between 1954 and 1962 the Commissioners of Public Works were negotiating with the owners for the <Col N="1123" /> purchase of their holdings, and subsequently Bord Fáilte endeavoured to acquire the lands, with a view to having the site transferred to the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The Hill of Tara is the subject of two Guardianship Deeds dated 1908 and 1922 respectively which, I am advised, afford adequate protection to the site.  It is an offence in law punishable by fine or imprisonment or both to disfigure, deface, alter, or in any way interfere with the archaeological remains or to excavate, dig, plough or otherwise disturb the ground on the Hill without the consent of the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The National Monuments Act, 1930, gives power to the Commissioners to acquire the site compulsorily, in which event the price to be paid would be determined by an arbitrator.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no evidence that the reductions in duties and the enlargements of quotas which have been made have had the effect of reducing the protection enjoyed by the textile industry below a reasonable and effective level.

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that there is any comparison whatever.  As far as I understand it, the margin of protection for the home distillers was something about 5d a gallon against imports chargeable with the preferential rate of duty.  This would be practically negligible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always possible for the Government to make slight adjustments one way or another.  As the Deputy knows, there have been cases recently of a very high importation of goods of a dumping character from certain countries and there have been certain upward adjustments of tariffs.  The Minister is entirely flexible in his attitude where a particular need exists.  He has given warning to the industrialists in this category that quotas are to be increased and has asked them to take advantage of re-equipment grants and of methods to modernise their industry and to engage in marketing procedures for securing more exports and so on.  The Deputy should know of the progress that is being made in this direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that the Government's policy in respect of the removal of protection is making it easier for the British to send in woollen cloths, but on the other hand, the woollen manufacturers here are finding it increasingly difficult to send their products to England because of the embargo which the British Board of Trade has put on woollen cloths.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are empowered to acquire, by agreement or compulsorily, land which they require for the purposes of their powers or duties.  They may also acquire by agreement land which in their opinion they will require in the future for those purposes.  I would not think, however, that a local authority would be entitled to acquire land surplus to their requirements with the specific intention of disposing of part of it at a profit which could be applied to reduce the cost to the authority of providing building sites or other works or services.  Where a local authority wish to dispose of land which they hold and which they consider is no longer required for the purposes of their powers and duties, they may do so for the best price obtainable.  They can if they wish put a reserve price on the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education what steps he will take to protect the educational and career interests of candidates for this year's intermediate certificate examination if the examination is not held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 72 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>The issue concerned involves asking me to upset the decision of two separate and independent arbitrators, one for national and a second and later one for secondary teachers.  It is implicit in this that I should decide unilaterally to widen the differential in the matter of salary between secondary and national teachers established by those two independent arbitrators.  As I am not in a position to do this even if I so desired, it was necessary for me to contemplate the possibility of holding the Certificate Examinations without the co-operation of the members of the Association of Secondary Teachers.</P>
      <P>When I announced that it might be necessary to abandon the holding of the Intermediate Certificate examination I had in mind that my Department with its own resources and with such outside help as was available to it could hope to carry through only the Leaving Certificate examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not state definitely that the Intermediate Certificate examination would not be held as I was and still <Col N="1160" /> am hoping that the other interests associated with secondary education would co-operate with me in the holding of the examination or that the Association of Secondary Teachers, even at a late hour, might see the impossibility of what they are seeking, being granted.</P>
    <P>I am not speculating as to what may happen in the event of the Intermediate examination not being held and with your indulgence, a Cheann Comhairle, I appeal here and now to the Association of Secondary Teachers, for the sake of those children on whose behalf their members have expended so much labour and care, to withdraw the advice they have given.  I would ask them to remember specially that a large number of pupils who take the Intermediate Certificate examination do not return to school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>While appreciating the problems which affect the Minister and without wishing to express any view on the issues involved, I take it the Minister appreciates the importance of indicating as early as possible to those concerned whether the examination will be held or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the anxiety caused by the uncertainty and for that reason I have announced that the Leaving Certificate examination will be held.  I should tell the House that the holding of these examinations without adequate outside help will involve diverting the staff of the Department away from other activities. It may involve the closing of the Museum and the National Library for a while to get the staff there.  The Leaving Certificate Examination will be held, marked and the results given out in the normal way.  I have no intention of standing by and allowing about 20,000 children to be disappointed after three or four years' study by not having an Intermediate Certificate examination.  As I have already explained, I am not in a position to give what the teachers want.  I should like to say for the sake of those in doubt that it is my intention that the Intermediate Certificate examination will be held and it is my belief that it <Col N="1161" /> will be held.  I will not go further than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an unfortunate status dispute with the Minister. Would the Minister not agree that a quicker solution might not be provided if he would have discussions right away with the secondary teachers and find out how far they are prepared to get this matter finished?  It is an unhappy position and the Minister has the sympathy of the entire House.  But sitting down and talking to them will remove the atmosphere of long-distance discussions which has been going on for the past few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clarify two points?  Before coming to his decision on the conciliation and arbitration award, did he offer to discuss the points at issue with the secretary of the teachers' organisation? Secondly, did the arbitrator, in considering the case of the national teachers, purport to establish a differential between them and the secondary teachers and, if so, was any representation invited or received from the Association of Secondary Teachers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>If the House will permit me, I should like to separate this idea of the examinations from the grievances.  No matter what pressure the secondary teachers bring to bear on me, I cannot unilaterally or bilaterally in agreement with them, solve their grievances.  The only action open to me at the moment is to hold the examination with whatever help I can get.</P>
      <P>The grievances, which are a separate item from the children and their examination, are a matter with which I cannot deal at all.  This matter is dealt with at independent arbitration. The function generally of the Government in relation to arbitration has been to accept the recommendations of the majority of the arbitration board.  This is what the Government did.  There is no room for intervention by a Minister in such a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To explain what happened in detail, the national teachers have their own <Col N="1162" /> individual arbitration board.  The secondary teachers have their own individual arbitration board.  I did try to get a common arbitration scheme for the lot, which might have avoided a good deal of trouble, but I did not succeed in getting agreement.  You have individual schemes and decisions are made.  In the first case, it was a decision improving the position of the national teachers by increasing their salaries.  Since this was the national teachers' arbitration scheme, the secondary teachers could not be dealt with in that scheme.  Over the years, different arbitrators have decided awards to the national teachers by taking as a yardstick their relative position with the secondary teachers. This was done this time.  There was no place in this scheme where the secondary teachers could come in. They had no rights, in this scheme. There was no change made in their salaries.  It was the national teachers' salary which was improved.  The change did bring them nearer the secondary teachers' salaries.  At a later date, as a result of Government policy, all teachers had their status improved.</P>
    <P>The secondary teachers went to their own arbitration with their own independent arbitrator, agreed on between them and the Government.  It was one of their nominees the Government accepted.  In the normal scheme of arbitration, they argued against the Official Side for about six days for a widening of the relativity fixed at the national teachers' arbitration board. The majority of the secondary teachers arbitration board decided that the relativity fixed at the national teachers' arbitration should stand.  This decision was made at an arbitration board in which there were secondary teachers advocating the opposite.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a narrowing of the differential?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

There is no certainty as to which it is and the Minister would allay a great deal of uneasiness if he were able to indicate which of the stations is likely to be closed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary)</i>: When progress was reported, I was dealing with the telephone service and the general distress evinced by most speakers in the House in relation to delays in installing telephones up and down the country.  On every occasion on which this matter is raised here, the defence offered by the Minister is invariably the same&mdash;difficulty in securing equipment.  He states that all telephone equipment has to be imported. I raised this matter at Question <Col N="1170" /> Time but I did not get very much further with the Minister.  He reaffirmed that no telephone equipment is produced here and that there is the greatest difficulty in securing supplies from abroad.</P>
      <P>I quite appreciate that certain telephone apparatus is of a highly technical character and, in the field of telecommunication in particular, considerable technological advances have been made, and I recognise, too, that there may be some restrictive commercial practices.  However, looking at the position from the point of view of one relatively unversed in these matters, all I see coming into my house is a wire with a telephone receiver at the end of it.  When people come to me, looking for a telephone, that is all I see going into their houses. I fail to understand, therefore, what extreme difficulty there is in producing in this country equipment of the nature required.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister has ever consulted with his colleague in the Department of Industry and Commerce in these matters and, if he has not done so, I would recommend him to do so without delay.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why some part of the equipment essential for the extension of our telephone service could not be produced by ourselves. There is a considerable market. The Minister intimated that there will be a considerable extension in the system over the next few years.  Anyone who looks at the programme outlined in the Budget in relation to the telephone system must appreciate that there will be a considerable expenditure of money.  It seems to me the Minister would be well advised to have another look at the position to see if anything can be done, not alone from the point of view of our own commercial interests but also from the point of view of expediting the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned, in his opening statement, that this Estimate contains no provision for the 12 per cent increase in pay.  He understands that the Minister for Finance will introduce a global Vote to cover this at a later stage.  I did not gather from him whether it is included in the £215 <Col N="1171" /> million revenue produced by the Minister for Finance here a couple of weeks ago.</P>
    <P>Looking over the Minister's address, I find he stated that 1,150 new trunk circuits were established.  He mentioned, in particular, Waterford, Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir, Carlow, Portlaoise, Limerick, and so on.  He went on to deal with the 22 new automatic exchanges.  In my constituency, not only in regard to exchanges, but in regard to the telephone services generally, there has been a considerable degree of well-nigh neglect, particularly of Tipperary town and one small area in my locality, the village of Dundrum.  I have been in communication with the Minister several times about the latter village.  I have been considerably annoyed about it, and I conveyed that annoyance and trouble to the Minister, and got the usual stereotyped reply.  I want to know when he intends to do something to resolve the problem in Tipperary town and in the village of Dundrum.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it was found possible to connect some 14,350 subscribers. When he said that, he was speaking of the provision of trunk circuits.  I take it that is 14,350 new subscribers.  The Minister does not make that clear, but that is the interpretation which I am putting on it.  If that number of new subscribers have been provided for in the past 12 months, my constituency must have been rather left out of consideration. The Minister also mentioned that people to the number of 13,000 odd are awaiting connection.</P>
    <P>When we open the Book of Estimates, we see that the first page deals with the new system of accountancy which is being provided for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The accounting system is to be streamlined and put on a commercial basis. A simple man reading that in the Book of Estimates would feel that now we are really going to get something, and that this is a first-class business concern. Of course, in fact, we find that this business concern has 13,000 people clamouring for telephones, and that <Col N="1172" /> this wonderful business concern is making a very inadequate effort to meet the public demand.  In order to silence that demand and, at the same time, get in a few handy pounds, the Minister is now introducing a new penal charge of £10 per telephone. That seems to be the reverse of what I would regard as a normal commercial course of action.  I would, therefore, appeal to the Minister to consider the question of telephone demands, particularly in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>I shall give him a concrete example, and I have sent him a letter about this. In the town of Clonmel a man applied for a telephone.  He is a cattle buyer, and he acts as agent for a cattle dealer in England.  Since last autumn, he has exported 1,800 cattle.  Nine months ago, he looked for a telephone in one of the main streets in Clonmel.  A telephone was removed from the house opposite to him in which there lived a hackney driver who needed a telephone for his business.  Anyone will appreciate that a telephone is a vital necessity for a cattle buyer who is acting as agent for a cross-Channel dealer.</P>
    <P>It should not create tremendous difficulty to give him a telephone.  When the telephone across the street was removed, one would have thought that surely it could be transferred to his house.  Yet he has been nine months looking for a telephone and so far the Department have been unable to provide him with one.  That is not only bad commerce; it amounts to virtual neglect.  There are many other cases, but that is an outstanding one.  I have drawn the Minister's attention to it just recently, and I am sure he will give it full consideration.  While I write to him about many other cases, this is one which I feel could be remedied quite easily, and should be attended to.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with our savings services and, amongst other things, told us that for the first time in our history we had reached a landmark as regards the Savings Bank and that we now have £100 million in the Post Office Savings Bank.</P>
    <P>The amount deposited last year was slightly up; the amount in the Trustee <Col N="1173" /> Banks was slightly down; and the amount of Savings Certificates was slightly up.  The savings service, and particularly the Post Office Savings Bank, as everyone knows, is the poor-man's bank.  I find it difficult to reconcile the practically static figure he has given with all this talk we have about our expanding economy.  I think that is a good index of the position of what we might call the poorer sections of our community and the less affluent members of our society.  The fact that those deposits have remained practically static suggests that that section of our society are certainly not enjoying the expanding affluence which Government speakers and some economists would like to persuade us they are enjoying.</P>
    <P>In his Budget speech, the Minister for Finance mentioned that he was going to arrange for improved Post Office Savings Bank and Savings Certificates facilities.  I fail to see any mention in the Minister's statement of any projected improvements in these two concerns.  In his reply, he might find time to advert to that aspect of things and tell us what plans he has put in train to meet the wishes of the Minister for Finance for improvement of these facilities in the interests of public saving.</P>
    <P>He mentions the co-operation of the post offices throughout the country in the issue of Prize Bonds and states that post offices have been responsible for collecting over £10 million of the total of £35 million worth of the Prize Bonds this year.  That is very praiseworthy and the Minister mentions it with a certain amount of relish.  But the Minister is a modest man and I am sure he often blushes for some of the past performances of his political associates.  I am sure he is not unmindful of the amount of condemnation directed at the inter-Party Government, the Fine Gael Party and the Minister for Finance in those days, who introduced these Prize Bonds several years ago.  He was also too modest to advert to the fact that, as I understand, since the introduction of Prize Bonds, the Government have made a profit of £25 million.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement <Col N="1174" /> to the effect that the intake of technician trainees is being doubled this year.  I welcome it in the context of the difficulty of expanding our telephone services to meet public demand. I feel that perhaps had the Minister taken that step a year or two ago, he might have been better placed to meet the increased demand for telephone services which exists at present.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been made by some speakers in relation to the treating of the Post Office as a concern which should be made pay its own way.  Up to a couple of years ago, it was making a small profit, as revealed in the Book of Estimates, but the Minister anticipates in the coming year a loss of, I think, £300,000.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary)</i>: I suppose whether you pay for Post Office losses by taxation or whether you ask the people to pay it through stamps, by and large, it is the public who pay it eventually.  We have a very big capital investment in the Post Office.  Last year there was a capital expenditure of £4.61 million and there is an estimated capital expenditure of £6 million for 1964-65.  According to the returns, the 1961 Telephone Capital Act provided £10 million spread over a five year period, giving a total of £50 million.  The 1963 Telephone Capital Act provided for a further £6 million spread over five years, giving £30 million, a total of £80 million. Considering we have the smallest number of telephones per thousand of the population of any country in Europe, it is obvious that considerable capital expenditure of that magnitude will be necessary if we are to bring our telephone services into a comparable condition with those of any modern European community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to reconcile that very heavy capital programme with the kind of pedestrian, ineffectual commercial approach of which the Minister and his Department are quite obviously guilty.  I do not totally blame the Minister.  He is merely trying to handle the heritage of other Ministers, but when we consider that we have a total authorised capital expenditure of <Col N="1175" /> £62.75 million, at the same time as we have 13,000 people clamouring for a telephone and not provided with this amenity, one naturally asks oneself what would be the position if a private commercial venture had that amount of capital invested.  Would they be in the position of having 13,000 people running to local TDs to write letters to the Minister begging him to put in telephones?  I would rather think they would have travellers on the road going from house to house, that they would be advertising on Telefis Éireann and on every newspaper pointing out the advantage of having a telephone, how you could double your business and improve your social life&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary)</i>: The reverse is the position.  We have 13,000 people pestering Deputies and every Deputy pestering the Minister about telephones.  So humorous has it become that the Minister now has a colossal stock of printed forms that he sends out to each Deputy.  I have often felt that I should like to call on the Minister and ask him to give me a few dozen of these forms so that I could send them out directly to the people who write to me.  That is very largely what happens and I do not say that to deride the unfortunate Minister who is the victim of a very indifferent performance down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister wants £2 million extra and he proceeds to raise the cost of the postage stamp, the telephone and telegram.  He explains this is necessary largely because of the ninth round of wage increases, as the expense of the postal and telegraph service is so largely a matter of salaries and wages. The service involves a large number of personnel and salaries and wages amount to something over £9 million. The Minister is now being hoist on his own petard or rather on the petard of the performance of his own Minister for Finance and Government who, by ill-advised taxes over a year ago, <Col N="1176" /> eventually provoked and made necessary the ninth round increases.</P>
    <P>I deplore the increases which are made necessary because I feel, first, that they will not ultimately benefit the recipients and that they will be back in terms of real purchasing power just where they were before.  I also deplore the increased charges now being introduced for telephones and postal services. These will not only mean a considerable burden on the poor sections of the community but will undoubtedly add to production costs and make our position less competitive internationally and add to the cost of commodities at home.  The added expenses, plus the other subventions which in the past year were placed on the community, will make our position in a world of free trade less competitive and that is the most serious aspect of this or the other increases the Government have placed on us.</P>
    <P>I also deplore the fact that despite the increased charges for telephones, telegrams and postage we now find, according to the Estimate, that instead of making a small profit, miserable though it was in view of the capital invested, the Minister dissipates in the coming year a loss of £300,000.  I think the Minister must admit that if there were no two-and-a-half per cent turnover tax and no ninth round, in all probability he would be able to come to the House today and produce an Estimate which did not demand increases in the cost of stamps, telephones and telegrams.  The ordinary letter, which a few years ago cost 2d., will cost 5d. now while in the case of our nearest neighbour across the Border it still costs only 3d.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in intervening in the debate is to draw the Minister's attention, if needs be, to the serious problems involved in and the repercussions arising from the interminable delay in the installation of telephones. To many laymen, the delay of so many months which is involved seems unjustified and unnecessary.  We know of no good reason why applicants for telephones in some of the main streets of our towns should be held up for six or eight months before <Col N="1177" /> the telephone is installed.  The many representations we have made on the subject to the Minister by way of personal interview, pointing out the hardship, inconvenience and loss of income caused by the lack of such a modern amenity have been of little or no avail. We have been told that the laying of trunk cables and such things must get priority.</P>
      <P>In my own town of Clonmel, there are a number of people who have been waiting nearly 12 months for telephones. All of them are important citizens actively engaged in business and the lack of a telephone has caused them great hardship.  There was an application by a firm of electrical contractors in one of our main streets, people who invested a lot of money in the town.  Despite repeated representations by Deputies of all political Parties, we have been unable to secure a telephone for these people, even though there are telephones adjacent to these particular premises.  From an engineering point of view, it would seem to us as laymen to be a simple matter to instal the necessary equipment for this much-needed telephone.</P>
      <P>I know for a fact that this firm has lost a lot of business because of its inability to obtain a telephone.  Two young men, electricians, who started the business, invested a lot of money in premises and equipment, have been asked by potential customers if they were on the telephone and they were obliged to say that they were unable to get a telephone and they have been bluntly told by these potential customers: &ldquo;You are no good to us; we shall have to go elsewhere for our electrical appliances and services&rdquo;. We have conveyed these sentiments to the Minister's Department but seemingly it is of no avail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again many garage proprietors in our more important streets cannot get telephones installed.  There is a grocery business which was raided by burglars and which is owned by a man who does not live on the premises and who wanted a telephone installed but he has not been able to get this essential service.  We have farmers who live outside the town but have businesses <Col N="1178" /> within the town and they cannot get telephones.  We also have the case of a garage proprietor in Clonmel who wanted an internal telephone for his premises and he has been applying for many months but has not been supplied with this internal communication yet.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to say that we must have priorities to this extent. The Minister should have regard to individual applicants in order of the importance of the business or profession and allot telephones in a fair way rather than throw down the gauntlet saying: &ldquo;Thus far shall we go with the installation of telephones and no further, until X, Y and Z works are completed.&rdquo;  That is an offhand manner in which to do business and shows a complete disregard for the hardship and loss of income caused to these people.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at the list of applications in my constituency, with particular reference to Clonmel.</P>
    <P>One of the first questions I tabled on entering this House in October in 1961 was to ask the Minister when it was hoped to have an automatic telephone exchange installed in the post office in Clonmel.  The Minister gave me one of the shortest replies ever heard in the House.  The answer was &ldquo;Four years&rdquo;.  I repeated that question nearly 12 months ago and the answer was again four years.  Seemingly nothing had been done in the intervening period to reduce the period. I do not know when it is hoped to instal this telephone exchange but I hope the period will be reduced by at least 2½ years.</P>
    <P>Recently I expressed concern about the erection of so many telephone and ESB poles throughout the countryside. I was somewhat heartened by the Minister's reply that he was conscious of the fact that these poles took from the scenic beauty of our countryside and was doing what he could to ensure that cables would be laid underground in the future.  I would appeal to him to accelerate that kind of work, to ensure that, where possible, cables will be put underground and thus eliminate many of these unsightly poles.</P>
    <P>We have a town and regional plan <Col N="1179" /> with which to conform and that plan seeks to bring about orderliness and preserve the beauty of our countryside and eliminate eyesores.  In that regard, I want to refer to the vast number of television aerials to be seen in most of our towns and cities today.  I need hardly say that this forest of aerials in our housing schemes destroys the beauty of many otherwise very lovely areas.</P>
    <P>There is an alternative and I am surprised that the Department have not availed of it.  Apart from the ugly appearance of these aerials, they constitute a danger and almost all local authorities insist that they must be insured.  They do constitute a hazard, as many chimneys were not built to support such weighty objects. I suggest to the Minister that he should consider the desirability of bringing into vogue these communal aerials which will eliminate the unsightliness of these forests of TV aerials and give the required reception for TV.</P>
    <P>One of the primary reasons I rise to speak in this debate is to bring to the notice of the House and the country the disgraceful state of affairs in our telephone exchanges.  I am referring specifically to night telephone attendants whose conditions and wages are nothing less than a scandal.  I make a fervent appeal to the Minister to end slavery in these night telephone exchanges.  The House may not be aware that these night telephone attendants are obliged to work for two weeks to secure a normal week's wages, that they must work 70 or 80 hours per week for an ordinary week's pay, that they work seven days of the week, Saturdays, Sundays and bank holidays and, to my knowledge, there is no such thing as overtime, bank holiday payment or anything else.</P>
    <P>These men perform a most important function.  They forfeit their time, their leisure and their rest and sit up all night in telephone exchanges doing a great social good.  They have great responsibilities in the event of a hazard such as fire.  They have to deal with ambulance calls, police calls, urgent calls to doctors, nurses and hospitals <Col N="1180" /> and with calls in cases of burglary and murder.  These men are the key to all these problems.  They bring worthwhile relief in emergencies at night.  This is their recompense, that they work for approximately 2/6d. an hour for 80 hours per week in order to garner in some £9 or £10 which is an average week's pay in these times. I am demanding that these people be granted a better deal and that this scandal in our telephone exchanges be ended for all time.</P>
    <P>The House must realise that the only places where there are designated night telephonists are Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Sligo and Dundalk.  Seven of the major cities and towns of this country have designated night telephonists.  All the other towns have not and they are staffed in the way I have mentioned, by men bereft of conditions and who are offered slave wages and expected to be responsible for the life and property of our citizens while at rest.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that where there are more than 1,000 telephone subscribers in any town or district, he should designate a night telephonist immediately in the post office there. It is true to say that the appointed night telephonists have decent wages and conditions, but why there should be such a disparity between the conditions and wages of the officially appointed men and the temporary men I do not know.  The comparison is clearly odious, despite the fact that they all perform the same duties.  It is not good enough for the Minister's top ranking officials to suggest that there is not enough work at night for these men to justify their getting a better wage.  The facts are that they must put in seven or eight hours at night, give up their time, their leisure and their sleep and be on duty for any important calls that may be made. They should be paid on that basis and on that basis alone.</P>
    <P>When the Department are obliged, as they often are, to get other members of the staff to do this work, they pay them not merely their appropriate rate but an overtime rate on top of that.  That is why I wish to expose this scandal and to ask the Minister to take steps to ensure that decent conditions <Col N="1181" /> and decent salary scales, appropriate overtime rates and holiday payments, are made applicable to these unfortunate men.  I would ask him also to see to it that these men are not so grossly overworked, as is now the case, that they must work upwards of 80 hours per week.  The evidence is that, by reason of the kind of privation imposed on these men, some of them have been found dead on the job.  That has occurred in my constituency and in other towns in recent times.</P>
    <P>I have expressed concern, too, about reception from Radio Éireann in particular. The advent of TV is very laudable and I wish to pay a deserved tribute to Telefís Éireann for the wonderful effort they have put into televising great entertainment and programmes of cultural and educational value.  I think our people in the main appreciate the efforts of this young Authority.  However, it would seem the brains of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are being siphoned off towards TV and that Radio Éireann is being left somewhat in the lurch in recent times.  Programmes have clearly deteriorated.  The reception from this station is becoming progressively worse.  Many people who like to listen to the radio and would much prefer the radio to television, have been obliged to give up the radio in recent times, certainly in my constituency, as being worthless to them and have had to resort to transistor sets or television.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be wise if he had a look at the situation obtaining in Radio Éireann and saw to it that the station was not allowed to die. Many people feel that the station is being allowed to die a slow death.  The Minister should ensure that programmes are improved and in particular that reception is improved.</P>
    <P>I expressed a view to the Minister that our emigrants in Great Britain look forward with hope and enthusiasm to news from Ireland, especially on festive occasions.  It is quite common to see a host of Irishmen in their rooms or in the local listening to All-Ireland football and hurling finals on the radio or to a rugger match or a soccer match at Lansdowne Road or Dalymount Park, as the case may be, trying to glean <Col N="1182" /> what is happening in their own land.  I understand that it is extremely difficult to get reception from Radio Éireann in Great Britain.  I can well understand that.  It is logical that if I complain about reception in Tipperary, it must be so much worse in Bristol, London, Coventry or Manchester.  We must have regard to the millions of our race in these islands and I would urge the Minister to see what he can do by way of improving reception to ensure that our emigrants can keep in touch with the old land.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged that a foreign station is cutting in on the Radio Éireann wavelength and that this has been happening for some time.  The Minister ought to tell the House and the country what he is doing in the international field to eliminate piracy of this kind which is rendering reception from Radio Éireann virtually valueless from the point of view of the subscriber.</P>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that post offices are being availed of by the general public to an increasing extent every year.  Apart from the purchase of stamps and postal orders and the sending of telegrams, people are obliged to go to the post offices for many other purposes.  Application forms for old age pensions, blind pensions, contributory pensions, and so on are provided at post offices.  Pensions, such as old age pensions, blind pensions, contributory pensions and children's allowances are, in the main, paid through the post offices.  It is my experience that there is not sufficient privacy in post offices.  Greater privacy is required in places where people are expected to give an account of their domestic affairs or where questions are asked by officials in regard to private and domestic affairs.  I suggest that there is an obligation on the Department to provide privacy in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Cubicles are available in post offices for the writing of telegrams.  The equipment in post offices comprises mainly some rather musty ink and a steel nib pen, which is probably rusty and unusable.  The time has come when more helpfulness, more understanding and a greater appreciation <Col N="1183" /> of the needs of the public should be shown.  I ask for privacy in respect of claims for pensions.  It is patently wrong that any official should have the audacity to ask questions of a private nature pertaining to the applicant's circumstances and the circumstances of his family in a public or semi-public place within the hearing of other persons.  Such conduct on the part of any official cannot be condoned.</P>
    <P>I must say, however, that the officials in the post offices are highly trained, courteous and most considerate and it has been a source of pride to me to see the manner in which they assist the aged, the infirm and the blind in completing application forms or in respect of other business that they may wish to do.  That is how we should like them to be&mdash; courteous, considerate and kind to such persons.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the condition of many sub-post offices.  I put a question to the Minister some time ago with respect to sub-post offices. I was rather concerned to find that a building is designated to be a sub-post office and a person is appointed as sub-postmaster and we do not seem to be at all concerned as to the kind of premises in which the business is to be carried out.  It would seem that we are not at all concerned as to the facilities afforded in that post office to the public.  The premises may be old and dilapidated, lacking sanitary facilities, not having proper accommodation. They may even constitute a danger to the users of the premises. Apparently the Minister has no responsibility in the matter but I would hope that that is not so.  I would impress upon the Minister the desirability of ensuring that sub-post offices which are utilised by so many of the public are rendered safe and are provided with the equipment necessary to meet the needs of the users.</P>
    <P>I was concerned as to the entrance to a sub-post office where accidents had, in fact, occurred by reason of the number of steps leading to the entrance, where there was no handrail provided, and where the <Col N="1184" /> aged, the infirm and the blind were obliged to go every Friday for their pensions or for some other purpose. There were accidents.  I brought the matter to the notice of the Minister and I was told, &ldquo;Sorry, there is nothing I can do about it.  That is a sub-post office.&rdquo;  It is a post office, whether you call it a sub-post office or not, and the Minister who accepts the responsibility of designating that building as a post office should take care that the building is properly equipped, safe to enter from the point of view of the general public.</P>
    <P>It is disturbing in the extreme to learn that it has now seemingly become recognised practice that we have not just one Budget each year but two. That is a dangerous precedent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

      <P>The public have become used to a Budget, through which they expect the prices of certain commodities may be increased.  Last year we had the turnover tax.  This year extra money is being pulled in through increases in the prices of the pint, of spirits, of petrol, of smokes, even though we were told these had reached saturation point and that there was little hope of extra revenue being garnered from them in the future. That was the major Budget.  Now we have the minor one from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, imposing increases on stamps, telephones, postal orders, telegrams.  For the running of such essential public services as those included in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, any extra expenditure should come from the Exchequer.  We regard it as dangerous in the extreme to permit any Department other than the Department of Finance to present us with little budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my contribution to last year's Estimate, I appealed for better conditions for auxiliary postmen.  I said the obnoxious word &ldquo;auxiliary&rdquo; should be removed altogether from the vocabulary of the Department, that it was unjust and unfair to expect a man to carry out the full duties of a postman during perhaps 40 years of his life and continue to be designated an auxiliary official without recognition <Col N="1185" /> or status of any kind.  It would be far better to have such men established at a certain stage of their service rather than have them deprived forever of pension and other rights such as those enjoyed by their established colleagues. Were it not for the Rowland Hill Trust, many of these men, having given more than 40 years' service to the Department, would be forced to live in abject poverty at the end of their days and their widows and descendants forced to resort to home assistance. I wish to pay a well deserved tribute to the originators of that charity. Clearly it would take a very long yardstick to measure the good it has conferred on many widows and children of postmen who found themselves in straitened circumstances.</P>
    <P>The fact that such a trust had to be established to cater for workers within a State enterprise, a State service, is a serious reflection on the inhumanity of officials of that time and down through the years since.  That a charitable body of this kind had to be invoked is a clear indictment of the disregard previous Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs must have had for the welfare of postmen and their dependants. Consequently, I would ask the Minister to provide for auxiliary postmen, their wives and families not just charity but justice.</P>
    <P>I conclude by asking the Minister to see what he can do to extend Telfís Scoile, a service which must be applauded by all associated with education throughout the country.  I do not know whether this is within the ambit of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs or whether the responsibility rests with the Minister for Education who has been sitting in for the Minister during the afternoon.  I know the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is interested in education, too, and perhaps he would use his good offices to provide an extension of Telefís Scoile to technical and primary schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In these days, increased production is something that will make much greater demands on communications than those to which we have been accustomed in the past. As well as that, increased production <Col N="1186" /> will swell very much indeed the volume of those communications.  The expansion of our industrial production and of our foreign trade will be closely connected and completely interwoven with our communications.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, frankly a matter for regret that at a time when it is essential we should have better communications to facilitate and even stimulate production, we should have one member of the Government, the Minister for Transport and Power, engaged in the extermination of the railways and another, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, engaged in making the services provided by his Department so outrageously expensive as to be a clog on that production.</P>
      <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs cannot be allowed to jog along in the same old way.  If the Department are allowed to put a brake on our economic growth, that brake can very well seize up the whole works.  I want to put this roughly, but quite crudely, to the Minister.  I am certain that if he and I went up to the cattle market, he would be able to show me I knew nothing about the job going on there. I am certain that in relation to the buying, selling or judging of cattle, he would be able to show me points out of number and to teach me a great deal, more perhaps than I would ever have the capacity to learn.</P>
      <P>He would be able to show me that in that business I could not possibly hope to be efficient.  In these modern days, any organisation is only as good as the man at the top is in the running of it.  A person with the qualities of the Minister is not the person to run an organisation so vital to our economic growth and industrial production. I am afraid it is undoubted that what the Department of Posts and Telegraphs wants is to be completely shaken out of the lethargy of the last century.  That can only be done by a person at the top who is capable of injecting new ideas right down along the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only the other day, on the introduction of this Estimate, we got an example of how the Minister was prepared meekly to accept anything dished up to him when he admitted <Col N="1187" /> across the House, in reply to a query by me, that it had taken him 15 minutes to understand one particular sentence of the paragraph dished up to him.  After it had taken him 15 minutes to assimilate, he went on and produced it parrotwise here, instead of having the enterprise to alter the phraseology to something that could be easily understood by everybody. Those are not the methods by which the Department can be changed to what is required in these commercial days.</P>
    <P>We have seen it again in another example.  Deputy Boylan is listening to me.  He knows, as I know, that telephone communications in Kildare are chaotic.  It is utterly impossible to dial a call from Celbridge to Naas or from Naas to Celbridge without having at least four shots before you get the right one.  Yet everybody is perfectly happy about it.  I would not mind if we had a frank acknowledgment that these things were there, that they were appalling and had to be surmounted. But everybody goes along perfectly happy, and anybody who is so extraordinary as to complain is written off as a crank.</P>
    <P>I am not going to say that I do not get the most extraordinary personal courtesy from the officials of the Department, but that is not the point. The point is that the service is utterly inefficient.  Everybody will tell you that on the trunk line from Dublin to Naas, you never get&mdash;that is no exaggeration &mdash;what you want on the first occasion. Recently, I was laid up at home.  When I am laid up at home, I am afraid I am a menace to myself when it comes to my telephone account, and I am a menace to my friends and business associates because I have nothing to do at home except to telephone.  I deliberately kept an account of three days' dialling from Naas to Dublin. Out of every five calls, four calls went wrong, either because there was no tone when you dialled or an engaged tone before you got at the number&mdash; so that it was not the number itself&mdash; or you got a wrong number.</P>
    <P>That is not only my experience; it is the experience of everybody else. <Col N="1188" /> Only yesterday I was talking to somebody in the Celbridge area.  They told me I was lucky to be able to get my STD once out of five.  Very often they had to exceed that proportion.  As I say, if I complain, everybody rushes around and does his utmost to facilitate me.  I appreciate that and pay tribute to it, but it is not good enough that the system should be totally inefficient.</P>
    <P>It is not only in respect to the STD system that we have difficulty. Last year it was put in for the first time and the position was utterly chaotic.  I think we gave the Minister a fairly easy time in respect of it.  We gave him the opportunity of finding out what was wrong.  And, long though it took, eventually things did become better.  But in the last month or two they have particularly deteriorated&mdash;because of the coaxial cable, I suppose, I am not clear on the mechanics of it&mdash;on the line from Dublin to Naas, Newbridge and Kildare and the connecting line from those exchanges to what used to be the Maynooth, Dunboyne and Celbridge exchange and is now the Celbridge exchange.  It is bad enough to have to put up with this at the old charge, but to have to put up with it at the new charge is more than the people can bear.  They are not going to put up with it.  If the Minister is not capable of ensuring that the system runs properly, he should make way for someone else who is able to organise a business and make it run efficiently and properly.</P>
    <P>You cannot expect to have modern industrial production without the telephone. Somebody said here earlier that the effect of installing a telephone was to make one's social life more pleasant.  I disagree entirely with that aspect of it.  My idea of a pleasant social life is to get away from the place where one could be reached on the telephone.  It is not in respect of the social activity side of telephones I speak, but in respect of the industrial and commercial side.  Commercial life just cannot manage without proper communication services.</P>
    <P>The telegram has gone out of date. I sympathise with the Minister in his <Col N="1189" /> difficulties in respect of the telegraph service.  The more telegrams are sent, the more the Minister loses.  I can understand his difficulty in that respect, because he has to keep up the telegram service until such time as the telephone system becomes even more widely dispersed.  Then, perhaps, he might not have the same difficulty, particularly with the growth of Telex. A proper telephone system, which does not fray one's temper but puts calls through in a reasonable time without the present absurd waste of time, is something desirable for the commercial community and for the economic growth about which we hear a good deal and which both sides of the House are anxious to foster.</P>
