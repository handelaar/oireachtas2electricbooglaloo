      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in respect of each of the last three years the value of raw materials imported for the manufacture of margarine in the form of a <Col N="804" /> table in a reply of 1st August 1961; and the value at Irish prices of butter exported in the same years.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to give the value of raw materials imported and actually used in the manufacture of margarine.  The information available relates to the value of imports classified to certain headings in the Official Import List which include raw materials imported which could, among other uses, be employed in the manufacture of margarine, either in the state in which they are imported or after preliminary processing.  I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the value of such raw materials imported in each year 1961 to 1963 and also the total (f.o.b.) value of butter exported in the same years.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>VALUE of raw materials imported in each of the years 1961-1963 which could be used in the manufacture of Margarine</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>In October last, the then Ambassador received an invitation to unveil the statue referred to in the Deputies' questions and he replied that he would be unable to accept.  One of the considerations which affected his decision was that to accept would not only lend support to divisive influences but would give rise to demands for his attendance at other small presentations which might be organised subsequently. A process of this kind once it got under way would soon destroy the solidarity of the major Irish organisations which have been long established and doing magnificent work under their popularly elected leaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may add that apart from his normal diplomatic duties, our Ambassador in London receives hundreds of invitations every year to attend a wide variety of functions not only in London but throughout England, <Col N="808" /> Scotland and Wales.  Many of these invitations are related to the activities of the United Ireland Association and other Irish social and cultural societies. The memberships of these organisations embrace Irishmen with varied opinions on home politics, past and present, who are all proud and willing to work loyally together for the cause of a United Ireland and for the promotion of Irish interests generally.  The Ambassador accepts as many as possible of these invitations consistent, of course, with the carrying out of the many other duties of his office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Since there would not be more than one memorial to Collins in this place, this could not be called a minor affair.  Is it contended the Ambassador acted on that ground?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <P>No.  In fact, this was a rather inexpensive plaster statue, but that is not the point.  It is that the Irish people in London have succeeded in working together and co-operating, irrespective of their political views.  It is absolutely essential that they should continue to live down the old canard that Irishmen can never unite and that if they cannot get the leadership of an organisation, they run off and join one in which they will be able to appoint themselves the leader.</P>

      <P>The Ambassador got an invitation to unveil the statue, and he decided that to attend at this particular function would encourage divisive influences. He also foresaw that if he <Col N="809" /> went to this function, he might be asked to go to others.  It is important that Irish people should get together and stay together as they have succeeded in doing for many years.  There are a great number of very strong Irish organisations.  The leadership passes around, but if each time a man who goes forward for election and fails to get elected, jumps off and forms another organisation, where will they be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present dispute concerns part of the Board's staff&mdash;that is, the headquarters clerical and inspectorial staff.  Their salaries had been substantially increased as a result of my acceptance of arbitration findings by the late Professor T. S. Wheeler in December, 1961.</P>
      <P>On 24th December, 1963, the Workers Union of Ireland served a claim for further substantial salary increases for the staff in question, and it was made clear at discussions between my Department and the Union in February, 1964, that this further claim was in addition to the 12 per cent increase represented by the ninth round of general salary and wage increases.  The claim, plus the ninth round, would represent increases of 27 per cent at the minima of the salary scales, and over 35 per cent at the maxima.</P>
      <P>Following the meeting with my Department in February, the union furnished, on 2nd March, some information that had been asked for as to the basis of the original claim.  On 10th April, the union demanded the immediate payment of the ninth round, without prejudice to the claim served in December last, and that that claim be submitted to arbitration.  On 24th April, I approved of a 12 per cent increase, that is, the ninth round, on existing salaries as from 1st February, 1964.  On 13th May, the union served strike notice which took effect on 25th May.</P>
      <P>The staff employed by the Board on the Leinster cattle breeding service, who are not involved in the union's claim, also withdrew their service as from 25th May.</P>

Is it not right to say that the staff of the Dublin District Milk Board have been refused the use of that machinery?  Is it not further right to say that for the past two weeks no insemination has taken place, that there is an income loss of about £600 a week, that the farmers who used the service now cannot use it, and that nothing is being done to settle the dispute?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Supervisors, £503 to £770, increased to £955 to £1,130&mdash; an increase on the maximum of £260; inspectors, £650 to £710, and the award <Col N="813" /> was £610 to £940, an increase of £230. That award was, by comparison with similar grades in the Civil Service at the time, £117 more on the maximum than they were receiving.  A claim was made for an increase prior to the national agreement on wages, about one month or so before.  The national agreement was arrived at and was to cover a period of two and a half years. I implemented the terms of that agreement as far as the staff were concerned. I am quite conscious of what a strike, especially as it affects the AI services, means to herd owners in the Dublin area, but if a national agreement is arrived at in this way and if a small group of people decide to select a time for strike action that will cause the greatest havoc to those affected by it, then if we are to be moved around in our decisions by that sort of approach on the part of employees, it would be a very bad thing indeed.  While I do not want to say anything that would aggravate the position, I can at least say that, in my judgment, the people who provoked this strike were very foolish and I would say, having regard to the history of this case, fairly unreasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether or not there were any negotiations between the union and his Department?  Is it not a fact that when the union officials were at the Department, they were allowed to make a case but received no comment whatever from his officials?  Is it not further a fact that three stereotyped replies are all that have been received from the Department in reply to the letter sent in?  Is it not further a fact that those people have asked for arbitration which would, if the Minister's case is as strong as he says, find in favour of the Department?  The judges have got a substantial increase since and they are now getting another one.</P>

For my part, I hope my conception of justice is as keen as that of any man but that is not my conception of what is fair and just, and I deeply resent the fact that 19 or 20 employees will take action at a selected time and force out 40 or 50 important people at this particular season, when in fact they have been treated in a manner about which they could not justifiably complain.</P>

In any event, it has been common policy in this House to encourage foreign investment in the economy of this country.  That, I think, continues to be common policy.  Also, as far as our proposed membership of the Common Market is concerned, this would involve freedom of establishment which I think is accepted on all sides of the House as well.

Inquiries were, however, continued, in order to ensure that all contributions paid in respect of her late husband and all credits to which he might have been entitled had been accounted for.  To this end, communications were addressed to the widow on 29th January, 1964, 17th February, 1964 and 6th March, 1964.

The outcome of the inquiries which followed was that the claim was disallowed from 5th March, 1964, on the ground that the claimant was not unemployed.  Statutory regulations provide that where a person has another occupation, as in this case, from which the remuneration or profit is more than 6/8d a day, or its equivalent, he cannot be regarded as unemployed. The claimant's share of the profit from the dairying business substantially exceeded the statutory maximum.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would <Col N="830" /> refer the Minister to the reply he gave to Question No. 35 when he said the examinations will be carried out by persons who are fully competent to undertake the task, carrying the implication that there is no need for parents or children to worry about the results of the examinations.  Would the Minister then, having got over the first hurdle, in view of the fact that the most serious task lies ahead&mdash;the marking of the papers&mdash;make a magnaminous gesture towards a very honourable profession, which, in my opinion, has been very badly led and, in order to have good relations restored, agree to meet the secondary teachers so that the examinations and the marking of the papers will be carried out in the manner in which they have been carried out heretofore?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the Deputy's Party, I do not see anything contemptible about a gravedigger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They may be good at digging graves but I do not know about examinations.  Leave them at digging the graves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody took them away from digging graves except to make a joke of them and I should not like to do that.  The examinations this year will differ from every other year in only one respect: this year there are a number of people who would like to discredit the examinations. The reason is that they withdrew themselves from helping with the examinations and the reason they did that was that two arbitrators, in making salary awards, closed the gap which existed between national teachers and secondary teachers.  What the secondary teachers wanted me to do would, in effect, be to break away from arbitration decisions and open <Col N="831" /> that gap to the disadvantage of another group of teachers.</P>
      <P>I could not do that.  I explained to the secondary teachers that no matter what they did&mdash;if they withdrew from examinations, boycotted them, even if they succeeded in wrecking the examinations&mdash;it would not affect their position.  I could not change the relationship established at arbitration between them and the national teachers even if I were prepared to do so.  I told them that no matter what they did to the examinations, it would not affect that position.  Still, they not alone withdrew from the examinations but made every effort in their power to intimidate those associated with the examinations.  Now I am aware there are attempts to throw dirty water on the certificates that will be awarded. Nothing they do to the examinations can affect their original grievance.  I met them; we had a long discussion and I explained quite clearly what the situation was.  Even if the Deputy wants me to restore good relations, I can do it only at the expense of another group of teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that in 1963 when the Mangan award was made to the national teachers, the Minister altered that himself?  Is it not a fact that the decision of arbitration affecting secondary teachers was given in their absence?  Surely the Minister will appreciate that there is a case and that at this stage a man in his position should not grind his heel into the face of his opponents. For the sake of future relations between the teachers and his Department, would he agree to my suggestion to bury the hatchet, to meet the teachers and restore the harmony that was there and then have the examination papers marked on the basis on which they are normally marked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may clear a point &mdash;the Deputy stated that I interfered with the arbitration finding in relation to the national teachers and many secondary teachers seem to be suffering from the same misapprehension.  What the Government did was to take a decision following that arbitration proceeding <Col N="832" /> to raise the status of all teachers and what the national teachers got after the Mangan status award from the Government, the other teachers got also.  The secondary teachers now want the Government to intervene and raise one group of teachers at the expense of others, to widen the gap.  This is quite a different question.  All teachers got the status award that was given as a matter of policy by the Government to all groups of teachers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as burying the hatchet is concerned, all I can say is that all the energies and resources I have at the moment are required in getting the examinations done.  Everybody realises that it is not the end of the world but we must get the examinations done and the certificates this year must stand up to those of every other year.</P>

We discussed all the problems and I said no matter what they asked me to do they would not gain anything.  My fear was that they would get any idea that I was half-promising anything.  I made it quite clear that no matter what they did in respect of the examinations I could not do what they asked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state in connection with the reported discharge of a number of recruits from the Garda Training Centre at Templemore, County Tipperary (a) the number so discharged, (b) the nature of the infringements alleged against the men concerned, and (c) what opportunity was given to them to defend themselves against such charges.</P>

      <P>Under the Garda Síochána (Appointments) Regulations the Commissioner may at any time dispense with the services of any member of the Force who is on probation if he considers that such member is not fitted, physically or mentally, to perform his duties as such member or is not likely to become an efficient and well-conducted Guard.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Commissioner that, in the exercise of these powers, eight recruits have been discharged since the transfer of the Training Centre to Templemore.  It would be contrary to practice and in some instances perhaps unfair to the individuals concerned to give the reasons for discharge.  Before a decision was taken in any case, the recruit was afforded the opportunity of furnishing his observations and these, where received, were given full consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether it is intended under new arrangements that Castlerea, County Roscommon will cease to be a district headquarters of the Garda Síochána; whether he is aware of protests made by Castlerea Development <Col N="840" /> Association regarding this proposal; and if he will state the reasons for it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether it is proposed that Roscommon town will no longer be a divisional headquarters for the Garda of Roscommon and East Galway, and that, instead, Roscommon will be amalgamated with the Longford-Westmeath area; and whether under this proposal the number of Gardaí stationed in Roscommon town will be reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>I have not yet received the full recommendations of the Commissioner, Garda Síochána, arising out of his review of the existing policing arrangements for the Divisions of Roscommon-East Galway and Longford-Westmeath and, pending their receipt and consideration, I cannot say what changes are likely to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is common knowledge in Roscommon, and the other areas to which I refer, that the divisional headquarters is being changed to Athlone, and would the Minister, even though he has not officially received the report, make sure that at this stage no such change will be allowed to take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>These are matters in which I have to have regard to the opinion of the Commissioner in relation to the best arrangements for the policing of the country as a whole, and of different areas in particular. When I receive any proposals of this sort, whether they involve the change of a district headquarters, the reduction to one-man status, or the closing of a station, I shall give full regard to all local representations which I receive before coming to any decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister at times has shown wisdom in dealing with his experts.  Is he aware that the experts who are advising him on this division aim at spending £30,000 in <Col N="841" /> that locality on the basis that Roscommon will be the headquarters?  Surely the Minister could now consider it more advisable to listen to the views of other experts on a matter of this nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The town of Roscommon to which I have referred is in a bad way at the moment.  Any further reduction in its status, or the number of people living in it, will have a further adverse effect on that locality. Will the Minister bear that in mind when the decision is being made?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House knows, I am somewhat limited in the time I may take.  Therefore, if my replies to matters which have been raised here appear brief or scrappy, or in some other way unsatisfactory, I would ask the indulgence of the House because I am anxious to conform to the order the House has made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde referred to the incidence of heart disease and asked for a breakdown into age groups of the figures for deaths from that disease for the years 1962 and 1963.  I am having this information complied and I shall arrange to have it sent to the Deputy.  He may not perhaps be aware that a considerable amount of research on the subject of heart disease is at present being conducted here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies suggested that the Departments of Health and Social Welfare might be merged.  I should like to point out that the functions of the Minister for Health are primarily concerned with the treatment and prevention of ill health and those of the Minister for Social Welfare with the provision of an income maintenance service.  It should be understood that the health services are only incidentally concerned with economic considerations but social welfare services are directly designed to relieve economic hardship.  To combine, as a couple of Deputies suggested, in one Department functions so essentially different in character and operation would be improvident, and unwise and frustrating in its consequences; for one of the essential functions would inevitably be subordinated to the other, social welfare requirements being sacrificed to <Col N="852" /> health requirements or <i>vice versa,</i> to the detriment of the public as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. F. O'Higgins deplored the fact that I had accepted a grant-in-aid to enable me to continue with my hospital programme.  I should much prefer to do this without Exchequer assistance but I certainly would not go so far as the Deputy in contemning it. He seems to make virtue of the fact that it had been incontinently withdrawn from him in 1956-57 and withheld from him in 1957-58.  I am disposed to believe that neither the withdrawal of it, nor the withholding of it, in those years was done at his instance. For if they were, then Deputy T. F. O'Higgins would have been responsible for all the loss, inconvenience, unemployment and suffering that the virtual suspension of all hospital treatment entailed at that time.  This I do not think he would willingly be.</P>
    <P>The Deputy refers to a building programme which he had drawn up before he left in 1957.  It was a magnificent manifestation of optimism.  On the basis of prices ruling even in those days, it would have cost £5½ million. I am sorry to say my predecessor had not one red cent to give effect to it.  On the contrary, he had already received the proceeds of the 1957 Grand National Sweepstake in advance of the normal date, in order to meet pressing obligations in respect of work already done.</P>
    <P>There were 38 projects in my predecessor's programme.  For various reasons, nine of these dropped out of the programme and, of the remaining 29, 22 have been completed or are practically so, six others are in progress, and planning on the remaining scheme is well advanced.  In addition to these 29 schemes, other works, requiring about £3¾ million, have been completed, are in progress, or are being planned; so that by the end of the year almost £8 million worth of work will be in hand or in train.</P>
    <P>In his references to the Elm Park, Coombe and Erinville projects, Deputy O'Higgins was sadly served by his memory.  I must, therefore, remind him that so far as Elm Park and the Coombe were concerned, he had not <Col N="853" /> made up his mind as to whether these two particular projects or the new St. Laurence's Hospital or the Regional Hospital at Wilton Road were to be allowed to proceed.  In these circumstances, it is quite fanciful of him to suggest that under him work on Elm Park or the Coombe would have commenced in 1957 and been completed in 1960.  Even the mere planning of these major works would have occupied 2½ or 3 years; so that, taking into consideration the time to be allowed for tendering, it would have been 1961 or later before the necessary contracts were signed and the works begun.  All this, of course, on the basis that Deputy O'Higgins would have been in a position to finance the contracts from the Hospitals Trust Fund&mdash;a position in which, I must emphasise, he would not have been.</P>
    <P>As for Erinville, my predecessor agreed in February 1957 that plans for it should be examined and finalised, but that it should not be allowed to go to tender until 1958 or 1959.  In the case of this particular hospital, there have been grievous delays on the building and were it not for these the new maternity block would have been functioning over a year ago.  However, it was put into commission recently.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins expressed disappointment that I did not say that there would never be again a fear of a thalidomide type of tragedy in this country.  No responsible Minister could possibly give such an undertaking.  No matter how arrangements for the testing of drugs by manufacturers are improved, it will never be possible to give an absolute assurance such as the Deputy asks.</P>
    <P>In fact at the recent World Health Assembly the Director of Health Services of a European country said that while his country carried out strict clinical and pharmaceutical evaluation of drugs, the possibility was being considered of excepting possible mutagenic and teratogenic effects from certification of safety and efficacy. This is a matter which affects all countries and arrangements have been inaugurated by the World Health Organisation which it is hoped will <Col N="854" /> ensure that adverse drug reactions will be notified to it, so that this information may be disseminated to member states.  The steps to be taken by us in this connection are at present receiving consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne referred to the Select Committee on Health Services whose work he appears to regard as a &ldquo;parliamentary game&rdquo;.  Deputy Treacy also referred to this Committee in a manner which suggested that its findings could have been expedited and its report made available long ago.  A similar view was also expressed by Deputy Kyne.  One would think from all this, that the Government asked the Dáil to set up the Committee just to &ldquo;rubberstamp&rdquo; the proposals of the Labour Party in regard to health services.  If this had been the intention, no doubt the Committee could have reported long ago.  But that would have been, I suggest, to make a laughing-stock of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Committee was not set up to accept, endorse, or recommend in accordance with the preconceived notions of any person, or Party or body in relation to the health services. The resolution of this House requires it to make a thorough and independent appraisal of the whole of the existing system of such services; and this is precisely what the Committee is engaged in doing.  I suspect, however, that the attempts which are being made to jostle and hustle the Committee in its task derive from the fact that the more closely the investigations are pressed the more clearly it becomes established that there is no serious or general dissatisfaction with the health services as they exist.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne suggested that, even though this matter is at present under consideration by the Select Committee, I should make known, at this stage, what my intentions are in relation to the question of a choice of doctor for persons in the lower income group.  My intentions can be simply stated: They are to consider carefully any recommendations on this or any other matter that may be contained in the report of the Select Committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> It will be appreciated that the availability of doctors of choice is restricted by a number of factors.  In isolated areas, for instance, there might be no more than one doctor available.  There is also the point that any system designed to provide for a choice of doctor would, presumably, be operated on a panel basis.  If the service were to be extended to groups other than the lower income group, it is inevitable that the panels of the more popular doctors would be filled rapidly; so that some persons who would prefer to have the services of such doctors would have to be content with their second or third choice. Apart from all that, any scheme which would provide for a choice of doctor would be a very expensive one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne accused me of smugness when I said that &ldquo;we can justifiably claim that the quality of the health services available for our people is, on the whole, excellent and keeps pace with modern developments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He on the other hand expressed the opinion that it fell behind the standard of advanced countries.  Only an ignoramus could honestly hold that view and I do not propose to discuss it any further.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne has observed that &ldquo;it should be very exceptional that a mother should die in childbirth.&rdquo; Such deaths are, in fact very exceptional among us.  I am not saying that they are few or that they are not regretted but in 1963, there were 22 maternal deaths in 60,000 births, that is, roughly one in three thousand. Twelve years ago the rate was almost five times as high.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has asked that the social and financial status of mothers who die in childbirth should be investigated.  I think that such an investigation is inherent in the projected survey to be undertaken by the Irish Medical Association.  I shall, however, examine his further question as to whether it would be possible to secure similar data in relation to infant deaths; but my feeling at the moment is that the <Col N="856" /> studies in progress are likely to produce quicker results.  In connection with this whole matter, however, it would be well to bear in mind that anaemia in pregnancy is a complicating factor in relation to the health of both mother and infant and that anaemia occurs without reference to the income group of the family.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, among them Deputies Kyne, Treacy and Dr. Browne, advocated a comprehensive health scheme.  Two of them, Deputies Kyne and Treacy, suggested that the cost of such a scheme might be met from insurance contributions.  This question is being specifically examined by the Select Committee of this House, and I do not propose to deal with it now, beyond saying that estimates of the cost of such a scheme compiled in December, 1962, showed that, on the basis of the figures then available, it would cost in the region of some £30 million.  On the assumption that the taxpayer would, through general taxation, bear one-third of the cost of the scheme, this would involve a special insurance contribution in respect of gainfully occupied persons of 10/- each per week.  On the basis of current figures, however, the cost would be more likely to be £38 million a year and the special additional insurance contribution 12/6d. per person.  If the taxpayer were not called upon to bear one-third of the cost, this latter figure would need to be increased by 50 per cent, that is, to 18/9d. per person.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy seemed to think that individuals who were insured under the social welfare code contributed to the cost of the services available to them under the Health Acts.  This, I may say emphatically, is not the case. No part of the contribution of a person who is insured under the Social Welfare Acts goes to defray the cost of the hospital and specialist service available to him under section 15 of the Health Act, 1953.  The benefits which he receives under that section are entirely uncovenanted, conferred on him gratuitously by the Act in question, and I am surprised to find that Deputy Treacy seemed to be unaware of this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> Deputy Carroll urged that a doctor should accompany ambulances in accident cases.  This would be a completely uneconomic use of the services of experienced hospital doctors.  In the generality of accident cases no work can usefully be done for accident victims at the roadside or on the way to hospital other than to carry out first aid and resuscitation procedures. Anything more than that can best be done in the hospital.  Fire brigade ambulance crews which deal with accident cases in the city are trained in these procedures.  In the country areas, where such crews are not available, it is the practice for a nurse to accompany the ambulance on accident calls.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. Hogan <i>(South Tipperary)</i> had a very useful comment to make on the idea of special accident hospitals. The comment was of particular interest because of his experience in this field.  He certainly deprecated the idea that it would be of much use and, in support of this, the European Regional Committee of the World Health Organization, which discussed the organisation of resuscitation and casualty services last September, came to the conclusion that the establishment of special casualty hospitals was not to be recommended; and I am prepared to accept the views of the experts of the World Health Organization rather than those of some of the Deputies who spoke here in support of the opposite viewpoint.</P>
    <P>Deputies Esmonde and Leneghan raised the question of the provision of local institutions to take care of mentally handicapped children in each locality.  This is not practicable in a great many areas.  Apart from the need to provide suitable and separate segregation facilities for each sex, special facilities for maintenance, education and training are required for the different age groups and for persons suffering different degrees and different types of handicap.</P>
    <P>There is, too, the question of securing suitable and adequate staff. This is not always easy although the position has improved somewhat with the establishment of An Bord Altranais <Col N="858" /> of a separate part of the Register of Nurses for persons specially trained in the nursing of the mentally handicapped. In short, I may say that, without regionalisation, it would not be possible to have sufficient numbers of the different age and other groupings to make provision of proper care and training a practicable proposition. With special relation to Deputy Leneghan's criticism, there are at present two residential institutions for mentally handicapped children in Connacht&mdash;Cregg House, Sligo, for girls, and Kilcornan House, near Galway for boys.  In addition, it is hoped that very shortly Woodlands in Galway will be available.  Children from Connacht are also admitted to residential institutions in other provinces.</P>
    <P>Nursing is a noble and dedicated profession and it is only fitting that the remuneration and conditions of service of those engaged in it should be as attractive as the community can provide.  I must deprecate statements made here suggesting that our nurses are overworked, underpaid and exploited. I have approved of the employment of additional staff to enable the hours of duty of nursing staffs in public authority hospitals to be reduced to 90 hours per fortnight. I understand that this is also in operation in our voluntary hospitals.  Nurses in local authority service now have access to a scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  I understand the general salary revision claim submitted by their organisation, the Irish Nurses Organisation, is, in fact, being examined at present under the scheme. Any resulting salary revisions will naturally be applied to comparable classes of nurses in the employment of voluntary hospitals participating in the deficit recoupment arrangements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne was unduly perturbed by the fact that some of our nurses emigrate.  Many of our nurses do take employment in Britain and America, as do members of other professions, but, so far as nurses are concerned, it is a two-way trend; movement is not solely outward.  It is inward as well to the extent that each year about 40 per cent of the registrations in the General Division of the Register kept by An <Col N="859" /> Bord Altranais represents Irish girls who have trained in Britain or Northern Ireland and are returning to work here.  Before I leave this matter, I might say we are not in general experiencing any difficulty in getting our requirements of nurses for our hospitals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan <i>(South Tipperary)</i> asked what was the position with regard to arrangements for the setting up of the proposed central sterile supply service.  It is very far advanced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne raised the question of the standards of hygiene in Dublin licensed premises.  The Food Hygiene Regulations are administered, I would remind the House, by the health authorities through their medical and health inspector staffs.  I have no reason whatsoever to believe that these authorities are not enforcing the regulations in Dublin.  If the Deputy has grounds for believing otherwise I should be grateful if he would furnish them to me.  The Food Hygiene Regulations, apart from the registration provisions apply to licensed premises. Some time ago the Dublin Health Authority intensified action to ensure that the provisions of the regulations were being complied with in such premises.  Unfitness of premises, including unsuitable sanitary conditions, may now be regarded as a ground of objection in connection with the grant or renewal of a licence and I have drawn the attention of health authorities to this fact.  I promise also to draw the attention of the Dublin Health Authority to Deputy Byrne's remarks.</P>
    <P>In October last, the Queen's Institute of District Nursing informed me that they were forced for financial reasons to contemplate dissolution.  My immediate reaction was to express keen regret at this situation and to tell the Institute that I was very ready to consider ways and means of resolving their problems.  It emerged that one of the main worries confronting the officers of the Institute was that their pension fund might prove unequal to the demands made upon it. I gave a formal assurance that should the Institute find itself unable to meet <Col N="860" /> in full, its liabilities in respect of the superannuation of its staff, I would be prepared to make grants available to meet such a deficiency.</P>
    <P>The second major worry of the Institute was the problem of securing additional funds to meet a contemplated increase in the salaries of the district nurses.  For many years local health authorities have had my sanction to pay subventions to district nursing associations up to a maximum of 75 per cent of each association's annual expenditure.  Notwithstanding this already substantial endowment from public funds, I told the Institute also in March last, that I was prepared to ask health authorities to increase their subventions, where necessary, to a maximum of 85 per cent of the annual expenditure of district nursing associations.  This offer on my part, taken in conjunction with the pensions guarantee, cannot be regarded, I think, as ungenerous treatment.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that those Deputies who were so eloquent in their pleas for more support for the Institute should emulate my action in a practical way by organising and engaging in a campaign to enable the Institute to raise the balance of 15 per cent which it requires in order to continue its splendid work among our people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully stated that some dispensary doctors discourage patients seeking attention after certain hours at their residence.  Dispensary doctors, I may say, and everybody knows it, I think, are required, of course, to afford medical attention at any time, on request to eligible persons in their own homes where such persons are unable, through illness, to attend at the dispensary. I have no evidence that dispensary doctors in general discourage calls to the homes of their patients.  If the Deputy will furnish me with particulars of any specific cases which have come to his notice I shall have them investigated.</P>
    <P>Neither am I aware that it is common practice on the part of dispensary doctors, as Deputy Tully stated, to query their patients as to their entitlement to hold medical cards.  Likewise, if the Deputy wishes to furnish <Col N="861" /> particulars of specific cases in this matter I will have them investigated also.</P>
    <P>I am in full agreement with the view expressed by Deputy Tully that if a dispensary doctor has reasonable doubts as to the entitlement of any of his patients to hold a medical card the position should be dealt with in accordance with the General Medical Services Regulations, that is to say, that the patient should be treated and the question raised with the health authority and not with the patient.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to the circular which in 1961 I caused to issue to health authorities drawing attention to the fact that they were authorised to supply drugs and medicines in cases where the persons concerned, through the financial hardship involved, were unable to meet the cost of these requisites.  In the light of his remarks, I shall again draw the attention of health authorities to their functions in this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputies Tully, Leneghan and Kyne raised the question of dental services. I concede that the public dental services are capable of improvement. Their defects are, however, due in great measure to the shortage of dentists and our shortage of money.  I am doing my best to remedy the former by improving the remuneration of dentists employed in the local health service; and the Minister for Finance is struggling with the latter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leneghan held that there is no outside nursing service at all in County Mayo.  In saying so, the Deputy overlooked that, apart from five public health nurses attached to the office of the Chief Medical Officer, who are engaged in the School Health Examination Service, the Child Welfare Service, the Immunisation services, and so on, there are no less than 17 nurses engaged wholetime on district nursing duties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde expressed concern at the extent to which non-nationals&mdash; doctors, I presume&mdash;are employed in local authority hospitals and claimed that the number is increasing.  A year and a half ago, arising out of a Dáil Question, I sought information from <Col N="862" /> health authorities as to the number of non-nationals employed in these hospitals.  The particulars furnished to me showed that of approximately 800 doctors employed, only 46, or about 6 per cent&mdash;all temporary and all in the registrar or house officer grades&mdash;were non-nationals.  I doubt whether the position has substantially changed since.  May I say in relation to the specific case which, I think, Deputy Esmonde had in mind, of a doctor who is employed in the health services in Wexford, that on enquiry I have ascertained that the doctor in question was born in Dublin and therefore is not an non-national.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, when we saw this Bill, and gave it consideration, it appeared to offer an opportunity to those of us interested in the general terms of the administration of justice to express the views of great numbers of the people in connection with the position of the judiciary <i>vis-à-vis</i> the ninth round increase in salaries and wages, the methods applied to the correction or prevention of crime, the inadequacy of sentences in many cases, the method of appointment of judges and justices, which we have long considered not to be the most efficient, the best or the most advisable and the jury system.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we put down a motion relating to these matters which we hoped would be taken with the Bill. However, the Government indicated they would not agree the motion should be taken in conjunction with the Bill except to the extent of one small phrase, which represents a parliamentary device purely, calling for the postponement of payment of the increased salaries of judges and justices for three months.  That was allowed and the rest of the motion disallowed, leaving us in the position that we may discuss only the main proposal to increase the salaries of the judiciary.</P>
      <P>The history of the salaries of members of the judiciary is an interesting story.  None of us, least of all the Labour Party, would wish to prevent any public servants, who were doing a good job, from receiving what is termed to be their due.  In fact, we of the Labour Party are quite prepared to go a considerable distance along the road to meet the equitable demands of all sections, particularly those who carry heavier responsibility than others.  Still, it is very difficult to understand why there should be anybody in any position in this State receiving considerably more than the Taoiseach.  This is the case in so far as members of the judiciary are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, there are other public servants outside this House who are similarly circumstanced.  If you look <Col N="865" /> at the records of salaries paid to the various levels of the judiciary, from the Chief Justice down to the district justices, from 1924 it will be found that at no time could they ever be called the most impoverished section of the community.  I do not consider that a district justice renders any more service to the community than a member of the Dáil.  I consider that some of them render considerably less.</P>
    <P>In 1924 most district justices had £1,000 a year&mdash;that is, 40 years ago. It is now proposed that they should have £2,520.  I do not quarrel with that at all but there is something wrong with our whole approach to these proposals, which concern us all very vitally, that apparently once the machinery of the State gets into a particular kind of rut, in so far as emoluments and payments are concerned, it is a kind of mortal sin if it moves even slightly out of that rut. So far as the judiciary are concerned, we have had constant care for their welfare no matter what Government were in power.  It did not matter whether it was the original Government of Mr. Cosgrave, the subsequent Government of Mr. de Valera or the inter-Party Government of Deputy Costello, we took more care of the judiciary than any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>I have been looking at some of the debates which followed on proposals to increase the salaries of the gentlemen who carry the lives and liberties of all of us in the palm of their hands. The arguments advanced have been numerous and varied but, to my mind, the most bizarre was the one put up here on the occasion of the last increase, which was as recent as two years ago, that we must pay the judiciary sufficient to ensure they will be people above reproach, that their integrity will be unassailable.  This seems to suggest that integrity is a purchaseable commodity.  The criterion seems to be that a man's integrity is to be measured by the amount of money you give him.  That is a contradiction in terms.  Integrity exists.  It is a quality which money or any other consideration cannot influence. It either is or is not there. <Col N="866" /> To suggest, as was suggested previously by Ministers&mdash;perhaps not the present Minister, but certainly by one of his predecessors&mdash;that high salaries should be paid to the judiciary to ensure they will be above corruption is a very poor argument and one which reflects upon the standards of our people.</P>
    <P>What then is the reason for these increases?  We must, apparently, keep increasing these salaries because we have successive rounds of wage increases for workers.  Surely it is ridiculous to suggest there is any comparison between the position of, say, a county council road worker or a farm labourer or a building trade worker in Dublin or a factory worker rearing a large family in Ballyfermot or any place else and the position of a member of the judiciary.  The average wage in the case of a farm labourer in Limerick would be about £6 10s. per week.</P>

      <P>We will have to do something about that.  We will have to get a union.  Is it realistic, when talking about percentage increases to district justices, to relate them to the ninth round increase to workers? Surely it is not.  The percentage increase is one of the devices employed by mathematicians to suggest we are treating everybody the same.  What does a percentage increase mean to a man earning £7 a week and to a man earning £6,000 a year?  There is such a difference that it is beyond understanding. No matter what illusions we may have and no matter what euphoria may develop within the walls of this House, the people who carry this nation are the people I described &mdash;the ordinary workers who carry <Col N="867" /> every aspect of the work of the machinery of the State and who make it possible for us to meet here.  They ask what reasons can we advance for giving increases to these gentlemen who seem to be so well off, who seem to have more than any other class in the State.  I would find it hard to justify these increases at this time before any body of Irishmen.  It may be said that most of the money will come back in income tax.  If that is so, what is the point of the exercise?</P>
      <P>If we were to oppose this&mdash;we have no intention of doing so&mdash;it would probably be suggested that we were against the whole idea that people should be adequately paid.  We are not, in fact, but I am trying to contrast the treatment of these privileged people, these people so essentially a part of the establishment, these people who are, in effect, all ex-politicians, most of them unsuccessful applicants for membership of this House and some of them former members of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling on that, Sir.  I am sure I am just relating what is known to everybody here. Whenever I had occasion to go before the Labour Court to justify a claim for increased wages for any group of workers, I had to make the case as to the service they were giving the particular employer.  In this instance, however, no effort is made by anybody to justify these increases, except to say we believe this should be done and that is all there is to it.  I am looking for something deeper here.  When paying these large salaries, we should, at the same time, seek to establish standards of recruitment in the future which will be different from those which existed in the past.  I will not pursue it any further, because I do not want to make it difficult for the Chair.  I know it is somewhat out of order.  I want to remind the Chair that the motion we had in was based on that proposition. We have been very tightly bound in this debate and not allowed to develop the points we want to develop.</P>

      <Col N="868" /> We are not going to actively oppose these increases, but as a member of this House, having seen what we did for the old age pensioners this year, last year and the year before&mdash;the miserable halfcrown&mdash;I could not in conscience quietly accept that we should do that for the most oppressed section of our people and do so much for these gentlemen, who are far from badly hit. There is something irrational between the two things.  I cannot understand the Government that will do these two opposite things within so short a time. I make that point simply to ensure that we do not lose sight of the fundamental fact that our purpose is not just to look after a handful of people, the judiciary, but to look after the whole nation and, as the document down in the hall says, to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  We are not doing that.  We are cherishing some a lot more than we are cherishing others, and that is something to our shame.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a word to what has been said in relation to this Bill.  This Bill should commend itself to Deputies.  It is correct, as Deputy Dunne has pointed out, that for the second time in 24 months, it has been necessary for the Minister to propose legislation to restore in some way the real value of judicial salaries.  That is, as has been pointed out, an indication of the gross mismanagement of the affairs of this country by the Government. It is indicative of the fact that the real value of money in circulation has dropped and accordingly, step by step, efforts have to be made to restore the damage in the different spheres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now dealing with judicial salaries.  The object of this Bill is, from 1st February of this year, to increase judicial salaries in order to compensate for the fall in the value of money.  Just like every other section of the community, judges and district justices have had to face the fact that the money they use has fallen in value.  Therefore this Bill is necessary. I should like to say that, in my view, there should not be any grudging <Col N="869" /> approach to this matter.  Deputy Dunne has recalled that in 1924 the salaries of district justices were fixed at £1,000 per year.  Today, in this Bill, in respect of ordinary justices, it is proposed that the new salary rate shall be £2,520. That would seem to indicate that in the period from 1924 to date, there has been a reduction in the real value of the salaries of justices, and in relation to the real value of other judicial salaries that they have not kept up with the rise in the cost of living and the consequential fall in the real value of money.</P>
    <P>We know that related to the value of the pre-war £, the value of the present £ has dropped three times.  The pre-war £ is now said to be worth something less than 6/8.  That is a fair indication of the fact that in proposing the salaries in this Bill the Minister is not even doing what it was thought correct to do in relation to the comparative values of some 40 years ago. This Bill is clearly necessary and should be supported.  I am glad Deputies who have spoken have recognised that it is necessary.</P>
    <P>This country owes a great deal to the fact that we have been fortunate in having an independent and, I believe, upright judiciary, which acts and functions as it should, as a safeguard and a bulwark, when necessary, in defence of the people.  Irrespective of how judges come to the Bench, irrespective of the source from which they have come to the Bench throughout the past 40 odd years, the remarkable thing is that our judges have always consistently maintained their independence and forthright role, and at times have stopped the Executive when it was felt that the Executive were acting wrongly and in a manner detrimental to the rights of the individual. We are fortunate in that respect. Some people say the system of appointment is not good.  That is all very well, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  In my view, since the State was formed, our judges have performed excellently and have maintained a very high standard.  Indeed, they have maintained the respect of the ordinary people for the courts and those who preside in them.</P>

      <P>I am happy that the Bill has commended itself to members of the House to the extent to which it has commended itself.  Perhaps I should avail of this opportunity, while his remarks are fresh in my mind, to agree fully with what Deputy O'Higgins said in regard to the quality, independence and integrity of the judiciary and how well we have been served down through the years by the judiciary. Indeed, this debate would take a very different form, I am sure, if the situation were otherwise.  It is a tribute to the type of democracy, society and civilisation which we are building up in this country that all of us can agree with Deputy O'Higgins in his closing remarks.</P>
      <P>I indicated at the outset of the debate that the Government approached this matter of increasing the salaries of the judiciary from two points of view.  One aspect of the matter was that the ninth round, or the 12 per cent increase, was part of a comprehensive incomes policy and, as such, should be applied impartially to all sections of the public service, including the judiciary.  It seemed to us in the Government that fair play demanded this and indeed also that the very nature of the ninth round national wages and salary agreement also demanded it.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, these increases in the salaries of the judiciary were rendered inevitable by the development of events.  If we were not to bring about and tolerate a very serious disruption in the long-established patterns in the public service, we had no alternative but to proceed with this ninth round increase for the judiciary along the lines set out in the Bill.  The proposals in the Bill represent a reasonable application of the ninth round to the situation of the judiciary in so far as we have given the full 12 per cent up to the circuit court level; ten per cent thereafter; and, finally, six per cent to the Chief Justice at the top of the scale.  As I said, I am happy that the House in general seems to be in agreement with this solution put forward by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is really a technical measure. Its purpose is to secure amendments of the Control of Imports Acts which will provide greater flexibility in the new situation arising from the gradual reduction of protective tariffs and the substitution of tariffs for import quotas.  The process of reduction of protection, as Deputies are aware, is designed to provide a spur to greater <Col N="872" /> efficiency and competitiveness in industry and to prepare us to take our part in the system of freer trade towards which there is an international movement.  There must, however, be adequate safeguards during this period of transition against the dislocation or deflection of trade and, consequently loss of employment, which could result from uncontrolled imports of goods with which our manufacturers cannot reasonably be expected to compete. Indeed, the absence of such safeguards could militate against speedy readaptation of industry to meet the conditions of freer trade, because manufacturers might be afraid to rationalise their production if, by concentrating on certain lines, they increased their vulnerabilty to &ldquo;low-cost&rdquo; imports.</P>
    <P>Nothing in the Bill is designed to limit fair competition.  To do so would be contrary to the spirit of the reduction of protection.  The alterations in the procedure are sought only for the purpose of enabling ceilings to be imposed on imports in those cases where external costs of production are so abnormally low by our standards or by normal international standards that our manufacturers could not reasonably be expected to compete with them within existing levels of tariff protection.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Government may place a limit on the import of certain goods without the necessity for an apportionment among importers.  This will enable open general licensing to operate within the overall limit and traders will not have to seek licences to import the goods. Once the ceiling has been reached, however, the Revenue Commissioners will not admit further goods until a new Order has been made.  Deputies will not expect me, because of risks of forestalling, to say what commodities are immediately in mind in this connection.</P>
    <P>Where quota protected goods are concerned, it is also necessary that the same power to impose ceilings in similar circumstances should exist. This is necessary not merely to facilitate the readaptation of industries now <Col N="873" /> protected by quota, but also to assist in the transition from quota protection to tariff protection.  Under the existing control of imports legislation, there cannot be two quotas on the one category of goods.  The Bill provides for the removal of that limitation so that a ceiling may be applied to imports of particular goods coming under an existing Quota Order.  Where this is done there would, in effect, be a quota within a quota.  Both quotas would, however, be divided among importers as at present and licences would continue to be necessary.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House. As I said at the beginning, its purpose is to tailor the Control of Imports Acts to the needs of a changing situation.</P>
    <P>I might say that I have had an explanatory memorandum circulated because on looking at the Bill, I realised that on the face of it it would convey very little to Deputies and I hope the memorandum will be of some assistance to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T. F. O'Higgins Mr. T. F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the object and purpose of this Bill is to undo or minimise the possible bad effects that might arise from the Government's declared policy in relation to trade liberalisation.  If that is correct, this is a proper step to take Quite frankly, I hold the view in relation to industries that have developed and grown up under tariff protection over the past few decades that those which have survived and which are giving good employment should continue to have the full benefit of protection so that they can strengthen themselves for the period in which all tariff protection will have ceased.  I know the contrary view is held by the Minister and has been expressed on behalf of the Government. One danger in the gradual liberalisation of trade before the Common Market comes about is that it may gradually weaken and destroy some existing industries which instead of having a sudden death, may in some cases have a slow death and may bleed away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard I am particularly concerned about the worsted industry <Col N="874" /> in my constituency.  Those engaged in it at the moment are producing and competing against well established producers in Britain and elsewhere for world markets.  At the moment they find, as a result of this country being neither in the Common Market nor in EFTA, that they as Irish producers and sellers on the export market are being hit on the home front by the reduction of tariffs and quotas and are facing abroad the build-up of tariffs against them and in favour of their British competitors.  That is a situation which may be only incipient, but if it continues, it could militate very seriously against the retention of, not to mind the increase in, export markets.</P>
    <P>This Bill does recognise some of the dangers involved in the removal of tariffs and quotas.  It empowers the Minister, when a certain stage is reached, to apply a clamp in the form of a quota for imported goods.  For that reason, I welcome it and think it should be accepted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill, mainly because of the fact that for some time past we have been expressing from the Party benches here the view that there is a great danger in proceeding with the reduction of tariffs without having some way of counterbalancing the situation which will arise.  We think the Minister is right in taking power to ensure we shall not reach the stage of reducing tariffs to such an extent that our industries which have grown up here behind a tariff wall will overnight be put out of business because of the import of low-cost materials from outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to delay the House but I would ask the Minister to watch the other side of the picture.  I am sure he is far more aware than I am of the position in which people who have had tariff protection over a number of years and who could come out from behind that tariff protection if they so desired have not done so, preferring to hold on to the protection, and therefore to extra profits, as long as they can get away with it.  I am quite sure the Minister will look after that side of the picture and that these <Col N="875" /> people will not be allowed to make the case that they still need very high tariff protection.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point I wish to make in relation to a matter which is only very barely touched on in this Bill, that is, the question of people who have been setting up industries in these countries for export and who are controlled in that they cannot sell in this country.  We recently had the case being made that a great deal of stuff being manufactured here for export could not be exported and therefore must sell as seconds on the home market.  I hope the Minister will make some comment on that when he is replying.  I know of a perfectly good industry which has been turned down by Córas Tráchtála recently on the ground that they could not export all their commodities and would, of necessity, flood the home market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy O'Higgins's comment on the danger of some of our industries meeting with a sudden death if our tariffs continued to be reduced, the main purpose of the reduction rhythm now being carried on is to ensure that such a sudden death will not occur.  The purpose of the rhythm is, as I have already said, to give a spur to our industries, to improve their efficiency and so ensure that they will maintain the home market and be in a position to compete on the export market with producers of similar types of goods from other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The woollen and worsted industry is one with which I have had very close contact in recent years.  I have had a number of discussions with them and have discussed the impact of the reduction in the protection they have, which incidentally is the most effective form of protection we can supply, that is, a quota.  They are very well protected as far as the home market is concerned by this quota.  It is true this quota is being extended at the same rate as other quotas are being extended but, by and large, they have been holding their own on the export market and, what is more, as a result of the great increase in the export of Irish <Col N="876" /> made-up garments, they are sharing in that increase by a greater output themselves. In the meantime, they are contemplating the setting up of an adaptation council which has been proposed to them by the Committee on Industrial Organisation.  As the House is aware, the purpose of the adaptation council is to see to what extent firms within a particular industry can rationalise, rationalise in lines of production, rationalise in export markets and in ordering of raw materials.  I hope the woollen and worsted industry will proceed at the fastest possible rate to some form of rationalisation which will be to their advantage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to some industries which are benefiting from protection and suggested that because perhaps they are very efficient, they should not be allowed to benefit to the same extent as others not so efficient.  Of course that would be a very difficult line of protection to administer.  It illustrates the kind of difficulty with which any Minister for Industry and Commerce deals when it comes to protection for industry. The Deputy commented on the difficulty of industries that have been established for export, have failed to achieve the export targets they have set and have not been permitted to sell on the home market.  These industries are the ones to which we give grants.  Normally a grant is not given to the promoters of an industry to make products which are already made in sufficient quantity to supply the home market.  However, if the promoters of an industry prove they have certain assured market outlets, then they may be given a grant, but on the condition that they sell only on the export market.</P>

      <P>There are two matters I wish to refer to.  It is proposed to do away with any list of importers which formerly existed.  Does the Minister anticipate that any difficulty will arise from goods being imported by different merchants, several of them arriving at the same time or within a short period of one another and the total quantity exceeding the quota? What arrangements will be made to ensure the quota is so distributed that some form of notice will be given to importers and to those awarded the quotas?</P>
      <P>One of the critcisms sometimes made in connection with the operation of the quota arrangements as at present existing is that where firms cannot supply goods similar to or comparable with those requested by distributors, the distributors find it difficult to get from those manufacturers a certificate or a letter admitting that they are unable to supply the goods.  In the absence of that, the Department are naturally reluctant to give import certificates.  That is a criticism that has been expressed and I should be glad to know from the Minister if any cases have arisen and what steps were taken to ensure that import certificates are not unreasonably withheld where manufacturers refuse, or delay, or in some other way evade responsibility to distributors, to give them the required letter or certificate to the effect that they are not able to supply the goods required.</P>

The normal quota to be appointed in that case would be of very low dimensions. That will be included in the quota order.  I do not anticipate much of a rush to get in goods in excess of the maximum order by one firm or to get a big proportion of the entire quota through one firm, but if a difficulty such as this arises, it will be possible for the Minister to give an exceptional licence.</P>

      <P>I do not think it would.  In the ordinary way, licences would effectively get over many of the problems that would arise.</P>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's second query, it is true that where the home manufacturer is protected, if he is asked by a person for a particular product and if he does not make that type of product, the tendency is for the home manufacturer to say that the product he does make is good enough or better than the one sought.  The Department have long experience of this exercise of the person seeking to get a duty-free licence for a particular commodity being referred to a home manufacturer and being told by him: &ldquo;I can make that article or something as good as it.&rdquo;  If it appears to the officers of the Department that the home manufacturer's claim cannot be sustained, then a duty-free licence is given to the person needing the product.</P>
      <P>Some difficulties do arise but it is inevitable if we are to maintain for some time this protection regime in the interests of our own producers and workers, but by and large I do not think the difficulties that do arise are very great.  Speaking for myself, I give those licences reluctantly but I am not unreasonable where a proper case has been established.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say if the powers in this Bill can be used <Col N="880" /> to ease the balance of payments position? There are countries in Eastern Europe particularly from which we take a lot more in imports than they take from us.  Could this Bill be used to prevent imports from them and to direct them to countries which buy freely from us and in respect of which the balance of payments is in no difficulty?

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I also draw the Minister's attention to the concern of <Col N="881" /> so many industries that the protection of the quota system which they have enjoyed for such a long time is being gradually eliminated by the policy of the Minister's Department.  Certain industries have claimed that it is necessary and desirable to maintain these quota restrictions for a few years more in order to give these industries a further opportunity of adapting themselves to the stiffer competition they must meet in freer market circumstances. Will the Minister comment on anxiety felt in industry and in the trade unions that the Minister's Department is reluctant to continue quota protection? I wonder why, when one considers that these industries, since we are not in the Common Market and have no positive idea when we shall be, have not, as yet, the availability of that wonderful market?  Does the Minister not think it unwise that he should remove this umbrella of protection in such circumstances?  There is an ingrained fear in many of the unions and industries that if quota protection is removed to the extent the Minister has in mind, there will be dumping and that inroads will be made into our industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of these industries have already been examined by the CIO and there has been a clear indication that very serious redundancy will arise in freer trade circumstances.  Some of those industries are making a genuine effort to adapt themselves and adopt the most modern methods, equipment and devices to contend with stiffer competition in free trade circumstances. They are deeply perturbed by the Minister's policy of insisting that the quota system be eliminated. I ask the Minister to give an indication that he will have regard to the views of the Federation of Employers and the unions in this very serious matter of reducing quotas still further until we shall have a tariff system at a time when we do not enjoy the benefits of free trade in Common Market circumstances.  It is a genuine worry on the part of the union in which I have a particular interest and in the industry with which I am very much concerned.  I ask the Minister to comment on his reasons for rejecting <Col N="882" /> the very sensible approach of the captains of industry and of the union in respect of this very serious matter of reducing quotas&mdash;I presume&mdash;in anticipation of our entering the Common Market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like some clarification.  As I understand it the Bill is protection for the time when further reductions will take place and already some reductions have taken place in the case of duties on imported goods and that this is actually an extension&mdash;rather than what the last speaker said&mdash;of the quota system made applicable to more goods which will become cheap by the reduction of tariffs.  I should like that cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It would take a long time to reply to the points made by the two Deputies who have just spoken but as I said, when replying to the debate on Second Reading, quota protection is the most extreme form of protection we can apply.  The reduction of ten per cent in tariffs is being applied also to quotas.  In other words, quotas are being extended by ten per cent.  Nevertheless, the quotas are remaining.  Take, for example, the commodity for which 100 tons quota is appointed.  That means that 100 tons of that commodity can be imported under the ten per cent extension rhythm we have now in operation.  The first increase in the quota would allow 110 tons of that commodity in.  I do not think it would be reasonable to continue a system of tariff reduction, and at the same time, leave quotas untouched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been meeting some of the firms and some of the trade unions representing workers employed by <Col N="883" /> these firms from time to time about the effect of extension of quotas on the employment given by the firms and on the firms themselves and, by and large, I think that the arrangements we are now making will be in the long term for the benefit of these firms.  I described myself to one of them as being like the mother administering the notvery-tasteful medicine to the child as she says: &ldquo;I know this is not nice but it will be for your good in the long run.&rdquo;  I think that is the position.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Cunningham's question, I want to repeat that this Bill is a means whereby we can protect our manufacturers against low-cost countries, usually far eastern and Communist countries.  I want to say very definitely that almost every country in Europe, including EEC countries, have devices in operation such as I am proposing to the House now.  In the case of a certain type of goods that are protected by tariff, if the tariff is not sufficient to ensure adequate protection to our manufacturers, we can employ this quota device by which we can exclude this unfair and unusual type of competition from low-cost countries where wages are depressed.</P>
    <P>Where the quota is in existence&mdash; and at the present our quotas are global&mdash;every country in the world can take advantage of them.  Normally, we would not be perturbed about imports from countries where the same kind of conditions of employment apply as obtain here but if a low-cost country tries to take advantage of that quota, we can step in and appoint a quota within that quota arrangement applicable to that low-cost country and that type of goods, so that in general the advantage of the quota will not be unfairly availed of by low-cost producers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of goods which do not come in under quota but under tariff and where the tariff is reduced, with resulting increase in the imports of these goods to this country, does this Bill provide for putting those goods under quota?</P>

I can assure the Deputy that I have given the request to which he refers the closest and most sympathetic consideration possible.  If I foresee dangers arising, which the industry will not be able to overcome, it is only natural that I shall be disposed to have another look at that request.  In the meantime, I do not think danger is there.  I appreciate fully the efforts being made by the industry within their adaptation council and I can assure the Deputy that my policy will not be to the detriment of the efforts being made there.  I do not expect the Deputy wishes me to give an undertaking now that I shall do one thing or another on behalf of that industry.  I have the best interests of the industry at heart and my policy will be to preserve that industry and to maintain the employment now being given in it and, if possible, increase it.</P>

      <P>I should like to say I am pleased to hear the Minister's understanding of the problem and the indication of goodwill which he has given us here today, that he will have regard to the situation that existed in the late 40's in the industry to which I refer.  In the case I have in mind, we had a situation in which the quota system was abolished and free trade operated for some months.  We had a serious condition of unemployment and acute redundancy and we do not want to see such a situation arise again.</P>

    <P>I should not like to think that protection would not be afforded until such time as dumping actually took place and unemployment took place.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill has two objectives: firstly, to increase the maximum financial contribution by county councils to county committees of agriculture; and, secondly, to provide that in future not more than 50 per cent of the members of county committees of agriculture may also be members of county councils.</P>
      <P>The first of these objectives is dealt with in section 1 which empowers county councils to increase the maximum contribution payable to committees of agriculture for the service of their agricultural schemes to a sum not more than 21 times the produce of a rate of one penny, that is, 1s. 9d., in the £, in the area consisting of the county, exclusive of any urban districts therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual income at present available to each committee of agriculture consists of a contribution from the county council equal to the produce of a rate of not less than 2d. in the £ nor more than 15d. in the £ and a State grant related to the amount of the agricultural rate.  Prior to 30th September, 1963, the State contribution to committees of agriculture approximated in the aggregate to the contribution from the county councils. Arising out of the Report of the InterDepartmental Committee on the Problems of Small Western Farms, increased financial aid was made available by my Department to 12 committees of agriculture in the western areas to enable them to strengthen their advisory services.  In the case of <Col N="886" /> these areas, the State contribution towards the salaries of advisory officers was increased as from 1st October, 1963, from approximately 50 per cent to 75 per cent.  In areas other than those coming within the scope of the revised arrangements, the State contribution to the finances of the committees of agriculture is unchanged and approximates to the produce of the agricultural rate.</P>
    <P>The existing maximum agricultural rate of 15d. in the £ was fixed under the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1958.  Since the passing of that Act, 15 of the committees have obtained a rate higher than the maximum of 10d. in the £ prescribed before the passing of the Act.  One of these Committees is, in the current financial year, in receipt of the present statutory maximum rate of 15d. in the £, another 14.88d. in the £, while three other committees are in receipt of a rate of 14d. in the £.</P>
    <P>The increased expenditure of committees of agriculture in recent years has been due largely to the considerable and very welcome expansion in the agricultural advisory services.  The total number of all categories of advisers employed by committees in 1957-58 was 313.  In 1963-64 the corresponding figure was 402, an increase of about 30 per cent over the six-year period.  Committees' expenditure has increased over the same period from £559,428 to £828,017.  In the next few years because of the expansion programme already mentioned, it is expected that there will be a marked increase in the number of agricultural advisers employed in western areas. Every county will then be reasonably well staffed with advisers but I would, even after that stage, look forward to further expansion of numbers as the demand for the services of advisers of various kinds is expected to continue to grow.</P>
    <P>In addition to the increased numbers of advisers there have also been fairly substantial salary increases in recent years.  It is clear that, due to increasing expenditure, committees now at or near the existing maximum rate of 15d. in the £ will be unable to maintain their agricultural programmes <Col N="887" /> unless they are enabled by legislation to increase their income in the future and that is the purpose of this section.  I want to emphasise that the provision is purely a permissive one.  It does not impose any obligations on county councils to increase their contributions to the committees of agriculture.  It merely empowers them to do so where they consider such an increase is called for.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides that, after the next local elections, approximately one half at least of each committee of agriculture will be composed of persons who are not members of county councils but who will be chosen by the councils by reason of their attainments in the practice of farming or in the development of agriculture and rural living in their localities or who are active in the promotion of agricultural or rural home education and advisory work.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation is not precise as to the numbers of non-county councillors who may be appointed to act on committees of agriculture.  Indeed the legislation, which dates from 1931, provides merely that each committee should be composed either wholly of persons who are members of county councils, or partly of persons who are, and partly of persons who are not, members of councils.  In practice the proportion of non-councillors on committees varies considerably from one county to another, some county councils tending to confine membership of committees to councillors, while others have shown a more liberal outlook towards the appointment of non-councillors.</P>
    <P>There have been considerable changes in recent times, notably in the emergence of new voluntary rural organisations, the extension of the co-operative movement, the growth of the educational and advisory services and the development of new techniques and ideas generally.  There can hardly be any doubt that committees of agriculture would benefit from some members drawn from the voluntary rural organisations and the co-operative movement or from among prominent local individuals who for <Col N="888" /> one reason or another do not wish to stand for election to the county council.</P>
    <P>I believe that the time has come to reshape our legislation so that persons, who are not members of county councils but who are playing a leading part in the improvement of our agriculture, and in raising our rural living standards, will have a greater opportunity to participate in the membership of committees of agriculture.  I feel sure that the change now proposed will bring to committees a new source of inspiration and strength and that it will lead to a more general acceptance of the educational and advisory services by the rural community.</P>
    <P>I believe that our present agricultural advisory system, which consists of a partnership between the Department of Agriculture and the county committees of agriculture, supported by the results of the research work undertaken by An Foras Talúntais and the universities, is basically a good one and that, subject to the improvements to be effected under this Bill, it is calculated to make a great and vital contribution to our further agricultural progress and development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House accept this Bill as a very small step forward, albeit a step in the right direction.  We welcome the fact that the expenditure that will now have to be met in the West of Ireland as a result of the decision of the interDepartmental Committee on Small Western Farms for the provision of extra instructors is being looked after, inasmuch as the committees of agriculture can now spend more than the maximum rate of ?d in the £ in their respective counties.  We know also that some counties, even before this step forward on the part of the inter-Departmental Committee&mdash;which I presume has hardly come to pass yet &mdash;had, in fact, reached their maximum. So, one half of the Bill is merely bringing up to date and accepting the power which some county committees of agriculture now have to spend more than they thought they would have to spend when the 1958 Act passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas. <Col N="889" /> It would, however, be quite naive of members on both sides of this House and the Minister if the exact provisions of the proposal that there shall be extern members to the extent of 50 per cent on the committees of agriculture were not examined in some detail. It must be remembered that the truth of the matter is that section 15 of the 1931 Act still governs the appointment of members of committees of agriculture and that, in fact, it is the county council in every case that will appoint them.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House have considered whether or not it would have been better to insert some provision for the automatic appointment by certain voluntary organisations of their nominees but we feel that perhaps the wisest course is the one that has been followed.  There is the point that, as we have three, four or five large voluntary farmers' organisations in the country, some of them in one county or another go up and some go down.  Therefore, the situation would appear to be that some organisation should after some years have two or perhaps more nominees and, because of custom, a small or almost nonexistent organisation might, in fact, have a larger or an equal number.</P>
      <P>However, section 15 of the 1931 Act still stands.  It indicates that the entire committee of agriculture, with the Government provisions set out in section 2 of this Bill, still appoints the entire committee.  The county council will, therefore, have to face this problem in a very non-political way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say, without any taste of rancour or without any desire to hurt the Minister, that I know an excellent committee of agriculture where the head of Muintir na Tíre in the county was unseated to provide a place for a Fianna Fáil Senator who lives in an urban area and has no land.  I know an excellent committee of agriculture where the foremost shorthorn breeder in the county, and a man who is doing highly detailed experimental cereal plots for the Department of Agriculture, was unseated to provide a place for somebody else who was a political figure but who was not involved in agriculture.  Whether or not that was <Col N="890" /> done by a majority of Fine Gael on the county council or a majority of Fianna Fáil or a majority of Labour, or any sort of combination, it is still wrong.</P>
    <P>If we are to follow the line on which the Minister introduced this Bill, then we would expect that there would have to be a non-political line right through the country on the county councils.  I want to say from our side of the House that, in local government and traditionally, that particular line of thought has always been available and that it is necessary now that it will also be available in the appointment of committees of agriculture on all other sides also.</P>
    <P>It would be a pity if the voluntary organisations in the country or other people interested did not realise the similarity that exists between a present Seanad election and the present new proposed system of election of members of committees of agriculture.  You can have a vocational nominee for the Seanad.  You can be nominated by an extern body but when you want to get there you have to be voted there by the members of the county councils and the members of this House and the members of certain city corporations. This is the same situation here. You can be an excellent person.  You can be of great value.  But when you come to seek your seat you have to be voted there by the people who themselves are elected through political channels to the county council.</P>
    <P>So long as the proper line is followed, this is a small step forward and a proper step forward.  The point I want to make on this side of the House in accepting this Bill is that we hope that this line will be followed. We want the voluntary organisations in the country who would seek their full representation on the committees of agriculture to realise that the step forward the Minister looks for and I hope will achieve is entirely dependent on the action of the members of the county councils.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree that section 1 of the Bill is necessary.  The constituency I represent has not got the difficulty which is mentioned here because we are a county with high valuations and, therefore, the rate <Col N="891" /> returns are much higher than they are in many other counties.  The 1d in the £ in County Meath produces very much more than it does in some other counties.  Therefore, we have not reached the maximum yet and we are happy with the situation.  However, in quite a number of counties the position is bad.  Their style has been cramped over the past few years because of the falling value of money, wages increases and the necessity to improve a number of services.  It was very necessary, therefore, to increase the amount.  Possibly the Minister could have gone a little further with this 21d in the £.  That would have prevented the necessity for bringing in further legislation.  However, I suppose that is a matter of which the Minister is a better judge than I am and I shall not, therefore, dwell on it.</P>
      <P>The second matter is somewhat more complicated.  In most sensible county councils, and I include the one in my own county in the number, politics crop up only once in the year.  That is on the day the chairman, vice-chairman and the committees are elected. After an election, when certain committees are being appointed, the vocational committee, the agricultural committee, and so on, we have politics right along the way.  When I heard this Bill was being introduced, I thought the Minister would have gone a long way further on this line.  I have not discussed the matter with Deputy Donegan but I think there is a great deal of sense in what he has said.</P>
      <P>It is really too bad that people who do not know anything about agriculture should find their way on to these committees, simply because they are members of a political Party and must be given some kind of position, either because they have been defeated for election to the county council or they have topped the church gate collection. They must get recognition and the recognition is membership of a committee. Now, that is wrong and I shall be very glad to support the Minister if he devises some other system of appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister provides that only <Col N="892" /> half will be county councillors.  Possibly he thought that would provide a certain remedy because it would leave a wider field from which to draw and avoid a recurrence of the kind of situation to which I have referred.  If the membership is uneven, I understand the council will get the odd member and that will give them an extra seat on the committee.  The qualification laid down is attainments in the practice of farming or the development of agriculture and rural living. That is very wide.  I am sure the Minister will agree there is not a national schoolteacher who does not take a rural science class.  If he happens to be a member of the strongest Party, he will feel he should qualify. It will be pretty difficult to keep such people like that off the committee. I think the Minister should have come out plainly with what he has in mind. Why did he not say that only those with a practical knowledge of farming will be elected?</P>

      <P>One meets quite a few who want to pretend they know nothing at all about it.  If the Minister does not intend to get the Bill through today, perhaps he would have another look at this and see if he can tie it up in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another objection I should like to voice.  By putting on 50 per cent who are not elected representatives, is there a danger we may have in some cases a whole series of Robert Emmets anxious to spend all the money they possibly can without any reference to how the money will be provided?  They will not be members of the local authority and the striking <Col N="893" /> of the rate will be no responsibility of theirs.  There may be no danger in the situation.  The Minister has far more experience than I have, but I think there is a slight danger that something like that could occur.  We might have people with very little connection with the rural community and with no respect for the county council because, if they had respect, they would present themselves as candidates and succeed in getting themselves elected.  These are the people who will show everybody the way to run a county committee of agriculture. There are one or two of them in every county.  They put forward the most harebrained schemes.</P>
    <P>The 1/9d. may not appear very much in some counties.  In my county it will represent between £40,000 and £50,000.  The Minister can see the danger to which I am referring.  It would be more than a coincidence that the whole 50 per cent would be that way of thinking but you could get someone who would climb on the bandwagon and put everybody in the position that they would have to make enemies of a great many people.  Those in public life cannot afford to do that. Apart from that, I think it is a good thing this matter has been examined. County committees of agriculture are far more important than most people think.  Outside the particular group very few people realise the good a committee can do.  Very few realise it is their organisation which brings about desirable and essential changes in agriculture.  I am a little sorry the qualification is not that they should have a practical knowledge of farming or be the nominees of certain voluntary organisations whose interests lie entirely in farming and in the development of agriculture.  However, I commend the Minister on introducing this Bill.  I think the few matters I have raised could have been dealt with in another way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully was perfectly right in saying that the questions to which he referred had been examined by the Department.  Indeed, some of them have been examined for many, many years.  The definition in the 1931 <Col N="894" /> Act remains.  I have no doubt that at that time those responsible were searching round for a better and more compact definition.  The House can be assured we have done the same in 1963-64.  If Deputy Tully were to examine the problems that could arise as a result of using the definition he suggests&mdash;a practical knowledge of farming&mdash;he would probably not be quite so insistent in this matter.  An individual with a practical knowledge of farming could be selected but who would not be a farmer at the particular time.  I cannot think right now of all the problems that would arise for those who would be trying to select persons on the basis of &ldquo;a practical knowledge&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In regard to the other points raised both by Deputy Donegan and Deputy Tully, I admit that it would be better if one could provide a hard and fast method of selecting this 50 per cent who must be persons who are not members of the elected council.  While being critical of the openings this Bill will leave when it becomes an Act, I do not think the Deputies were in the mood to say that they had a method by which this could be overcome.  When in the last 10 or 15 years county councils seemed to veer towards appointing to county committees of agriculture only persons who were members of the council, I thought that was a great mistake on their part.  Of course, members could always say, and did say whenever, in conversation, I accused members of a county committee of taking what I regarded as a foolish step, &ldquo;Do you deny that I am a farmer? Not only am I a farmer but I have gone before my people and have secured election.  If there are others who think they could be of more use or could make a bigger contribution to agriculture if they were members of the county council and could thereby secure election to the committee, why do they not seek election?&rdquo; I have heard that argument and it is not bad reasoning but it never convinced me that it was a wise thing for councils to select only persons who were elected members of the council, as many councils did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one could stipulate clearly where <Col N="895" /> this 50 per cent were to come from, that would be good.  I certainly do not want any weak or evasive interpretation to be put upon this provision when councils come to appoint committees but, as in the case of the definition of &ldquo;farmer&rdquo;, I cannot find it possible to provide the actual source from which they would come because if I were to name organisations and say &ldquo;The following organisations will have the right to nominate&rdquo;, how could you be sure that the organisations so named would be able to devise a correct and fair method of selecting their own members?</P>
    <P>Then there is the point that I have often mentioned, as to the number of these organisations and their representative capacity.  I do not want to take sides with one organisation over another on the basis of its strength or its representative character.  To attempt to distribute appointments to the committee of agriculture to named organisations would not be fair.  I would hope that the strength and representative character of a rural organisation should make itself felt to the extent that people would be selected who would measure up well to the examination and scrutiny of those around them who knew them.</P>
    <P>I am not claiming that this will be a perfect business.  As is usual, it will probably be operated very fairly in most places while there will be areas where that might not be the case.  If there is any Deputy who can put down an amendment in regard to the definition or the method of selection, I should be delighted.  We have tried very strenuously to find an alternative proposal which would be better but we have failed to do so.</P>

      <P>There is one.  If you take the number to be appointed as extern members and elect them by the county council votes on proportional representation, which the people have given you in respect of another matter, you will stop a majority on the county council from taking all the seats.  That is a proposal that we can put down as an amendment on Committee Stage. That is the way to do it.</P>

      <P>The difficulty arises when the county council comes to look at the people whom it should choose, who are outside their own elected body.  I am not really so much afraid of the political aspect.  I think that, by and large, except in a very isolated case, county councils have made a fair effort to give fair representation.  That is my experience.  It did not happen in every case but there were very few where reasonable consideration was refused to parties in the composition of these committees.  I am not saying that these two provisions, that is, the definition of an eligible outsider for membership of a committee and the method of election, are perfect but we cannot see any better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we have really made a point in respect of the rule in subsection (1) (c).  I think Deputy Tully is quite right in what he said and I agree with him that we take in everybody in a rural parish up to the parish priest.  Rule 5 of the Second Schedule of the Agriculture Act, 1931, says:</P>
      <P>No person shall be appointed to be a member of a committee of agriculture unless he either has a practical, commercial or technical knowledge of land or has an estate or interest in some agricultural land in the county or has special local knowledge of agricultural matters.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the passage of this Bill but I think the definition in the 1931 Act has not been improved upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House, either, but I believe that is far better than this very vague detail.  I read it at first rather quickly but on a second reading, it seems to me to be a very vague detail.  These non-county council members are to be chosen by the council, because of attainments in the practice of farming or the development of agriculture and rural living or because of attainments <Col N="898" /> in the promotion of agricultural or rural home education and advisory work.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree with me that the widest possible interpretation can be put on this.  Let me say that I did not mean that the parish priest did not know anything about farming.  Most of them I know are excellent farmers, apart from the knowledge they had before they entered the Church.  If the Minister cannot do it now, I would ask him, before the Bill passes through the Seanad, to have some agreement made to have this tightened up.</P>
      <P>If we do not have this matter tightened up, we will have a whole group of people being put forward on some committee or other who have not the foggiest notion about farming at all but who, because of their allegiance to one political Party or another, will be put forward.  Some people think it is a good thing to be on a committee, no matter what it is. I should like the Minister or his advisers to think of some way of tightening this matter up, even if it does mean&mdash;and this is a job he would not like doing&mdash;tying down representations to certain organisations.</P>
      <P>There is another point.  When you give the local authority the right to select these people, there will almost certainly be in certain cases objections by some people that somebody, no matter who he is, has not the proper qualification.  I am really perturbed that this is something which may cause more confusion and it does not improve matters at all.  I should be grateful if the Minister would agree to have another look at it and see if he can provide a better way of dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My attitude is slightly different.  I know that no matter how you try to do this, you cannot tighten it up completely.  Once I have arrived at that conclusion, my second approach to the matter is that the definition should be reasonably wide.  My third approach is, having been forced to the second conclusion, to look to the local authorities and to expect them, having got this, which was the only advisable definition I could give them, to make <Col N="899" /> their choice as wisely as possible.  That is my approach and I do not think you can improve on it.  I do not mind looking at it again.  When I give that sort of assurance, I am giving it in the knowledge that we have tossed this over and I cannot find myself able to come up with something at this stage that I could not come up with yesterday.</P>

      <P>What is the <i>modus operandi</i> whereby a person is disqualified from being a member of a committee of agriculture?  As I understand the position, the persons appointed from the county council are governed by Rule 5 of the Second Schedule of the Agriculture Act, 1931, which reads:</P>
      <P>No person shall be appointed to be a member of a committee of agriculture unless he either has a practical, commercial or technical knowledge of land or has an estate or interest in some agricultural land in the county or has special local knowledge of agricultural matters.</P>

There is a provision in the 1931 Act which sets out qualifications <Col N="900" /> for membership of agricultural committees. There must be some governing method by which persons are disqualified from membership.  If there is not a provision there, there should be before this Bill passes through Parliament. I will not challenge anybody. I am long enough in politics to know that would not be any good.  I do not know what the position is in relation to these qualifications.

      <P>I am aware of a case where there is an election coming along which may cause a certain amount of trouble.  Deputy Donegan has quoted the Second Schedule of the Agriculture Act, 1931.  Rule 2 of that Schedule lays down:</P>
      <P>Every committee of agriculture shall be composed at the discretion of the council either wholly of persons who are members of the council or partly of persons who are and partly of persons who are not members of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rule 5 sets out that no person be appointed to a committee unless &ldquo;he <Col N="901" /> either has a practical, commercial or technical knowledge of land or has an estate or interest in some agricultural land in the county or has special local knowledge of agricultural matters&rdquo;.  It would appear from this that he does not even have to belong to the county. If he comes under this very wide qualification, it does not matter where he comes from.  Bringing in the Bill was the Minister's responsibility, but it is our duty, before it goes through, to point out weaknesses in it to him in case he might feel inclined to alter them later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Tully in as much as subsection (1) (c) of section 2 adds to Rule 5 and they must also qualify under that. Deputy Brennan asked what was wrong with this.  I shall cite a good committee, which shall remain nameless. It is wrong that a place should be given to people of a certain political line, while the head of Muintir na Tíre in the county and the best shorthorn breeder in the county, with 30 years' experience of doing highlyspecialised cereal plots for the Department, should both be excluded, although they were members for 20 years.  It is all right for the Minister to say that he must now depend on the county councils.  While I agree there is nothing wrong with politicians, at the same time, I think these two examples I have quoted are quite wrong.  While the Bill is a slight step forward, it might not be a bad thing if, before it went through, the Minister looked at it and made some changes.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, and on the assumption that the House agrees, I propose to follow established practice and to treat the six Votes for which I am responsible as one group, so that there may be one general discussion, without, of course, prejudicing the right of any Deputy to raise a particular point on any individual Vote.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that my Department's Estimates for last year were not taken in the House until February of this year, that is, four months ago. On that occasion, my introductory speech covered developments up to then.  In view of the shortness of the interval since that general review of my Department's activities, I intend to be briefer than usual on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the headquarters of the Department are concerned, the most notable event since I spoke here in February was the Third Conference of European Ministers of Justice, which, as Deputies are aware, was held here in Leinster House at the end of May. The Conference, which was convened under the auspices of the Council of Europe, was attended by delegations from 16 member countries, and by observers from Finland and Spain.  It would be remiss of me, a Cheann <Col N="903" /> Comhairle, if I did not express my deep gratitude to you and to the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad for placing the facilities of this building at the disposal of the Conference in such a generous and co-operative manner. The members of both Houses may take a justifiable pride in the facilities provided, which were the subject of very favourable comment from our distinguished visitors.  I am satisfied that in its working sessions the Conference made a significant contribution to the ideals of the Council of Europe, and that the informal exchanges of views outside the formal sessions have helped to further mutual understanding and trust among the participants.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, I am sure, be interested to know that under an arrangement approved by the Government, a group of students from Northern Rhodesia are being trained in our public services in preparation for their assuming important responsibilities as administrators in their own country, when it becomes the independent state of Zambia towards the end of this year. Four young administrators have been assigned to my Department and are being trained in duties relating to the courts, the Garda Síochána and the prison services, and are absorbing a knowledge of working methods with very commendable speed.  We are very glad to have them with us, and are gratified that Northern Rhodesia should see fit to turn to us for guidance in the administration of justice and that we should have this opportunity of helping even in a small way an emerging African nation and its people.</P>
    <P>Before mentioning facts and figures in relation to the Garda Síochána, I should like to mention two important recent developments affecting the Force.</P>
    <P>First, the transfer of the Training Centre from Dublin to Templemore took place in the second half of February, and training courses for recruits, and promotion and other courses are now in full swing there. The accommodation and facilities provided are of a very high order, and <Col N="904" /> should lead to even greater efficiency in the Force, the standards of which, I am happy to say, are already very high.  The local authorities and people of Templemore have, by the warmhearted welcome they have extended to their new neighbours, shown their appreciation of the Government's policy in the field of decentralisation.</P>
    <P>The second interesting item is the recently-announced scheme for the reorganisation and expansion of the Dublin Metropolitan Garda Division. This involves the merging with the present Division of a number of subdistricts at present surrounding it, so that the new Dublin Metropolitan Garda area will stretch from Howth on the north side to Bray on the south. This new arrangement is part of a general reorganisation scheme, the object of which is to increase efficiency and to distribute Garda personnel and services where they are most needed to combat crime.  As Deputies may be aware Dublin with less than 25 per cent of the State's population has over 50 per cent of the indictable crimes committed within its boundaries.  The new Metropolitan Area will be divided into two Divisions, each under the supervision of a chief superintendent and subject to administrative control from Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>Garda expenditure for the current year is estimated at £7,772,980 which shows a net increase of £120,230 on the Estimate for last year.  The greatest part of this increase is in subhead H, the pensions subhead, and is due partly to an increase in the number of pensioners and partly to the increase in pensions that was granted to Garda pensioners, like other State pensioners, from 1st November, 1963.  In subhead B&mdash;Travelling and Incidental Expenses&mdash;additional provision has been made to meet the increases in subsistence and other allowances, which were granted in February last, in settlement of claims submitted under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme and which will cost approximately £44,000 this year.  The decision, to which attention is drawn in the Notes in the Book of Estimates, to transfer to the appropriate Votes <Col N="905" /> the charges previously carried by the Vote for Posts and Telegraphs in respect of services rendered by that Department, is mainly responsible for the increase in subhead C. Subheads E and F have been increased to meet the cost of furniture for the Templemore Training Centre and replacements in and additions to Garda vehicular strength.  The provision of additional equipment, such as Scotchlite belts, reflective triangles and a mobile crime detection unit, has also contributed to the increases.</P>
    <P>There is an apparent decrease in the provision for pay.  This is because the figure shown for 1963-64 includes the provision last year, in a Supplementary Estimate, for payment of arrears of pay from January, 1963, following the pay increase awarded at Arbitration. The 1963-64 figure, therefore, includes approximately £100,000 in respect of 1962-63.  I should mention, however, that it will be necessary later in the year to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to meet the ninth round pay increase that was awarded to the Garda Síochána from 1st February of this year.  It will be in the region of £700,000.  This will result in an increase in the total estimate for subhead A this year.  The provision for pensions will also need to be increased as a result of the pay increases.</P>
    <P>There is a substantial increase in the estimate for appropriations in aid.  This is mainly due to an increase in the contribution from the Road Fund to the Garda Vote in respect of expenses incurred by the Garda Síochána in the enforcement of road traffic laws.</P>
    <P>I have referred on previous occasions to proposals to close down stations or reduce them to one-man units.  I wish to assure Deputies that I only approve of a proposal of this sort when I have been satisfied beyond all doubt after a most careful examination of all the circumstances that by reason of the absence of crime, the sparsity of population and the control that can be exercised from adjoining stations, it can be implemented with a saving to the public purse and without detriment to the policing of the area concerned.  In the calendar year 1963 three stations <Col N="906" /> were closed and two reduced to one-man units.</P>
    <P>I am happy to be able to report that progress is being maintained in the provision of suitable accommodation for the Force.  Fifteen new stations with 19 married quarters were completed during the past year and 70 new houses for married members were provided by the National Building Agency.  Work is in progress at present on 19 new stations and 300 houses.</P>
    <P>I know that most Deputies will agree with me when I say that the most important duty of the Minister for Justice is the preservation of law and order and the protection of the community against crime.  While we are in this country very fortunate in this regard when compared to most of our European neighbours we must never become complacent and we should be anxious at all times both to counter disturbing trends and improve the existing situation where possible.</P>
    <P>`I mentioned in connection with last year's Estimate that the provisional figures for indictable crime for the nine months ended 30th June, 1963, indicated that the final figures for the year ended 30th September, 1963, would show a fairly substantial upward trend and this turned out to be the case.  The figure for 1963 was, in fact, 16,203 as against 15,307 in the preceding year and 14,818 in the year before that.</P>
    <P>The most significant incease was in the numbers of housebreakings and similar crimes which, in the year ended 30th September, 1963, amounted to 4,006 as against 3,466 for 1962 and 3,186 for 1961.  1,047 assaults and other offences against the person were recorded as against 885 and 701 in the corresponding years.  These increases are disturbing, particularly as they come in the categories comprising serious types of crime.</P>
    <P>It is clear if we are to maintain or even improve our position as a community in the light of trends and developments elsewhere that a comprehensive and sustained effort will be required by all concerned.  The main contribution will have to come from the Garda Síochána and in this connection <Col N="907" /> I would like to assure the House that I am constantly keeping under review, their strength, location, morale, discipline, methods of training and equipment and I am satisfied that the Force is in good shape and well-equipped for the prevention of crime and the apprehension of criminals.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of some significance that 40 per cent of all persons convicted of indictable crimes last year were under 17 years of age.  A particular effort must be made by parents, teachers and others who have close contact with young persons to inculcate into them sound principles and respect for authority and the law.  The Garda are participating on an increasing scale in the formation of youth clubs: they believe, and I believe, that the youth clubs can play a very strong part in the disciplining of young people for their own and the community's good.</P>
    <P>Owners of property have a duty and a part to play and I would like again to appeal to property owners to make it as difficult as possible for the criminal, particularly the petty larcenist. Locking of doors and windows, locking of motor-cars are elementary precautions but it is surprising how many people who pride themselves on their commonsense and their practical approach to life's problems who neglect simple precautions of this kind.</P>
    <P>In my speech on last year's Estimates, I outlined the steps that the Garda are taking to ensure that premises are less vulnerable to the thief.  I referred to the special Preventive Unit that has been set up in Dublin which, among other duties, surveys premises and advises the owners of precautionary steps they might take, and to the fact that the Garda in the rest of the country provide similar advisory services.  I would urge owners to co-operate wholeheartedly with the Gardaí in this regard.  The Garda cannot be everywhere and everyone must play his part in frustrating the criminal.</P>
    <P>The courts, too, have a vital part to play by imposing sentences which are realistic and appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.  In this <Col N="908" /> connection I hope that justices and judges will take account of the progress of our penal reform programme and in deciding for and against gaol sentences will have regard to its emphasis on the rehabilitation of prisoners.</P>
    <P>The overall detection rate for all indictable crimes rose to 69 per cent in 1963 from 66 per cent in 1962.  In Dublin it was 52 per cent as compared with 47 per cent in 1962, and outside Dublin it was 84 per cent as compared with 85 per cent in 1962.  I should like to mention again that these detection rates are regarded as excellent in police circles, and compare very favourably with those of other countries in comparable conditions.  Last year's improvement in the detection rate is all the more gratifying on that account.</P>
    <P>The total number of prosecutions for summary offences was 101,467 in 1963, as against 105,189 in 1962, and 104,057 in 1961.  The number of prosecutions for Road Traffic offences was 74,853 as against 77,203 in 1962. The decrease in prosecutions for these offences is undoubtedly due to the operation of the fines-on-the-spot scheme for parking offences in Dublin which came into operation on 1st April, 1963.  By 31st March, 1964 approximately 44,000 notices had been served.</P>
    <P>I availed of the recent visit here of the European Ministers of Justice to compare notes with my colleagues from abroad on these matters.  I am satisfied from these informal discussions that we are proceeding along the right lines in this country and that our position is not, in general, unsatisfactory. To sum up, I would say that the present situation is one that calls neither for alarm nor complacency but simply for eternal vigilance.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for Prisons at £328,640, is £11,920 more than last year's.  The increase arises in the main from the fact that, under the new arrangements made between the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the other State Departments, the prisons service will now for the first time pay for its postal, telephone and telegraph services, at a cost of £5,837. <Col N="909" /> The balance of the increase arises chiefly from additional provision to the extent of £3,792 for victualling in prisons, reflecting some increase in the cost of foodstuffs and a rather larger estimated prison population, which during 1963 showed a daily average increase of 43 over the previous year. The total number in custody under sentence nowadays is around 480 which shows that the upward trend is continuing. But, as I remarked earlier, the figure is low, comparatively speaking.</P>
    <P>The prisons building programme, to which I referred here some months ago is now well under way: in Mountjoy prison the building of an extension to the corrective training wing was begun early last autumn and will provide for still greater segregation of special grade trainee prisoners and of those prisoners who, in the closing stages of their sentences, sleep within the walls but go out every morning to employment outside the prison.  The modernisation of the prison hospital has been completed, the work of converting the old hospital building into an intern officers' quarters is nearing completion and the new bakery is in operation.  In the other prisons, work is well advanced on the renovation and improvement of the older parts of existing buildings and on new installations, including improved heating, laundry and ablution facilities and new quarters for intern officers.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know I am not happy about the location, or the workshop and recreational facilities of St. Patrick's Institution, that is, the juvenile prison, and for some time my Department have been making inquiries with a view to procuring a suitable new site in the vicinity of Dublin.  The very great majority of the offenders are committed from Dublin and must resume their ordinary lives on release in Dublin and on that account and for various other reasons I feel that the location of any institution which we might build must be within a reasonable distance of Dublin so that parents, relatives and friends of these youths may be able to visit them.  If any Deputy knows of 15 <Col N="910" /> to 20 acres going at a reasonable price which would suit our purpose, I should be obliged to hear from him.</P>
    <P>On the debate on last year's Estimates, I outlined the work of the inter-Departmental Committee which I set up in September, 1962, to inquire into the existing methods for the prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders, and I described the principal recommendations made to me by the Committee in relation to our prison system, the Children's Court, the probation service and the role of the Gardaí in the prevention of juvenile delinquency.  I am happy to be able to say that the changes being introduced are working out very smoothly and are already giving most encouraging results.  Furthermore, study visits abroad for senior prison personnel have been arranged under the auspices of the Council of Europe and these provide opportunities for the examination of the effectiveness of methods employed elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The statutory powers to grant temporary release are being increasingly used in the case of prisoners who are making good progress and for whom outside employment can be obtained while their sentences are running.  The exercise of these powers is an invaluable means of smoothing the transition from detention to freedom and also of ensuring, as far as possible, that the prisoner on his final discharge is already on his feet as a useful member of society.  In the six months from September, 1963 to February, 1964 inclusive, four prisoners were discharged to take up employment before completion of their sentences while six others were released each day to outside employment.  The corresponding figures in the case of St. Patrick's Institution are three and seven.  A grant of temporary release on other grounds was made in a total of 12 other cases, usually for reasons connected with family difficulties or bereavements.</P>
    <P>The work of securing outside employment for promising prisoners has so far been carried out by the existing prison personnel and we may hope for greatly enlarged possibilities for this type of approach to the problem <Col N="911" /> of reintegrating the prisoner in society when the two new prison Welfare Officers take up duty.  The appointments in these cases have now been ratified as have the appointments of a Probation Administration Officer, the new head of the probation service, and of the additional Probation Officers and I am satisfied that with these recruitments, together with the assistance of the voluntary probation workers&mdash;of whom three groups in Dublin alone now have recognised status&mdash;we should have an adequate probation service within a comparatively short time.</P>
    <P>Apart from the probation service, the Juvenile Liaison Officers attached to the Dublin Metropolitan Division of the Garda Síochána are now an active force in the field of preventive justice.  Case-work in this new service commenced last September and up to the end of January nearly two hundred juvenile first offenders had been dealt with.  A Ban-Gharda has recently been added to the team to look after suitable girl offenders assigned for supervision.  The Junior Liaison Officer is concerned with the positive rather than the negative aspects of crime prevention: with the promotion of healthy youthful activity, particularly club activities, and of better relations between the erring juvenile and his family, and the enthusiastic Junior Liaison Officer team are already endeavouring to set up a summer camp to which deprived children assigned to their care can be invited for a holiday.</P>
    <P>For a considerable time past individual Gardaí have voluntarily been contributing their efforts to youth club work and now the Force as a whole is actively engaged in promoting and strengthening the boys' club movement.  I feel sure that this work will not only be a valuable social contribution and a means of reducing the incidence of delinquent behaviour but will also assist in the promotion of cordial relations between the Gardaí and the members of the public.  Good public relations are, of course, essential to the success of all Garda work.</P>
    <P>Once again, I cannot finish on this subject without a special word of <Col N="912" /> thanks to those many voluntary social workers who do so much to assist the direct efforts of the State&mdash;the courts, police probation and prison staffs in fulfilling the ends of justice: to the Legion of Mary and the Salvation Army, to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, especially the Guild of St. Philip, to the Discharged Prisoners' Aid Society, the Irish Red Cross Society, the St. Patrick's Welfare Association and most particularly the Prison Visiting Committees for all they have done and are doing to help in the rehabilitation of the offender.  To this work of true citizenship I am very glad to pay tribute.</P>
    <P>The next Estimate is that for the courts.  The increase of £27,340 shown in the Estimate Volume arises for the most part from changes in accounting procedures: there is no substantial change in actual expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to mention in connection with this Estimate that the Commission appointed to inquire into court practice and procedure reported during the year on the procedure for the preliminary investigation of indictable offences.  The Government, having given long and careful consideration to the views and conclusions expressed in the majority report, have decided that it is possible to ensure greater administrative efficiency, considerable savings in public expenditure and in the time of witnesses and all concerned with preliminary hearings, while at the same time protecting fully the position of the accused by adopting the recommendation contained in the minority report for the abolition of the system of preliminary investigation altogether. Legislation to implement this decision is in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>The next Estimate, that for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, shows an increase of £14,660 over the previous year.  This is almost entirely due to the making of provision for increases of staff during the year.  I am sure Deputies O'Higgins and Sweetman will be pleased with this.</P>

      <P>The progressive increase in the volume of business of <Col N="913" /> these offices, to which I have drawn attention previously, continues to be maintained.  This increase in the volume of business reflects the buoyancy of the business and economic life of the country and underlines the need for an efficient Land Registry and an efficient Registry of Deeds to serve these needs.  As I say, I am sure Deputies O'Higgins and Sweetman will be pleased with this provision for extra staff in the Land Registry.</P>

      <P>My Department continues to seek ways and means of providing an efficient service in both offices.  Apart from the provision of additional staff to cope with the extra work, accommodation has been a problem in the Land Registry.  I expect that a substantial addition, which has been added to the present building will soon be completed, and will suffice pending the provision of a large new block which is at present at the planning stage.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for Charitable Donations and Bequests also shows a small increase of £810, caused by the need for adding to the staff to meet the greater volume of work involved in handling the progressively increasing funds administered by the Charity Commissioners.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I am glad to express publicly my thanks to the members of the various Committees and Boards, who are voluntarily engaged in special activities associated with my Department. The labours of these publicspirited citizens are of the greatest importance, and I am sure the House will join with me in paying them a well-earned tribute.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In connection with any assessment to income tax where a person proves, to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners, that he has incurred expense on himself, or on any dependant, arising out of disability or illness which is serious and against which disability or illness the Voluntary Health Insurance Board have refused to cover him under any of their insurance schemes, or have only agreed so to cover him at a premium in excess of twice their normal rate, there shall be deducted from the income to be assessed the vouched expenses so incurred in excess of £50 per annum per person and up to a maximum of £300 per annum per person.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> On Committee Stage, we had discussion on another amendment to which this is generic.  The purpose of the amendment moved on the Committee Stage by Deputy Byrne and supported by many Deputies on this side of the House was to ensure that, where a person had incurred substantial expense arising out of disability, he would get a tax allowance for such expense.  What we had introduced at that time followed exactly the report of the Commission and in addition was something on the lines of the Australian system.</P>
    <P>We had considerable discussion with the Minister on that occasion as to the cost here of that amendment and the cost, taken on a percentage basis, of the Australian concession in relation to the total Australian income tax.  Many Deputies, including myself, found it extremely difficult to accept the figures the Minister gave in relation to the cost assessed here based on the same principles or proportions as in Australia.  It would be desirable if the Minister would give us, when he is speaking on this amendment, a more considered view than he gave us on that occasion particularly in the light of the statements and the criticisms that were made of his figures.</P>
    <P>Regardless of that, the Minister made two points against the principle of the amendment as set down on Committee Stage.  The first was that it would be virtually impossible to determine what illness was serious and likely to be permanent.  While perhaps one might not agree with him in that respect, at any rate the House is not now concerned because there has been included in this amendment a clear and specific test of the seriousness of the disability or the illness.  The clear and specific test which is included is that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board has refused to cover the person concerned under any of their schemes against this illness for any premium that is not in excess of twice the normal rate.</P>
    <P>Many of us have from time to time come across cases of very great hardship where people have tried to cover themselves through the Voluntary <Col N="916" /> Health Insurance Board and have found the Board were not prepared to take them on as a risk.  Nevertheless, they have in years afterwards incurred substantial expense because of illness and usually, because of that illness, have not been in a position to earn their normal salaries.  Therefore, the hardship is on the double because while their earning is cut down they get no tax allowance for the heavy cost involved.  We have made it clear in this amendment that the test of whether the illness or disability is serious lies in the certificate of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  As long as that certificate and that test are there, there is the necessary preciseness about the amendment on which the Minister spoke on the last occasion.</P>
    <P>As on the last occasion, the request is to permit an allowance where the illness has cost in excess of £50 a year and under £300 a year.  With that preciseness because of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board certificate and because the band of expense is between £50 and £300, the amendment could not possibly cost any enormously substantial sum.  While not costing a great deal to the revenue as a whole, it would be of immense importance in the relief of hardship in the type of cases we feel would be covered.  For that reason, we urge very strongly that the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is somewhat different from that submitted on Committee Stage.  I must admit the Deputy has met some of the objections I raised on that Stage and probably come a bit nearer to making such a scheme administratively possible.  At the same time, I must oppose the amendment for various reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three changes are made.  First I pointed out on the Committee Stage that to decide whether an illness was permanent or not would be a very difficult matter for administrators. That difficulty is removed now. Secondly, this concession would largely be confined to those who could not secure cover from the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  Thirdly, there is the very useful safeguard that <Col N="917" /> before payment is made the claim must satisfy the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>When this amendment was put in last year I thought that if there were such a clause as the Deputy has put in here a person who was rejected by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board might get some relief.  Then I was shown the great difficulties of this matter.  One of them was that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board reject a person sometimes wholly and sometimes partially.  The example given to me was of a person suffering from diabetes but otherwise healthy. It was suggested he might be accepted by the board but not in respect of illnesses arising out of diabetes.  One of the great difficulties is that we are not dealing with voluntary health insurance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like interrupting the Minister, but the charge would be in respect of the particular illness the man was suffering from and, therefore, the diabetes case would be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They say: &ldquo;We will cover you for anything but diabetes&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the amendment would cover it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties is they do not load the premium as life insurance bodies do.  They impose the same premium but say they will accept anything but certain diseases.  I shall come back to it in a minute.  One great difficulty about the Voluntary Health Insurance Board is that under the Act which established the board there are about 60 registered bodies who are doing this health insurance business.  The first difficulty, therefore, that would arise in this respect is that a person seeking coverage with another body and either partially insured or rejected, would be compelled to try also the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme and be rejected by the board before being given any relief by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People insured with the various bodies other than the Voluntary <Col N="918" /> Health Insurance Board may have some personal reason why they prefer to go to these people rather than the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and might resent being compelled to go to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to offer their premium there. As well as that, there are bodies entitled to do this type of business under section 4 of the 1955 Finance Act.  They were principally trade unions and friendly societies helping people to pay their medical expenses. There are many of these bodies also.</P>
    <P>We have, therefore, a very wide choice in this country of bodies catering for sickness in addition to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. There is the INTO, for instance.  They have a health scheme but all their members are not bound to join it. In fact, some of them might have serious objection to joining it or to being compelled to join it if they were paying income tax and seeking some relief from income tax because of medical expenses.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's proposal in the amendment would appear to have been prompted by the impression that if a person were suffering from a certain illness the premium would be loaded. What happens is that the illness would be excluded and no person would be paid by the board in respect of complaints arising from that particular illness.  I mentioned on Committee Stage, as a general objection to providing this type of relief through income tax, that it does lead to inequities as between one person and another.  I gave the example of a man with three children earning £1,450 a year.  If he were to meet with an illness and had to pay £100 medical fees his relief would be £23 15s Od, but a man with six children would not get any relief because he would not be subject to any income tax.</P>
    <P>Then there is the case of a man earning £10,000 a year.  He would get relief of £69 3s 4d on every £100 spent.  That goes to show that the person who really needs the help most is the most unlikely to get any benefit from a scheme such as that proposed. That is why, on Committee Stage, I argued that the relief which the Deputy has in mind would be better secured <Col N="919" /> under a health scheme rather than an income tax system.</P>
    <P>Under a health scheme, without any doubt it would be provided that the person who was worst off would get the better relief and the person best off would get small benefits.  For that reason it is quite obvious that this type of scheme should be provided under a Health Act rather than through the income tax code.  As I mentioned then, there is a Select Committee sitting on the health services and presumably recommendations will be made by that Committee that will give more help to those on lower and medium incomes to pay their medical expenses.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked me about the position in Australia.  I mentioned on the last occasion that if the Australian scheme were applied here it might cost us £3 million, The amendment proposed on Committee Stage and today would not, however, cost anything like that because there are restrictions here which do not apply in Australia. The £3 million figure is based on the amount collected in 1963-64 by way of income tax in Australia, which was £830 million.  Of that, £540 million was income tax from individuals.  The amount the health concessions cost the Australian Exchequer was £35 million. If you take that £35 million out of the £540 million and work out a percentage, it would confront us with a very costly scheme if applied here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister happen to know if this is the only health concession in Australia?  I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the figure of £35 million in Australia cover any other income tax health allowances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. Deputies will see from that figure that the average amount allowed to each of the taxpayers who contributed £540 million in Australia was £30.  If that scheme were applied here it would cost from £3 million to £4 million.  On the other hand, if the percentage were allowed as a percentage of the amount <Col N="920" /> paid in by taxpayers it would be £2 million a year.  Then, if the restrictions we impose were applied it would be much lower than that.  Of course, Deputies will realise that where a limit of £300 is inserted, as Deputy Sweetman has proposed here, there would be demands every year to have that limit raised until eventually the limit would be very high and, of course, the scheme would cost more and more.  Principally because I think it is not the way to give this benefit&mdash; under the income tax code instead of under the health scheme&mdash;I am opposing the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested to this extent.  At present I know somebody who has worked all his life in a very responsible position and has a pension of £1,000 per annum.  This person is now extremely ill with an illness of long duration.  It has already lasted for the past year or two and it will last for the remainder of his life.  It costs him £20 a week.  It is fantastic to think that there is no relief for such a person. It is amazing that the law of any Christian country would allow such a situation to exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no more experienced or wily parliamentarian in the House than the Minister for Finance and, with the greatest respect, I am sure Deputies will agree with me when I say, as others before me have said, he is a past-master at begging the question.  This talk about Australia and about it costing £3 million to implement this amendment is grotesque fraud.  Implementation of the amendment would probably cost less than £100,000 a year to the State.  The amendment is highly restrictive and represents a considerably watereddown version of the report of the Income Tax Commission, our own commission which sat for many years and considered the matter at great length.  It heard the views of the Revenue Commissioners on the proposals and it still recommended the principle of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners went on record before the Commission as opposed to the principle of this amendment because it cuts across the theoretical <Col N="921" /> conception of income tax as a non-discretionary tax.  There are many academic, theoretical grounds for opposing this and the Minister has produced them all.  But Deputy Clinton who spoke a few moments ago so very briefly summed up the position.  It is an appalling thing that in a Christian country a modest relief for the dying&mdash;that is what it amounts to&mdash;should be so persistently opposed by the Minister.  Was there ever a greater fraud perpetrated on the Irish people than the Health Services Committee of this House which is now sitting and which has sat for over two years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not discussing the workings of the Committee but repudiating the Minister's argument that we should await the report of the Committee in its sterile effort to provide us with adequate health services. It is gross irrelevance to this amendment to bring in that matter. As to the further theoretical reasons produced by the Minister on this occasion we have heard some which have not been produced before.  We have heard of the bodies other than the Voluntary Health Insurance Board catering for medical insurance.  The Minister said there were sixty of them. They are of no consequence; for all practical purposes, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board has a statutory monopoly of medical expenses insurance in this State and, to the extent that these other bodies exist, they can be provided for in a recast <Col N="922" /> version of the amendment.</P>
      <P>As I said in relation to other amendments, I can always respect the point of view of the Minister for Finance who says: &ldquo;I have not got the money&rdquo;, but to produce the doctrinaire grounds the Minister has used in justification of his rejection of the Commission's recommendation is, I think, a rather dishonest performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the view expressed by the Minister and with the attitude he has taken up. Over the years there has been a very honestly held view&mdash;that goes without saying&mdash;that it is wrong to use the revenue taxation code in this way.  That view was put up to me very strongly when I introduced the incentives for exports.  It was said it should be done in another way but I think time has shown that my disagreement with that doctrinaire view and the decision I took at the time was right.  I think the Minister would be taking the same right course if he accepted the amendment on the lines we have been discussing.</P>
      <P>There is no use in the Minister trying to conjure up a great case against the amendment on the basis of a person with a salary of £10,000 a year without reference to the rest of the story as to how much the Minister takes out of that and how much the man has left for himself.  My own view is that rates in relation to direct taxation of that sort compare unfavourably with those of other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It happens that I have before me the rate of federal income tax on individuals in Canada.  I suppose the Minister will agree that we can take roughly 30,000 dollars as being the equivalent of the figure he quoted.  It is not quite three in the £ but it is as near as makes no difference.  As far as I can see, from 30,000 dollars, the Canadian Government take only 11,000 dollars.  Here, first of all we take 6/4d in the £ in income tax which is virtually £10,000, as near as makes no difference.  Then we take surtax on top of that and this would mean that the person concerned would be left, in the Minister's own case, with considerably less particularly when we take into <Col N="923" /> account that in Canada the exemption for a married person is 2,000 dollars, personal allowance, which when reduced would again be substantially above the figure that we have here.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not think it is fair for the Minister to take one figure out of the income bracket and build his whole case around that, without taking into account how much of that particular income he already takes away under the income tax and surtax now in operation.  I think the Minister is wrong in refusing to accept this principle.  I do not suggest for a moment that my drafting is completely watertight, but I think the Minister will agree with me that it is sufficient to make the principles which we are urging on him sufficiently clear.  It is entirely wrong, as Deputy Clinton said a moment ago, that where a person has his whole income, or a large part of his income, going on costs arising from permanent illness, serious illness or serious disability, there should not be some allowance in the income tax code for that.  Although the Minister has intimated that he will oppose the amendment now, I shall urge him most strongly, indeed, to have another thought about this matter.  I believe, if he does, he will find that the objections to it are founded in the doctrinaire point of view, honestly held of course, but wrong.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 recommitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 14, after line 43, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>12A.  The exemption from income tax liability granted under the Finance Act, 1963, to agricultural and fishery co-operatives shall be extended to cover industrial producer co-operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was raised by Deputy Corish on Second Reading.  It arises because of the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce set up a Commission on Co-operative Societies in 1957.  It should have produced excellent results because it did not bring <Col N="924" /> in any recommendation until June, 1963, and, in the course of six years consideration, I am quite sure they looked at every angle of this problem. When they brought in the recommendation they said, and I quote from the Report of the Committee on Co-operative Societies, page 41:</P>
    <P>The present position is satisfactory in so far as genuine co-operatives are concerned.  There is, however, a probability of abuse by societies which, though holding themselves out as co-operatives, do not observe true co-operative principles in their activities.  This situation could lead to the withdrawal of the tax privilege from all societies, including the genuine co-ops.  The arrangements which we recommend for restricting the use of the term &ldquo;co-operative&rdquo; to genuine co-operative societies would provide a means of eliminating these tax abuses.  While having regard to the recommendations in the Fifth Report of the Commission on Income Taxation and to the intentions of the Government as indicated in the Second White Paper on Direct Taxation laid before the Oireachtas in April, 1963 and in the Financial Statement of the Minister for Finance when introducing the Budget, 1963, we feel generally that the current tax exemption should be preserved for genuine co-operative societies.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; appears on several occasions.  This is a genuine co-operative society.  The Minister, however, for reasons of his own, decided that he would only include the agricultural and fishery co-operatives in the scheme, and would not include industrial co-operatives.  We can see no reason at all why a genuine co-operative society, as recommended by the Commission on Co-operative Societies, after six years' labour, should not have been included.  This society, which is a genuine co-operative society, being made liable for income tax, while they are trying to pay for a heavy capital commitment, are, in fact, almost being put out of business.  I do not think that is what the Minister intended.  I think a genuine mistake was made, and I suggest to the Minister that it can be <Col N="925" /> remedied now.  The Minister should include genuine industrial co-operatives as well as agricultural and fishery co-operatives. I do not wish to delay the House in discussing the amendment because I think the Minister is well aware that it should not be necessary to do so.  I should like to ask the Minister, in view of the facts I have given him, and of which he was already aware before now, to consider this matter and allow the amendment to be included in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, we must look at how we stand with regard to income tax in connection with co-operative societies.  The Commission made a recommendation with regard to the relief of income tax for certain societies and the imposition of income tax on all other co-operative societies in their Fifth Report.  The Government gave their views on this in the Second White Paper on direct taxation.  Last year in Part VII of the Finance Act, 1963, the legislation was implemented by the Government, as forecast in the White Paper.  Generally speaking, following the recommendation of the Income Tax Commission, agricultural co-operatives were exempted.  Fishery co-operatives which had not been mentioned by the Income Tax Commission were also included. Were all other societies excluded because there had been rather undesirable results from the exemptions from income tax up to that time?</P>
      <P>I know the society the Labour Party has in mind.  It is a deserving society, but, unfortunately, neither my legal advisers nor I can think of any form of words that would give relief to that particular society and not include many others, which we would not like to include.  I suppose Deputies will say we can name the society and say it could be exempted, but that would not be desirable.  My objection, therefore, is that to include any type of industrial society would lead to the inclusion of others which we certainly do not want to include.  We do everything possible, in fact, to keep them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As long as we can remember co-operative societies generally were relieved from income tax and it came to the stage where something should <Col N="926" /> be done because people were taking advantage of that fact, and were forming co-operative societies for the purpose of evading income tax and not for the purpose of co-operation. In 1963 for the first time income tax was extracted from co-operative societies, with the exception of the agricultural and fishery co-operatives.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have embarked on a new conception of the treatment of co-operative societies and I think we should give it a few years.  I would ask the Deputy to look at it in that way. It is a bit soon to amend it.  It is only for one year.  Perhaps, when we have a little more experience, after another year or two, we might be able to consider some variation of the scheme already there.  I am not promising that we shall: I say it might be possible when we have a bit more experience but certainly not at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most extraordinary thing I have heard for a long time.  The Minister admits that there is a case for it.  He admits that the society is a genuine society and that, but for the fact that his legal advisers cannot find the words, it would be exempt, and, for that reason, that they must pay income tax.</P>
      <P>We assume from the Minister's statement that all the other societies&mdash;the fishery co-operatives and agricultural co-operatives&mdash;are Simon Pures.  We assume that, when the Act was passed, not one of those societies that was allowed in, was not a genuine co-operative. The Minister knows as well as I do that that is a lot of cod.  He knows that, because it had to be worded in that way, the chancers got in, as they would in any other case. Despite that, the Minister&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;included fishery co-operatives and agricultural co-operatives.</P>
      <P>The Minister now says that the fish and flesh are all right but the good red herring is out.  He says the red herring cannot be treated the same as the remainder.  That is a terrible approach on the part of the Minister. If he even said he would be prepared to go into the matter to see if he could find the words, it would be some step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first time I have ever <Col N="927" /> heard a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance say he could not find the right words.  Just think that the Minister for Finance admits he could not find the words which would describe this adequately in order to keep the others out.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister could have done it in the same way as he did it for the other co-operatives.  He could have included these people who, he conceded, are genuine co-operatives and very deserving.  It will be small consolation to them if, two or three years hence, the Minister or his successor decides to amend the Act when these people have gone out of business because they were unable to meet the heavy income tax commitment.  Surely the fact that they are a genuine cooperative&mdash;and there is no question about it&mdash;means that there should be some way in which this matter can be dealt with.  Before it is finally written off, would there be any possibility of the Minister's getting a dictionary and getting his legal advisers to go through it to find, as they will, a word which will allow him to include a genuine industrial co-operative society and to have such societies included as well as the other two types of societies he has mentioned?</P>
    <P>We know that, over the years, there were abuses.  I cannot understand how this has come about in view of the fact that the recommendation by the Committee, after their six years' labours, did not say that industrial co-operatives should be excluded. It said that genuine co-operatives should be included.  This is a genuine co-operative and the Minister says, in effect: &ldquo;We cannot find the words and, therefore, they must pay&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister again try to have a look at this to see if there is something he can do about it because a grave injustice is being done to this co-operative society?  No encouragement is given to other producer co-operatives to come into existence if this is the way the one at present in existence is being treated.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 19, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 1 (4) (d) of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952, is hereby amended by the insertion of the words `including machinery used in a quarry or pit solely for the purpose of raising material for the construction or repair of roads.&rdquo;'</P>
      <P>I have very little more to say on this amendment other than what I said on the Committee Stage.  I put down the amendment again to give the Minister an opportunity to consider it further in the interval and in the light of explanations we gave him on that occasion.  The fact is that I happen to know of one case where a man has a lorry so specially constructed that it has built on it a special type of crusher mill for the purpose of breaking up road material in a pit.  If that man had that machinery on a low loader, the low loader would not bear road fund taxation.  But, because it is on a lorry instead of being on a low loader and because he takes it, therefore, on the roads from one quarry to another, always using it for the sole purpose of raising road making materials, he is subject to the £1 per horse power tax for which he would not be liable with a low loader.  It seems to me that that is all wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case in point that I know of is a case where a man, for the county council, takes around his machinery in this way about half a dozen times <Col N="929" /> in the year and that is that.  For those half dozen or so trips, the existing law provides that he is charged £75 a year tax.  The Minister will not get anything for the Road Fund by keeping this because the man concerned will obviously sell the lorry and utilise the type of low loader that would be exempt for such carriage.  In the circumstances, I think there is nothing to be gained by the Minister's retaining the section and that there is everything to be gained by accepting the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit that this is rather a difficult and technical problem.  I did study the matter since the Committee Stage.  As far as I can see, the underlying principle which applies is the use to which the vehicle is put on the road&mdash;not the use to which it is put when it is off the road.</P>
      <P>The amendment suggested by the Deputy lays particular stress on the use to which the vehicle is put when it is off the road.  The determining factor is, therefore, the use to which the vehicle is put when it is on the road.  That is why certain vehicles are exempt when used for road-making.</P>
      <P>I think the Deputy is not correct in his plea that if the particular person he mentioned had loaded this equipment on a low loader the low loader would be exempt from duty.  I asked my friends in the Department of Local Government to give me examples of those vehicles that are exempt and those that are not exempt.  They assure me that vehicles are exempt only if used solely for road-making and only if special road equipment is permanently built in or permanently attached to the vehicle.  It must be permanently built in or permanently attached to the vehicle.  If it is a low loader used merely for the conveyance of equipment. which is not permanently attached or built in, it would not be exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Another example which illustrates the point is a tar tanker used only for the carriage of tar; it would not be exempt, but a tar sprayer, fitted permanently with pumps and a spraying barrel, and so on, would be exempt.  First of all, the vehicle is used for road repairing and road making and, secondly, it must be fitted permanently on to the carrier before exemption can be given.  These are the two tests.  They are two simple tests and I do not think we need go beyond them.</P>

      <P>Before we leave this subject for this year, I want to make one last point.  I had intended making it on an earlier stage but I think it is relevant here and now.  In recent years, an increasing interest has been manifest in tax affairs by both sides of this House.  Very frequently, questions have been put to the Minister which he has been unable to answer because of lack of information.  There seems to me to be a good case for the establishment of some kind of statistical section or research section is the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  I pointed out some years ago the contrast in the information available in the report of the Revenue Commissioners here as compared with the report of the Inland Revenue Authorities in the United Kingdom in which there is a wealth of useful information for those who wish to appraise the tax system.  That information is not available here.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in moving this motion, seemed to me to exude an air of confidence which practically amounted to complacency, complacency which was certainly not justified by the contents of his statement and, in particular, the crime figures which he read out.</P>
      <P>It is rather startling to discover from the Minister's statement today that the figures for indictable crime have increased from 14,800 odd in 1961 to 16,203 in the year 1963.  Housebreaking offences have increased from 3,186 in the year 1961 to over 4,000 in the year 1963 and assaults and other offences against the person have increased from 701 in the year 1961 to 1,047 in the year 1963.</P>
      <P>Those are rather startling figures. They show that within the last couple of years there has been a very considerable increase in indictable crime and a substantial increase in the housebreaking figures and in offences against the person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that the Minister simply has an inborn air of confidence when he is talking about his Department.  I feel sure that the Minister, in fact, is <Col N="933" /> not complacent when faced with a situation like that because it is not a situation in which any Minister for Justice or the Department over which he presides can afford to be complacent.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, whether we like it or not, it does call for an increase in the strength of the Garda Force and it seems to me that it is necessary for this House and for the people of the country to make up their minds to that and, if such an increase is called for, obviously, it will have to be paid for. In face of those figures, in face of that increase&mdash;and it is a gradual but a substantial increase over the last three years&mdash;it does seem to me that some expansion of the personnel in the Garda Force is necessary.</P>
    <P>The picture so far as numbers in the Garda are concerned is one of a rather slight decrease over the last ten years or so, as will be seen from the figures which the Minister gave in reply to a Question which I asked him today. There is no very great variation over the last ten years but, taking 1st January, 1964, as compared with 1st January, 1954, there is a reduction of about 400 in the total membership of the Garda.  There was a slight reduction in 1955, a slight increase in 1956, a drop in 1957, a further drop in 1958, an increase of about 18 in 1959 as against 1958 and then up to 1961 there was a gradual increase and it seems to have dropped off then again from the figure of 6,609 in 1961 to 6,364 on 1st January of this year.</P>
    <P>As I say, there is nothing startling by way of a fluctuation there but what is startling is that with the same Garda Force&mdash;the same as regards numbers, obviously not as regards personnel&mdash; with virtually the same strength in the Garda over the last ten years there has been in these few years from 1961 to 1963 a very considerable increase in crime.  That seems to me to spell out the lesson that the Garda Force is not sufficient in strength to deal with the situation and that the answer is to increase the Force.</P>
    <P>This matter was the subject of an editorial in the Garda Journal.  I have not got the editorial here but I have a report of it which appeared in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 21st March of this year.  That report reads:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> Commenting on the marked increase of indictable crime in the last quarter of 1963 an editorial in the journal in Irish, <i>An Gharda</i>, says it discloses a position of seriousness that must be faced up to without delay if the crime problem in this country is to be kept in hand.</P>
    <P>The increases in offences against the person and offences against property with violence are of a disturbing nature, it continues.</P>
    <P>The editorial asks:</P>
    <P>How is this challenge to law and order to be met and what is the answer to this steep increase in the incidence of crime?</P>
    <P>In the ultimate there is, in our opinion, but one answer.  The strength of the Garda Síochána must be increased and, in addition, the public must be made aware to a far greater degree than seems evident at present of their obligations and responsibilities in this respect.</P>
    <P>The quotation finishes:</P>
    <P>The strength of the Garda Síochána, however, has not kept pace with this population and area increase.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;It was referring to the Dublin Metropolitan area&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>We have in mind particularly an increase in strength sufficient to restore in full that vital police unit &mdash;the guard on the beat.</P>
    <P>It is an unfortunate fact that the pattern for some years now in this country, and, possibly, it is the same in other countries&mdash;I do not know&mdash; but certainly the pattern in this country has been to get away from the garda on the beat.  There is the gradual closing down of garda stations throughout the country.  That was referred to in the Minister's speech this evening. There is the increased use of the squad car in rural areas and the gradual discontinuance of the garda on the beat.  It seems to me that not only in rural areas but in large urban areas and in the city of Dublin and other large urban centres the garda on the beat fulfilled a function that <Col N="935" /> cannot be replaced by means of a squad car, particularly in rural areas. The old time garda whom all of us know of, or if we do not know of, have heard of, became practically an institution.  He was friendly and certainly acquainted with everyone in his area.  He had never any trouble about getting any information which he wanted.  He knew the people in the area for which he was responsible. The type of friendship and respect of the garda which was there lent itself to keeping down crime figures. It is a great pity to see that pattern changing.  I do not believe it can ever be replaced by squad cars or any mechanical device.</P>
    <P>The garda, doing his duty in a squad car, simply goes into the area and goes through it.  He does not get to know the people in that area and they do not get to know him.  He does not get their confidence.  This is not as effective as the old time system of the garda on the beat, whether he was walking his area or doing it on a pedal cycle.  It would be well, as a matter of policy, for the Minister and his advisers to consider that aspect of it and to consider the value of the small rural garda stations from that point of view.</P>
    <P>The Minister, generally in relation to the question of crime, referred to the Preventive Unit which was formed in Dublin.  I consider that this Preventive Unit is certainly a step in the right direction.  I should like to say this to the Minister.  I was called upon, in my business premises, by the area security officer for the area in which it is situated.  I was extremely impressed by his approach to his work, his obvious enthusiasm for the job he had to do and for the fact that he quite clearly knew what he was talking about and had made a study of the situation.  It is a compliment, not only to him but to those who selected him, that he was the type of man who was able to explain what he had in mind and do it in a way the ordinary layman could understand.</P>
    <P>He is the only one of these area security officers, or whatever they are called, I have met.  If the other officers <Col N="936" /> functioning in the city and other areas have the attributes which this man obviously had, then I would say there is a good job being done in the selection of these men.  This is something which was well worth trying.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that this Estimate was discussed a comparatively short while ago.  I do not want to go back very much over the ground that was covered in that discussion. The Minister referred to the transfer of the Garda Depot to Templemore as one of the outstanding matters during the year.  I do not want in any way to go on record as being against decentralisation of Government services.  I think, on the contrary, that there are many aspects of Government services that could be decentralised with benefit to all concerned.  I should like to see the Minister for Agriculture in a setting of sylvan beauty along the Wicklow coast.  I should like to see some of the other Ministers, with their Departments, outside the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I wonder was it wise to choose, as a first step on the road to decentralisation, the Garda Depot?  I wonder whose idea it was?  Did the suggestion come from the Force or was the suggestion imposed on the Force by the Minister for his advisers?  The wisdom of this step certainly is not apparent to me.  It seems abundantly clear, from the crime figures, for example, which the Minister quoted, and from the population figures in the city of Dublin, that the recruits coming into the Garda will be required, to a very large extent, for duty in the city of Dublin.  They will have to serve for some period there.  It would have seemed to me, at any rate, from that point of view, there was a particular value in retaining the Garda Depot in Dublin where the recruits, during their period of training in Dublin, would get to know the city and its environs.  They would get the city atmosphere and then, when they were put on duty in Dublin, would not feel like fish out of water and would not act like fish out of water.</P>
    <P>I am not at all sure that this idea of taking the training centre from Dublin to Templemore&mdash;I am not saying <Col N="937" /> this as against Templemore but to anywhere outside Dublin&mdash;was a wise move at all.  Perhaps ultimately I will see the wisdom of it but I do not consider it was a wise move.</P>
    <P>I want to refer very briefly here to a matter which has been brought to the Minister's attention, unsuccessfully, unfortunately, that is, the question of the siting of the new garda station at Rathdrum, County Wicklow. The Minister will be aware from representations made to him both by the public representatives for the constituency and from the Rathdrum Development Association that the townsfolk in Rathdrum are perturbed by the Minister's decision to site the new Garda station approximately half a mile from the town.  I do not think it necessary to cite the disadvantages associated with this move.  I know from the Minister's point of view the position was that a particular site was in existence.  I think it was owned by the Board of Works and was available for the Garda station. I know, equally well, that there were other sites available in the town and that officials called to inspect these sites.</P>
    <P>It is fair to the Minister to say, when representations were made to him in the matter, he went to the trouble of sending officials along to inspect the alternative sites proposed.  I do not suggest this was so much bogus activity.  I do not accuse the Minister of that but it seems to have been regarded as a <i>fait accompli</i>, that the officials went along and inspected the other sites, when really all the time the decision had been made that the Garda station was to be erected on the site outside the town, about half a mile from it and that that was to be done partly on grounds of expense and partly because it was suggested it would give a greater opportunity for observing traffic.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any real basis for either of those arguments.  The question of expense, if it is involved at all, comes to possibly £120 or £200, which would certainly be saved in the connecting up of water and drainage facilities to the site in the town as against the site outside the town.  I must <Col N="938" /> say I am not impressed at all by the argument with regard to traffic control. I suppose it is too late now to ask the Minister to have another look at the question.  I can assure him that the people of the town who have been in touch with me about it feel rather strongly on the point.  They feel from the general point of view of the town and the usefulness and the part to be played by the Garda in the community, that all these things point to having the station situated in the town rather than outside it.  If it would be possible, I would ask the Minister, even at this late stage, to think again with regard to the siting of this Garda station.</P>
    <P>The last matter to which I wish to refer is a question I raised with the Minister during the past couple of weeks.  It is in regard to road traffic accidents where civil proceedings are instituted and concerns allowing independent Gardaí witnesses to give their statements freely and, if necessary, to attend consultations with the legal advisers of either party.  The present situation is most frustrating from the point of view of the litigant.  It is true that, if the garda has made a formal statement and if the plaintiff or defendant in proceeding gets in touch with the superintendent concerned, he will get a copy of the garda's statement with the police abstract and copies of any other statements taken. But very often the formal statements even of members of the Garda require clarification which may be vital from the point of view of the person embarking, or thinking of embarking, on legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>If a person is advised by his legal advisers that the evidence of a Garda witness is essential, he should be entitled to have available to him in full the evidence that the garda is in a position to give.  That should apply equally to both sides.  I cannot see it would in any way prejudice the administration of justice if that kind of open disclosure were to be made, whenever required.  I know it is possible by means of a rather circuitous route in cross-examining the superintendent to get him to get the information from the garda and pass it on second-hand or third-hand to the litigant. <Col N="939" /> I do not regard that as at all satisfactory.  This is a question the Minister should have another look at. I might as well confess that I am talking principally about the situation as it exists in Dublin.  I think it may be different in rural Ireland.  Gardaí may have greater freedom there as to whether or not they will attend consultations with the legal advisers of litigants, but they do not seem to have in Dublin the freedom I think they should have.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred, towards the closing part of his statement, to the Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry.  The Minister should realise that as far as the Land Registry is concerned, the position is that most of the building sites inside the city boundaries have already been developed over the years and, consequently, what building work there is is moving gradually outwards to land which is already registered land.  Where a building estate starts, there may be 300 or 400 sites on it.  Instead of just one transaction&mdash;the sale of the land to the developing company&mdash;you have on top of that 300 or 400 transactions when the leases are being granted.  That must create a difficult situation in the Land Registry.  It must create a kind of bottleneck wherever you have these building estates.</P>
    <P>Obviously, that work must be done. These people are buying their houses&mdash; many of them with loans&mdash;and are entitled to get their leases registered with as much expedition as possible. While that work is being done, unless there is a substantial increase in staff, some other work must suffer.  I do not in any way fault the officials of the Land Registry.  They certainly do their best to facilitate everyone and do it as quickly as they can.  They have a difficult task by reason of the fact that building is extending to land already registered.  Whatever the Minister can do by means of increasing the staff or increasing the buildings or otherwise to assist in having that situation dealt with quickly, the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister stated in his opening speech, it is only a few <Col N="940" /> months since the previous Estimate was debated and, therefore, there are not many matters to be covered.  First, I should like to pay tribute to the Minister.  From the dealings we have had with him in the House and generally, he has been able to give us courteous replies.  When he is asked about something, he seems to know very soon what the position is and to pass the information along.  The same applies to his officials.  I can assure him that that type of service is appreciated by Deputies on whatever side of the House they sit.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker referred to the fact that the Garda are now being trained in Tipperary.  Whether they are trained in Tipperary or Dublin does not matter because most of the young Gardaí seem to be able to pick up the routine pretty quickly.  It will be generally admitted they are coming into the Force at an extremely difficult time, because not alone in Dublin but in the towns and villages, we have this hooliganism on the part of young people that has to be kept in check. Attacks on the Garda and, in fact, serious injury to some of them, have become quite commonplace.</P>
      <P>I think the Press have a certain amount of responsibility in this matter, not perhaps on this side of the Channel but certainly on the far side, for giving them fancy names.  If instead of calling them &ldquo;Mods&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rockers&rdquo;, they were called what they are, hooligans and blackguards, they would not have an incentive to gather together and create disturbances.  Unfortunately it is the law-abiding citizens, and the Garda who are trying to keep the peace, who suffer in a great many cases, instead of the people who start the trouble.  Apart from the fact that they injure human beings, they must also be condemned for the fact that they seem to take a delight in the amount of damage they can do.  Some years ago people broke into premises and stole property.  Apparently that is not the proper thing to do now; there is no longer a &ldquo;kick&rdquo; in it.  Instead they break windows, damage as much property as they can, and do not take anything away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad that the Garda pay <Col N="941" /> dispute has been settled and that the Garda are now adequately remunerated, because they are in danger when they are on duty.  Having blamed the Press, it must also be stated that much of the trouble starts in the homes.  If these young people were not treated as &ldquo;Mammy's darlings&rdquo; and were dealt with in the proper way, much of the trouble would cease.  Some of the blame must also be laid at the door of the courts.  It is senseless for people who have been responsible for causing serious trouble and brought to court, to be treated leniently.  The time has come when the Minister must take his courage in his hands and make it quite clear that he expects justice to be done.  It is all very well to say that we must be merciful, but we have reached the stage where our patience is worn out.  Again and again, people come before the courts, and again and again they get away with a light sentence or a warning.  Until they are treated as what they are, criminals, and put away from society, we will have a succession of those cases.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this matter worth mentioning is that we find when a group of young people gather together and build up into a gang, nine times out of ten, an older person is involved somewhere in the group.  It is not uncommon in certain towns&mdash;not so much in the cities&mdash;to find someone peddling old motor cycles or scooters to young people and then we have swarms of them chasing through the streets of villages and towns and up and down the country lanes on bikes without tax or insurance.  That is another case where the Garda should be more strict. I am very well aware that the older Garda in many districts know everything that happens.  Five minutes after a crime is committed, they can put their hands on the person responsible. They deserve great credit.</P>
    <P>I fear that sometimes the actions of young hoodlums are looked on as something of a lark.  I do not think they should be considered as something of a lark.  I believe they should be dealt with and dealt with quickly.  If they were, we might not have so many of the tragedies which occur in later <Col N="942" /> years.  The Minister should pay attention to what is happening, and he should try to get the Garda to deal in a proper way with those people before the whole matter gets out of hand.</P>
    <P>The question of traffic control has been mentioned.  I have the greatest admiration for the way in which the Garda on point duty in the towns, and particularly in this city, carry out their job.  It is a great credit to everyone concerned that the change in the traffic regulations&mdash;for example, the one-way streets&mdash;has been working so smoothly. The patience of the man on duty on O'Connell Street must often be tried very severely.  I have seen people who should know better trying to force their way against the flow of traffic and having to be told that a particular street is a one-way street.  That happens again and again, but the Garda never loses his temper.  I have seen traffic policemen in operation in many countries, but I believe our traffic policemen are as fine as the traffic policemen anywhere in the world, and certainly in Europe.</P>
    <P>It was the practice many years ago, and it still happens occasionally&mdash;it is certainly something that should be frowned upon very severely &mdash; that when people from a certain stratum of society were accused of what might be termed a respectable crime, for want of a better word, they got off under the Probation Act, while an unfortunate person who had not got twopence in his pocket got six months for stealing the equivalent of a loaf.  The Minister may say that happens very rarely, but if it happens only once in a year, that is once too often.  It does happen, and the newspapers display the fact that it does happen occasionally.  Again that is something which needs to be tightened up.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister is tired of listening to queries about changes of superintendents' offices.  I know they are moved from one town to another, and the plea is that if any more people are taken away, it will reduce the population. The plea is also made that if they are taken away, the town loses face to a neighbouring town.  I believe that in some cases these decisions are taken with undue haste.  I am aware <Col N="943" /> that while a deputation was awaiting the Minister's pleasure to discuss the matter with him, the superintendent concerned was reading a letter giving him notice to move the next day to his new base.</P>
    <P>I am not challenging the Minister's right to do these things, but I believe that before these decisions are taken, everyone concerned should be taken into consideration, including the local city or town fathers.  After all, they are the people who are trying to build up the town, and trying to give it a certain status.  They help to keep law and order with their local bye-laws and by co-operating with the Garda authorities, and they are entitled at least to the courtesy of a hearing before the final decision is taken.  The first notice they get that the office is being moved should not be through some public representative who is &ldquo;in the know&rdquo;.  It is wrong to do it that way.</P>
    <P>Something similar happened in the case of the court clerks a few months ago and, as the Minister is probably aware, a considerable amount of upset was caused at the time.  Someone who knew an area, and in particular knew the legal profession who were practising in it, was moved out and someone new who was not as easily accessible was moved in to take his place.  I know that the months have straightened out those matters and things are running as smoothly now as they ever were, but it was wrong that it should have been done in the first place.  However, the Minister must have had some reason for doing it.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Minister's speech that while he covered a very wide field in a short space of time, he did not mention anything about leases.  Would the Minister say how we stand with regard to ground leases?  What about that new Bill?</P>

      <P>If that is the case, I would ask the Minister to have something done about preparing the legislation before we resume, because the Minister is probably aware that this is being watched with anxious eyes by people in this city and many other places.  Recently I came across a case in which somebody was being charged a ground rent of £10 a year for a railway wagon which was being used for a summer home.  When we reach that stage, we are reaching the very end of the road.  Therefore I would ask the Minister to do his best to have the legislation introduced as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody in this House, having regard to the fact that the guards have a difficult task to fulfil, should propagate the idea that the guards are a national force, the custodians of everybody's rights and liberties and the protectors of everybody's property.  It should be emphasised to all our citizens that each and every one should regard himself as a police officer and that every citizen has a responsibility to assist the police in every possible way.  It is disheartening <Col N="945" /> to many guards and to a great number of people that when certain situations develop, citizens fail to render assistance to the guards and on occasions have taken the side of the delinquents.  Unfortunately even after 40 years, there is something of a hangover and it is time that we got rid of that.  The only way in which we can get rid of it is by emphasising the duties of citizenship and everybody's responsibility in this regard.  Every Deputy and every Senator should avail of any opportunity they get to stress the duties of citizenship and in that way we might be able to eliminate that hangover.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that it is disturbing at times to read of the light sentences imposed for very serious offences and the heavy sentences imposed for minor offences.  I do not know whether the Minister can do anything about that, but the Minister and the Government have a responsibility to set their faces against that sort of inequality.  In regard to the question of the transferring of guards and such matters, these of course are within the competence of the Commissioner and it is his responsibility.  The Minister has very little to do with that, if anything.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, Deputy de Valera tabled a question to the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Defence asking them if it was their intention to promote to a grade higher every member of the Garda or every Army officer who held a military certificate or a medal.  This was in view of the fiftieth anniversary that was about to take place in a short time.  This is a matter about which the Minister should do something.  I believe that Deputy de Valera had that in mind when he asked the question.  I do not want to make any point about it.  I merely want to add my voice to his and ask that the Minister and the Government reconsider that matter.  It would be a nice gesture and it would do much to bring about some of the things about which the Minister for External Affairs spoke earlier today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I want to express my gratitude to the <Col N="946" /> House and to Deputies who spoke, for the constructive way in which they have received my annual report and the contributions which they have made in regard to it.  I shall deal first with the points raised by Deputy O'Higgins.  He suggested tentatively that there might be, on my part, some complacency about the situation in which we find ourselves with regard to crime and its prevention, the activities of the Garda Síochána in relation to it, and so on.  I hope that I did not convey any such impression. If I did, I certainly did not intend to. Indeed, I could quote from my opening speech when I said, in summing up, that our situation called neither for alarm, on the one hand, nor complacency on the other, but simply for vigilance all the time.  I am aware of the fact that there has been an increase in the figures for indictable crime and this naturally causes me and my advisers and the authorities in the Garda Síochána concern, and we are continually reviewing the situation and our plans to see what further measures we can take and what improvements we can effect.</P>
      <P>Whilst there has been this increase in the past two years, there are several redeeming features about the situation. First of all, as I have said here time and again, and as we had an opportunity again of confirming on the occasion of the recent Conference of Ministers of Justice, our situation is regarded as a great deal happier than that of any other country of corresponding size and stage of development. Secondly, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, there is in this country an astonishingly high percentage of detections of crime and, of course, as has frequently been pointed out, that possibly is one of the best possible deterrents.  I mentioned that the figures outside Dublin are at the extraordinarily high level of 80 to 84 per cent.  The Dublin figure brings that down but taking the country as a whole, including Dublin, the figure is over 60 per cent.  That is a very satisfying and reassuring aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other aspects, and in this <Col N="947" /> connection I want to refer to the suggestion by Deputy O'Higgins that the size of the Force should be increased. I can tell the House that it is being increased.  This year the Minister for Finance and the Government have agreed to an increase of 100 in the number of Garda.  That will make a substantial contribution to our campaign against crime, particularly in Dublin city but also throughout the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy O'Higgins was as gracious as he was about the crime preventive unit.  This is a very fruitful line of endeavour.  It is an area in which we can do a great deal.  There is no doubt that all of us can contribute to making crime easier by our carelessness.  However, in so far as we can, by the elimination of carelessness and by the taking of simple precautions, make life more difficult for the potential criminal, then we are making a valuable contribution in this field.  I hope we shall be able to continue the work of this unit and expand its activities in a number of directions. It is very reassuring for me to hear the complimentary remarks which Deputy O'Higgins had to make in regard to it.</P>
    <P>There were arguments against transferring the Garda Depot to Templemore. There were also many arguments for doing so.  Having regard to all the arguments put forward and the various factors entering into this situation, the Government decided that on balance, in the national interest, the right thing to do was to initiate this major step of decentralisation by transferring the Garda Training Depot to Templemore.  We have nothing to be sorry about in relation to that decision and I am convinced that, not alone will the change redound to the benefit of Templemore and the surrounding countryside and contribute to the idea of decentralisation, but also that the Force, in the years that lie ahead, will have better standards of efficiency and higher standards of morale than it has had in the past.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins raised the question of the new Garda station in Rathdrum. This was a difficult problem <Col N="948" /> for me.  Naturally, I did not decide it on the basis of my own feelings or inclinations, or indeed on my own judgment.  I had to be guided by the people concerned who were, first, the Garda authorities and, secondly, the Office of Public Works.  However, I am assured that the site which has been selected is the most suitable from the police point of view, and the Office of Public Works are also in favour of it.  I am sorry that a number of the people of Rathdrum should be disappointed at the decision ultimately made but I am afraid nothing can be done about it.  The alternative site which was offered, I understand, would not have been too readily available.  There would be difficulties of title in acquiring it, and so on.  Apart from all that and apart from the fact that our plans in regard to the other site were very considerably advanced, there is still the final point that the police authorities say the site chosen now is the best one, and I do not think I can be expected to go beyond such a decision.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by Deputy O'Higgins was in regard to the question of Garda witnesses being available for consultations in connection with civil actions.  It might be as well to remind the House that the present practice in this regard is that parties involved in civil proceedings in road accident cases may obtain, on payment of certain nominal fees, two things: copies of any statements which have been made to the Garda by witnesses and an abstract of the Garda reports, namely, the names and addresses of the parties concerned, the measurements in any sketch maps made, and so on.  In other words, they can get the bones of the official Garda report. I do not think we could do more than that.</P>
    <P>This matter has been raised a number of times.  Many of my predecessors have been asked and approached about it.  The really serious objection to Deputy O'Higgins's proposal that the garda themselves should be available for consultations is a simple practical difficulty.  Consultations of this sort would almost invariably be held in Dublin and would mean that the individual members <Col N="949" /> of the Force concerned would have to attend these consultations at great loss to the State and very considerable interference with the normal execution of their duties.  By and large, it would lead to a very serious disruption in the normal running of the Force.</P>
    <P>Even if this proposal did not give rise to these disadvantages, could we say it is a very necessary or desirable thing to do? The individual member of the Garda Síochána in this type of case would not be in a position to give direct evidence of what had happened.  He can only do what he has already done, namely, supply the statements which he has taken from actual witnesses.  In 99 cases out of 100, he is not an actual witness and could not add anything to what he has been able to extract in the form of statements from the witnesses. Furthermore, he would not be entitled to or would not be able to interpret witnesses' statements.  Therefore, there is nothing to be gained by the suggestion put forward by the Deputy, and there are the very serious practical disadvantages involved from the point of view of the running of the Force.</P>
    <P>Finally, Deputy O'Higgins mentioned the Land Registry.  I must agree the situation there is not as satisfactory as we would like it to be. By the institution of a system of overtime, we did succeed from time to time in eliminating practically all the delays occurring, but I am afraid the situation has deteriorated again to some extent.  All this is, of course, entirely due to our difficulties in procuring staff.  However, we have the situation under review; we are very much aware of the necessity for an efficient, expeditious Land Registry and we are making an effort to deal with the staff difficulties and hope to be able to clear them up.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, we have as I have already mentioned in the House an extension of accommodation already nearing completion and a further major extension at the planning stage. I hope that when this additional accommodation becomes available, we will be able to effect considerable improvements in the Land Registry. <Col N="950" /> As of now, however, I must confess the situation is not as satisfactory as we would like it to be and that something will have to be done to improve matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised a number of points.  In particular, I was impressed by his argument that too much these days is made of, and too much publicity given to, these young hooligans and blackguards who misbehave themselves in public.  I have from time to time been very disappointed with the manner in which our newspapers treat these affairs.  They tend to glamorise them and I suggest they will have to become much more responsible in regard to these undesirable modern trends and tendencies.</P>
    <P>One paper in particular, one of our Irish newspapers, disappointed me enormously in this respect.  There was a particularly notorious outbreak in some English seaside resort and this was reported in an Irish newspaper in such a way as to seem to be inviting young people here to behave in the same way by giving a disproportionate amount of publicity to it, glamorising these events across the water.  This report seemed to me to be doing exactly the wrong thing&mdash;tending, if anything, to encourage similar performances here.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to our newspapers, to their editors and those responsible, to deal with these things in a very sober, matter of fact, realistic, publicspirited way.  I agree fully with Deputy Tully that we should abandon all of these pseudo-glamorous descriptions and call a spade a spade, pointing out that the people who do this sort of thing are just blackguards, hooligans, a menace to society, and that they should not be allowed to get away with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully was also critical of our courts in this respect and seemed to think they could adopt a stiffer attitude. I think there is something in that.  Deputies will have noticed that in my opening remarks I suggested the drive to combat crime involves us all &mdash;all sections of the community&mdash;and in particular, I said I hoped the courts would play their part.  The fact that we now have this penal reform programme in operation and that its main <Col N="951" /> emphasis is on the rehabilitation of prisoners, should mean that judges and justices, in dealing with certain types of cases coming before them, need not be too apprehensive about awarding jail sentences.  Many people feel, indeed, that there is injudicious use of the Probation Act.  In particular, I feel very strongly about one thing: anybody who assaults a member of the Garda Síochána in the course of his duty should, unless there are very exceptional circumstances involved, receive a jail sentence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also mentioned the question of the Navan district office. The only thing I can say in that respect is that we must at all times keep an eye on the organisation and distribution of the Force with a view to the best possible arrangement for the policing of the country and give the taxpayers the best possible value for the money they spend on the Force. It is nonsense to think that any particular organisational structure should prevail for all time.  In the very nature of things, we have to reorganise and redistribute our Force from time to time.  There is nothing particularly obnoxious from the point of view of any town that the district headquarters should be transferred out of it.  It is simply an organisational matter and casts no reflection on the town: it is simply the transfer of the Garda headquarters involving, perhaps, a Garda superintendent and his clerk.  If you look at it realistically, such a change could not be regarded as in any way detrimental to the town involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin mentioned something of importance, and I am glad he did.  He appealed to the people to co-operate with the Garda, to come to their aid if they are in difficulties and generally to afford them any assistance they can.  The Garda are our own police force and they are entitled to expect from individual citizens at all levels the greatest possible degree of co-operation and assistance.</P>
    <P>He mentioned another point about which Deputy de Valera has been asking parliamentary questions and has been writing to me, that is the question of making some gesture of recognition <Col N="952" /> to the members of the Force who are still serving and who are either 1916 men or who fought in the War of Independence later on.  I do not see in what way anything of that nature could be done.  Any honour or tribute that is to be paid to these men should be paid by the nation as such and I am not sure it could be regarded as appropriate that the Garda force in itself should be involved in something of this nature or whether it would wish to do something along the lines suggested by Deputy de Valera or Deputy MacEoin this evening.  I do not readily, at first sight anyway, see what we could do.</P>

      <P>Both Deputies are very persuasive in regard to this and it is something towards which all of us, I am sure, would be instinctively sympathetic but I cannot hold out any hope.  I should not like to be interpreted as holding out any possibility whatever that anything could be done but, in deference to the two Deputies, I shall go so far as to say I shall think about the situation to see if there is any way in which their point of view could be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall conclude by repeating, if I may, that I think the primary responsibility of the Minister for Justice is the preservation of law and order.  In that respect, the situation is not as good as it was 12 months ago.  The trend is in the wrong direction and crime, to some extent, is increasing. I am not alarmist about it; I am not complacent; but we are doing everything we can.  We are continually reviewing our arrangements and plans and we shall continue to do so, and I assure the House we shall give the matter of crime and crime prevention the greatest possible degree of attention. We shall not allow any consideration of finance to interfere with what we regard as our duty.  I know the Government would fully support me in this.  If we find there is some way in which the situation can be improved and even if it involves the expenditure of some amount of money we shall be perfectly prepared to go ahead with whatever course of action <Col N="953" /> seems to us prudent and right in that respect.</P>
    <P>As an instance of that, I mentioned that the Government have agreed to the provision this year of an increase in strength of 100 gardaí.  We are all the time seeking ways of providing more and better equipment and strengthening the gardaí in every way we can to enable them to carry out their task because it is, of course, on the gardaí that we must primarily rely in this connection.  I think we have in them a good instrument and we should do everything we can to make sure they are fitted to carry out their task.  Then, we need the co-operation of all sorts of people, the general public, the proprietors of property and business premises, the courts, social and charitable workers and so on.  If we can get this on the same level as we have been getting it recently, or even to a greater extent in future, we should be able to keep the situation in regard to crime within bounds. There is, of course, no ultimate solution to this problem of crime in society but what we must try to do, and hope to succeed in doing, is to keep it within bounds by keeping our community in as reasonably satisfactory a position as it has been up to now.</P>
