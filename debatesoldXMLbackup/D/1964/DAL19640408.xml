      <P>asked the Taoiseach the reasons for the discrepancies, in relation to the figures given for ownership of dwellings for the years 1953 to 1959, between the replies to Questions No. 8 of 13th December 1960 and No. 2 of 3rd March 1964.</P>

      <P>As was explained in the final paragraph of page 33 of <i>National Income and Expenditure</i>, 1962, total personal expenditure is estimated as a residual and, consequently, small changes in the level of its constituents are to be expected when revisions of other items in the national accounts take place.  The changes referred to in the Deputy's question were due to such revisions.</P>
      <P>Data on rents from the Census of Population, 1961, have recently become available and the use of them may result in some further changes in the series of estimates of rent of dwellings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether his attention has been drawn to statements made by Professor W.J.E. Jessop on 11th March last with regard to the high incidence of anaemia among the patients attending Dublin maternity hospitals; and whether any steps are at present being taken under the Health Acts with a view to the prevention of such wide incidence of anaemia by the provision of improved diets for expectant mothers or by any other measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a report of the statement referred to.</P>
      <P>It is normal for a doctor providing maternity care to test his patient for anaemia.  The Maternity and Infant Care Scheme provided under the Health Acts includes provision for this test which immediately alerts a doctor as to whether his patient is anaemic so that appropriate measures may be taken&mdash;including, if necessary, advice as to diet.  For this reason among others every opportunity is taken to urge all women who are eligible for maternity services under the Health Acts to consult their doctors as early as possible in the pregnancy so that any abnormal conditions, including anaemia, may be detected in good time.</P>
      <P>In so far as anaemia may be attributed to lack of appropriate nourishment for expectant mothers, I should like to point out that lack of nourishment, where it exists, does not necessarily result from poverty. Nutritional deficiency can result as readily from eating the wrong type of food as from an inadequate supply of food.  A maternity patient would be well advised, therefore, to act upon the counsel of her doctor in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> Where a doctor prescribes drugs or medicines for such a condition they are supplied free of charge to patients who are unable to meet the cost.  Every expectant mother in the lower income group is entitled, under the Health Acts to a daily supply of milk and this facility is widely availed of.  In addition, in the Dublin area charitable organisations provide a substantial mid-day meal to expectant mothers who seek it. One such organisation, which receives a measure of financial assistance, also under the Health Acts, from the Dublin Health Authority&mdash;which in turn receives 50 per cent recoupment from the Exchequer&mdash;operates 16 centres spread throughout the city at which an average of five hundred dinners were provided daily for expectant mothers in a recent year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether the Medical Research Council have as yet completed their study of thalidomide babies born in this country; if so, how many such children were born in this country; how many have survived; and what special provisions are being made for the help and care of such severely deformed children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1962 the Medical Research Council of Ireland undertook, at my request, a survey designed to provide information&mdash;so far as is practicable&mdash;as to the number of babies born with deformities which might be ascribed to the consumption of thalidomide by expectant mothers.  I have received the Council's report, but it is not possible to say with certainty how many of the deformities were associated with use of the drug, thalidomide. In an effort to obtain a clearer picture of the influence exercised by this drug, the Medical Research Council are undertaking another survey of deformities occurring in a recent period when the use of thalidomide had been discontinued and could not, therefore, be a factor in the incidence of congenital abnormalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, at my request, the National Organisation for Rehabilitation have made arrangements to ensure <Col N="1172" /> that all the facilities, including specialised artificial limbs and other devices, are available so as to enable affected children to develop and lead a reasonable life despite their deformation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister anticipate that this new investigation which he has initiated will be completed soon?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether his attention has been drawn to the statements made by Professor W.J.E. Jessop on 11th March last with regard to the high incidence of severe congenital deformities of the nervous system in babies born in Dublin; if he will give statistics of the incidence of such deformities in Dublin and in the country as a whole over the past ten years, together with comparable statistics for Northern Ireland, Britain, and other Western European countries; and what progress is being made in research into the causes and possible methods of prevention of such deformities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a report of the statement referred to.  Statistics relating to the incidence of congential abnormalities of the nervous system are not available in respect of Ireland and, so far as I am aware, are not available in published form in respect of the other countries mentioned.  I can only conclude that such information as was the basis of the statement of Professor Jessop in relation to this condition in babies born in Dublin is information which is becoming available in the course of the survey on the incidence of congenital malformations in infants born in Dublin, which with the aid of a grant which I have authorised from the Hospitals Trust Fund, is being conducted by the Medical Research Council.  This grant was authorised in October, 1960; the investigation is still proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> I hope that this survey will result in indentification of the factors that interfere with normal intra-uterine development, and will therefore point the way to the remedial or preventive measures which can be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health how many general medical service cases were called in for dental treatment since 1st January in (a) the Naas area, County Kildare, and (b) County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>During the period 1st January to 31st March, 1964, six adults in the Naas area, that is, in the Naas and Carragh dispensary district which comprises the town of Naas and some of the surrounding rural area, and 89 adults in the whole of County Kildare were provided with dental treatment by Kildare County Council under section 14 of the Health Act, 1953.  In addition, children who might be eligible for dental treatment under section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, were provided with such treatment under the child welfare and school health services.</P>
      <P>The dental services in County Kildare, particularly in the Naas area, were curtailed during this period as one of the two whole-time dental surgeons employed by Kildare County Council, who provided dental treatment in north County Kildare, was not available for most of the period.  This dentist has since resigned.  His post will be filled next week&mdash;on a temporary basis pending the recruitment of a permanent officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of applications for free drugs and medicines by persons of the middle income group which were (a) approved and (b) refused in South Kerry constituency each year since the Health Acts came into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy's question relates to medicines and drugs supplied, free of charge, under section 14 of the Health Act, <Col N="1174" /> 1953, to persons not covered by General Medical Services cards.  The earliest period for which the health authority has such information is the year ended 31st December, 1961.  This followed the issue of a circular letter from my Department in September, 1961, which reminded health authorities that they are empowered to supply drugs and medicines, free of charge, under section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, to persons who, because of the financial hardship involved, are unable to meet the cost of these items, even though they do not hold medical cards, and asked the health authorities to keep records of items so supplied.</P>
      <P>During the years ended 31st December, 1961 and 1962, no applications for free drugs and medicines under the terms of the circular were received from persons in the South Kerry constituency. During the year ended 31st December, 1963, three such applications were received and granted.</P>

      <P>and <b>Sir Anthony Esmonde</b> asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will consider amending the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959 and the Straight Baselines Order, 1959 made thereunder by making the baselines therein referred to from outer headland to outer headland and thus add many valuable acres of fisheries to Irish territorial waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, the straight baselines along our western and southern coasts which were prescribed by the Government under the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959, (Straight Baselines) Order, 1959, resulted in adding many valuable square miles to our exclusive fishing jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The result of the new Fisheries Convention when implemented by the signatory States will be that the exclusive fishing jurisdiction against the traditional fishing States will be measured at six miles from the existing baselines and against all other States at 12 miles.  This means that, so far as the Convention is concerned, our existing baselines which we drew in 1959 are now accepted.  It is a source of satisfaction to us that as a part of the general compromise France, which had reserved its position in relation to our existing baselines, has now withdrawn her reservations.  This accords with the friendly relations which happily exist between our two countries.</P>
      <P>Any attempt to prescribe fresh baselines at this moment would, I am afraid, reopen situations which appear now to be satisfactorily resolved.</P>

The letting will make an extra contribution to the revenue of the airport and should provide an attractive amenity in the area.  I am aware that, as mentioned in recent announcements, the promoters of this venture contemplate the provision of other leisure facilities.  If firm proposals materialise for the extension of such facilities on airport lands the promoters will have to submit them for my consideration. The lease for the golf centre will include appropriate safeguards including a condition that it will terminate if the lands are required for airport purposes before the expiration of the full term, which is, in any event, to be a fairly short one.</P>

As a temporary arrangement to meet exceptional requirements, approval was given last September to the Dublin Corporation's proposal to recruit a number of temporary Dangerous Building Inspectors at a rate in excess of that amount.  Permanent officers have an incremental salary scale proceeding to a maximum which is well in excess of the special rate sanctioned for temporary inspectors. They also have advantages in relation to permanency, superannuation and sick leave which temporary staff do not have.  In January last, the Corporation submitted a proposal to increase the minimum of the salary scale for Dangerous Building Inspectors and certain other inspectors.  The proposal, which was based on a comparison of the existing scale with that paid to another grade on the staff, was not considered to be justified and accordingly sanction was refused.</P>

For the current period licences are subject to the condition that the vessels shall not fish within the exclusive fishery limits of the State. As these limits have not yet been extended beyond three nautical miles from the baseline, licensed vessels are at present free to fish between three and six miles.

      <P>I am aware that reception of television programmes is unsatisfactory in a number of areas including the Castletownbere district. As I announced when moving the second reading of the Broadcasting Authority Amendment Bill, 1963, the Authority plans to carry out a survey of all areas where reception is deficient and has in fact arranged to provide satellite transmitters in seven locations where surveys indicated that they are essential.  Further areas will be dealt with under the second stage of the Authority's satellite programme and a transmitter will be provided to serve the Castletownbere area if the Authority is satisfied that it is warranted.</P>
      <P>On the question of improving sound reception in the area, I would like to say that financial provision has been made in the recent Act for the establishment of a national VHF service which should greatly improve reception of the Radio Éireann sound programmes in all areas where reception is at present unsatisfactory.</P>

The number of part-time teachers employed in the same school-year was 1,896, comprising 1,255 males and 641 females.  Because of the changing and developing nature of the vocational education service, it is not possible to estimate precisely what the requirements in the matter of teaching personnel may be at any particular time.

      <P>The statements in question are totally false and I regret that they should have been published without any evidence to sustain them.</P>
      <P>The facts are as follows: Numerous complaints have been made to the Garda Síochána by respectable women living or working in certain areas that when going about their lawful business in the evenings they are frequently and persistently accosted by men, from cars and otherwise.  The Garda Síochána have been aware that much distress and, very often, alarm have been caused, especially to young women, in such circumstances.  For various reasons, however, many of those affected would be unable to give evidence that would sustain a conviction and, in order to detect offenders, members of the Ban Ghardaí were assigned to duty, over a period of some weeks, in those areas.</P>
      <P>The members concerned were fully aware that the object was to detect persons accosting respectable women and they had explicit instructions that it was essential that they should not give anybody passing-by any reason to think that they were women of easy virtue but that they should represent the average respectable girl walking along the street.  I am assured that those instructions were scrupulously observed and I have seen no evidence to support any suggestion to the contrary.</P>

Is it not a fact that these people, while acting as nothing other than prostitutes, could easily have been seen by people who knew <Col N="1204" /> them who could go back to their native villages and say that they were just prostitutes in the streets of Dublin?

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night this section was being explained by the Minister for Lands and I repeated what I understood to be his explanation.  As he did not contradict it, I assumed my interpretation was correct.  The main reason the section has been put into the Bill is to discourage people outside the congested districts from looking for land.  The Minister did say, and I feel sure he recalls it, that it would mean there would be more land available for people in the congested districts if other people did not take it up.  He repeated the story we hear so often, that he has had deputations from people outside the congested districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume he is talking about the midlands and the east coast where there are people who would be prepared <Col N="1248" /> to pay the full annuity if the Minister were prepared to buy land and give it to them.  I assume they would be people who in normal circumstances would not be entitled to such portions of land.  I wish to make it very clear that as far as the Labour Party are concerned, and as far as my constituents in Meath are concerned, we are perfectly satisfied the Minister is here attempting to do a very unjust act in suggesting that in the future division of land, those living beside an estate outside the congested districts will have to pay the full annuity while those brought from the congested districts will have to pay only half the annuity.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister consider a situation where two farmers are set up side by side on the 45-acre farms the Minister speaks about?  One of them comes from the congested districts and pays half the annuity, but the man who has been living there all his life, working hard at farming, attempting to make a living for himself and his family, will have to pay the full annuity.  Will the Minister explain where is the justice in that?</P>
    <P>I am well aware that in this House there are Deputies from all Parties and I should be very glad if they had the courage to stand up and express their views on the section.  I can assure the Minister that if he allows a free vote of the House on the section&mdash;it is certainly going to a vote&mdash;he will find he will not carry it even with the support of his Party.  The carrot he dangled last night&mdash;the authority to declare any area a congested district if it suits the Minister for Lands for the time being &mdash;will not wash, because we are all well aware that the Minister has, even when speaking on this Bill here, stated that he will deal with the existing congested districts as laid down in Schedule II of the Bill.  That being so, it is not good enough that the Minister should attempt to put through a section like this.</P>
    <P>He also said on at least three occasions last night that a subsidy of £1 million per year was being paid for the purpose of continuing this halving of the annuities and he spoke of the big saving that would be necessary in order <Col N="1249" /> to bring the thing out level.  If the Minister is convinced this is necessary, would he not apply it generally?  Why did he pick out one section of the community and leave another section in what must be considered a privileged position?  Is it not true that if there is a question of taxpayers' money being paid, the people who are lucky enough to be born in Meath or Westmeath or in one of the midland counties are as much entitled to a portion of that money as people coming from congested districts?  I think this is an attempted confidence trick and I do not think it will work.  I am satisfied that if the Minister leaves this to a free vote he will be beaten on the section. I am not sure even if he puts the Whip on, he will be able to carry it because we all know the effect it will have on people seeking divided land.</P>
    <P>The Constitution lays down that there shall be equal rights and opportunities for all.  I have been declaring for quite some time here that even as it stands, so far as land division is concerned, there are not equal rights. Because of the regulations of the Land Commission, preference is given to people from a certain part of the country when land is divided.  We are now going further.  Not alone are we going to give them preference, if the section is carried, but we are going to add a little extra and people who live in areas outside the congested areas where a farm is being divided must pay the full annuity.</P>
    <P>Before the discussion goes any further, I ask the Minister to have another look at this section because I am sure that the people who support the Government have already made the point that this section is most unfair and unjust.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to section 4 on this particular point that the Minister has power to declare an area a congested area.  I just refer to that generally.  Section 4 is a protection and if it was not there I should be up in arms because we have so many congested areas in County Dublin.  That is true.  We have Rush and other areas that are definitely congested with people living on one or two acres of land and eking out an existence on conacre.  Coming to section 7, the Minister provides that people will get land if they pay the full annuity.  There are a number of conacre farmers in County Dublin who welcome this provision because they are in the position that they are declared as landless men notwithstanding that they and their fathers and grandfathers have made a living on conacre land.  The people whom I and other County Dublin Deputies represent will be glad to avail of the provisions of section 7.  I think the Minister has covered the situation very well in section 4.</P>
      <P>This is a huge national problem and if the Minister were as good as Saint Peter he still has a problem in regard to the land because we have so many uneconomic holdings, so many conacre farmers who have no claim at all. We are in the awkward position that these people would be delighted with any opportunity of purchasing land instead of being in their present position of paying£20 or £25 an acre for conacre and then trying to make a living while having to buy machinery and manure, etc.  This is one of the problems of my constituency.  Deputy Tully made a very good case from his point of view but I believe no matter what Minister is here there is no more contentious Bill that could be brought into the House.  No Bill will please everybody.  There is an attempt here to be rational and meet the views of different areas.  We have so many congested areas that we would need another Ireland and another 12 million acres of arable land to give them all viable holdings.  That is the big problem the Minister must face in trying to introduce a measure that will go some of the way to ease the present difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1251" /> I do not know if it will happen in our day that the people will be able to live on their holdings.  Even with the best will in the world, even if we had a national Government and could steamroll measures through the House it would take a long time to do things like this.  The old rundale system and other things that have existed for generations aggravate the problem the Minister has to face and in my opinion he is making an honest effort to meet it.  He knows the position and, as a Deputy, he comes to the House from an area where the problem exists.  I come from an area where it is also a problem.  I hate to see a farm divided unless the smallholders in the area, and especially the conacre farmers, get a reasonable chance of acquiring some of this land or it is allotted to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Burke for his compliment.  I think he did not get the point of this section.  Section 4 does gives the Minister the authority, if he so desires, to declare an area a congested area but he has made it clear that he will deal with the congested areas that are already there.  If he begins by declaring County Dublin a congested area, I think there will be a row.  Deputy Burke has said that in some peculiar way section 7 gives some kind of right other than they have at present to people who are now considered as landless men to be considered for land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke said he welcomed the fact that conacre farmers in Dublin would be glad of this section because they were now considered as landless men.  The Deputy is as well aware as I am that landless men even in congested districts have no more right than if they are in non-congested districts.  So that argument does not work.  Secondly, section 7 provides that in future, certain classes of persons who will receive allotments of land on an annuity basis in non-congested areas will not benefit from <Col N="1252" /> the halving of annuities conceded under the Land Act, 1933.  That is clear enough.  The explanatory memorandum also says:</P>
      <P>The classes affected are: (i) farmers with existing holdings who may receive enlargements in non-congested areas and (ii) cottiers and other persons who may get allotments in non-congested areas, where surplus land is available.</P>
      <P>That is also clear enough.  What it says is that if either of these two classes are fortunate enough to get a portion of land, after the passing of this Bill, if this section is written in, they will have to pay the full annuity for it.

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I find it hard to understand Deputy Burke's logic, if there is any logic in his method of thinking.  His constituency is getting nothing whatsoever, no more than my constituency. This is a western Bill, in which the halving of the annuities is being retained for western congests, and congests in other parts of the country will pay the full annuity, if they are lucky enough to get land.  I take the simple view that no matter where the congest is, whether in Roscommon, Mayo, or Wicklow, he is a congest, and if one congest is asked to pay only half, the other congest should be asked to pay only half.  If one pays the full amount, the other should pay the full amount. Surely it must be fairly equal from the point of view of capacity to pay?  They are all, if you like, relatively poor farmers.  They are uneconomic holders. They are all Irishmen.  I see no reason why the Minister should try to draw another border across the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The position under this section is being completely misrepresented. For instance, it was said last night, by Deputy Tully, I think, that if some foreigner, or some large farmer, bought land in a non-congested area, he would benefit by the halving of the annuities, whereas a local congest who got a portion of that land would not.  Nothing is further from the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out already that under the 1933 Act the annuities on all land, practically speaking, were halved. That has cost the Irish taxpayers some £75 million to date.  The vast majority of land that will be coming into the Land Commission machinery will be land in respect of which the annuity has already been halved.  If the Land Commission buy that land in non-congested areas for division, the cost of that land, plus the annuity, is all the tenants among whom it is divided up will be asked to pay.  As in any <Col N="1254" /> other purchase, the purchaser pays the capital sum, the purchase price of the land, subject to the annuity.  The tenants in the non-congested areas who get a division of land will be paying exactly what they would be paying for it, had they been in the happy position of buying the land themselves, and solving their own congestion.</P>
    <P>To use an expression I used last night dealing with this section, in such cases the Land Commission would act as land bankers for the purpose of advancing money to purchase land that came on the market, where they consider it fit, in the non-congested counties.  I repeat what I said last night.  I had several deputations from the non-congested counties who informed me that they would be quite happy to pay the full economic price for any such lands that would be acquired for division amongst them. Indeed, one case that comes to my mind now is that just a few years ago we had a number of people on deputations dealing with the Oak Park estate in Carlow.  The people concerned told me they were paying £25 and £30 an acre for conacre, and that whatever the full costs of those lands would be, they would be quite happy if the Land Commission took over the lands and had them divided, and financed the operation so that the State would be at no loss.</P>
    <P>Let me come back to the rather peculiar argument which has been advanced, by Deputy Tully and others, that there is something utterly wrong in picking out some portions of the country for special consideration or special treatment.  It was not I who started this.  Away back in 1909 these congested areas were written into an Act, and these counties were written in for special treatment.  I think it was in an 1891 Act that the Congested Districts Board was established.  The Congested Districts Board was established for the sole purpose of dealing with these congested areas and counties, and all the thousands and millions of pounds that have been spent since were spent in those areas because of the special social and other problems we had in those areas because of our history.  In the same way, for different <Col N="1255" /> reasons, there are other areas, including the Gaeltacht areas, where special consideration is given because of their location and economic circumstances. So, long before this State was established, these congested areas got different treatment, and special treatment, because of their existing conditions, from the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>It seems to be suggested that there is something extraordinary about taking migrants up from one of the congested areas and giving them special treatment by way of halving the annuity. In many cases, as I have said on other sections, it is not at all easy to get migrants to leave their home environment and accept migration.  In very many cases, it is necessary to provide as many inducements as we can to get these people to move out of the congested areas and accept holdings in the non-congested areas.  Because they have to establish themselves on new ground, we must also try to ensure they are in a position to survive.  The people in the non-congested counties who would be getting land are already established.</P>
    <P>I pointed out last night in dealing with this section that there is absolutely no comparison whatsoever, generally speaking, as between people in the non-congested counties and people in the congested counties.  I pointed out that, in the main, in the non-congested counties the people have been established for years on far better land than exists in the congested areas. For years, they have been operating under far more favourable conditions. I suggest they have been nearer to more profitable markets.  The congested counties are on the western seaboard and most congested portions of them are in the main in the most isolated portions of these counties.</P>
    <P>I have also pointed out, in respect of the migrants who came up very many years ago, although they got small migrant holdings in those days, that at least it can be said, even though the holdings were small and are now regarded as uneconomic, they were far and away better than the lands they left behind.  In many cases, the congested <Col N="1256" /> patches of fragmented holdings they left behind them went towards alleviating the very poor economic conditions that existed in their native counties.  Most of these men, even though they have small land units, have done extremely well over the years.  As a result of the start they got in those years, many of them have now expanded and added to their original holdings.  Some of them have done extremely well.  Still, the position today is that in order to make a real impact in our time on the hard core of congestion that is left in these congested counties, it is necessary to concentrate the whole financial power that may be available under this heading by the State.</P>
    <P>It has been said that here and there in non-congested counties you will find an odd pocket of congestion.  I accept that; but even what they would call congestion in these counties is no comparison in fact with the intense type of congestion and rundale of which I speak that still exists in the congested counties.  Where, in non-congested counties, there do exist pockets of congestion such as those to which I refer, I repeat that section 4 is the answer.  The Land Commission can get geared to it.  They will be entitled to make an Order scheduling any pocket of land, parish, village or townland of a non-congested county a congested area.  That being so, that particular portion of that non-congested county will be entitled to all the benefits, including the halving of the annuities, being retained here for the congested areas.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time a differential was made.  After, for instance, the halving of the annuities under the 1933 Act came into being, it was amended by this Dáil under the 1936 Land Act.  Take a migrant's holding in excess of £3,000 in value.  On anything more than that, he had to pay the full annuity and to reimburse the Exchequer fully.  So, the principle of sticking to the one halving of the annuity has been adhered to in legislation down through the years.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House, as far as the non-congested areas are concerned, that if the Land Commission, outside <Col N="1257" /> any intense pockets there may be in them, get more activity by way of purchase of land, then all my experience as Minister is that the people in those areas will be quite happy to pay the full cost of that land rather than to pay the very high conacre rents that obtain in those areas <i>ad infinitum.</i> The real answer to any pockets of congestion in these counties is the power being taken here under section 4.</P>
    <P>I have told the House that as soon as may be, when the Land Commission have become geared to the administrative problems arising out of the passage of this Bill, it is my intention, immediately they are in a position to advise me, to exercise the powers conferred under section 4 and where local inspectors in the non-congested counties are in a position to advise from time to time to bring in any pockets of congestion in these non-congested counties in which the circumstances would justify the exercise of these powers.</P>
    <P>I do not see what objection there can be to this section.  As far as I am aware, there certainly has been no objection outside and no objection has been conveyed to me except what I suggest to be the artificial arguments put up here in the House to try to create some kind of feeling against migrants.</P>
    <P>We have it on the record of the House that migrants are not welcome in certain areas.  I thought that was gone, but evidently we still have it with us.  These objections do not count much now in this day and age.  We have moved a long way since the first migrants were brought up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the subject of the Minister's powers under section 4 to alleviate any hardship that might arise in the administration of section 7, the Minister said that the Land Commission will make an Order under section 4 scheduling an area as congested. In this section 4, the Minister makes an Order.  I shall not deal with the antagonism which is sometimes apparent to migrants from the west when they go to other areas.  That is not new in Meath, Kildare, Westmeath and so on.  We have it down at home. If there is a big enough farm in County Mayo, the people around do not like to see migrants from a few miles away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the little headaches in the course of Land Commission work that have to be met and understood.  It is a very natural feeling. I came up against it myself when I was in the Land Commission.  I fully understand these people.  Naturally, when a piece of land was being divided in an area, most of them knew it was their last chance of getting a bit and in my opinion, they were justified in putting up as good a fight as they could, in law, to get the land&mdash;but I do not agree with violence.</P>
      <P>We shall leave all that aside for the moment and deal with section 7 as it stands.  There are two things I do not understand.  I think one of them was dealt with by Deputy P. Hogan <i>(South Tipperary).</i> I do not see why a man who has a small enough holding in any county and who is entitled to additional land should be treated differently from a man in similar circumstances elsewhere.  Remember, the worst feature of this section has not been touched on at all.  There may be land to be divided in a congested area in Deputy Tully's constituency in County Meath or in Deputy Burke's area, in Rush, County Dublin.  Under this section the Minister has undermined a very important section of the 1933 Act and section 12 of the 1950 Act, whereby the Land Commission, and the Land Commission alone, judicially fix the annuity that is to be paid on the land.  The Minister is undermining that in section 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> Under the provisions of this section, if a group come in to him and he finds they have to pay full annuity, the Minister can very easily say, if he wants to make a political issue of it: &ldquo;If you join the local Fianna Fáil club I shall make an Order declaring your area a congested district and you can then get the land at half price&rdquo;. That is the whole point of this section, no matter how you dress it up.  That is the real truth of the matter.  The Minister has told us here, under section 4, that he can declare an area to be a congested area.  All right; there is a farm of land to be divided in Deputy Tully's area which is not a congested area.  If the Minister wants to, he can extract votes from the people of that area.  All he has to do is to say: &ldquo;Produce your Fianna Fáil membership card and I shall declare your area a congested district&rdquo;.  They will then get the land at half price.  That is about all that can be said on this section.</P>
    <P>There is only one type of case, a very rare one, which would justify this power, and which could be very easily set out if it were the Minister's intention to do so.  We all know that on practically every big farm of land which the Land Commission take up, there is an undesirable heath, maybe two or three acres or ten to 20 acres of marshy, rocky ground which nobody wants to take.  The Land Commission very often have to go on their knees and beg somebody to take it at any price.  I could understand that in cases where the Land Commission have to put up such a piece of land for public auction and there were no bidders.  I do not care what the Minister or anybody else says; I think any person who is entitled to an allotment of land, where the State goes to all the trouble and expense of purchasing land, whether he is a congest or uneconomic holder, whether he is living west or east of the Shannon, should be given that land when it becomes available.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted a case where a farm of land is taken up in the midlands to be split up among migrants from the west.  The unfortunate <Col N="1260" /> man, who has been living on the outskirts of that land, who has been herding or earning his living some other way, might have had it in his head that the Land Commission would get that land some day and he would become a small farmer himself. He now finds there is a great difference between himself and the migrants from the west who can get the land at half price.  That will cause bitterness and bad feeling among the unfortunate people already living there.  The big danger of section 7 is that it could be a weapon in the hands of any unscrupulous Minister.</P>

      <P>I should like to comment on a statement made by the Minister.  He mentioned the difficulty of getting people to move from a congested district.  He said in order to get them to do so, certain inducements had to be held out to them.  I thought the position was the other way round, that farmers in congested districts who apply to the Land Commission for exchange holdings had great difficulty in getting their applications dealt with. Some of them, I know, feel that their applications will never be dealt with. A number who are anxious to secure help from the Land Commission in getting exchange holdings do not think it worth their while to apply at the present time, in view of the difficulties their neighbours have experienced in getting the Land Commission to attend to their claims.  Am I to assume from the Minister's statement that this is all changed?  If it is, full publicity should be given to it because many people who have been frustrated in their dealings with the Land Commission in making applications for exchange holdings, could then renew their applications at once and have them dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is constitutional for the Land Commission to say to the island holders in West Cork that they <Col N="1261" /> are not to be considered at all.  Up to eight or nine years ago, their applications were dealt with and a number of them were moved from the islands. Now their applications are not even considered so far as the scope of the present Land Bill is concerned.  It does not extend to the island dwellers.  I was indeed pleased to hear the Minister say here today that these difficulties seem to be wiped out, and that now, instead of the applicants getting frustrated, they will get special inducements to move out.</P>
    <P>In saying that, I must also mention that a number of congested farmers who moved from West Cork to other parts of Cork county and to other parts of the country came out very well from the Land Commission.  They got very satisfactory exchange holdings and I am sure they appreciate very much the manner in which the Land Commission dealt with them.  I think it is only fair to mention that, because I have had reason on a number of occasions to condemn the activities of the Land Commission.  But, in so far as dealing with the very limited number of applications from West Cork is concerned, they have come out very well indeed and I am sure they appreciate that.  There is no doubt that the Land Commission could help considerably in relieving congestion if they moved a little faster.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, before he closes on this section, to clarify his statement about the inducements to applicants because I am very anxious that some deserving applicants who, due to the uneconomic nature of their holdings in West Cork, cannot live there, are very anxious to get out to other parts of the county or other parts of the country.  We do not like to lose them in West Cork but unfortunately some holdings are too uneconomic and people cannot continue to live on them.  I believe when these people make application, whether they are from the islands or from the midlands, they should be dealt with uniformly.</P>

      <P>There are many Deputies under the impression apparently that the people in the congested areas of the west are only too delighted to get an opportunity of rushing up to Meath.  They are not.  It is very difficult to get the people in the west to come up to Meath and some considerable inducement must be offered to them if they have to come. In the parish in which I live and in the two adjoining parishes, there have been no applications for migration to the midlands at all.  I do not accept Deputy Tully's attitude on this, though I admit he is right to fight for his constituents.  I think the Minister's approach is the fairest one; a very substantial inducement must be offered to these people to migrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather remarkable that the people in Meath, Westmeath, Kildare and other counties in which there is good land are offering colossal prices for conacre.  They do not crib at £15 an acre.  This is land which may be taken from them in a year, or two <Col N="1263" /> years.  Yet, it is seriously suggested that these people, when they are given land on a permanent basis by the Land Commission at a reasonable price, consider that price too high, even though it may not be one-tenth what they are paying now for land.  I cannot swallow that argument and I do not think the Minister should be expected to swallow it.  The Minister is doing the right thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The only relevancy on the migration issue was the argument advanced by Deputy Tully that it was utterly unfair to have a migrant in the midlands on a halved annuity while a local beside him, who got an addition, must pay the full annuity.  To take last things first, let me deal with what Deputy Murphy said.  In every congested area and in every constituency, there are numbers of people who may not be suitable but who would be prepared to migrate.  The Land Commission must have their order of priorities: No. 1, which are the most congested holdings; No. 2, what people must come out.  When dealing with run-dale&mdash;Deputies who do not understand the problem should appreciate that there are certain difficulties&mdash;there may be some people in the area who must come out before any proper rearrangement can be put through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the areas which comprise the hard core of congestion, a congestion to which no solution has been found so far, it is now more essential than ever that inducements should be given so that the small farmers on the intermixed holdings in a key position may be induced to come out.  Experience has shown that year after year people are chosen to come out.  The son of the house is asked to attend an agricultural school, and so on.  When it comes to the time of parting, in many cases the very people most anxious to get out refuse, and for a variety of reasons.  I shall not go into them here.  These people are used to the social life in the west of Ireland.  They regard Meath as a backward part of the country.  They do not want to go there.  Far be it from me to blame them.  Now, when people refuse to <Col N="1264" /> get out, they are put at the end of the queue.  That is a form of penalisation about which I have had second thoughts because one is not really penalising the man who has refused to accept a holding provided for him elsewhere; one is penalising the four or five neighbours who might be relieved if he got out.  That is the reason why these inducements are now being provided for migrants.</P>
    <P>The number of migrants in any area is limited by two factors, the amount of land available and the number of buildings ready.  In every estate taken over in non-congested areas, those employed on the estate have to be considered first.  Then local congestion must be relieved.  It is after that the migrants' holdings are provided.  In many cases people prepared to migrate are not considered suitable by the Land Commission.  In every single case what really determines the migration is local conditions.</P>

Then, when another henchman came in, the whole plan in the ashes had to be rubbed out with the foot and a new plan drawn to show that man what he would get.  That is one of the reasons Deputy Blowick has the mentality he has.  He cannot see normal government in this country and that an end has been put to the queer things we all knew were happening when there was Coalition Government here.</P>
      <P>Comment has been made about the high conacre rents that are being paid in the non-congested counties.  To my knowledge, these rents do exist.  However, if the Land Commission are prepared to stand between the local man in these areas who has not the money to buy and the man with the long purse by purchasing lands that come on the market I have no doubt, from the representations I have received, that rather than pay the conacre rack-rents they are being asked to pay, they would be very glad to pay the full cost of the lands concerned when they come to be added to their holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not now dealing with the old concept of a congested holding. We are now aiming at the new concept of a holding of from 40 to 45 acres of good land.  Where there are people in <Col N="1266" /> non-congested areas who do not measure up to that standard, these people will be entitled to consideration by the Land Commission when land becomes available in the area.  In a number of cases in the non-congested areas where they had what we would regard, when compared with the holdings in the congested areas, as fairly comfortable units of from 30 to 35 acres of good lands, they will now come in for consideration under the new concept.  Many of these people are obviously well able to pay the full cost of the land concerned.</P>
    <P>The case has been made before this by Deputy Flanagan of many landless men who are paying up to £200 a year for land and yet making a living after paying these heavy rents.  The case has been put to me by people in these areas that these people want more Land Commission activity in the non-congested areas in order that the Land Commission would finance the purchase of these lands and give the people the usual 50 years, or whatever it is, to repay the purchase money by way of annuity.  Even after all that, the cost of the operation under this section will be considerable.  It is all right to say that the people will be repaying under the section the full cost of the land.  They will be paying the purchase price the Land Commission will have to pay for the land in the open market.</P>
    <P>I may say that since 1932 the Exchequer has expended £75 million in coming to the aid of the Irish tenant farmer.  In addition to the cost of the land, there will be the time and expense of the officials who will have to plan these farms, who will have to divide them and who will have to have them attached to the folios of those already on the lands.  What the cost will be under the new provision in the Bill, I cannot say, except to state that out of the present allocation of £3 million, approximately £1 million is a subsidy from the taxpayer to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>It is for all these reasons I have mentioned that I say there is a case to concentrate seriously on an effort to solve the problem of the congested <Col N="1267" /> areas, to take powers to deal with pockets of congestion in the non-congested areas.  It would be utterly wrong to apply to the non-congested areas such as Meath and Kildare, the same conditions as in the congested areas. It would be wrong to give every individual in such areas the same facilities as those in the congested areas.  Is it not a fair way and a far better way to deal with any particular pocket of congestion in non-congested areas, that we should schedule such pockets under section 4 of the Bill and so entitle the people in that scheduled pocket to all the benefits to which congests are entitled? I think this is a realistic way to approach the matter nationally, the proper way to approach it from the Exchequer point of view and the fairest way for this House to approach it.</P>

      <P>In what way will the proposal to go back to the pre-1933 conditions help the migrant?  You will have a migrant brought to the midlands from any congested county and he gets a new holding there with the annuity halved.  The man outside the wall pays the full annuity.  In what way does the dearer annuity or the man outside the wall help the migrant from the west?  Or am I misunderstanding the whole section?  Again, may I point out very briefly as regards subsection (2) of section 4 which he has spent ten minutes telling us about, there is absolutely nothing in this subsection. This is what it says:</P>
      <P>When making an order under subsection (1) of this section the Minister shall have regard to the size of the holdings, the quality of the land and the type or types of farming carried on in the area to be declared a congested area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That might mean the Minister would have regard to a 500-acre farm, if there were any in such an area.  It does not say to what particular types of holdings the Minister must have regard.  It is just a whole lot of verbiage, with nothing to it.  Therefore if subsection (2) of section 4 were wiped out, it would not alter the Bill <Col N="1268" /> one iota.  There is no use in the Minister trying to tell us there is some wonderful safeguard there to prevent a Minister doing wrong things under section 4.  The Minister has gone around in circles with regard to migrants from the west.  There is not one word in section 7 about migrants from the west.  Migration can be dealt with under the appropriate sections of this Bill when they come up and the Minister will hear plenty about it, certainly from me.  I am sticking to the one point here.  I hold a man is entitled to an addition of land if he is a smallholder, whether he is in a congested area or not.</P>
    <P>The very fact that people are leaving the land wholesale is proof that agriculture does not provide a livelihood for them there.  It is ridiculous to say that, because a certain class of migrants in the non-congested counties are prepared to pay a large sum for conacre, they are rolling in money. The poor devils must pay it or get out. Most of them must pay £20 an acre because they are too old to face England, the United States or Australia.  If these people had to pay these exorbitant prices for conacre when they were 18 or 20 years of age, they would not have remained in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The position about the Bill is that the Minister has brought in a large number of amendments and apparently is prepared to speak for a quarter of an hour at every opportunity. If anybody makes a comment, he is prepared to reply for a quarter of an hour and if the Chair allows him, he is quite in order in doing so. However, he cannot blame us at a later date for holding up the Bill.  I have often heard Opposition speakers being blamed for that but on this occasion the Minister is determined the Bill will not go through in a hurry.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a comment the Minister made last night and repeated today that the Land Acts, when they were brought in first, dealt with congestion. The Minister is as well aware as I am that the first migration did not take place until the early 'thirties. The original Land Acts dealt mostly with evicted tenants, with people who lived in the neighbourhood of the estates, who were in fact given the estates, and people brought from outside. The Minister now apparently considers it a capital crime that £75 million of the taxpayers' money was spent in halving the annuities.  He would have been expelled from his Fianna Fáil cumann if he were there in 1932 or 1933 and made such a statement.</P>

      <P>I had not noticed it.  The position is, as Deputy Blowick said here and Deputy McQuillan interjected, <Col N="1270" /> there are no extra inducements offered to the migrants now.  If it is sought to create the impression that the House is now offering them something which they did not get before, then that is entirely wrong.  I agree with the attitude that uneconomic holders, no matter where they come from, should be treated equally.  There is nothing wrong with that and the Minister can justify that.  It is entirely wrong that an uneconomic holder from the congested areas should be treated in a different way from an uneconomic holder, to use the Minister's words, in Kildare or Meath, and we could include Longford, Westmeath and Cork. He can treat the local men in a different way from the congest if he wants to and if he gets away with it under this Bill.  The Minister said last night that the NFA had no objection to it.  The NFA have been shouting from the house tops in regard to derating land up to £20 valuation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a hard job because the Minister contradicts himself so often that somebody must <Col N="1271" /> misquote him.  The NFA have circulated a document of which I am sure the Minister received a copy, even if he has not read it.  In it, they say they have no objection to the system proposed. The extraordinary thing is that they have been objecting to the rating of agricultural land up to £20 valuation. They are perfectly satisfied to have added on a considerable amount to the outgoings of a farmer because he happens to be born in the midlands and gets a farm of land.</P>
      <P>I heard one Deputy say that that was only one-tenth of what would be paid for conacre.  Perhaps the Minister would let the House have the benefit of his knowledge about the farms most recently divided.  What in fact has been the extent of the annuity being paid, the half annuity?  Then we will know the terrific price being paid for conacre, if we accept the figure of one-tenth which was quoted by somebody. I do not care in what way the Minister refers back to section 4, or any other section, because the position as it stands is that the person in a non-congested area who gets a farm will in future be required to pay the full annuity and his neighbour, who has come from a specially selected and privileged area, and even though he may be much wealthier, will have the benefit of continuing at half the annuity.  This is nothing new.  It is what is being done at present.  It is being done for the very few people to whom the Minister referred last night.  Now it is to be extended to those who were unfortunate enough to be born in the west of Ireland and the congested areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister picked on one of my statements and said that it was not correct.  He said&mdash;and I hope I am quoting him satisfactorily&mdash;that if somebody buys a farm, he does not get away with paying half the annuity. The position as I know it is that if an annuity is being paid on a farm and it is bought by somebody else, the situation is not altered as a result of the sale.</P>

They still have to pay the half, but if they happen to have been born in the midlands, and you can add County Dublin now, they will have to pay the full annuity just because they committed the cardinal crime of living within one mile of an estate when it was divided.  No one in this House can claim that there is any justice in that.  It is a deliberate attempt to victimise certain citizens and as far as we are concerned, we will oppose it as far as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>What strikes me about this section is its dishonesty. <Col N="1273" /> There is a very high degree of dishonesty about it, bearing in mind that little over a quarter of a century ago, the Government's policy shouted from the hilltops and in the valleys, was to abolish the land annuities completely. After a great struggle, during which the smallholders and farmers were driven to the threshold of every county home because they were broken completely, it was agreed that the annuities should be halved.  This is the first effort in legislation to deprive the people who benefited by the halving of the land annuities.  Not alone is this section dishonest but it is morally wrong.  The Minister should act on the basis of common justice and should realise that this section will create disagreement and enmity between neighbours and lead to a most unsatisfactory state of affairs.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that on the passing of this Bill he will have the power to declare certain pockets of congestion as congested districts but we must judge this Bill as we see it and in the Second Schedule, the congested districts are defined.  The congests who are already in areas which are not declared congested districts will be very seriously affected.  Take, for example, the congestion that prevails in Wicklow, Cavan, parts of Longford and in areas of Offaly, Laois, Kilkenny, Carlow, North Tipperary and parts of Meath.  Would the Minister not be prepared to face this matter courageously and ensure that the terms of this Bill will refer to the whole country and not attempt to make fish of one and flesh of another?  In this case certain privileged people are going to enjoy holdings at half the rent&mdash;because the Minister by order will declare their areas congested districts&mdash;while their neighbours will be living under conditions of a congest because their area may not be declared a congested district.  That is the great injustice in this.  It is a very serious matter and I have a feeling that is only the thin end of the wedge towards depriving the people of the benefits given to them in 1933 when the annuities were halved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the farmers will take a careful <Col N="1274" /> note of this section because I feel it is the first step towards making them pay what the Government can describe as a full economic rent for their holdings.  Surely every Deputy is aware that there have been many instances of smallholders who have already obtained holdings from the Land Commission, or additions to their existing holdings, and that their grievance is the annuity they are already paying is too high and too severe.  Surely they will have a greater grievance when it is doubled.  The Minister tells us that he has been taken up incorrectly by Deputy Tully and others who take the same meaning from what the Minister says.  When a holding is put on the market, no matter who buys the holding or what price it fetches, the annuity does not change.</P>
    <P>This is a section that the farmers would need to guard against because the privileges they won so dearly, after being dragged through an economic war, are now in great danger.  There is a possibility of the advantages represented by the halving of the annuities being discontinued.  If the Government get away with this section, it will be only a matter of time until legislation is introduced which will bring the Land Commission annuities up to the full rate and will discontinue the benefit of the halving of the annuities created by the 1933 Act.</P>
    <P>In the name of common justice, in the name of fair legislation, all farmers are entitled to the same treatment, irrespective of the part of the country in which they live.  It is not right that one section of the community should be set against another.  The Minister knows the temperament of rural Ireland.  He knows the state of affairs that can be created if one man having the same type of land as his neighbour pays only half the rent for it while his neighbour pays the full rent.</P>
    <P>This matter should be reconsidered, in view of the opposition to the section from so many Deputies.  The points raised by Deputies opposing the section are worthy of consideration. In the interests of those people who will be seriously affected by the <Col N="1275" /> section and who will be unable to pay the full economic rent of the holding, the Minister should reconsider the section.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that the section will seriously affect a cottage tenant in a non-congested district who obtains a portion of land as an accommodation plot.  He must pay the full rent for it, whereas on the adjoining land where a congest may obtain a holding, the congest will enjoy the privilege of the halved annuity. This is dishonest.  It is something which the House should reject and of which the people should take serious notice.  In my opinion, it is the first step towards the introduction at a later stage of something which we may describe as a land tax.  That has been hinted at.  It is the first step to doubling the rent on every landowner. The Minister should tell us straight and be honest with us on this Land Bill.  This is a first instalment in an effort to deprive the farming community of the benefits of the Land Act under which the land annuities were halved.</P>
    <P>This is unjust.  I would ask the Minister not to lose his patience.  I appeal to him to be calm.  I sincerely ask him to view this matter in a calm and rational way.  There is no reason why the Minister should lose his temper with Deputy Tully or any other Deputy.  We all desire to discuss legislation in a rational way.  I am sure the Minister realises that there must be an Opposition.  We are here as an Opposition to secure the best possible legislation for the majority of the people.  That is our duty.  We have no desire to be obstructive or destructive. Our desire is to be constructive.  The constructive criticism which has come from this side of the House in relation to this section is worthy of the fullest possible consideration by a Minister who is anxious to present this country with a Land Bill based on common justice.  That is all we are asking for in so far as this section is concerned.</P>

      <P>I do not know where Deputy Flanagan got the idea that there was any proposal by any <Col N="1276" /> Government that the people would be relieved of the whole of the annuities. The only time that I ever saw any such proposal was during an election period when it was suggested by the Leader of Deputy Flanagan's Party that as against the halved annuities, they would ask for no annuities at all and that the land would be free.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Flanagan's Party had their way, all of the people of this country would still be paying the full economic annuity, with the difference that it would be paid to Britain instead of to our own Government.  Let Deputy Flanagan take that to himself.</P>

      <P>I see the Minister's position without any difficulty.  What is wrong with most Deputies who are making all the noise here is laziness. When I hear statements made about Dublin and Louth and other areas in regard to conacre, I have to consider it in the light of one cheque I saw, which was for £27,000 payable to one so-called farmer for wheat, two years ago, that was grown on land that was taken by an auctioneer in Meath and Dublin for a gentleman who resided abroad.  He grew wheat but they knocked the economic price of wheat to the ordinary farmer.</P>
      <P>What is wrong with Deputies is downright laziness.  When it is stated here that any area where there is a congested pocket will be declared a congested area or will be considered as a congested area, Deputies are too lazy to walk around their constituencies in order to find where these congested areas are.</P>

      <P>I have no apology to make.  In reference to the farm which I mentioned before the Dáil adjourned and which the Land Commission are now acquiring, three Deputies from my constituency went to Deputy Blowick when he was Minister for Lands.  We begged him then to take it from the person who had grabbed it, a fellow called Smith&mdash;425 acres of it. Deputy Blowick, when Minister for Lands, refused to take it.  It was sold for £7,000 to an Englishman.  Since then, it has been swapped a couple of times and I feel sure it would cost the Land Commission today between £35,000 and £45,000.</P>
      <P>That is the situation in regard to land prices that has arisen, due to the neglect of a previous Minister for Lands.  These are the problems we have to face up to.  That land could have been let very cheaply if it had been bought for £7,000.  Now, because the Land Commission must pay perhaps £45,000 for it, a completely different state of affairs exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Deputy who takes the trouble to look around his constituency can very easily find out where the congested pockets are.  They can then bring those to the notice of the Minister and demand that they be scheduled <Col N="1278" /> as congested districts under section 7. I have quite a big area to look after and I can do it.  It is up to other Deputies to do something for the people who sent them here.  I am perfectly satisfied that since the Minister has taken the power to himself to declare any pocket pointed out to him as a congested area, after inspection by the Land Commission, no difficulty will arise under this section.  The difficulties raised here are a big bluff by a number of Deputies who are too damn lazy to do their jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time I have seen an attempt, in recent legislation at any rate, to tamper with the question of the annuities.  To my mind, that is a very explosive problem indeed, one of which the Government should be very wary.  Let me put it in this way: if the Government had the intention of making an overhaul of the question of the annuities, they should have been frank about it. Section 7 seems to be another case of flying the balloon.</P>
      <P>When the Government previously had certain things in mind, this same Minister was sent down the country to fly the balloon.  That balloon was shot down and I have the accounts of it here.  It involved investigations the Minister for Lands was making into what our position would be when we became members of the Common Market.  Here we have the same Minister for Lands taking an unprecedented step to alter a situation that has been working satisfactorily up to the present.  The excuse given for the alteration proposed by this section is that it will benefit holders in the congested areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spent at least 45 minutes telling us that the object of the section was to provide an inducement to congests, in the west particularly, to take holdings which would be made available for them in the midlands and elsewhere.  He suggested there was wagon load after wagon load of congests ready to move across every bridge over the Shannon if things were made sufficiently attractive for them in the midlands.  He repeated that section <Col N="1279" /> 7 provided an inducement which was not there before.</P>
    <P>What is the position?  In section 7 there is no inducement to a migrant or a person living in the congested areas which was not there already.  Why is it introduced, then?  My conviction is that this Government are not prepared to make a penny piece extra available for the solution of the land problem. What they are doing is pretending they are interested in the small farmer in the west, to whom they say: &ldquo;You will still have your annuities halved and we shall make the big fellow in the midlands pay.&rdquo;  The position will be that the small farmer in the non-congested areas, who is entitled to an addition of land wherever the Land Commission take over a farm, will now pay the full annuity, whereas the congested farmer in the west who may get a migrant holding will pay only half the annuity.  The argument can be put forward that the small farmer in the non-congested areas is subsidising his colleague in the congested locality.</P>
    <P>I speak as a Deputy who comes from an area designated as congested, and I do not think the people in my constituency want that type of segregation. To them, and to me as their representative, a cottier is a cottier, whether he is in Meath, Kildare, Tipperary, Cavan, Roscommon, Galway or Mayo.  Because he happens to be a cottier in Roscommon with a few acres, his annuities are halved.  If he is a cottier in part of Westmeath, or Longford, or Tipperary, he pays the full annuity.  Why is that type of segregation being introduced for the first time through section 7?  I should like an answer to that because, to my mind, there is no attraction in the section for the people of my constituency.</P>
    <P>This section imposes a definite penalty on the small uneconomic holder or cottier in the non-congested areas.  Why?  It will not help the people in Roscommon or Mayo but it will penalise the people in Tipperary, Cork, Cavan, County Dublin and other parts of the country.  I am satisfied the Minister for Lands will not get a <Col N="1280" /> free hand from his Government as far as finance is concerned, particularly from a Taoiseach who looks at Ireland through Dublin spectacles.</P>
    <P>It is clear the view has been expressed in Government circles that the people with land shall pay the full annuity.  It is clear they have decided: &ldquo;Let us test it like this and see how it works out through the Minister for Lands in his new Land Bill.&rdquo;  That is why section 7 is here today.  The small farmers and the uneconomic holders in the areas not designated as congested should not be treated as guinea pigs in this fashion.  It is a dreadful situation to find that an alien, or foreigner, or a large rancher, can come in and buy a large farm in, say, Tipperary and that this Bill has made no change in so far as the repayment of the annuities is concerned.  Such a purchaser is fully entitled to the privileges he has so far had.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the farm he now buys, if the Land Commission have another farm for division, the small local farmers will have to pay their full annuity on the portion of the land they received from the Land Commission while the large rancher beside them or the non-national has the full privileges which he has enjoyed up to the present so far as halved annuities are concerned.  If that is the way to deal with smallholders and uneconomic holdings in non-congested areas, I believe Fianna Fáil Deputies who will vote to support this section are not aware of the implications of it.  The argument put forward by Deputy Corry, Deputy Burke and the Minister that there is power in section 4 to allow the Minister to declare pockets of congestion in various parts of the country will be no solution.  In my opinion that is only an endeavour to weave a web of confusion and prevent the true situation from being discussed. It would appear that if every Deputy could do as Deputy Corry suggested the Minister would not have enough pockets in his suit, his overcoat, his dress suit and his wardrobe to hold the congested localities that would be produced.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows that his plan is to set up 45-acre holdings all over the country if possible.  On that basis, every county in Ireland can justly be described in the same terms as the areas now described as congested under the old Congested Districts Board.  So, in fact, it is a waste of time talking of pockets of congestion because there is no part of the country that cannot be described as congested if one takes a 45-acre unit in the future.  The Minister should have another look at this section before the next Stage of the Bill.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Minister may not have a big wardrobe but he has a good motorcar and all he needs to do is get into it and drive over the roads, west and south and he can see in every county there is a considerable congestion problem.  This is particularly acute in North Tipperary.  The Minister is obsessed by areas.  If the nine-county area was not scheduled for him I think he would have invented it.  He affords opportunities to the west against the congests in the south because in the south they are supposed to have better lands and markets and to be better established.  But who has the better land and so on?  Not the congests, but the bigger farmers.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The only benefit the young farmer can get from this Bill is the doubtful one of being offered land at half annuity price.  It will not help them to get an extra acre apart from the conditions <Col N="1282" /> at present obtaining.  They have been led to believe there is something in this Bill that will get them land and that is what I deplore because I believe it is calculated, and will be used, to deceive young farmers and farmers in non-scheduled areas.  If they do get land on their own rights they will walk into a non-scheduled area and will, perhaps, be very unpopular as they will be paying half-annuities as against their neighbours who may have got land in equally poor circumstances and have to pay full annuities.</P>
      <P>This Bill, I think, will lead to a complete misconception on the part of the general public as the so-called concession of the halved annuity given in scheduled areas will not get them any extra land.  It will, I believe, encourage them to leave the land and many of them at the moment require little encouragement.  There is the added objectionable feature that under the cover of giving them a concession of land at half-annuity, there is the new invention that Deputy McQuillan mentioned, the dress-rehearsal for full-annuity which for the first time is put on the small parcel of land.  Any congest, even though he gets a few extra acres, will still in the majority of cases not be a rancher but a small landowner. The Minister mentioned 40 to 45 acres of good land.  It means that a man, a non-scheduled congest, can get a few acres of land but will pay for these the full annuities.  That is a new departure and it may be a prelude to other things that are to come.  Why cannot the Minister, in view of the small amount involved, treat the entire country as a congested area and allow these congests, farmers in non-scheduled areas, to get a few extra acres?</P>

I am convinced his efforts in this respect as regards the halved-annuity section will be quite worthless and probably are quite deceptive.</P>

Deputy Oliver Flanagan spoke for quite a long time about dishonesty.  In case people outside the House would regard him as an expert in that respect it is necessary for me absolutely to refute the implication he <Col N="1284" /> made on this section regarding my intentions to take action under section 4 of the Bill.  Again, as regards what Deputy Blowick alleged in respect of subsection (2) of section 4, it is necessary for me to refute that and to say that if any Minister for Lands did not exercise the powers in section 4 in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2) of that section, Deputy Blowick would be the first person to impeach him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give statutory authority for the pensions increases granted in 1962 and 1963 to various public service pensioners.  The pensions covered by the Bill are civil pensions payable from the Exchequer and from other public funds, including pensions paid by local authorities and harbour authorities, as well as pensions paid by various statutory bodies.  Separate legislation will be enacted to authorise similar increases in Army retired pay, disability pensions, special allowances and military service pensions.  The increases in Exchequer pensions, both civil and military, are already being paid in most cases under the authority of Additional Estimates passed by this House on 18th July, 1962, and 28th November, 1963.</P>
      <P>The provision of the Bill are explained in detail in the White Paper circulated with the text.  The most notable feature of the Bill is the new basis adopted for the pensions increases of 1962 and 1963.  Previous pensions increases had consisted of percentage additions which varied with the amount of the pension or the date of the pensioners' retirement, so as to provide a larger increase in the smaller pensions or for the longest retired pensioners. The 1962 and 1963 increases operated to bring all pensions currently payable to persons who retired before a certain date, up to a common level fixed in relation to post-retirement pay.  The 1962 increases raised pensions to 1955 pay level, and added a further 6 per cent to these pensions and to pensions granted before the general pay increase of 1969, which became operative for the Civil Service on 15th December, 1959, and for other services in December, 1959, or in the early months of 1960.</P>
      <P>The 1963 increases advanced pensions further, to 1959 pay level, so that all pensioners who retired before the dates in 1969-60 when the 1959 pay increases became operative have now been brought up to 1959 level.  The resulting benefit was, of course, greatest for the longest retired pensioners.  In the case of the older pensioners, some of whom had retired before 1939, the 1962 and 1963 increases have meant a substantial addition to their pensions over and above the increases already granted to them under the four earlier Pensions (Increase) Acts, 1950 to 1960.</P>
      <P>The large-scale revision of pensions to the post-retirement pay level of 1959 was a more costly operation than any pensions increase previously granted.  The estimated total annual cost to the Exchequer of the 1962 increases is £820,000 with a further £320,000 for the 1963 increases.  Even allowing for some savings on the 1962 figure on account of deaths since August, 1962, the annual cost of the 1962 and 1963 pensions increases at the present time is estimated to be of the order of £1.1 million.  The estimated annual cost to the Exchequer of earlier pensions increases was £212,000 for the 1960 increases, £130,000 in 1959 and £180,000 in 1956.  The estimated annual cost of the increases granted in 1949 was £240,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of Exchequer pensions covered by this Bill for the 1962 increases is 10,106 divided into the following categories: 2,709 Civil Service pensioners at an annual cost of £121,000; 2,956 national teachers&mdash; annual cost, £195,000; 4,017 Garda <Col N="1287" /> pensioners (including widows and children)&mdash;annual cost, £122,000; 424 RIC and miscellaneous&mdash;annual cost, £24,000.</P>
    <P>The total annual cost of increases in these pensions is £462,000 to which must be added approximately £42,000 for recoupment of the Exchequer share of the 1962 increases in local authority pensions, making a total of £504,000 for the estimated annual cost to the Exchequer of the 1962 increases under this Bill.  The 1963 increases payable under the Bill are estimated to cost a further £211,000 in a full year, of which £48,000 is for Civil Service pensioners, £60,000 for national teachers, £79,000 for the Garda pensioners and £9,000 for RIC and other small groups of pensioners; the remaining £15,000 is for recoupments to local authorities.</P>
    <P>Increases in Army and military service pensions, retired pay and special allowances, which will be covered by separate legislation, will bring the cost to the Exchequer in a full year up to the figures of £820,000 and £320,000 already mentioned.</P>
    <P>Another provision in the Bill which I should mention specially is section 29, under which future increases in civil pensions of the type covered in the Bill may be authorised by statutory regulations made by the Minister for Finance and laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  This provision will relieve the House of the necessity of passing an Act to validate every new pensions increase.  It will not, however, lighten the work of the Minister for Finance, who will always have the task of co-ordinating the many proposals for expenditure urged upon him in this House and elsewhere with the revenue available to him.  In this situation, the Minister for Finance must hold a balance between the various sectors of the community so that the incidence of taxation and the distribution of benefits will tend to be fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years, a substantial allocation has been made from the Exchequer to public service pensioners. The needs of pensioners will continue <Col N="1288" /> to be sympathetically considered and I hope that it will be possible to effect further improvements in their position from time to time.  Their claims, however, will have to be considered in relation to the overall pattern of financial and economic development which must ultimately determine the benefits that can be provided for every class in the community, including pensioners.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not want to be discourteous to the Minister by interrupting him, but it is an unfortunate fact&mdash;and I do not think it is in any way due to discourtesy&mdash;that every time he stands up to make a speech such as this, except on the most major occasions, the persons responsible for it never circulate a copy of his speech.  I am not hitting at his two officials here present; it is not their function.  I know whose function it is and the Minister knows, and he ought to see that he is not put in the personally embarrassing position in which he has been, of having to apologise for the fact that the ordinary courtesy of circulating the Minister's speech has not been observed.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not attributing any discourtesy to the Minister personally.  It should not be necessary to refer to this on every occasion, as it has been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation in relation to pensions is one of the most complicated types of legislation that anybody is unfortunate enough to have to consider. The basis on which the pensions started with the Superannuation Acts in the last half of the last century has been kept the basis of composition of pensions ever since.  I want to suggest to the Minister, and to the House, that in this modern age, we should look at the matter in an entirely different way. It is appropriate, I feel, that we should reconsider the whole basis of the composition of the pension.  It was all right, in a day and age in which the value of money remained fixed, to say that a pension was payable by reference to the salary of the person at the date on which he retired.  As far as I <Col N="1289" /> can recollect, and I speak entirely subject to correction, the original Superannuation Act was one somewhere about 1874, or thereabouts.  At that time, and subsequently, the value of money remained static.  Nobody wants the value of money to continue to decrease as it has continued to decrease, but it is an unpleasant fact that it has been doing so steadily over the years.</P>
    <P>The first class of people who are hit by a decrease in the value of money are those living on fixed incomes, and of those the pensioners are the greatest proportion.  Some countries have already moved away from that conception. Some countries have decided that while the grade in which a person retires fixes the rate of pension at that time, nevertheless the actual money he receives varies with the value of that money, varies, as we would put it here, with the cost of living index figure.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that for a Minister for Finance deliberately to tie pensions to a cost of living index figure is a very radical departure.  It is something which should be examined and examined soon, because unless some new basis is taken, we will go on being grossly unfair to one section of the community.  It has been the pattern in relation to payments to pensioners over the years that they have lagged a long way behind payments to other classes of the community in the increases that have been obtained to compensate for rises in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Naturally, those who are on pensions are not going to be allowed to take into account increases in productivity and increases in general improvement of the standard of living of those in employment.  It is entirely wrong that where the value of money decreases substantially over a period the pensioners should only get the compensatory increase in their pensions to meet that decrease in the value of their money in a matter of some number of years after the decrease has made itself felt.</P>
    <P>This Bill is of course only the legislative implementation of decisions announced in earlier Budgets, and, though I do not expect the Minister <Col N="1290" /> for Finance to give an indication today of what he is, or is not going to include in his Budget, I want to urge very strongly on him that there is an obligation on him in that Budget to improve the lot of the pensioners. The increased costs on every one of us in every sector of our society today fall hardest and most inevitably on the person in receipt of a fixed income.</P>
    <P>The pensioner is clearly one of these and clearly one of the most deserving of these classes. There is an obligation on the community to ensure that where people lose a substantial part of their purchasing power through no fault of their own, the State should consider how it can bring up the amount in relation to that purchasing power.  I sincerely hope that when Tuesday comes, the Minister for Finance will have included in his Budget a sufficiency to bring the State pensioners not merely up to 1959 as this Bill does, but right up to the present time.</P>
    <P>As I said in the beginning, this Bill is a most complicated piece of legislation, as is the whole pension legislation. I think I am correct in saying, however, that the effect of this Bill will be that there will be some simplification in at least the legislative end of pensions authorisation.  But in addition to that, it has the effect of ensuring that the pension plan is homogeneous up to December, 1959, for State pensioners and January, 1960, for the indirect State pensioners and those of the teachers, Garda and so forth.  I am not quite clear, however, exactly where this Bill goes in relation to its enabling provisions for local authorities.  Is it clear that local authorities are empowered under this Bill to increase their pensions <i>pari passu</i> in the same way or must that be done by a separate Local Authorities Pensions Bill?</P>
    <P>What I have said in relation to State pensioners applies with equal force to local authority pensioners. One of the effects of the lag over the years in regard to increases in pension to meet increases in the cost of living has been that some pensioners have gone to their reward and have, therefore, <Col N="1291" /> never been able to take advantage of any increases, while others found they had not got the first increase to meet an increase in the cost of living when the second increase actually came along.  They have been doubly hit from the point of view of the depreciation in the value of their money.</P>
    <P>I have never been quite able to understand why a Bill such as this is necessary at all.  The State has been paying these increases in pensions for the past two years under the authority of a Vote coupled with the Central Fund Bill or the Appropriation Bill. If that was sufficient authority to pay these increases up to date, why is it not sufficient authority now and for the future?  It seems to me entirely illogical that an Estimate passed by the House and the inclusion of that in the Appropriation Act should have been adequate in 1962/63 and in 1963/64 but is not adequate in 1964/65.  If it were right in one case, surely it should be right now and for the future?</P>
    <P>The ambit of this Bill is, of course, a little wider because it also deals with streamlining, though I believe this streamlining does not go far enough. According to paragraph 13 of the explanatory memorandum, the provisions of this Bill apply to former Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries and their widows.  This has no relation to me personally since I did not have the requisite three years and so I can comment on it objectively. The loss that is frequently suffered by a Minister because of the break in his business and because of what he must do after he ceases to be a Minister are matters that should be taken into account in the computation of pension.  I understand that no payments have been made in the respects I mention under the authority of Votes and the Appropriation Act.  Why is an increase appropriate to be paid under an Estimate in one case and not appropriate in another case?  Perhaps the Minister could unravel that matter.</P>
    <P>When one considers the general problem of pensions and their equation to the value of money not merely at the time the person retired but also <Col N="1292" /> at the time he wants to use the money, there is not really very much one can say on Second Reading.  The general principle involved is more germane to a Committee Stage discussion during which the various sections can be considered specifically.  I trust there will be a substantial period between now and the Committee Stage so that those who are interested outside will have an opportunity of studying the measure and making representations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few short general observations on this measure.  The Bill is, as the Minister has pointed out, the machinery necessary to give continued legal effect to increases already granted.  The Bill, in fact, only does partial justice in a situation that has called clamantly for many years for alleviation and for a full measure of satisfaction for the injustice meted out to various categories of public servants.  So far as the Bill is some alleviation of an injustice, it must be accepted.  So far as it holds out any indication of future efforts to mitigate the continuing injustice that will be prevalent, notwithstanding this measure, then it is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only indication I can see appears in section 29.  That is the only indication that those who are still suffering from injustice will have their cases adequately met.  If I heard the Minister aright&mdash;he will forgive me when I say I found it a little difficult, particularly towards the end, to hear what he was saying&mdash;the Minister does hold out some sort of hope that at some time there will be some additional measure of relief for retired civil servants; they will get the benefit of increased productivity, or increased prosperity, or words to that effect.  That is hopeful, perhaps, but it is not very helpful.  It is very easy to say that we hope the prosperity of the country generally, the productivity of industry and agriculture, will enable public moneys to be given to retired public servants.  The point is that that situation is always postponed and, in the meantime, retired civil servants and public servants generally suffer an injustice. It is no measure of satisfaction to them to know that at some future date some residue of these will gain <Col N="1293" /> some little advantage, continuing in the meantime to suffer hardship.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman pointed out that the origins of superannuation go back to legislation in the British Parliament nearly a century ago.  Pensions were then based on salaries payable at the time of retirement.  Throughout all that period&mdash;some complications arose because conditions arising out of the First World War and, to some extent, the Second World War&mdash;the principle adopted was that pensions were really not gratuities but something in the nature of deferred pay.  It is from that point of view that public servants who retired some years back are now claiming parity with those who are now retiring in circumstances and conditions entirely different.  That is the real basis of their claim to justice in this matter.</P>
    <P>Public servants who have got, or who will get this year as in years past, increases in their remuneration have got those increases on three counts. The first is, the fall in the value of money; the second the increase in the cost of living; and the third the increased prosperity of the country. These are the three principal points on which it is justifiable to increase pensions and wages.  Each of them is applicable in the case of public servants who have retired, whatever the date of their retiral.  Take the position of a person who retired three or four years ago.  He finds himself at the age of 63 or 65 with the amount of money which he has to keep himself and his family, and at that stage many people have not yet discharged their family obligations, halved compared with what it was before his retiral.</P>
    <P>As the years go by, the amount of money available to him falls in value each year, and year by year, not merely from the point of view of general inflation but also because of the increased cost of living.  The amount of goods that money can buy has fallen steadily over the years.  The cost of living has increased and is still increasing and will continue to increase by reason of the taxation imposed by the Minister.  This all has its impact on the retired teacher, the retired civil servant and the retired civic guard.</P>
    <P>We are told that the country is in a phase of prosperity and that is one <Col N="1294" /> of the reasons given for the increase of 12 per cent in salaries.  I have been asked by a constituent of mine why that 12 per cent has not been given to her.  She is a retired secondary teacher who finds the continued increase in the cost of living intolerable.  The price of everything as far as she is concerned has gone up; she has to face increased taxation and the increased cost of living.  That lady, who is not so young now, has to face these problems and she is one of the types on whose behalf I am speaking.  There are only three of these and I am sure the Minister is well aware of them all.</P>
    <P>The next is the civil servant and I am taking the case of an executive officer who retired before 1959.  In spite of this Bill, he will still receive £110 per annum less than an officer of the same grade who retires this year.  This is only one such instance that I could give as I have a number of letters from my constituents on this matter.  I have spent most of my official life advocating the claim that I am now advocating so it cannot be said that I am doing it in the evening of my political life.</P>
    <P>The next series of incidents I should like to quote as representative of the injustice and unfairness of which I complain to the Minister, the House and the public is with regard to the civic guards.  One is a retired chief superintendent and in speaking for him I speak for the 3,000 men, commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers, who served this State at the very beginning, who in very difficult times went as an unarmed force to keep order in this country. They are a section of the community which has been very badly treated in this matter.  In the case of a chief superintendent who is now 63 years of age and who has retired for some few years, he finds himself very much worse off than a person of the same rank now retiring.  He retired only a few short years ago but it is sufficiently far away for him not to get full advantage of these new increases.</P>
    <P>Let me give some further instances. A guard retiring on 1st March, 1960, with 33 years service gets £290 4s.  A guard retiring four years afterwards, on 1st March, 1964, and with 33 years <Col N="1295" /> service gets £472 10s., which is a difference of £182 6s.  I know that the only justification the Minister has for that is the financial one and that he can say he is expending £1.1 million in trying to ameliorate the injustice to which I refer but injustice is not sufficiently condoned by saying that we have not the money to remedy it. Money has been found for many other matters, not all of them as vital or as important as the cause of the people to whom I refer.</P>
    <P>A sergeant who retired on 1st March, 1960, with 33 years service has a pension of £336 10s. while a sergeant who retired on 1st March this year with the same service has £529 17s.  Surely that is a startling state of affairs.  A superintendent who retired on 1st March, 1960, with 33 years service has a pension of £627 and a superintendent with the same service who retired on 1st March this year has £946 10s.  A chief superintendent who retired on 1st March, 1960, with 33 years service has £815 and a chief superintendent with the same service who retired on 1st March this year has £1,207 10s.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to give any further details.  I am just taking these three examples as indicative of the position. I could give many more figures but I am sure the Minister has them all and knows them well.  Those people whose cause I am advocating here are a section of the community that have been very badly treated by their employers, the State.  I have been advocating their rights down through the years and I would now ask the Minister, when he is considering what can be done, to take the final and irrevocable step of giving parity to all pensioners.  Those people who have retired for some years should be treated in the same manner as those who are now retiring.  The conditions which justify larger pensions for those who are retiring now also warrant that the same measure of justice should be given to those who have retired over the years.</P>
    <P>There should be no difference <Col N="1296" /> between the pension of a guard who retired in 1960 and one who retired this year, considering what has taken place in the economy of the country since 1960 and which has justified the increased pensions given to the guard retiring now.  The cost of living has gone up and the value of money has gone down.  The Government claim prosperity for the country and in giving the 12 per cent increase, that has been one of their justifications.  I now ask the Minister to take the last and final step of giving parity to all pensioners.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt, looking at what has happened in the matter of pensions over the years, that various Ministers for Finance were forced, whether through considerations of justice, or political matters or pressure from the Dáil, to give pension increases in many cases, at intermittent intervals.  That pressure will continue.  Those who are now retired will probably find the pensions they get are not adequate to meet the conditions that may exist in two or three years' time.  They will add their voices to the ancient voices of that residue of derelicts and a few years hence will still be looking for justice.  Eventually the principle of parity will have to be given.  Accordingly, I do think it would resound to the Minister's credit and also to the credit of the State if the Minister dispensed that justice which undoubtedly the claims of these sections of the community require.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill merely gives legislative effect to the pension increase proposals contained in the 1962-63 Budget.  I do not propose to comment on it at any great length.  Suffice it to say that there is and has been for many years great dissatisfaction among pensioners in the Government service and in the local authority service with the rate of pension and the rate of pension increase that has been applied to them over the years.  This Bill contains many complex and detailed provisions for the calculation of particular types of pensions but the main outline in the Bill is to give legislative effect to the proposals of 1962-63.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some improvement in the manner in which pension increases <Col N="1297" /> have been applied in recent years.  However, we still have not reached a perfect or near-perfect system in order to ensure that justice and fair play will be given to those in receipt of or are depending on local authority or State pensions.  The latest increase given in the Budget of 1963 and which is given the force of law now brings pensioners up to the level attained by those who retired in 1959. The ideal situation would be if the Minister found it possible to apply increases to those people as if they were retiring in 1964, 1965 or whatever year they might retire.  That would be the ideal situation, not alone in respect of State and local authority pensioners but in respect of other pensioners for whom the Minister for Social Welfare, in particular, is responsible and possibly the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be conscious of the criticism there has been over the years of the delay in payment of many of these pension increases.  Over the past couple of years, the Dáil Order Paper has been filled with questions asking when certain types of State and local authority pensions will be paid. I do not know whether the delay has been by reason of the framing of the legislation, the legislation which appears to us in this measure so detailed and complex in its provisions. I note there is a proposal in the Bill to provide for these increases in future by statutory regulations.  I think it would be correct to assume that this will be a speedier method of making provision for these increases and for payment.  That in itself is an advance and I trust my interpretation of that part of the Bill is correct.</P>
    <P>I suppose the main criticism the Minister has levelled against him and the main criticism that Ministers for Finance down through the years have had levelled against them is that it is not enough.  I gathered from some of the Minister's remarks a note of optimism to the effect that he was working towards a situation where pension increases would tend to keep pensions in line with increases in salaries and wages.  We all trust that position will be attained soon.  Of course, we sincerely hope the Minister in framing the proposals for next <Col N="1298" /> week will have in mind especially that section of pensioners who at the present time are in receipt of very small pensions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have repeatedly expressed the view that the time has come to review the basis on which pensions are awarded and granted.  As has been said in the course of this debate and indeed on other occasions, pensions, as we understand them, are based on the rate of pay at retirement.  That principle, if it is accepted as a principle, was all right when the value of money was constant.  Pensions for State servants have now been in existence for almost a century.  During the first 50 years or certainly up to the First World War, the principle of basing pensions on the rate of pay at retirement seemed an adequate and reasonable approach to the framing of pensions. A very radical change occurred with the inflation which followed the First World War.  Although prices subsequently dropped, it altered the outlook on pensions generally.  Since the last war, however, the situation has changed dramatically to the disadvantage of pensioners and not only is causing serious anomalies but has resulted in what can only be described as very unfair differentiation between pensioners who retired in a particular year or period and their colleagues who retired subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Examples have been given here this evening and many others could be given of State servants, civil servants, Garda and Army personnel, teachers and other categories that do not come to mind at the moment who retired a short period of two or three years ago. I have one case in mind of an officer who will not be three years retired until next June or July and whose colleague due to retire at the moment under the same age limit regulation, holding the same rank and precisely the same position, will have a pension of £3 a week approximately higher than he was awarded when he retired just three years ago.  The reason we should review this whole system is the unfair situation which has developed arising from the system under which pensions are <Col N="1299" /> based on the rate of pay at retirement. In some European countries a different system has been evolved and the time has come when we should look afresh at this problem and review the whole basis on which pensions are fixed with a view to reaching a situation in which pensions would be revised upwards on the basis of rises in the cost of living, or on whatever basis is agreed in respect of wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>In recent years, and since the war, we had a number of wage and salary adjustments.  The House is familiar with the fact that the most recent such adjustment is that known as the ninth round.  These wage and salary adjustments are given in order to compensate people for the rise in the cost of living. There have been various rises over the years and, as has been pointed out, the cost of living is still rising.  It is unfortunate from the general point of view that any degree of stability has only been short-lived and although there have been occasional periods since the war when price stability appeared to exist the periods were brief and the general experience has been a substantial and continuous rise in the cost of living and in the price level generally.</P>
    <P>Generally, the pattern has now been evolved in which a wage and salary increase applies to all categories whether they are employed directly by the State or whether they are in private employment. The pattern in the recent ninth round increase was that a similar increase was granted to all categories and the 12 per cent increase applied right across the board not merely to State or semi-State concerns but to those employed in industry as well. This meant that those in receipt of wages and salaries were compensated for the rise in the cost of living and that adjustments were made to cushion them against the increase in prices and to bring them up, perhaps not fully in some cases, to the level of the standard of living which they enjoyed prior to the most recent rise in the cost of essentials and the most recent rise in the consumer price index.  That has meant that those living on pensions or <Col N="1300" /> fixed incomes, such as those living on the income from investments accumulated out of past savings, or on incomes from property, find that they have got a meagre increase or in some cases have not yet got any increase.  I believe we have got to evolve a system similar to that in operation in some European countries under which at the same time as wage and salary adjustments are made comparable increases in pensions will be made in respect of retired State pensioners and other categories of pensions.  There is no valid reason why pensioners should lag behind other categories in the community.</P>
    <P>One of the bases on which salary and wage adjustments are made is that the general standard in the community, the level of productivity and the general level of prosperity, justifies it and that those engaged in a particular range of employment by their efforts and skill are contributing to the general increase not merely in prosperity but in certain aspects of productivity.  That reason is valid for those engaged in industry and in agriculture and in certain other categories of employment, but there are many people in different avocations, even under the State, who, no matter how hard and efficiently they work, do not affect the rate of productivity one way or another or only to a very slight degree.  The very nature of their work does not afford them an opportunity of having a direct impact or at least an impact of worthwhile dimensions on the level of productivity and the general level of prosperity.  Therefore, to the extent they benefit through wage and salary increases they get an advantage over and above what is paid to pensioners and retired persons.  There are a great many people, former civil servants, ex-Army or ex-Garda personnel, retired teachers, former local authority employees, retired post office and other workers, all of whom in their own way have given good service, to the best of their ability, for the duration of their employment in these callings. Indeed, some of them have given very distingiushed service.  These people served the State well and now they find that because of the system under <Col N="1301" /> which pensions are awarded those who retire now, compared with those who retired some years ago, will get a higher rate of pension.  With the passage of time those who retire now will find that their pensions are based on the level of salary or wages in existence at the time of their retirement and their colleagues who retire subsequently will very likely have higher pensions unless we by legislative action or by deliberate policy decide to adopt an equitable and fair system, a system which will recognise that the whole basis on which pensions are based is no longer valid.  The system was satisfactory enough prior to the first war and perhaps prior to the last war, but certainly it is no longer valid in the changing conditions which now exist, in which the value of money is no longer constant, and those in receipt of pensions are the worst hit.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of discussion in recent months about the effect of the turnover tax and the fact that those who have got the ninth round increase have been compensated for the effects of the tax by the increase in their wages or salaries But, as I have said and as others have said, there are sections of the community who so far have got no commensurate benefit, who, in fact, have got no benefit at all in respect of the effects of the turnover tax and who have not benefited by the ninth round.  These are pensioners of all sorts, whether State, semi-State, local authority or otherwise; persons living on fixed incomes from investments or from, say, property or other sources.  All these categories find that their situation and their standard of living are being continuously depressed without any alleviation.</P>
    <P>I believe and hope and the House and the country hope that the Minister next week will treat pensioners in a fair and reasonable manner.  There are many sections of the community suffering severely because of the rise in the cost of living.  I do not attribute all the rise to the Government or to the policy adopted.  Some of it is outside the range of Government activity. Some of it is outside the scope of any <Col N="1302" /> effective remedial action by the Government.  Some of it is the effect of a general, world-wide trend, a trend that has not merely affected this country but has affected and is affecting Europe.  But, at least we have the ability and the means to compensate to some extent those pensioners who have been adversely affected by the substantial rise in the cost of living and by the fact, as I have said, that pensions are based on an antiquated and out-of-date system that was appropriate enough in bygone times but is no longer valid in view of the decline in the value of money and the fact that the value of money no longer remains constant.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of this matter that the Minister might consider further, that is, the question of a proper pensions scheme for widows of civil servants.  I know that we introduced an Act in 1956 but it seems to me from the views I have heard expressed that that Act has not been availed of to the extent to which it might be or to the extent necessary to cover widows of civil servants. There is a strong case for a pensions system.  Admittedly, civil servants generally serve for a longer period than Army personnel but there is a strong case for a pensions scheme for the widows of civil servants on a basis similar to that provided for widows of ex-Army personnel or, certainly, one which would provide pensions for the widows of civil servants in the same way as pensions are provided for widows of ex-Army personnel, ex-Gardaí and other categories.</P>
    <P>I wish to join with the other Deputies who have spoken in urging on the Minister the desirability of devising as soon as possible a policy in regard to pensions and following that policy decision by the legislative and other administrative action necessary. I would urge him to decide that for the future a new approach to the method of assessing pensions is necessary, that we should get in line with the enlightened and progressive policies which are now being operated in a number of European countries under which pensions and retirement pay <Col N="1303" /> are based on some arrangement or system which would keep them in line with rises in the cost of living and with wages and salary adjustments, rather than allow pensioners to be left at the tail-end of the financial and other arrangements made; to operate the economy of the State on the basis on which we would expect it to be operated; to consider particularly the weakest sections of the community as having a first charge on the resources of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's position is a very difficult one.  I believe that any Minister for Finance in an inflationary period such as we are now moving through will have great difficulties.  In fact, I am sure the Minister most nearly resembles the little boy we remember in the schoolbooks 50 or 60 years ago with his hands in the breach in the dam wall in Holland trying to keep the flood waters out.  I can understand the Minister's reluctance.  It is quite clear that he must be reluctant to add anything to the formidable bill which it is costing to run the country, to pay its servants and to pay its pensioners but, if we deal with the matter on that basis, that we only yield when we have to yield to claims for adjustments in reward or in pension, that will mean that only the most vocal and the most urgent will get their slice out of what is going and the least vocal and the weaker will suffer.  That is the kind of jungle reaction of human nature and, indeed, of Ministers for Finance.</P>
      <P>We all know that there are pockets of pensioners who have a real grievance and they will always have a grievance until all pensions are evenly, equally and equitably dispensed.  Until the very brutally underpaid pension of the CIE worker is related in degree to the pension paid to the just-retired public servant, we must admit and accept the charge of injustice.  Until all pensions are related to some scientific calculation that is based on actual cost of living indices, this injustice will continue. The strong will benefit and the smaller and the weaker groups will suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister himself cannot buy <Col N="1304" /> as much with the £1 note in his pocket today as he could have bought five years ago.  That sums up pretty well the case against any kind of differential in the scale of pensions for public servants who in their time have all performed and given the same service. Those who retired in the middle fifties did work that is comparable with the work done by those who are retiring now.  They are finding it just as hard to live.</P>
    <P>If this thing is done on a scientific basis, if all pensions are related to a cost of living index figure, it will have one advantage, that every Minister for Finance will know pretty accurately how much it will cost for every point increase in living costs and none of us can grumble.</P>
    <P>Inflationary trends such as we have now are very savage and very unselective in their impact and it is our duty in this House to combat that by relating pensions, that is, all pensions, to real money values.  Let us make sure that if we are paying a pension to a retired Secretary of a State Department, to an Army officer, to a retired sergeant of the Garda or even to a long-retired CIE worker, we will treat them all equally and fairly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I suppose we could say that, in the final analysis, governments cause inflation. Certainly, they have a great responsibility when inflation comes and they should be held responsible for that inflation.  Up to the present time, inflation hits in our society here two sections of the people: the farming community and pensioners.  The other section&mdash;the salaried classes, the workers&mdash;by virtue of their numerous organisations, have got their incomes adjusted.  The pensioners have nowhere to turn.  Certain other classes&mdash;industrialists, the stock exchange manipulators&mdash;can hedge against inflation and compensate themselves for increases in the cost of living or declines in the purchasing power of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister recently what it would cost to give parity to the various retired civil servants.  I enumerated CIE, the Garda, the Army, the Civil <Col N="1305" /> Service, ex-RIC and others.  He told me he did not know what it would cost and said he thought the collection of the information would cause more trouble than it was worth.  Perhaps the figure would be a tidy one.  I do not know, and seemingly neither does the Minister.</P>
    <P>I asked him subsequently whether he would consider introducing a pensions policy to provide automatic adjustment of pensions in proportion to the cost of living index figure. During the past ten years, the cost of living index figure has advanced at the rate of three per cent per annum.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong. That would have been something on which one could at least make a calculation. It is something from which the Minister could give us an estimate, if he agreed to provide a pensions policy based on the cost of living index figure, of how much it was likely to cost.</P>
    <P>I would ask him to examine these two viewpoints&mdash;either parity or a scheme based on the cost of living index figure idea.  I feel sure it would be quite an easy matter to devise an alternative formula&mdash;there must be a choice of formulae&mdash;which would work out in a fashion equitable to all our pensioned classes and obviate the necessity for introducing year after year these <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements&mdash;Pensions Bills such as the one we have today. The Government would then know where they were going and the recipients of pensions would have some assurance and, in a fashion, also know where they were going.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned that a pensions policy is in operation in some degree or other in many European countries.  Inflation is a world disease and no doubt other countries have come up against the same difficulties as we have been encountering since the ninth round of wage and salary increases. They, too, have had to solve this problem in some fashion.  Have we studied what other countries have done in this respect?</P>
    <P>I asked a question yesterday and the reply I got shows, as far as I can judge, that in the Minister's Department there <Col N="1306" /> is very little information available on pensions policies on the continent.  If that is so, it is time the Government did a little homework and found out how other countries deal with their pension questions.  It would be simple for the Government, if they are unable to do it themselves, to refer the question to the Economic Research Institute who would, I feel sure, gladly provide them in a month or two with all the necessary data on pensions policies obtaining elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I would make that suggestion to the Minister.  Meanwhile, we have to make do with this type of <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement, be it good, bad or indifferent.  I realise the Minister has not got an endless purse, that he must think of Budget day.  I cannot ask him now what concessions he will give to the farming community who cannot get pensions and yet who must bear the full rigours of inflation.  All we can do is welcome the relief given in this Bill and hope the Minister will address himself to some more rational approach to the entire problem, some automatic system which would obviate the necessity for this type of perennial legislation.</P>

      <P>Listening to the last speaker, I really could not tell whether he was in favour of the increased pensions or not.  The situation in which pensioners can get increases depends on the prosperity of the nation.  Thank God, the economics of the country have improved considerably, enabling the Minister for Finance to increase pensions accordingly.  I welcome this Bill because it does what we all believe should be done&mdash;betters the lot of sections who need improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer to the suggestion that we should embark on a pensions policy similar to that used in some other country, and would suggest that the pattern obtaining in another country might not at all suit us here.  The economic policy we have adopted during the past five years has succeeded in uplifting our people generally. As a result, the Minister is now able to bring in a Bill increasing pensions. Each section of our people is <Col N="1307" /> anxious to get a little more in order to provide better facilities for sustenance. One section to which I should like to refer are the railway pensioners, quite a number of whom have passed on.  There are still a number trying to exist on very small pensions. A Commission has been appointed and I do not wish to embarrass the Minister, pending the report of that commission. I should like to congratulate the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A proposal to increase pensions for the various types of people covered by this Bill is a very welcome measure and very desirable in present circumstances.  If the Minister and the Government have embarked on a policy of ruthlessly and deliberately increasing the cost of living, it is natural that pensioners generally will be very seriously affected.</P>
      <P>I make special reference to one section of pensioners, the widows of deceased members of the Garda, whose pensions I consider are miserably low. I have long felt that the Government should seriously consider the whole question of pensions for widows of Garda members, bearing in mind that the Garda Síochána are responsible for law and order and for the protection of life and property.  Many of them lost their lives in the discharge of their duties.  We have a number of widows in receipt of pensions whose husbands died in the performance of their duties.  We also have cases of Gardaí who were killed by a accident while on duty.  The rate of pension paid in such cases is miserably low and certainly does not enable the widows to live up to the standard to which they were accustomed in the lifetime of their husbands.  A Garda's widow is expected to live up to a high standard.  She must educate her children properly and that is no simple task at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> Therefore, I ask the Minister and, through him, the Government, to ensure that whatever provision is being made in the future in this matter of pensions, special sympathetic consideration should be given above all others to widows of the men who served this country so well, who have been custodians of law and order and who risked their lives in a number of cases carrying out their duties of safeguarding life and property.</P>
    <P>The pensions that have been paid to the Gardaí themselves, I feel, could have been increased from the beginning. Some Garda pensioners are receiving very low rates of pension. Since a special case can be made for such people, the Minister should arrange to pay higher rates to Gardaí who retired on reaching the age limit or otherwise.  When it was established, the Force had a very difficult task and for that reason I feel the Minister can present the Government with a set of very special circumstances regarding Garda pensioners.  It is regrettable that a number of them retired before the rates of pay reached the present level and as pensions were based on the rate of pay they received at the time of retirement, many of them get very small pensions in comparison with what Gardaí will now get on retirement.  In view of the limited number of these people, I think the rates for those who retired some years back should be brought up to the same level as would be applicable if they were retiring at present.  A very strong case can be made for special attention for Garda pensioners.</P>
    <P>The large number of retired civil servants has been very seriously handicapped by the ever-increasing cost of living.  Whatever chance organised employees have, those in trade unions and so on, retired civil servants depend on their pensions, and are unorganised. They remind me very much of the present plight of the farmers.  They got no increase but were expected to meet every increase in the cost of living. Some of those people have very limited fixed incomes and are very seriously hit by the continuing increase in the cost of living.  The Minister should be <Col N="1309" /> very sympathetic to their genuine claims and the reasonable appeals they have made for a very substantial increase in their pensions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke rightly referred to the CIE pensioners.  The Minister for Finance should be reminded of this matter.  CIE pensioners are not covered by this Bill but we shall have an opportunity again of asking the Minister to do something about the very low rate of pensions they are paid.</P>
    <P>I am glad that local authorities will be empowered to increase the pensions of retired local officials.  This is most desirable because many local authorities have numbers of pensioners on their lists, gangers, overseers, nurses, dispensary doctors, those associated with engineering staffs and others who, like retired civil servants, have to bear the brunt of increases in the cost of living, in the price of bread and flour and every commodity they must buy. At the same time, they must meet substantial increases in rates on their houses and other increased costs that have become the order of the day in the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>The amounts by which pensions will be increased under this Bill are, I think, still insufficient to afford a very great improvement in the pensioners' standard of living.  I am sorry the Government in the past turned a blind eye and a deaf ear to reasonable appeals made by pensioners.  It is high time to have a general review of the position and bring all our pensioners, especially those with no organisation or trade union to fight their case&mdash;and those are the people most seriously affected&mdash;up to a reasonable level. Very often these people make no protest and are prepared to suffer on, exercising greater economy in their homes.  The Minister must be aware of the very special circumstances associated with the genuine pension claims of such people.</P>
    <P>This Bill certainly goes some way towards alleviating some of the distress on the doorstep of many pensioners but if the Minister were serious in speaking of the great period of prosperity in which he says we now are, then the time must have arrived when we should be able to have a <Col N="1310" /> general and substantial improvement in pensions.</P>
    <P>I conclude by asking the Minister, having given special attention to the types of pensioners to whom I have referred, to bear in mind that there are special claims to be made for retired national teachers.  Retired national teachers are a very special section of the pensioned community.  They have given very good service to the country. The national school has been looked upon as the university of the poor.  In recognition of the valuable contribution retired national teachers have made to the country, their pensions should be greatly increased.  I make that plea on their behalf.  I hope the Minister will bear in mind the special urgency associated with substantially increasing the rates of pensions of retired pensioners.</P>

      <P>Serious consideration should be given to the Garda who were unfortunate enough to be borderline cases when the generous increase was given to members of the Force.  It is very disheartening to those men who joined in 1923 and 1924 that their age prevented them from remaining in the force until brighter days came along.  They were the men who went through hard times to build up a good police force, and see that law and order were maintained, at a time when it was very hard to do so.  Many of them retired a matter of a few weeks before the increase was given, and lost their increased pension and increased gratuity by a matter of days.  I seriously ask the Minister to include as many of them as he possibly can.  The Garda are not like other people. There was a time when a man would be removed from the Force if it were known that he had made any attempt to supplement his income by earning a few pounds.  It happened recently in Dublin that a young Garda was pulled simply because he tried to supplement his income by earning a few pounds. I have met ex-civil servants and ex-CID men, and it is disheartening for them that their pensions give them so little on which to enjoy life.  It is mere existence for the retired man and his wife.  That is too bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> Local authority employees, county council gangers, county council supervisors, and so on, are looking forward to money being provided to give them pensions.  In County Leitrim today, there are three men who are about to be retired.  Those are the men who maintained the roads of the county when it was very hard to do so.  Today we have good roads and we have only a limited number of gravelled roads. The task of maintaining the roads is not anything like it was in the past.  The sooner the Minister makes provision for those people the better.  Those three men are getting old, and they are going out now without any provision being made for them in their old age.  They worked for about £1 a week before wages moved in a worthwhile way.  We all hope to see our county council employees, from the road worker right up to the top employee, enjoying a pension which will leave them comfortably off in their old age.</P>
    <P>There are borderline cases among the teachers, too.  Some of them missed the increase by a matter of months, weeks or days.  I ask the Minister sympathetically to consider all borderline cases, and to make the pensions retrospective so that the most deserving cases will be included.</P>

    <P>Deputy Sweetman said pensioners are the first to be hit by a reduction in the value of money, which is quite true.  A reduction in the value of money is hard on any person living on what might be regarded as a fixed income. Therefore it is hard on pensioners when their pensions remained at a fixed level.  Deputy Sweetman also said that in certain countries they have tried to remedy this position by increasing pensions <i>pari passu</i> with the cost of living.  Another Deputy spoke of European countries increasing pensions <i>pari passu</i> with the increases in <Col N="1312" /> salaries of the civil servants.  I have been trying to get information on that, and I find it very hard to get any reliable information on what any country is doing.  I am afraid no country has an out and out system of saying: &ldquo;We will increase pensions exactly as the cost of living goes up,&rdquo; or &ldquo;We will increase pensions exactly as the salaries of the civil servants increase.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Attempts have been made to meet the situation in a partial way, much the same as we have been doing here. Perhaps some have gone further than we have gone, but I think it would be true to say also that some have not gone as far.  We must keep in mind that the whole concept of increasing pensions is of rather recent origin.  The first increase in pensions was given in 1949, only 15 years ago.  In the Civil Service, or in the State generally, we take longer to develop a proper pattern of things than can be worked out over a period of 15 years.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in my introductory speech, in the early increases we gave from 1949 to 1956, and to 1959 indeed, a bigger increase was given to lower paid people than to higher paid people and, of course, that increase going back over some years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>A bigger proportionate increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  In the last two increases dealt with in this Bill, there was a departure from that, and there is a system, if you like, of bringing them into relation with the retiring salaries of the times.  First, we brought them up to before 1959, and on the last occasion, to the end of 1959.  That brought them to the level civil servants had reached after the seventh round of increases in pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been thinking over this problem. Having brought State servants generally up to that level, we have to make up our minds what we will do in the future.  It all depends, I need not say, on whether money is available, but supposing we had the money available, what should we do?  I think that if we were able to say today, in the case of pensioners, that we would as circumstances arise increase their present pensions by some figure related <Col N="1313" /> to the increased cost of living, we would have done as much as could be expected of the State for them.  In other words, if a pensioner is retiring on a certain pension and if he is told: &ldquo;Well, as far as possible we shall keep that pension up to the cost of living. We may lag behind by five or seven per cent for a couple of years but we shall keep some relation to the cost of living&rdquo;, I think that would be as much as any pensioner could expect from the State and it would be a fair enough proposition.</P>
    <P>I have often mentioned here before, especially in talking about State salaries and wages, that we have to have regard to what employers outside can afford.  In this particular case we should have regard to that, too.  It is all very fine for the State to come in and vote money to increase the pensions of existing pensioners but I cannot see how employers outside can do the same.  We must remember that the bigger employers outside have built up a pensions scheme by putting so much into the pensions fund&mdash;so much is deducted from the employee and so much is put in by the employer himself&mdash;and that fund will actuarially be sound on the grant of a certain pension. But now these funds will no longer be sound if it is expected that they should increase the pension of those who have already gone out.  In fact, it would be difficult for them to keep their funds sound by giving increased pensions to those going out in the future, not to speak of those who have gone out in the past.  I do not know how employers will get over that difficulty which is there.  We shall have to keep in mind, with State pensioners, that that difficulty is there for everybody else, whatever about the State itself, and we have to have sympathy, as it were, for these employers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman asked why it was that in certain cases we paid these pensions on the authority of the Dáil giving us a Supplementary Estimate.  I believe that legally, or perhaps more in practice than in law, it has been customary to pay out on the authority of a Supplementary Estimate.  That is, I believe, all right as far as voted services are concerned, but I am told that <Col N="1314" /> in the case of pensions on the Central Fund, it is a different matter and requires legislation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello said that the pension of a civil servant was regarded as deferred pay and that, on that basis, increases should be given <i>pari passu</i> with the increased pay of serving officers.  I have been told that the old legal theory of pensionable service was that it was an act of grace; that there was no right whatever to it by law and that it was just given as an act of grace.  I do not know if even a civil servant at the moment has a legal right to a pension.  Certainly, no legislation, as far as I know, was passed to give them the legal right to a pension.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello also spoke about injustices to a pensioner retiring, say, in 1962 and having, say, £120 less than his colleague who is retiring now. That is an anomaly.  I do not know whether or not one would call it an injustice.  At least, the man got what he was promised and was entitled to when leaving the service at that time. We cannot be accused of being entirely hardhearted in this matter, considering that we have increased our expenditure on pensions over the past two years by £1.1 million, which is a fair amount out of a total of £8.4 million.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish spoke of the delay in paying pensions.  I think there were some delays with the local authorities. Under this Bill, the local authorities have authority by regulation to pay pensions.  Some of them, I think, were rather doubtful about their legal <Col N="1315" /> authority to pay, pending the passage of this Bill.  Most of them did pay and I am not sure that all did not come up to scratch in the end but I know there was some delay for some time.  There will be no further delay when this Bill passes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave spoke of the practice in a number of European countries to which I have referred and went on to say that the pensioners and those on fixed incomes generally got no benefits, as the Social Welfare people did, in order to cover their increased costs under the turnover tax. That is not true because in last year's Budget one of the measures which I mentioned was an increase in State pensions in order to cover those pensioners against the increase in the turnover tax.  As a matter of fact, the average increase in pensions in 1963 was about four per cent and the average increase in the cost of living we find from the mid-August figure, which was the one before the turnover tax came into operation, and the mid-February figure was about three per cent so that they have been covered as far as that is concerned.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Cosgrave also said he felt we should have a better scheme of pensions for the widows of civil servants.  My colleague, Deputy Sweetman, brought in an Act in 1956 which gave a civil servant the right to opt to have his own pension reduced but provision being made for his widow if he should pre-decease her. It has not been adopted by very many people, unfortunately.  I do not see, at the same time, why I should be expected to look after these widows when the husbands themselves are not doing it, as they are not, under the 1956 Act.</P>
    <P>It should also be mentioned, perhaps, that where a civil servant dies leaving a fairly young widow, if he and she were drawing children's allowances, these children's allowances continue so long as the children remain within the age limit under which these allowances are payable.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barry showed his sympathy for me in my dilemma of finding the money but, after showing his sympathy, he went on to say I ought to do all I possibly could for these pensioners.  Deputy Hogan joined with Deputy Barry in talking about inflation at the moment and the difficulties created for pensioners because of that.  Deputy Hogan said he asked me a question as to what would be the cost of bringing all State servants up to the level of those retiring now and that I said I could not give him the information.  Of course, I could not give accurate information. To do so, one would have to go back over each pensioner.  There are so many different grades and so many different rates of pay, and so on, that there is just no general way of making such a calculation.  One could not even do it with a computer because it would take months to feed the computer with the various data.  I could not, therefore, give an answer to the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Deputy could himself make a rough calculation when I tell him there was an eighth round increase of from 14 to 16 per cent and a ninth round increase of 12 per cent.  That makes about 27 per cent in all.  That will give some idea of what the cost would be because, roughly, if a civil <Col N="1317" /> servant retires with 12 per cent more, and he has full service, he gets half his salary by way of pension, and the pension, of course, would have to be increased by 12 per cent to bring it into parity.  Those are the figures on which to make the calculation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked what would be the cost of bringing pensions up on a cost of living basis.  The cost of living has increased by about 14 per cent since pensions were increased to the 1959 level.  From 1959 then to the present time, the cost of living is about 14 per cent up.  It must be remembered, however, that those who retired last year and those who retire this year would not need the same lift as those who retired four or five years ago.  I mention this data to give Deputies an opportunity of making some shot at this calculation for themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan talked about the Garda.  Why, I do not know.  They have not been any worse treated than anyone else.  I think, perhaps, they make a bit more propaganda about their case.  Possibly that is what has impressed Deputy Flanagan.  The pensions in their case have been brought up to the 1959 level, too, and the widow of a Garda gets a pension. That does not apply in the case of other State servants.  Another point is that if a Garda serves 30 years, he gets a full pension.  Other State servants must serve 40 years to qualify for full pension.  I am not finding fault, of course, with the good treatment the Garda get, but I would like to assure Deputy Flanagan and others that the Garda have been justly treated as compared with civil servants, teachers, and others.  They have got everything to which they could legitimately claim they were entitled from the point of view of pension.</P>
    <P>Deputy McLaughlin made a plea on behalf of hard cases.  Of course, hard cases occur.  That is inevitable.  It cannot be avoided.  A man is due to retire on a certain day and goes out. There is a 12 per cent rise and a colleague, who retires a week later, gets a higher pension because of that increase. No matter what one does, there will always be this division.  It is just as equitable to draw the line on the <Col N="1318" /> day the increase is given as it is on any other date.  I do not see any way out of the difficulty.  With a good system of gradual improvement, either from the point of view of parity or on a cost-of-living basis, the gap may be narrowed.  Indeed, as things are, pensions after a year or two tend to get closer together.  That seems to be the best we can do at the moment.</P>

      <P>I doubt if this section really needs explanation.  It speaks for itself.  It is proposed by this section to confirm that the Lay Commissioners, when hearing cases, can summon witnesses. It is also designed to provide machinery through which they can punish offenders for non-attendance on their <i>sub-poena.</i> Since the adoption of the Constitution, doubts have been expressed as to whether the Lay Commissioners, as a quasi-judicial body, have full powers to summon witnesses to attend before them.  The main difficulty is that any power is useless, unless it is linked with power to punish those who disobey.  That power is normally reserved to our courts under the Constitution.  In relation to acquisition and similar proceedings, there is naturally no difficulty about attendance of owner witnesses or Land Commission officials, but it could happen that it would be necessary to call in third <Col N="1319" /> parties, such as persons with special local and technical knowledge, who might not be willing to give evidence. It is for the purpose of removing doubts about the powers of the Land Court to summon witnesses that this section has been introduced.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to explain whether from now on it is the Lay Commissioners who will administer the oath to such witnesses.  It is true to say that heretofore the registrar to the Lay Commissioners could administer the oath.  The registrar is present at the hearings which take place before the Lay Commissioners and surely if the registrar is present at these hearings it should be possible for him to administer the oath.  I see that under the section it is the Lay Commissioners who are empowered to administer the oath and I would like the Minister to give a little more information as to whether it is now the Lay Commissioners who are to administer the oath and if the registrar is not now to have power to do so.

      <P>The Minister would be well advised to clarify the position as it is at the moment.  Will he tell us why he has found it necessary to bring in the section?  What has arisen in the working of the Land Commission which brought about the drafting of this section?  I understand that at present the Commissioners have power to summon witnesses and take evidence on oath and that if there is a question <Col N="1320" /> of doubt with regard to prejury there are certain steps open to the Commissioners to take.  If the Minister has discovered that there are loopholes as far as witnesses are concerned and if this section is being brought in to close those loopholes it is welcome.  However, I do not think there is any use in pretending that we are going to equate this court in importance with the High Court by amending the legislation along the lines contemplated in section 8.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether this is the proper place to question the Minister on the right of appeal by the Land Commission inspection staff against decisions of the Commissioners.  It may seem extraordinary that I should ask the Minister a question like that but the fact is that when the Land Commission take steps to acquire a farm they do not take those steps lightly. They examine the position in the locality, the size of the holdings in the locality, the need for division and when they come before the Lay Commissioners they are well armed with regard to the situation.  I would like that the Lay Commissioners should be empowered to cross-examine, under oath if necessary, the various witnesses who are there as objectors to the activities of the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>I do not want to mention particular cases in the discussion on this Bill but I am afraid that the tightening up that is proposed to be done under it will not in itself be sufficient to bring about the necessary improvement in the acquisition section.  I would like the Minister to give an example of what omissions there were in the previous legislation and how this section proposes to repair the omissions that have come to the notice of the Department.</P>

      <P>This is an addition to any other power that may already have been vested in the registrar to the Lay Commissioners to administer oaths.  The registrar, by direction of the Commissioners, can administer the oath at any time.  There is no intention to change the practice.  There have been doubts expressed by constitutional lawyers as to the power of this particular court to inflict punishment <i>in terrorem</i> on witnesses who <Col N="1321" /> have failed to attend.  Some suggested that it is only the High Court that has such power.  While this matter has never been challenged and issue has never been taken, it was felt that we should take the opportunity to clarify the position and ensure that where a <i>subpoena</i> is issued by the Land Commission and a witness does not appear, there is a procedure whereby that witness can be punished.  The effect of this section is to remove these doubts, although the matter has never arisen in practice.</P>

      <P>Would a person whose lands were being acquired and who did not enter an objection be a witness? While the Land Commission court has to have certain powers with which I would agree, I would not like to see a position arising where a person whose land was being taken might find himself being jockeyed into the position of being a criminal.  Is there any danger of that arising?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  As far as the objector is concerned, as far as my knowledge goes, it is a question for himself whether he gives evidence or not.  If an objector considers it is better tactics not to go into the witness box, he is at liberty to stay outside it.  There is not the same power in this court and there is not the same practice that a witness can be called by virtue of the fact of his presence in the precincts of the court in the manner in which he can be <Col N="1322" /> called in a criminal court or by a district justice in his court.  In this situation, it is for the objector to give evidence or not as he deems fit.  The whole purpose of this section is completely different from what Deputy Blowick has in mind.  It is designed to compel the attendance of a witness.</P>

      <P>This section is put in for the purpose of removing certain doubts that have been expressed in some quarters.  It is to confirm that local authorities have the power to make cash contributions towards the cost of works undertaken by the Land Commission and from which the local authorities benefit.  The Department of Local Government did express some doubt as to whether, in accordance with the letter of the law, it is lawful for local authorities to make payments of this kind.  For instance, in the case of works on embankments, bridges or culverts undertaken by the Land Commission and which might incidentally benefit other people in an area, agreement might be reached between the Land Commission and the local authority that the local authority would contribute something towards work of this kind.  I want to emphasise that this is purely a voluntary business. The local authority might think it good business to get together with the Land Commission to do some job of public utility.  It is to remove doubts expressed by the Department of Local Government on the legality of such propositions that this section is here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would go a little further, if possible and tell us what kind of <Col N="1323" /> doubts have arisen in this matter and if the Department of Local Government auditors have queried the powers of the local authority to make payments. The Land Commission must be very much alive to any objections that have been made by local government auditors against the payment of such contributions by local authorities. Perhaps the Minister could tell us what has been the total of such payments in any of the past five years which were made by local authorities to the Land Commission.  I am sure the Land Commission keep up-to-date records of such works and particularly of such payments.</P>
      <P>I am not at all satisfied that the Minister has given the House a very clear explanation on this section.  He should enlighten us a little more as to the nature of the doubts that have arisen.  Have the local authorities contributed towards Land Commission works in the past without legal obligation or authority to do so, and to what extent have local government auditors queried the rights and the powers of the local authorities in making these payments?  I feel sure the Minister would not take the serious step of inserting a section to regularise the matter in this Bill without having satisfied himself as to the doubts that have arisen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of any surcharge having arisen.  This is a very simple proposition.  There are certain works such as those to which I have referred, embankments, bridges, culverts or, perhaps, a bit of a road which it might be necessary for the Land Commission to construct and which would be of general utility as well as serve the interests of their own tenants.  It may well be in some of these instances the local authority should contribute something.  Indeed, it does happen that the local authorities from time to time in small matters of this kind approach the Land Commission to go ahead and are willing to join the scheme.  It is because of doubts expressed by people in the Department of Local Government about the strict legality of the local <Col N="1324" /> authority making contributions of this kind that this section was introduced. There was never any question of the matter being queried by the Auditor-General. This is a sensible section and one which I think the local authorities generally will welcome.</P>

      <P>Yes, but before we come to section 10 I want to know are we letting the cat out of the bag in section 9 and then dealing with something in section 10 in which we have handed over the powers of the Land Commission, in other words, enabling the evasion of responsibility under section 10?</P>

      <P>I am not suggesting the Minister has that intention.  I do not want him to take the view I am looking for snags in this, but if the Minister would give me an example it might be helpful.  The Explanatory Memorandum refers to &ldquo;the cost of marine embankment repairs, etc., being executed by the Land Commission&rdquo;.  Can we take it this is not an attempt to say to the local authorities at a later stage: &ldquo;You have power now to contribute.  Unless you contribute the Land Commission will not put up £X&rdquo;?  At the moment the Land Commission must bear responsibility.  Under this will they be in a position to say: &ldquo;We will not contribute <Col N="1325" /> unless you as a local authority contribute as well?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us a specific instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to give an instance of what I have in mind.  We shall say there is a rearrangement scheme and that there is a through road going to serve four Land Commission tenants who are getting houses in that scheme and that by extending that road a bit further it would serve six houses that are not in the scheme at all, a distance of a mile further.  That would be a proposition on which the local authority might come to the Land Commission and say: &ldquo;You continue this work and we will join in with you because we will be doing a good job for these other people.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Another instance I would say would be an improvement scheme on lands in the hands of the Land Commission and where they considered that in getting outfalls for drainage, a new culvert or bridge would have to be constructed and that apart from serving the few people on that estate with whom the Land Commission were concerned, it would also serve other people outside the Land Commission scheme.  That would be another instance in which the local authority might join with the Land Commission in a joint scheme.  It is that type of scheme I have in mind.  It could also happen with embankments, although we will have more about these on the next section.  There would be, I conceive, places where there would be portion of an embankment for which the Land Commission had liability and another portion in the same place where there was erosion or flooding and the local authority might say to the Land Commission: &ldquo;Come in with us on a joint scheme and it will serve other people as well as your own people.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Let me say again that this is purely a voluntary business.  It is an enabling section to enable the local authority to join with the Land Commission in suitable cases.  There is no intention of relieving, nor does it relieve, the Land Commission of any existing liability for anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1326" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the section is purely an enabling section and it could not possibly be anything else.  I am strengthened in the suspicion I expressed a few minutes ago that the Land Commission can use this as a means of evading their responsibility in regard, say, to the construction of a road.  The Minister has mentioned, for instance, the case of four houses being served by the Land Commission.  They are putting a road in a new estate and there are six houses, according to the Minister, further on somewhere which could be linked up with the other four houses. Whose responsibility should it be to link up those houses?  Surely that is the responsibility of the Land Commission. The local authority is quite willing afterwards to take over the road which the Land Commission in the first place should construct.</P>
      <P>I want this matter cleared up.  My impression of the activities of the Land Commission is that over the years they have shown the greatest neglect in regard to road construction and to drains.  If it now means that they are going to evade their responsibilities even further, I would not be in favour of giving them a way out.  This is what I can see happening under this section. The 1953 Act was also an enabling Act and it empowered any local authority to declare as a public road whatever road the local authority, in its wisdom, believed to be of public utility.  That means that if the Land Commission are servicing four houses and proceed to link up the four houses with six others in the area, the county council or local authority afterwards can declare that road a public road and maintain it and, to my mind, the local authority are doing their job properly in that regard but they should not be asked, or the local ratepayers should not be asked, to bear the burden of constructing the link road between the four new houses being built by the Land Commission and the six other houses in the locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that there is no compulsion on the local authority to make a contribution towards making that link road.  Of course there is not, because if there were, there would be <Col N="1327" /> an outcry, but the pressure can be exerted by the Land Commission and they can say to the tenants in the six houses: &ldquo;We will help with this, provided the local authority goes fifty-fifty with the Land Commission.&rdquo; Pressure will then be exerted by the tenants and they will endeavour to get the local authority to make the 50 per cent contribution towards the cost, when in fact at present the Land Commission have the responsibility of making that road.  I do not want to see that position being changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>My belief is that as it stands now the Land Commission can say to the Roscommon County Council: &ldquo;You have the authority and an enabling Act has been passed which enables you to subscribe to the making of the road between the four houses in section X and the six houses in section B and unless you are prepared to co-operate in the making of that road, the Land Commission will have no further responsibility.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I did not make myself quite clear to the Deputy.  Let me re-emphasise that this section is introduced solely for the purpose of removing doubts about whether it is strictly lawful for local authorities voluntarily to join in a scheme of mutual benefit with the Land Commission. I was dealing with the four houses and it might be better to give a clear picture and say that we have a public road south of these four houses in that small estate which I will call &ldquo;X&rdquo; village and with which the Land Commission are dealing; there is a by-road, not in good condition, running from the public road through the village of &ldquo;X&rdquo;, where the four houses are to the north of the other six houses.  There would be no liability on the Land Commission to deal with that portion of the road serving from the four houses back north to the six houses, but the county council might say to them: &ldquo;Well, if you complete this, we will take it over <Col N="1328" /> by joint effort and deal with the six to bring them on to the road servicing the four and give them a clear run to the main road.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is a joint effort of that kind that is contemplated here.  It is only for the purpose of removing any doubts that the local authority could contribute with the Land Commission to a scheme of mutual benefit to their own people and the public generally and those within the particular scheme with which the Land Commission are dealing.  That is the sole purpose of this, whatever Deputies may argue on the next section.</P>

    <P>I feel that subsections (1) and (2) of section 10 are most undesirable.  The Minister is now taking steps to place the responsibility which should be his and that of the Land Commission on to the local authorities.  It is very unreasonable. Section 10 exonerates the Minister for Lands and the Land Commission from &ldquo;any obligation to cleanse, maintain, repair or restore any works&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that to go into this in some detail will take me some time.  The fact remains that this section arises directly from paragraph 16 of the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts dated 13th June, 1957. It may shock the Deputy to know, as I suspect, that his leader, Deputy Dillon, was Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts at that time.  I quote from the Report of the Public Accounts Committee of that date:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>16.  The Land Commission failed to clean a drain bordering lands they had acquired and the owner of the adjoining lands took an action in 1952 for damages for flooding of his land due to the neglect of the Commission.  The plaintiff was successful in his action and also in a similar action taken in 1953 after the Land Commission lands had been allotted to tenants under purchase agreements.  The Accounting Officer stated that the question whether the Commission continued to be responsible for the cleaning of the drain <Col N="1330" /> although no longer in possession of the lands, had been referred to the law officers.  The Committee will be glad to be informed of their decision.</P>
    <P>On this point the Minister for Finance replied on 30th October, 1957, to the Committee of Public Accounts that legal advice on the complex issues involved had been received, which indicated that the position was not entirely free from doubt, that some aspects of it might require clarification by legislation and that the matter was under consideration by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Again, in 1958, the Committee of Public Accounts commented as follows:</P>
    <P>It is noted that the question whether the Land Commission continues to be responsible for the cleaning of drains although no longer in possession of the lands is not free from doubt, and that some aspects of it may require clarification by legislation.  The Committee wishes to be informed in due course when a final decision has been reached.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in December, 1959, stated that provisions to clarify the legal position were being prepared for inclusion in a suitable Bill in due course.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts, in paragraph 3 of their next Report of April, 1960, made the following comment:</P>
    <P>The Committee notes that it has been decided to clarify by legislation the legal position relating to the responsibility of the Land Commission for the cleaning of drains when the Land Commission is no longer in possession of the lands.</P>
    <P>At this point, it will be of interest to mention that the amount of the damages awarded against the Land Commission was very small&mdash;£25 on the first decree and £12 on the second decree, making a total of £37 in all, with additional costs and expenses of £84, being a total of £121.  That is my recollection.  This was known as the Owen Kelly's claim case and I think it arose in Deputy McQuillan's constituency. So that, financially, the <Col N="1331" /> particular case represented a small problem in itself.  Theoretically, it carries wider implications but, fortunately, no further trouble of its kind has arisen in practice up to date.</P>
    <P>As the general legal position about drains had been formally queried by the Committee of Public Accounts, it was necessary for the Land Commission to go fully into the legal position.  The Attorney General of the day advised the Land Commission. This matter had given rise at that time to many questions of legal complexity. I do not feel that at this stage it is necessary for me to take up the time of the House in a dissertation on the differences between non-feasance and misfeasance but let me say that the position with Owen Kelly's drains in principle arose and could arise in this way in other cases.  It could arise, for instance, in cases in which the Land Commission had parted with possession of the land for years, where, when they were dividing the particular estate, they carried out a drainage work and some years afterwards Pat Murphy's cow fell into that drain and Pat Murphy could come after the Land Commission, although, theoretically, because the Land Commission had parted with the lands they were not entitled to go in on his lands, which had been divided amongst all the neighbours, without committing trespass. You have what I call an impossible legal position arising.</P>
    <P>The net result of the legal examination, as reported by the law officers, was that legislation would be necessary to try to clear up this rather complicated mess.</P>
    <P>There is no question whatever of section 10 passing on liability to a local authority.  It simply makes the law clear that the Minister for Lands and the Land Commission have certain specific liabilities and no more.  In the interests of the taxpayer who would have to foot the bill it is essential to try to make the legal position as clear as possible.</P>
    <P>Section 10 broadly follows the headline of subsection (2) of section 51 of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> Nothing contained in this Act nor anything done by the Commissioners thereunder shall operate to render the Commissioners liable (save where it is proved that their officers, servants, or agents have been guilty of carelessness or neglect) for any damage which may happen to any land or other property through or by the overflowing of any river, stream, or watercourse or through or by the sudden breaking of any bank, dam, weir, sluice, or other work constructed by the Commissioners under this Act or for the maintenance of which they are responsible under this Act.</P>
    <P>In drafting section 10 of the Bill, the approach has been to give general protection to the Department from relevant litigation, with certain definite exceptions.  First, let me emphasise that the Department or the Minister for Lands will be liable where there has been legal negligence.  This is effected by the significant parenthesis &mdash;and I am quoting the section, &ldquo;(not being a negligent act or omission)&rdquo; in the protection given by clause (b) of subsection (1).</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Department will be liable where the injury is a matter of express contract.  There is no question of trying to upset existing liabilities, specifically undertaken.  On this point, the significant phrase is &ldquo;implied contract&rdquo; in the protection given in subsection (1) of section 10.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, apart from negligence and express contracts, the field of possible litigation against the Minister and the Land Commission is to be regulated according to whether the Land Commission are or are not in sole and exclusive occupation of the land on which the works are situated at the relevant time.</P>

I <Col N="1333" /> want to make it clear that apart from the negligence as set out here, if the Land Commission are negligent while the lands are in their possession, they are still liable and are also liable under express contract.  If the Land Commission are in occupation, then the Department will be legally liable.  For instance, where an estate is taken over by the Land Commission and, as sometimes happens pending the preparation of a scheme, some work has to be done and people's stock are there grazing, if the work is done negligently by the Land Commission, the Land Commission are liable.  They are also liable under contract, express or implied.</P>

      <P>When the tenant is in occupation, the tenant is liable, or will be after this section has been passed into law.  Where the Department are not legally liable, the complainant will have redress against the landowner or holders concerned in so far as they may be legally liable through the ordinary responsibilities of ownership. Therefore, there is no question of section 10 transferring liability for maintenance of works from the Land Commission to county councils.  The fact that section 10 happens to be placed after this other section which made Deputy McQuillan suspicious is purely coincidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to explain the position with regard to embankments.  Roughly speaking, I do not think this affects them one way or the other, within certain limitations which I shall give the House.  The position about embankments is that they will be all taken over by the Board of Works under the relevant provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945.  There is provision under that Act for the one authority, the Board of Works, to take <Col N="1334" /> over all these embankments in the ultimate, and they will then be the responsibility of the Board of Works. That will be the position in the future.</P>
    <P>As they proceed with drainage schemes, where such embankments are concerned, the Board of Works will take them over and the taxpayer then becomes responsible for them.  There are some cases involving embankments that broke.  When estates were originally the property of the Land Commission, certain liability attached, on the sale of those estates, for the maintenance of embankments.  In many of those cases, as far as I know, the moneys that were reserved for them were in the hands of some old trusts, the income from which would be spent on the maintenance of embankments.</P>
    <P>Those are old anachronisms as far as the practical job is concerned today, because those moneys would not be sufficient to maintain such embankments nowadays.  Theoretically, the Land Commission in some cases maintain embankments or build embankments outside the estates on the theoretical ground that where there is erosion, their investment is in danger&mdash; that the holdings in respect of which annuities are charged should be protected by the Land Commission since the more that falls into the tide, the less security there will be for the holdings. Now we are back to the principle that arose as a result of the good Owen Kelly's drain in Roscommon.</P>

      <P>There is a duty on the Department when a matter of this kind is raised, and solemnly raised at a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee and the accounting officer is directed to do something about it.  It was as a result of this matter being raised and questioned at a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee in 1957 that this matter has arisen. Having been legally examined on several occasions since, and the diverse legal implications of that decision having been considered, it was felt by the lawyers concerned that there was only one way of dealing with it, that is, to bring in a section of this kind in a suitable Bill.</P>
      <P>I feel sure that Deputies who are familiar with this type of problem will readily appreciate the queer position under legal liability that arises for the Land Commission.  There might be an estate vested in tenants from which the Land Commission had disappeared for many years; yet they might be confronted with another Owen Kelly, who, I am sure, has long ago gone to his reward, and may the green sod lie lightly upon him.  Wherever he has gone, I hope there are no drain troubles.</P>
      <P>As a result of this rather peculiar decision, it was our duty to see that the Land Commission were relieved of liability in cases where they had parted with the property.  It is only right that we should clear up this mess in cases where the Land Commission had parted with the property for many years&mdash;that they would not be held liable when in fact they had no right whatsoever to go inside the gate to abate a nuisance arising from something they did years before.  I am sorry I had to go into so much history, but that is the real purpose of the section.</P>

      <P>Apart from the section being a permanent memorial to the late Owen Kelly, I think it is something which is being put into <Col N="1336" /> legislation now which calls for closer examination.  Everybody knows that when an estate is being divided, the Land Commission are responsible for the division, for the proper fencing of the estate, for proper road-making and drainage.  If public money is spent on fencing and road-making, making embankments and on a comprehensive drainage scheme, it means considerable expense to the taxpayers and one would imagine that when the Land Commission carry out such work they would assume responsibility for its maintenance.  When they allot the lands they fix a suitable rent to be paid by the allottee and he pays that rent while in possession.  Naturally, the Commission should be responsible for the road they have made into the estate leading to their houses.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made one reference to drainage.  He said that under the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act it is intended that all minor drainage schemes will eventually come within the scope of the Board of Works and that the Board will be responsible for all drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Embankments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Embankments. If the Board of Works are to be responsible for them and if it takes them as long to assume responsibility in that case as it does to carry out the obligations they have under the Arterial Drainage Act where they consider very extensive drainage schemes for many years, it is not very encouraging.  It is well known that the Land Commission have responsibility in respect of many watercourses, when they make new watercourses or initiate new drainage schemes or open a new drain.  Surely, if they open a drain they do not expect a smallholder occupying the land to maintain it himself?  What happens if the drainage of a townland is undertaken by the Land Commission in the first instance and it serves four or five local landowners and one or two of them for any reason are not in a position to do their part of the drainage work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the land project has been responsible for carrying out wisely some very extensive drainage schemes and the Local Authorities (Works) Act <Col N="1337" /> is no longer in existence&mdash;thanks to the Minister and his colleagues&mdash;I feel the Minister is relieving himself and the Land Commission of responsibility for the maintenance and repair of natural or artificial watercourses.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act was responsible for carrying out the very type of scheme which would be of great importance to the type of people with which this section deals.  I think this relief of responsibility is a very bad provision because what is everybody's business is nobody's and there is no use in the Land Commission shedding responsibility unless it is put on somebody else.  Vast sums of public money are being spent on embankments, drainage and road making and, on the passing of this section, unless the Minister accepts the amendments I have moved, money which has already been spent on these amenities for tenants will be completely wasted.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister has an obligation to say on whom responsibility will rest.  I understand from him it will now rest on the person in occupation of the land and the moment the Land Commission allot the holding that will end their responsibility and it will not matter if we have a recurrence of the case of the late Owen Kelly and the cow in the drain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this will result in greater expense which the tenant or the local authority will be unable to bear.  It is difficult to get local authorities to do what they are supposed to do on scheduled roads and in regard to drainage beside main and county roads without saddling them with responsibility for drainage of concern to landowners.  It might be possible to make a case if the Minister would contact the Minister for Local Government and advocate the immediate restoration of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>

      <P>I do not.  That is why I am speaking on it.  I look to <Col N="1338" /> the wisdom and intelligence of the Minister to enlighten me and I am waiting to be advised by him.  I want to know who will be responsible for maintenance of works undertaken by the Land Commission when this section is passed, unless my amendments are accepted.  All that concerns the Minister and the Land Commission, apparently, is to shift responsibility from themselves: they do not care where it falls.  They will never have a recurrence of the Owen Kelly cow case.  It is all very fine to quote extracts from the proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts but the tenants do not care a thraneen about that and are concerned only about who is responsible for the embankment and its maintenance and for the Land Commission road.</P>
      <P>Is it not reasonable to expect that if the Land Commission construct a new road a certain sum will be provided annually for its maintenance?</P>

      <P>Of course, for all time.  What is wrong with that, particularly in the case of drainage, because if the Minister waits until very small drainage works on Land Commission watercourses are carried out by the Office of Public Works, he will wait a considerable time?  There is no use in saying the tenant will be responsible because, to my knowledge, most allottees will not be in a position to maintain roads.  They cannot do it at present. The Minister knows from his experience the big difficulty there is, in his constituency I am sure as well as everywhere else, in getting people together&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to avail of the generous provisions of the rural improvement schemes.  I know that in my constituency there is considerable difficulty in getting the contributions necessary.  When there is such great difficulty in getting people to contribute under the rural improvement <Col N="1339" /> schemes when the Department give generous grants, how on earth can they be got together to give money out of their own pockets to carry out works from which there will be no financial return for anyone&mdash;the Office of Public Works, the Land Commission, the county councils or anyone else.</P>
      <P>This is very important, because whatever difficulties have cropped up in the past, similar difficulties are likely to crop up in the future.  The Land Commission will not care because their responsibility will be over on the passing of this section. The Minister has quoted from the report of the Public Accounts Committee, and he has given the result of the legal proceedings which were instituted in the Roscommon case.  The Land Commission lost.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he has gone to his reward, that he is dead and prayed for.  Deputy Blowick says Owen Kelly is alive.  We are very pleased to hear that.  That is more encouraging news than the Minister had for us.  However, the Land Commission and the courts have gone fully into the case.  It cost the Land Commission a considerable amount of money in legal and other expenses. Would it not have been better if the Land Commission had accepted that responsibility in the first instance, without contesting the matter in the courts, when they knew&mdash;surely their legal advisers could have informed them&mdash;they had responsibility in that case?  This section will relieve any doubts that may exist as to responsibility. That is why I feel it is not right, and why I feel these two subsections should be deleted.  They will cause considerable inconvenience. Once the Land Commission carry out <Col N="1340" /> any works to improve a holding, and continue to take rent and impose an annuity on the landowner, they should be responsible for the maintenance of those works.  I think the Minister is very unwise in this matter.  I make a very serious appeal to him, in the light of the difficulties that are likely to arise, to agree to the deletion of the two subsections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is too prone to take what Deputy Blowick says as gospel.  Time and again in this House Ministers of different Governments have made it clear that the Land Commission are not a road maintenance or a drainage maintenance authority.  The same principle has been announced for river embankments, with the specific exceptions I have mentioned, such as trusts under which explicit responsibility is given. The same general policy has always operated in respect of other Land Commission works.  Each improvement work has to be performed adequately and subsequently maintained, but the primary responsibility is that of the landowner concerned.  The task of maintenance can be taken over from the landowner as is done by the Board of Works in respect of embankments and drains, and by the county council <Col N="1341" /> in respect of roads.  That has been done from time to time, but for the rest, the responsibility for the maintenance of ordinary drainage works going through land is the responsibility of the owner, and always has been so. That is the law of the land.</P>
      <P>One would imagine from Deputy Flanagan's remarks that this was a terrible imposition on the owners of property, owners who get land, or additions to their land, rearranged by the Land Commission to which, incidentally, the taxpayers contribute a very substantial sum.  Generally speaking, the cost of the improvement works in this case is a very heavy item indeed, and half the cost is paid, generally speaking, by the taxpayers.</P>
      <P>Anyone who suggests that simply because the Land Commission divided an estate or made all these improvements, they should be held liable for all time for the maintenance of the improvement works is reaching the height of absurdity, and that is what Deputy Flanagan is arguing.  It is because of the legal decision to which I have referred when the Land Commission were held liable&mdash;although they had left the place years before&mdash; for flooding as a result of alleged neglect of a drain, or failing to maintain a drain going through land in respect of which they had not even a legal right of entry, that this section is here.  We want to clear up that absurd legal situation.</P>
      <P>I do not think anyone in his senses would suggest that the Land Commission should be responsible for all time for the maintenance of, for instance, fencing around farms.  One might as well suggest that the Land Commission should till land they got for farmers. The section arises in the way I have described as a result of the rather peculiar legal decision, and it is to get rid of the potential liability that arises from the legal implication of that decision that the section is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to what he described as a peculiar decision.  It is a unique case of an individual winning an action against the Land Commission whose responsibility it was to prevent flooding. <Col N="1342" /> This case took place some years ago, and there were no disastrous results so far as the Land Commission were concerned.  I have heard of no descents on the law courts by anxious tenants to test out their cases as a result of the famous victory of Owen Kelly.  In spite of the fact that there have been very few cases of a similar nature&mdash;I do not know of any; perhaps there have been none&mdash;we have a very long section included in the Bill to prevent a recurrence of Owen Kelly's case.</P>
      <P>I can only describe this as I have already described it&mdash;as using a sledge hammer to lay out a midge.  It is much more serious than that.  The Land Commission are using poor Owen Kelly as a scapegoat in this instance.  They are out now to utilise that case to give them an opportunity to strengthen the powers they have to enable them in the future to shelve their responsibilities at an earlier stage.  Every Deputy will agree that the Land Commission are noted over the years for the speed with which they shelve their responsibilities to tenants with regard to the making of roads, the repair of them, the making of drains, and so forth.  I can speak with experience of my constituency. There is nothing but dissatisfaction amongst the tenants down through the years.  Quite a considerable amount of land division took place in my constituency over the years.  Today, the local authority&mdash;the county council&mdash;have a terrible legacy as a result, first of all, of badly made roads.</P>
      <P>When I say I believe that the Land Commission for the ha'port of tar spoiled the job and left the roads unfinished, I mean that they got out as fast as they could.  The minute they got the tenants to sign an acceptance of their holdings, that was the end of it as far as the Land Commission were concerned. I think that was wrong.  They still have these powers.  I do not see why this House should add to these powers to enable the Land Commission to say: &ldquo;We are finished.  We have nothing more to do with your area.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows that in my constituency there is an estate named <Col N="1343" /> Moate Park which is a tourist attraction. People come to see that locality. It is a beautiful area.  The Land Commission divided that farm of land in the past few years.  The roads in that estate were in good condition prior to the Land Commission's arriving on the spot.  Today, the roads on that estate are almost impassable.  There are huge pot-holes on the roads.  Vehicles of all sorts have to skirt the road and use the side of the road to pass: it is absolutely scandalous.  The local authority, I hope, have got the Land Commission before they got time to get out.  My latest information is that the Land Commission had agreed to investigate at this stage the possibility of putting those roads into a reasonable state of repair before the local authority would take them over.  I am afraid that if section 10 were now in operation the roads in that estate would be left as they are today and the local authority would be saddled with the responsibility of providing whatever moneys might be necessary to put those roads into the state of repair in which the Land Commission should leave them.  Does anybody think it is right for this House to allow the Land Commission to evade their responsibilities further in that regard?</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Flanagan meant to convey that the Land Commission should be responsible for all time for the maintenance of roads.  I do not subscribe to that view.  I believe the Land Commission should put the roads into a state of repair that will meet with a certificate of approval from the county surveyor of the local authority.  If the technical expert of a local authority is prepared to certify to the county council that he has found a road to be in a suitable condition as a result of the Land Commission's activities, I think that at that stage a local authority should accept their responsibility and take over the road then and declare it to be a public road.  It would be wrong to try to saddle the local authority with the taking over of that road until it is put into a state of repair that should be the responsibility of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>We have this position in most counties <Col N="1344" /> that the Land Commission finish their work&mdash;roads, drainage, and so on&mdash;and move out.  I shall not deal with the drains at this stage.  I shall deal with the roads.  As Deputy Flanagan said, what is everybody's business is nobody's business.  The result is that when the Land Commission move out the road is there.  The local authority are not notified by the Land Commission that they have finished in the area and that the road is in good shape.  I have never known local authority officials anxious to find fresh roads to take over.  One has to lead the horse to the well.  Officials are not anxious for further work as far as roads are concerned.  They will not go to the Land Commission and ask: &ldquo;Are you finished with that estate yet?  We are very anxious to take over that road.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Land Commission do not even say to the local authority: &ldquo;We are about to finish here within the next three months and we shall have this road in a good state of repair.  Will you move in now so that there will be no hitch in the maintenance?&rdquo; There is a difficulty there that must be solved and it will not be helped by section 10.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to comment a little further on that issue.  The law is clear enough as to the way the Land Commission can evade their responsibilities. They know themselves exactly how far they must go and how far they may be responsible afterwards. There is no good at this stage in bringing in a new section to make the position still worse as far as the tenants and the local authority are concerned. There would be more co-operation all round if the Minister said he is prepared to see that that co-operation to which I have referred is brought about rather than to bring in a section which will give the Land Commission an opportunity of saying to the local authority: &ldquo;We quote you section 10. We are finished with you here.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It might seem, as the Minister has suggested, that when the Land Commission hand over a farm, a house, buildings and amenities of various kinds to a farmer it would be <Col N="1345" /> the height of absurdity, to use his own words, if the Land Commission were saddled with the responsibility of maintaining these things <i>in saecula saeculorum.</i> Nevertheless there are certain amenities which of their very nature and importance, and primarily by reason of their cost, it would seem to be outside the ability of many farmers to maintain and to provide for in after years.  In the absence of any State aid or specific grants towards the maintenance of drainage, roads, water supplies, and so on, it is only reasonable that the Land Commission would accept responsibility in these specific matters.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the lack of regard on the part of the Land Commission in respect of the handing over of farmhouses, outhouses, and the provision of amenities to which I have referred.  In many instances, the Land Commission are niggardly in their approach and would seem to be almost guilty of dereliction of duty in relation to this matter.  I have known many farmers who were allotted land, houses and outoffices, who refused to occupy farmsteads because of the state of dereliction in which they were left by the Land Commission.  The normal, decent amenities were not provided. Fireplaces were not provided; cement floors in kitchens were not provided; a proper access to the farmhouses was not provided.  The outoffices were derelict.</P>
      <P>Farmers, in the circumstances I mention, should have some redress against the Land Commission.  To whom can a farmer appeal in these circumstances if the Land Commission fail in their duty in the first instance? What redress has a farmer if a decent house is not provided, if adequate repairs are not carried out to outoffices, if proper boundary fences are not erected, if a decent access path is not made to the homestead?  It would appear that the Land Commission under this section are taking power virtually to foist on the farmer whatever they think desirable, while they opt out of any legal responsibility. That is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to roads, the road <Col N="1346" /> should be up to the standard stipulated by the county engineer.  It should be brought up to the minimum standard required as to width, durability, and so on.  It is not good enough to provide a mere gravel pathway for a community of Land Commission tenants and expect the local authority then to take that road in charge.  It is not good enough to provide water and other amenities unless the Land Commission also take reasonable steps to maintain these amenities.  Some of these amenities are very costly and the average farmer could not possibly maintain the amenities on his own. Unless the Minister can indicate what State aid will be available to maintain these, providing them is a waste of money.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this section.  I appeal to him to give the House an assurance that houses, outoffices and amenities of a certain standard will be provided.  If they are not up to the required standard, then I suggest the tenants should have a right of appeal.  An arbitrator should be appointed, competent to decide whether or not a house is properly repaired.  That is done in the case of cottages which are being vested.  If a tenant is not satisfied with the repairs carried out, he has the right of appeal to the Minister for Local Government and the Minister will send a neutral engineer to determine whether or not the cottage has been adequately repaired. If he decides it is not repaired to his satisfaction, he makes a recommendation and the local authority must carry out the additional repairs stipulated. There is no such redress under this Bill for the Land Commission tenant.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that it would be absurd to spoonfeed people and maintain forever boundary fences and do the ordinary repairs that one normally expects the tenant himself to carry out.  The Minister is quite right in that, but there are more important amenities being provided by him and, if he allows these amenities to become derelict because of inability on the part of the tenant to maintain them, then it will be so much money wasted.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister has misunderstood slightly the opinion I expressed.  I certainly do not advocate that the Land Commission should be responsible <i>in saecula saeculorum</i> for the maintenance of all fences, drainage, embankments and repairs to Land Commission houses.  The Minister said that, if that were to be done, then one might as well till the ground.  What I am concerned with is the work which will be outside the bounds of possibility for any smallholder to undertake himself. I, therefore, move the deletion of subsections (1) and (2) of this section to ensure that the works done by the Land Commission will be maintained by the Land Commission and not left to the allottees.  Subsection (1) specifies any work whatsoever and includes any river, stream, natural or artificial watercourse, canal, drain, pond, lake or other area covered by water, and any natural or artificial bank or embankment carried out by the Land Commission before subdivision.</P>
      <P>I trust I have made myself clear to the Minister.  Surely the Minister does not expect for one moment that, in the case of a defective canal, for example, causing serious flooding to a holding allotted by the Land Commission, one or two smallholders should be responsible for carrying out the drainage improvements necessary on that canal. The same argument holds good with regard to ponds, streams, rivers, or lakes, artificial or otherwise.  If the works were necessary before the land was divided, then it is reasonable to assume their continued maintenance will also be necessary for the proper enjoyment and utilisation of the land when divided into holdings.  Works of the kind to which I have referred should, when carried out by the Land Commission in the first instance, be subsequently maintained by the Land Commission.  The Land Commission should not disclaim all responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in complete agreement with Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Treacy when they ask for a certain standard in relation to Land Commission roads. Such a standard is not only necessary but desirable.  With regard to the houses provided by the Land Commission, <Col N="1348" /> those in my constituency are a credit to the architects, engineers and everybody concerned.  Everybody knows that the tenant of a Land Commission house is responsible for the repair and maintenance of that house. It is a different day's work, however, when it is a question of lands being flooded or there being no way of getting in or out of the lands.  Surely it must be agreed that public money would be wasted if there were not some curb on wasteful expenditure?</P>
    <P>Not alone is it a question of watercourses and embankments being maintained but, if they are not maintained by the Land Commission, they will steadily deteriorate.  I am quite satisfied of that.  If those works deteriorate steadily, there will be requests to the Land Commission for their maintenance. The Land Commission will disclaim all responsibility; and the local landowners will not be in a position to undertake major works.  What will happen in the case of a number of farmers suffering from flooding from a drain made by the Land Commission in the division of a holding when one or two of the landowners are not in a position to provide labour, time or money to do the drainage work?  The last thing we want in rural Ireland is legal proceedings between neighbours for the maintenance of a watercourse or some such matter.  That is not the spirit of our people.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of Land Commission roads.  At present these should be made so that they will carry heavy machinery, combine harvesters, reapers and binders and tractors.  If you are to have heavy machinery of that nature on Land Commission roads, you must have a good foundation and a good surface.  It does not do to put a load of gravel on a soft surface.  There has been no improvement in recent years on these Land Commission roads and I must say that if they were brought up to the same standard as the Land Commission houses and building, there would be little cause for complaint.  I doubt if any responsible county engineer would provide a certificate that these Land Commission roads could be handed <Col N="1349" /> over to the local authorities to be kept in repair.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have not been generous in the amount of money spent on making roads and their roads are not up to the same standard as those made by the local authorities. This is something the Minister should have a look at.  When an estate is divided, the Land Commission have the responsibility of putting up embankments and other works.  Any group of smallholders would not be able to do such work unless there was somebody to help them and the Land Commission should hold on to responsibilities of this nature.</P>
    <P>It is most unreasonable that because of one law case, we should have a section inserted in this Bill which will have a bad effect on Land Commission work all over the country and which will cause annoyance and inconvenience to those who are to receive allotments of land.  By the inclusion of these two subsections, the Minister is not having due regard to the amount of taxpayers' money which has been spent on these works and I would ask him to reconsider carefully this aspect of these two subsections.  The Deputies who have spoken on this matter have made a good case as to why the Land Commission should hold on to the responsibilities they have.  The explanation given by the Minister that the Land Commission lost one case in Roscommon is no reason why the whole country should be harnessed with these two difficult subsections.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendments because I honestly feel that he has not presented the House with a satisfactory explanation as to why action of the type envisaged in the subsections is needed.</P>
    <P>It goes to show a great deal of pride on the part of the Land Commission. They went to court and lost a case in Roscommon and then they come along to take the greatest revenge they can. On the first occasion on which the Minister has an opportunity to bring in a new Land Bill, they set out to make sure that they will never lose a court case again.  The explanation given by the Minister is not a satisfactory one and is very vague.  I know he is going to say a few words on this <Col N="1350" /> and I would ask him not to lose his temper but to approach the matter in the practical way in which Deputy McQuillan and I have approached it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has repeated this <i>ad nauseam</i> and I do not propose to take up the time of the House in dealing further with the matter.  The short answer about drains affecting three or four farms is that there are rural improvement schemes in existence and the law as it stands is that adjoining riparian owners must keep their sections of the drains clear. The Deputy's argument is that where the Land Commission allot certain lands to farmers and, 20 years after, one farmer's cow gets into an outfall and in an effort to get the flies off his tail, shoves a whole lot of mud into that outfall, the Land Commission should then send down a man specially with a shovel to clean that outfall.  Is it Deputy Flanagan's policy that this should be done at the expense of the taxpayer?  The Lord give me patience to deal with these matters.</P>
      <P>Let me say that as far as Deputy Treacy is concerned he is talking about something to which I am a complete stranger.  I have no knowledge whatsoever of the type of housing to which he refers.  All I can say is that if he would give me particulars privately of what he has in mind, I shall look into the matter.  Let me make it clear we had here in this House a model of the standard type of new house the Land Commission are erecting for migrants and it earned the approval of every Deputy.  These houses are erected by the people themselves with special financial assistance from the Land Commission.  Therefore I am utterly at a loss to understand what type of case Deputy Treacy complained of here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would pass on to me the full facts, I shall be very glad to look into the matter. It is certainly news to me and if the Land Commission have some liability when I investigate it, it will certainly be dealt with, but I just cannot understand how such a case could arise.</P>
      <P>To deal with some of the points made by Deputy McQuillan in regard to Land Commission officials visiting local authorities, there is very close liaison between Land Commission officials and the officials of the local authorities.  It is standard practice that where roadmaking is being done by the Land Commission, they meet the necessary specifications laid down to enable these roads to be taken over ultimately by the local authority.  I do not know offhand the exact measurements specified but they meet the standards required.</P>
      <P>May I also say that under the new Planning Act there will be mandatory consultations in respect of buildings and so on between the officials of the local authority and the officials of the Land Commission?  Therefore I cannot visualise the situation in respect of which the Deputy expressed fears.  Let me repeat that under this section the Land Commission are still liable for negligence in respect of any work carried out by them while they are dealing with an estate and in possession of these lands.  Where the injury is a matter of expressed contract, the Land Commission are still liable.  The only purpose of this section is to deal with the potential liability arising from the decision in the Owen Kelly case that somebody could come back years after the Land Commission parted with the land and claim there was non-feasance or malfeasance on the part of the Land Commission in connection with some work they carried out in improving the land when the land was being divided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were debating this matter until to-morrow night and expressing all the fears that have been expressed here, with Deputy Flanagan continuing with his flights of imagination, it would still not change one iota the simple <Col N="1352" /> purpose of this section.  That should be accepted by every reasonable Deputy. It is here in the House as a result of the unanimous recommendation of the Committee on Public Accounts, that raised the case of the good Owen Kelly back in 1952.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this question of the standard practice in connection with roadmaking to which the Minister has referred, he states there is a procedure now in operation whereby the Land Commission, having made their roads and being about to leave the locality, hand over these roads in a suitable state to the local authority. I should like the Minister to satisfy the House on this point: is there a standard practice laid down by the Department of Local Government in relation to these roads or is it a matter for each local authority to decide in what state the roads must be before being taken over by the local authority? Again, who initiates the question of the takeover?  The Minister says consultations take place.  Who initiates the consultations?  Is it the local authority that will have responsibility or is it the Land Commission when they are finishing have the responsibility of notifying the local authority they have the road ready for taking over?</P>
      <P>While I accept the Minister believes that the standard practice is to hand over the roads in a suitable state, meeting the requirements of the local authority, in actual fact, that is not the position, as I can prove to him without a shadow of doubt.  I do not want to repeat what I have said about the road in Moate Park.  There is no doubt that the Land Commission have not fulfilled their responsibility there because the road is in a dreadful state and the Land Commission's first reaction was to say: &ldquo;We are finished there&rdquo;.  Only for the fact that they were still caught with their lorries moving through the estate in connection with timber, we would never have had the chance of pinning the responsibility on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how we stand at the moment but I do know that section 10 gives them a way out.  If the Minister is able to assure this House that as far <Col N="1353" /> as the Land Commission's activities in future are concerned, they will put all the roads in the various estates into a proper state of repair, up to the requirements demanded by the local authority, then I shall accept that as a fair proposition on the part of the Land Commission.  The position varies in different local authorities.  I understand quite a number of local authorities are not anxious as it is to take over roads.  What is the position as far as the Land Commission are concerned? Will it be the position that when the Land Commission have made a road and the tenants have signed over for their holdings, that road will be nobody's business or will it be up to the tenants themselves to repair that road under the rural improvements scheme?  If it is, then you are going to have a lot of dissatisfaction and a waste of public money because of a lack of maintenance over the years. Naturally you will have the tenants saying: &ldquo;This road is a public road; other people are using it and why should we have to subscribe to it?&rdquo; What I want the Minister to do is to bring in a standard practice that will apply in every local authority.  If there were any way in which the Minister could do it, I would like to see it being mandatory on a local authority, wherever the Land Commission had brought a road into a proper state of repair, to take over the road.</P>
    <P>After all, under the Drainage Acts, if the Board of Works complete an arterial drainage scheme, the onus is on the local authority to put up the money for the subsequent maintenance of that scheme.  I believe that where the Land Commission put a road into a proper state of repair, and by that I mean the proper width, steamrolled and tarmacadamed, and hand it over to the local authority, there should be no possibility of any query on the part of the local authority as to their responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has already brought in the Minister for Social Welfare, for instance, in this <Col N="1354" /> Bill and has taken powers which I felt would normally be the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare. In fact, what the Minister is doing is getting rid of these powers to make the position still more unsatisfactory. Nobody wants to be awkward about this but I can assure the Minister that the criticism which I put on record ten or 15 minutes ago about the conditions of roads in my constituency will not be forgotten for some time. As a public representative, I must bring this home to the Minister, and in view of the fact that we have this rare opportunity now, we must make the fullest possible use of it, to ensure that we will not have a continuation of the present unsatisfactory state of affairs as far as road maintenance is concerned. I am not satisfied yet, until I hear further from the Minister, who lays down the road standard; secondly, what happens roads in areas in which the local authority are not using the Local Authority Act, 1953, and also what does the Minister think of the proposition to have these roads tarmacadamed when the Land Commission move out of the locality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I need to go over all this ground again.  The Deputy is well aware that once the Land Commission finished with all these roads, they were the responsibility of the tenants and it was up to the local authority if they got them to take them over, or if they themselves got a minor relief grant or any other grant, to maintain them when they went into disrepair.  Once the Land Commission did them, they were finished with them.  What is happening now is that there is consultation in such cases about the roads between the officials of my Department and the officials of the local authority.  As far as I know, generally speaking the responsible officials of the local authority specify the standards they require before taking them over.  So far as that is the position, our people endeavour to comply with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the Land Commission in, say, Mayo, lay a road having regard to the importance of an area, to the same standards as the Mayo County Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they lay it according to the standards laid down to enable the county council to take it over.  It is up to the tenants concerned, or the council concerned, to take these over.  I am sure the Deputy has had experience of local authorities.  From my experience on county councils, there is always a list of <i>cul de sac</i> and other roads waiting to be taken over by the local authority.  My recollection is that all these applications for roads to be taken over would generally be put back until one specific meeting of the county council, around budget time, and then the council decided on the number they would bring in.  That was the procedure on the Mayo County Council in my time and I am sure a similar procedure is followed in other counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At all events, let me say that it is the Land Commission's practice, where it is necessary, to make these roads to the specifications required by the local authority so that ultimately if the local authority so decide, they can take them over.  If in this Bill I were to take any mandatory power to tell local authorities what to do, I can well imagine what Deputy McQuillan's contribution would be on that issue as well as the contributions from practically every other Deputy and I do not propose to enter that field.  Let me emphasise that in regard to anything the Land Commission do negligently on estates after the passage of this section, the legal liability will still be theirs.  It is to clear up the Gilbertian situation that the Land Commission <Col N="1356" /> can be made liable for a nuisance on lands they have no legal right to enter that this section is here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been talking about Land Commission roads but actually the roads we want to see something done about are the ones that will be laid by the Land Commission in future.  One of the biggest snags is that when the Land Commission develop an area, for some extraordinary reason they run a road into the middle of a field without any hope of its ever becoming a link road.  The local authority of which I am a member have on occassions made representations to the Land Commission to have a road laid in a certain way so that eventually they could develop it as a useful link road.  In Meath, we have been using to the very fullest extent the Local Government Act 1953 &mdash;which incidentally is referred to there as the McQuillan Act&mdash;and it is used to the extent that every road with two or more houses on it is taken over as a public road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the <i>cul de sac</i> road?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in fact any road including the Land Commission roads. The extraordinary thing is that the county council have extreme difficulty in adapting the Land Commission roads to ordinary use, for two reasons.  The first reason is that they run them out into the fields and, in most cases, they cannot be developed as link roads even though a slight alteration of direction and a matter of two hundred yards would make them very useful link roads.  The second reason is that the standard of bridges erected by the Land Commission over drains and the standard of surface put down over the boggy parts of these roads is very bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may be correct when he says that there is an improvement. I am quite prepared to agree that over the past few years the standard of these roads has been improved very considerably, particularly with regard to width, but the Minister would be doing a very good job if he adopted the suggestion made by Deputy Corish and Deputy McQuillan that a standard <Col N="1357" /> should be laid down which must be met.  If he does that, the country will gain because if the roads are properly made in the first instance the excessive expenditure which has to be met at a later date, usually by the taxpayer, will not arise.</P>
    <P>I know that when the Land Commission are dividing an estate and decide to build a number of houses and to connect them by roads it is sometimes not easy to site the houses in such a way that it will be easy to accommodate each house with a road which can be used as a link road but there are many cases where it is possible to do so.  I have in mind one case in the area which has now been transferred to Deputy Boylan's constituency of Kildare, in south Meath, where an old road runs in from the south side a distance of nearly half a mile.  It is quite a good type road. There are a number of houses on it. When the Land Commission were dividing a neighbouring estate, they ran another road in from the opposite direction within 100 yards of it and, for some extraordinary reason, they gave the intervening land to somebody who will not agree in any circumstances to the linking of the roads.  If the Land Commission had possession of that land, it would have been an easy matter for them to link the two roads and it would have been a very useful road and would have taken miles off the distance local people have to travel from one side of the area to another.  Because of the fact that the Land Commission have not that intervening field, the position is very awkward.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister could solve all these problems by laying down that it is not a question that there should be co-operation between the Land Commission officials and the local authority officials but that there must be co-operation.  I am quite sure that the officials of at least one county council are not entirely satisfied that they are getting the co-operation that they have asked for from time to time from Land Commission officials responsible for developing roads.  I am not trying to blame the Minister who is trying to <Col N="1358" /> pilot one of the thorniest Bills through the House and I can understand his exasperation when everyone cannot see things as he sees them but it is only right that we should put problems to him so that before the Bill becomes law, he will have the opportunity of improving the Bill considerably.  The matter I have referred to is a case in point.  It will save everybody concerned a good deal of annoyance and money if the proper co-operation can be secured.</P>
    <P>Let me say that I believe the Miniister is perfectly right when he says that the Land Commission should not be held responsible indefinitely for land they have handed over to somebody else.  That would create an extraordinary situation.  The Minister is correct when he says that there should be a period after which responsibility should pass to the new owner.  Having said that, I should like to say that particularly in the case of roads and to a lesser degree in the case of drains, if the Land Commission do not do the job properly in the first instance, they should be forced to carry the responsibility which has fallen on them, not exactly because of their negligence, but because they have not done the job properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another section of the Bill which we will come to that perhaps may solve the difficulty Deputy Tully has in mind when he talks about the recalcitrant landowner who has a field between two roads and will not allow the roads to be connected, because I am taking the opportunity in this Bill, under certain sections, to modernise rights of way and I am taking certain compulsory powers where the circumstances justify it, to create rights of way, irrespective of the title to the property concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I can do is to repeat that I have given a direction to my officials in matters of this kind to consult with the officials of the local authority.  That should normally work.  No instance has been brought to my notice of lack of co-operation or of my direction being ignored.  Surely, where houses are being built and roads are being constructed by the Land Commission, if there has been prior consultation <Col N="1359" /> with the officials of the local authority, that is as far as any Minister for Lands could reasonably be expected to go? Unless there is something radically wrong, things should work out satisfactorily when that consultation takes place.</P>

      <P>I think the officials are doing their job in so far as they are given power to do it.  Money is the problem in finishing these estates properly. I want the Minister to know that in the local authority area with which I am familiar the local authority officials have proved to be reasonable men.  That means that there is only one group that has proved to be unreasonable, that is, the Land Commission. It is in headquarters that we have this deadlock because the local authority has been told by the Land Commission: &ldquo;We have no responsibility. We are finished in these estates and will accept no responsibility whatever.&rdquo; They moved out of those estates without as much as a &ldquo;by your leave&rdquo; to the local authority officials who, unless they were posted on the roads each day, could not possibly find out when the Land Commission were finished.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether the local authority engineers in Roscommon are at liberty to go to the Land Commission and say: &ldquo;There have been three estates in the past three years where we believe you have left the roads in bad condition, or at any rate they have deteriorated since because you did not notify us you were leaving and did not make the necessary finances available so that these roads could have been put back into a proper state of repair&rdquo;?  As the section is drafted, it can be quoted <i>ad lib.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal has been said so far on the section, so very little remains for me to say at this stage.  However, I would strongly urge the Minister to introduce an amendment on Report Stage inserting a provision whereby, on the completion of each Land Commission job, whether it be road making or bridge construction, the Commission would notify the local authority that they were leaving the district.  The amendment could provide that the Commission would supply to the local authority details of the work, including, possibly, dimensions of roads and so forth, and that the Commission would notify the authority that they could inspect the works within a period of 21 days, for approval or otherwise.  The amended section could also provide that allottees would have an appeal to the Minister. After all, the section may have serious consequences and it is quite evident if one reads what the Explanatory Memorandum on the Bill states in relation to this section.  It says:</P>
      <P>The Land Commission will, of course, be fully responsible while the lands are on their hands, but after the allottees have gone into possession the maintenance obligations, if any, will attach to the allottees.</P>
      <P>After the Land Commission have proceeded to allot the lands, works like the construction of bridges or the provision of rights of way may arise. The bridge might have to be built over a county council maintained stream.  Then the allottee finds himself saddled with complete responsibility for the maintenance of these works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allottee may be told by the Land Commission that he must take over the work.  He signs for them but may find, after signing, that a job has not been carried out in a satisfactory manner.  A cottage tenant who tries to vest his cottage, if he is not satisfied with the state of repair of the building, has a right of appeal to the Minister concerned over the head of the local authority and that Minister may send an impartial official of the Department to inspect the premises and determine <Col N="1362" /> whether or not they are in proper order for vesting.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest it is not too much to ask that a smallholder given an allotment would have a similar right in regard to works on the holding for which he is to be made responsible. I suggest the allottee should be given a period of at least three months within which to appeal to the Minister for Lands.  The Minister, as in the case of cottage vesting, could then send an impartial official to inspect the works concerned &mdash; they might include drainage, fencing, and embankments &mdash; and determine whether or not they were in such a state of repair that the allottee could justify be asked to maintain them.  We are only reasonable in asking that machinery be set up for an appeal by the allottee to the Minister so that the allottee would not be saddled unjustly with maintenance responsibility.  Of course, the Land Commission will take care not to give a certificate, after the case of Owen Kelly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry there are not more men like him.  He is the one man who succeeded in waking up the Land Commission from their slumbers.  I have no doubt that he obtained a very great reward for his deeds in this life.  I am not asking too much in seeking the right of appeal to the Minister so that not alone will the Minister be satisfied that justice is done but that it will be seen to be done to the allottee.  I feel the Land Commission will be washing their hands completely of this and that the allottee will be saddled with the great responsibility of trying to maintain <Col N="1363" /> what he may not be financially able to maintain.  The Minister should give the matter a little more consideration. Those of us who are critical of the section would be prepared to let the matter rest, at least for tonight, if the Minister gives a guarantee that he will look into this before the Report Stage so that an allottee may have a right to appeal if he does not get his property in the condition promised by the Land Commission and in a condition enabling it to be described as in a first class state of repair.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to notify the local authority in the case of works being completed by the Land Commission so that the County Manager may consider providing in the following year's estimates adequate provision for the maintenance of the Land Commission works for which the Land Commission will no longer be responsible on the passing of section 10 of this Bill. Many local authorities would be only too glad to assist residents or allottees by taking over the roads knowing that, in addition to paying the Land Commission annuity on the holding, these allottees in the main would be substantial ratepayers of the local authority and would be entitled to good roads.  If officially notified, I think the local authority would make a report that the road concerned was suitable for taking over and responsibility for its maintenance for all time would then rest with the local authority.</P>
      <P>We are not asking the impossible and I feel that if the Minister examines the matter between now and the Report Stage he will see the wisdom in the argument advanced here to give the allottee a right of appeal to him as a person who will see that justice is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be well to have provision in the Act for the appeal even if it meant saving only one tenant enormous inconvenience and expense by saddling him with an obligation to do something beyond his capacity, something which might be handed over to him purporting to be in first-class order, and which he discovers is not the case.  Yet, once he has signed, the Land Commission have no further <Col N="1364" /> responsibility.  All I seek is the right of appeal which can be determined in the same way as matters are decided by the Minister for Local Government on appeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is democracy and I suppose I must deal with the arguments&mdash;if I may so describe them&mdash; made here that we should deal with this matter in the same way as an appeal about the repairs to a labourer's cottage.  We are dealing here with presents of lands costing thousands and thousands of pounds to the taxpayers, particularly in the case of migrants' holdings.  Deputy Flanagan, on behalf of Fine Gael, asked me to consider inserting a section on the Report Stage to ensure that the Land Commission, having done so much in connection with land division will be liable for all these things and also having local authorities brought in to check their work to ensure that roads are tarmacadamed to these Land Commission houses, to ensure their bridges are built and their fences all right for all time and that the tenant should have a right of appeal in all these things.</P>
      <P>Certainly, I accede to the Deputy's request&mdash;I shall consider this position between now and the Report Stage of the Bill.  I think he has not gone quite far enough.  I must also consider providing swimming pools and multicoloured umbrellas under which these people can recline when the weather is fine.  I also think there should be provision in this section making it compulsory on the Minister for Lands to send every one of these tenants, their heirs and assigns, a Christmas card&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy accused me of that already.  It is his imagination. Under this section it is intended to make it quite clear that the Land Commission need not pay rates on unoccupied buildings pending allotment. Under existing law, in general, under section 14 of the Local Government Act, 1946, owners of buildings can claim from county councils to be recouped on rates paid on buildings which are vacant for the purpose of undergoing repairs, etc., or letting. Recoupment may turn on whether the owner is <i>bona fide</i> unable to obtain a suitable tenant at the maximum rent permissible under the rent restrictions Act.  Because existing law does not quite fit the operations of the Land Commission disputes have arisen with the local authorities.  It would be impractical for the Land Commission to try to let houses for the year or two they are normally on hands before disposal. Accordingly, agreement has been reached between the Departments of Finance, Local Government and Lands that the Land Commission should be specifically exempted.  The purpose of section 11 is to provide a practical solution of a problem which, while not very important, has been giving rise to considerable trouble between local authorities and the Land Commission in respect of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Had the Land Commission not got that privilege&mdash;to call it that&mdash;just like any private owner at <Col N="1366" /> present, that if the house is empty rates are not chargeable?  My view is that this section is completely unnecessary. If the local authorities refused to accept that the Land Commission building was empty and insisted on rates being paid when there was nobody in the house I could understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in law, as far as I know, is the same for the Land Commission, as for anybody else and where a building is vacant, if the local authority is strict in its approach it will make you produce evidence of your attempts to let the building and ask you to show that you failed to get a tenant.  In that way although Land Commission buildings may be unoccupied there has always been trouble between the Land Commission and the local authorities in respect of such buildings which may be vacant for a comparatively short time, a year or 15 months, while a scheme is being prepared. Now, the local authority will not lose anything because when this Bill passes it is proposed that immediately the tenant is put into occupation of the land and buildings he will be liable to the local authority for rates from that date.  This clears up an awkward position administratively because the Land Commission, for the short periods that these buildings are unoccupied, are not in a position to prove to the local authorities that they attempt to let these buildings or that it would be a practical proposition.</P>

    <P>NOTES: (a) The figures for the Civil Service supplied in the answer to the question of 4th April 1963 were, as the note to that question indicated, derived from the Civil Service Census. That pattern has again been followed in computing the figures set out above; an appropriate addition has been made to the 1964 figure for the cost of the ninth round. The 1964 figure contains an estimated amount for overtime and is to that extent provisional.</P>
    <P>(b) 1957 figures based on Estimates provision; 1964 figures based on Estimates provision with an appropriate addition for the ninth round.</P>
    <P>(c) On the basis of actual cost for the year ended 31st March, 1964, the figure of 0.6 per cent for the Garda Síochána given in reply to the question of 25th April 1963, requires to be revised to 0.7 per cent.</P>

      <P>Under the Finance Act, 1963, the non-liable margin of £2,500 for Corporation Profits Tax was abolished.  In respect of profits arising on or after the 1st January, 1964, Corporation Profits Tax is chargeable at the rate of 5 per cent on so much of the profits as does not exceed £2,500 and at 15 per cent on profits in excess <Col N="1231" /> of that figure.  The following table shows the estimated cost of restoring the non-liable margin of £2,500 and of introducing non-liable margins of £3,000, £4,000 and £5,000.  It is assumed that profits in excess of the non-liable margins specified would continue to be charged at the rate of 15 per cent.</P>
