    <Title>Land Bill, 1963&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 27 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This section raises two very fundamental matters.  I have said at an earlier stage of our discussion that the great danger of this Bill is that it contains some very useful provisions but that concealed behind those useful provisions, there are some extremely dangerous ones.  One of the most malignant of the proposals in this Land Bill is contained in this section and it falls into two parts: one, the new and unprecedented power which the Minister for Lands seeks to <Col N="390" /> acquire, to direct himself the inspection of land for the purpose of acquisition; and two, flowing from that power, the consequence of the Secretary of the Department of Lands for the time being being himself a Land Commissioner.</P>
      <P>I want to make this quite clear&mdash;it is a matter of some delicacy to handle with propriety&mdash;that the present Secretary of the Department of Lands is an outstanding public servant whom we on this side of the House consider would be a most suitable person among many others to be appointed a Land Commissioner.  It is important that that should be made manifest in the very opening stages of discussion of the principle here involved.  But for section 27 we would be prepared to argue the appropriateness of the Secretary of the Department of Lands for the time being being also himself a Land Commissioner, but if the powers of section 27 were to be vested in the Minister as head of the Department, we would put it to the House, and I do not think it could be argued against us, that it is fantastic to suggest that justice could not only be done but be seen to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you had a situation in which the Minister for Lands calls in the Secretary of the Department and says to him: &ldquo;Tell the senior inspector in a certain area to inspect certain land with a view to acquisition,&rdquo; the Secretary acting as he is constitutionally bound to act under the direction of the Minister, instructs the senior inspector of the Department to go and inspect lands with a view to acquisition.  The person whose lands are inspected on the instruction of the Secretary of the Department of Lands appeals against the propriety of the acquisition of his lands to the Land Commission, and seated in the Land Commission when he goes before them to make his case is the very man who has sent the inspector to inspect his lands for acquisition.  How can anyone suggest that justice will not only be done but be seen to be done if a man labouring under a deep sense of grievance at the prospect of his land being compulsorily acquired by the Department finds that one of the judges in his case <Col N="391" /> is the man who set the process of acquisition in motion?</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Corry intervened in the debate and I think Deputy Corry has stated the case most eloquently against section 27.  No one could have done it more dramatically.  He described how, in his own constituency, feeling that a certain farm should be acquired, he went out by night and he manoeuvred his car so that he threw the lights of it on the farm, lest the proprietor should be in any doubt that there was a vigilant eye upon him, and he scanned the farm under the light of his headlamps.  The neighbours all round could see the car turning and Deputy Corry scanning the land.  He said he turned his car then and he drove to Dublin, went in to the Minister, and said: &ldquo;Take that man's land&rdquo; and, within three days, he says the farm was taken.</P>
    <P>Now, I allow for the picturesque in Deputy Corry's description of his own prowess as an ardent servant of those who vote for him and the scourge of those who vote against him, but does the House want to perpetuate the picture?  Whereas heretofore there stood between Deputy Corry and his constituents at least the Land Commission, consisting of quasi-judicial persons holding their office by quasi-judicial tenure, now the situation is to arrive that, when Deputy Corry goes out and casts the light of his headlamps on his neighbour's farm, he can drive to Dublin, not to say to the Minister: &ldquo;This case ought to be referred to the Land Commission for consideration as to whether the farm should be inspected for acquisition&rdquo; but, rather, to say: &ldquo;Michael, will you put a blister on this fellow?  Send in the inspectors, in any case, to put the heart across him.&rdquo;  Do we want that? Does Deputy Corry, or any member of the Fianna Fáil Party, think it would be a desirable thing, if Fine Gael were the Government of this country, that a member of the Fine Gael Party should have the right to go to the political head of the Department of Lands and ask him to send inspectors in on his neighbour's land?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> Now, what I apprehend is that a great many people do not understand, or do not realise, the radical nature of this departure because relatively few people are familiar with the whole atmosphere that surrounds land settlement in Ireland.  There is, however, powerful evidence in existence in support of preserving the present situation. The first Land Acquisition Act was passed in 1885 under a British Administration.  Since 1885 to date there has been a succession of Land Acts.  They are legion.  There is the Ashbourne Act; there is the Wyndham Act; there is the Hogan Act of 1923 which transferred all the tenanted land to the Land Commission.  There is the Birrell Act.  There is a whole succession of Acts passed by Fianna Fáil, two or three passed by the inter-Party Government, and one or two since passed again by Fianna Fáil.  In all the Acts that have been passed, time and again, individual Deputies have made the case that we could expedite the procedure of acquisition if the Minister had certain powers.  Time and again Deputies on both sides have said that it was not proper, to their way of thinking, that you could not raise in Dáil Éireann the question of the acquisition of an individual farm and require the Minister to explain the reasons for its acquisition or inspection. British Ministers, Cumann na nGaedheal Ministers, Fianna Fáil Ministers, Clann na Talmhan Ministers, Fine Gael Ministers and, again, Fianna Fáil Ministers have all said, for 40 years, that with the intimate knowledge of the whole land code, and the problem it involves in the social pattern of the life of the small farmer, it was undesirable that the political head of the Department should have such a power.</P>
    <P>It has never been argued before in this country, and anybody who has any understanding of the whole history of this business must realise how utterly damnable is the suggestion, that we should put into the hands of the political head of the Department the power to inspect or the power to acquire.  I know perfectly well that the Minister for Lands will intervene most energetically to say: &ldquo;I have never asked for <Col N="393" /> the power to acquire.  I do not want the power to acquire.  That will be left in the hands of the Land Commission.  All I am trying to do it to streamline the whole proceedings.&rdquo;  I can see at once that the Minister for Lands is as familiar with the whole background and history of this business as I am and he knows, just as well as I do, what the inspection of a holding by a Land Commission inspector means to a farmer in rural Ireland.  It means the threat of the prospect of compulsory acquisition.  Remember, there is a profound difference in the whole machinery of compulsory acquisition being set in motion since Deputy Blowick's Land Act.  There were two Acts, one which provided the Land Commission must pay the market price and another authorising the Land Commission to purchase land at public auction, or were they both in the same Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Both powers were in the same Bill.  The Land Commission have power now to go to an auction and buy a holding for cash and the Land Commission are also required to pay the full market price.  If a man puts his holding in the hands of an auctioneer and if the Land Commission inspector goes to that auctioneer and tells his client the Land Commission are interested and, if they offer him a good price and he should take it, in 95 per cent of cases he sells that land to the Land Commission at the market price.  There used to be a feeling that, if you took your money in land bonds, you lost some money on the realisation of those bonds.  It has long been the practice now to ensure that these bonds carry the current rate of interest and I imagine land bonds today are selling at par or at a premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a man is willing to part with his land the machinery is there to bring him into contact with the Land Commission and make it easier for him to sell his land to the Land Commission. From the point of view of the majority selling holdings in congested areas, if they sell to the Land Commission, they will be selling with the goodwill of all their neighbours.  But, if a farmer puts <Col N="394" /> his holding up to auction and sells it to one individual, he will do so to the indignation of all his other neighbours and he will earn 20, 30, or 40 enemies for the one man he obliges by selling the holding to him.  All the machinery is there for a man who wants to get rid of his holding to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>When we talk about inspection with a view to acquisition of the individual case we are talking about the man who does not want to sell.  Now, we all recognise that the whole land code is based on the assumption that a situation can arise in which the public good conflicts with the private individual's strong personal predilection and the whole of the land code says that strong personal predilection must be protected up to a point.  But if the user of the land is grossly unsuitable, if the man is obviously not using the land as a farmer would use it, but perennially setting it, and if there are a whole number of small congests living around him in urgent need of enlargement of their holdings, then it is legitimate for the Land Commission to go in and if need be compulsorily acquire the land for distribution among his neighbours. We recognise, however, that there are all important fundamental rights involved here and, therefore, it is most essential in cases of this kind that not only will justice be done but that it will be seen to be done and we have provided that if after the Land Commission have weighed up the matter in a court, which will go down to the district where the land is situated and sit in the very area and perhaps itself go out and look at the situation, and if they are taking the decision that the land should be acquired and fix the price then the tenant still has the right to go to a judge of the High Court to argue as to the justice of the price. We all know that not infrequently when the appeal is made the judge fixes a higher price than the Land Commission thought appropriate and sometimes a price that the Land Commission is not prepared to pay and as a result the Land Commission withdraw from the acquisition proceedings and the man is left in undisturbed possession of his land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> I do not deny that in certain very rare and isolated cases that may mean that possibly what would appear to the bulk of us an unreasonable solicitude for the individual rights of the smallholder has been manifested by the Land Commission court.  I do not deny on very rare occasions one gets a case where most men would have said that it would have been wiser to go on with the acquisition of the land than leave the land in the hands of the person who objected, but I rejoice in that just as I believe in the jury system in criminal trials because I believe it is better that many guilty men should go free rather than that one innocent man should be convicted.  So I believe the whole principle of security of tenure is far better maintained even if it means the rare and exceptional case in which the Land Commission have bent backwards to respect the security of tenure of the individual and have gone perhaps rather further than the average reasonable man would go to see he remains undisturbed in his fixity of tenure, so that all might be reassured in the country that fixity of tenure was a fundamental principle to which all of us, no matter to what political Party we belong, still subscribe.</P>
    <P>The great danger if you start cutting corners in this matter, if you start seeking expedition, efficiency and rapidity, is that you purchase it at too high a price.  I put it to you, a Cheann Comhairle, that it has been truly said that Parliamentary democracy is the most inefficient system of Government in the world, except all the other systems.  Let us come to the fundamental question.  What is the purpose of Government?  The purpose of Government is to maintain individual liberty in an ordered society.  There are a dozen other systems of Government which will get things done quicker and more expeditiously than Parliamentary democracy but at the price of destroying individual liberty. So, it has been truly said that this system is the worst system, except all the others, because our system preserves what is vital.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the House that <Col N="396" /> we in Ireland have evolved a system under the land code which has worked because it has served the public good while preserving the fundamental principle of fixity of tenure.  I know it is slow.  I know it can often appear devious and tedious.  I know from my experience as a Deputy for Donegal and Monaghan how impatient my constituents can become at what appears to them the endless machinations of the Land Commission before they acquire and even more so before they will divide.  Time and time again I have taken up with the Land Commission this question of the slowness of acquisition, the slowness to divide and time and time again I have had to go back to my constituents and say: &ldquo;I think the Land Commission are right.  It seems as clear as crystal to you that such and such a farm should be acquired but the Land Commission have looked into this case which is that of a widow woman with a boy of 17 who is attending the Agriculture College.  She says that if they will wait until he comes out in two years then she can run the farm but at present she has to set the land for the boy's education and all the other children are too young and she is entitled to a couple of years to demonstrate whether she is going to do that or not.&rdquo;  I have said that I thought the Land Commission was right in refusing to proceed.</P>
    <P>I have had cases, too, where the Land Commission appeared to be setting land they had bought for year after year and I have said: &ldquo;Are you never going to divide this land?  The people are in a state of uproar when they see people taking Land Commission land on conacre.&rdquo;  And they have replied: &ldquo;Here is the situation. This is all part of the plan for division and for settling a whole area.  Until we get another 20 or 30 acres we cannot do the job and if we proceed with a scheme now without that additional land having been acquired the whole scheme will be unsatisfactory and this whole place will be in turmoil for the next three or four generations.&rdquo;  I have told my constituents: &ldquo;I know how exasperating this is, but they are right.&rdquo;  Why are they right?  Because <Col N="397" /> you will find in the Land Commission men who have devoted their whole lives to this question.  I am not pretending that everybody in the Land Commission is an omniscient angel but taking them by and large they consist of a body of knowledge, a body of experience and a body of skill unrivalled in any part of the world.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that our procedure for the settlement of the land question is the admiration of every country in the world Ask them in Germany, or ask in the various continental countries what they think of the work of the Irish Land Commission.  They will tell you that all they now know about the resettlement of land they have learned from the long experience of the Irish Land Commission.  That is something we ought to be proud of, but we are crossing Rubicons if we make this fundamental change.  Do not be under any illusions: this is a fundamental change.</P>
    <P>Let us revert for a moment to the picture drawn by Deputy Corry himself. He goes out at night and throws his headlamps on his neighbours land. He makes up his mind that it ought to be acquired.  At present he may swagger about his constituency and say: &ldquo;I will soon fix that&rdquo;, but anyone else in that constituency, to whom that boast is repeated, can reply: &ldquo;Do not bother about Martin.  He talks that way, but he is harmless.  He will make a hullabaloo, but when he gets to Dublin&mdash;smack, he runs right into the Land Commission, and they do not give a damn for Martin in the Land Commission.  His representations are listened to but any other Deputy's representations are listened to just the same.  The case will be judged on its merits.  If it is right, proceedings will be initiated, and, if it is wrong, they will tell him to take a running jump at himself.  Then he will be roaring and bawling in Dáil Éireann, dancing the can-can and saying the civil servants should not be superior to the elected representatives of the people, but nobody will pay the least heed to him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But suppose we pass this section, you cannot say that any more.  I cannot reassure people concerning their <Col N="398" /> fixity of tenure.  I am obliged to say: &ldquo;I do not know.  Deputy Paddy Smith has just resigned from the Government. They are very shaky.  It is notorious there is a lot of confusion and quarrelling going on within the Government. They would be glad to see the last of Martin&rdquo;&mdash;I mean no disrespect to Deputy Corry when I speak of him as &ldquo;Martin&rdquo; because he is spoken of that way in his own constituency&mdash;&ldquo;but if he got tough and said that, unless this land is taken, he would resign, this is a time when they are very shaky and they would not like that.&rdquo;  It might be that he could blackmail the Minister at least into making the gesture of directing a senior inspector to inspect the land.</P>
    <P>The senior inspector goes to inspect the land and the matter comes before the Land Commission.  Two Commissioners go down and hold a court in the immediate vicinity of that holding. The farmer goes in with his solicitor and counsel to make the case that the land should not be acquired.  Who is sitting on the Land Commission Court?  The Secretary of the Department of Lands.  Who sent the inspector to inspect the lands?  One of the men sitting on the Bench.  What am I to say to the small farmer who comes to me and says: &ldquo;Have we not got fixity of tenure under our own Government?&rdquo; I ask any fair-minded Deputy, could I honestly reply: &ldquo;Yes, we still have&rdquo;?  I could not.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House that, if you pass this section in its present form and in the context of the other section dealing with the appointment of the Secretary of the Department to the Land Commission, you are asking the people in rural Ireland to accept an appeal from the prosecution to the prosecution.  I put it to you that the moment you place in the hands of the political head of the Department of Lands the power to send a senior inspector in to inspect lands for the purpose of acquisition&mdash;I want to give you the most solemn possible warning of this&mdash;you are going to invent the most pestilential instrument of political blackmail ever forged in the history of this country.  You are going to put into the hands of every Deputy <Col N="399" /> the temptation to go out and claim he has the power to get his neighbour's lands inspected.</P>
    <P>I put it to Dáil Éireann that very often, inadvertently, a Legislature does something without full realisation of the impact of what they do.  Pass this section, and into the hands of the unscrupulous Deputy there is going to be put an instrument of vicious political blackmail.  Do not stop there.  Take Deputies trying to do their best, who are, in my opinion, and I speak from some experience, the vast majority of Deputies.  The Deputy trying to do his work honestly in his constituency is going to be exposed to intolerable pressure.  He is going to be arraigned by an incensed group of land-hungry people in his constituency and challenged: &ldquo;What is the measure of your influence with your own Government? We are putting it to you that that man's land ought to be inspected. You cannot any longer say the best you can do is to forward our recommendation to the Land Commission for their judicial determination as to whether it should be inspected or not. You are now in a position to go to the Minister for Lands of your own Party and demand that it be done, and we are going to judge of your value as a TD representing us by whether your influence with the Minister is sufficient to get it done or not.  If he throws you out, it means he does not give a damn about you.  The moment you admit we have carried conviction to your mind that that is our feeling, then it should follow, as day follows night, that it will be done.  Or else, the case is clear.  You are a political has-been and the sooner we get rid of you the better, because the Minister does not give a damn for you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Do Deputies on any side of the House want to create that position? I ask Deputies on all sides of the House, whose neighbours are involved in this matter: do any of us want to create such a situation as I describe? I certainly do not.  I do not believe any level-headed, calm or prudent Deputy on any side of the House disagrees with me.  I know that some of <Col N="400" /> the most experienced and rational members of the Fianna Fáil Party agree with me.</P>
    <P>I am utterly unable to understand what has persuaded the Minister to suggest this change.  The best case he has made for it so far is that it will expedite the process of land acquisition. I do not believe a word of it. Theoretically recommendations have to come up from the court, be considered by the Land Commission and be returned with their approbation to rural Ireland.  You may save a week or sometimes less by empowering the local senior inspector to direct the inspection, but you are doing that at the price of making fixity of tenure the servant of political expediency in rural Ireland.  Unless you are all mad, unless the Members of this House have lost their senses, they will not do this thing.</P>
    <P>Look back on the whole long saga started as far back as 1870.  Think of the new departure, of the land war and the Land League.  Think of the great panoply of successive Land Acts that have contributed collectively to the solution of the land problem in Ireland. Down through that period of stress and strain, violence and even bloodshed, we here in Ireland have always maintained, against the immense forces arrayed against us by the landlords with power, wealth and an alien Government to sustain them, that fixity of tenure was the sheet-anchor of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Is it credible that, having sustained that thesis for close on a century, certainly for 90 years, for no better reason than that we should expedite acquisition proceedings, we are going to put it in jeopardy?  Heretofore those of us who have been long in politics, and those of us who are not so experienced, could afford to smile when we heard of Deputy Corry going out with his car by night, throwing his headlights on a neighbour's farm to survey it with a view to acquisition, and could afford to say that that kind of constituency acrobatics was typical of some old warriors, that it did not matter because fixity of tenure was firmly rooted in the judicial status of the <Col N="401" /> Land Commission.  I cannot say that any more, and no one else can either.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate and I fully understand that section 27 does not give the Minister power to determine whether land is to be acquired.  I fully appreciate and fully understand that the only new power it confers on him is to direct inspection of land for the purpose of determining whether acquisition is desirable, and that the latter question remains a reserved function of the Land Commission, but I was reared in rural Ireland, in the heart of the second most congested area, and I saw the last evicted tenant restored to his holding in east Mayo in December, 1918, after 40 years of struggle.  Many other Deputies share my experience.</P>
    <P>I know what it means to have your holding illuminated by Deputy Corry's headlights on a Monday night and to have a Land Commission inspector walk your land the following Monday morning.  I do not believe there is an honest or experienced Deputy on any side of this House who wants to incorporate in the land laws of this country the principle that Deputy Corry can go out by night and call the attention of the whole surrounding neighbourhood to the fact that he has come to scan his neighbour's holding under the searchlights of his car, and that the Minister for Lands for the time being of his own Party is to be put in the position of having to declare either that Deputy Corry was a fraud or that he was only playacting or alternatively of saying to the Secretary of the Department: &ldquo;Tell the chief inspector of that area to go and inspect that land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Love of the land is very deep in this country.  I solemnly warn you that if that transaction were repeated in many parts of Ireland, you would raise ghosts the nature of which you ought not to have forgotten.  I know what it cost to eliminate violence on the land question in this country.  I know the story of the new departure. I know the days when &ldquo;grabber&rdquo; was a hated name in Ireland.  I know men today who still have tarnished reputations because their grandfathers were grabbers.  I know a field today, and <Col N="402" /> every time I pass it, I cannot prevent myself from thinking of the people who own it and recalling that they grabbed it from a tenant farmer.  Do not stir those murky depths.  Do not forget how hard it was to put an end to moonlighting in this country.  Do not forget what the new departure was.  It was the struggle of Davitt, Parnell, O'Brien and others to harness violence, to control it and concentrate it in a concerted effort to abolish by law the evils which afflicted the people and drove them to violence and hatred.  I ask Deputies to pause.</P>
    <P>In the old days the grabber would be seen creeping up to the back door of the rent office and when the agent knew he had a tenant, then came an eviction, and the high hopes amongst the neighbours that he would not be able to set the land were ended when the grabber came creeping in.  We all know that when the evicted tenant could not get a holding on an adjoining estate, lest his continued propinquity would keep the agitation alive, he was supposed to go away, whether it was to the workhouse or some distant place, in order that his name might be forgotten so that the hatred of the grabber might die away. It never did die away.  It survived and passed to the grabber's children and grandchildren.  But the Land Movement substituted the path of legislation and reform for the violence of desperation that had characterised land agitation in this country heretofore.  All of us understand that picture.</P>
    <P>I beg of this House to reflect for a moment.  If Deputy Corry can go out by night and illuminate his neighbour's land for all the world to see, and claim the power to get that land inspected, and that that is the law that we, the elected representatives of the Irish people, have made in our own Parliament, are we not reversing the whole course of history?  Are we not inviting that there should be substituted for the due process of law a desperate resort to violence rather than to submit to the grabber's claim?</P>
    <P>I know how hard it was to launch the new departure and to substitute the rule of law for the moonlighter and <Col N="403" /> the cattle hocker and the gun fired in through the kitchen window.  Do not raise those ghosts again.  They were once successfully laid by great men. Walk warily lest you find that, in this generation, there will not be men of equal stature to lay those ghosts again if we should call them from their graves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>After all these histrionics, I want the House to get back to the realities of Section 27 and what it proposes to do.  I think that Deputy Dillon, by repeating these misrepresentations of this section, expects to terrify the people outside this House: he certainly will not terrify those inside the House.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure that Deputy Dillon must know from his experience that the picture he has built up here in connection with the section is completely incorrect and completely untrue. Deputy Dillon must know that prior to this law, since the foundation of this State, it was the Commissioners who authorised the inspectors to go out to inspect the land in respect of which they themselves sat to decide whether to take or not to take.  He paints the picture now that because the Secretary of the Department, Commissioner O'Brien, will be sitting on that court there is something completely immoral, something completely wrong, in the Commissioner authorising somebody to go in to make an inspection and then sitting in judgment on that particular case.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon must know that this section provides for the simple process of the senior inspector's signing a form authorising an ordinary inspector of the Land Commission to make the usual report, upon which the Commissioners must decide whether or not the land should be taken.  It is not the Minister who will decide: let me re-emphasise that, no matter what smokescreen may be raised here.  The Commissioners must decide and they must decide on the report of the inspector in the same way as they have decided on the reports of their inspectors since the foundation of the State.</P>

    <P>Until the year 1947 and the decision <Col N="404" /> in the Dunleavy case in the Supreme Court, with which I was associated, the Commissioners operated what I described then as a Star Chamber procedure.  In those days, the Commissioners signed this form&mdash;called the Section 40 Notice&mdash;and the inspector went in and reported to the Commissioners behind closed doors and they read the whole file.  The owner was not notified of what was in the file. The owner did not know in those days what case he would have to meet if he came before the court, if he wanted to resist the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>After the decision in the Dunleavy case in 1947, which was followed by the Roscrea case the next year, that procedure was reversed.  For the first time, it was laid down that the owner was entitled to hear what the Land Commission inspector had to say.  It was after these cases to which I have referred that, for the first time since the foundation of the State, the Land Commission inspector had to go into the witness box to give evidence of what he found on the owner's land and to stand up to cross-examination on those issues.  Therefore, instead of this being something new in the form of Commissioners dealing with the case by their own inspectors, and they themselves signing the form, they have been authorising the inspection of those lands since the foundation of the State and have been sitting judicially or quasi-judicially on those cases in the Land Court ever since.  Deputy Dillon suggests that there is something extraordinary in the suggestion that Commissioner O'Brien, because he is Secretary of the Land Commission, should be able to sit in a Land Court, having authorised or directed the signing of a form of inspection, completely overlooking the fact that on these forms of inspection by their own inspectors the Commissioners have always decided whether or not to take any particular farm.</P>
    <P>Let us just recapitulate what actually happens or how the matter comes to the Land Commission in the first instance.  The Commissioners do not live in outer space.  They cannot decide any issue as to whether land should or should not be taken without having <Col N="405" /> independent evidence before them as to the necessity for taking the land, as to whether there is congestion, and as to the user of the land, that is, in cases where they are taking lands because of bad user.</P>
    <P>Invariably, these files start perhaps by local people going into the local Land Commission office and making the case that Mr. X is in America and that his lands have been let for many years, and so on.  That goes from that very junior official to the senior inspector there and from him to the Divisional Inspector.  It goes up right along the line and under existing law, it has to go to the Commissioners in Dublin for signature of this preliminary notice&mdash;the Section 40 Notice&mdash; to enable that junior official to go out to find out whether these allegations are true or otherwise.  By the time that happens, in nine cases out of ten the land is gone because Mr. X's relations know that his neighbours have been making representations about the lands.  It may well be that the neighbours may or may not be accompanied by the local Deputies.  They know that the people around the place have become interested and, of course, the friends immediately get busy and these lands are sold or transferred before the Land Commission get an opportunity of sending their inspector to ascertain whether or not they are suitable for Land Commission purposes.</P>
    <P>All that is being asked here is that, instead of this travelling up and down, the Divisional Inspector&mdash;and there are only four of them in the country, each of them dealing with several counties&mdash;will be authorised to sign this notice enabling the preliminary inspection to be made upon which the Commissioners will make up their minds whether or not to go ahead with the usual proceedings for acquisition. That is simply what is being sought here.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise that the Commissioners, whether a Commissioner happens to be Secretary of the Department or not, have no way of getting an independent report on the suitability of these lands for acquisition except on the <Col N="406" /> report of one of the Land Commission officers, their own inspector.  Irrespective of what allegations may be made by neighbours or what representations are made by Deputies, what the Land Commission must do is have their own inspection upon which the Commissioners will make their minds up whether proceedings should be instituted or not for the acquisition of these lands.  After the passing of this Bill, it is the Commissioners who still have that power and who will still decide whether any lands should be taken for Land Commission purposes.</P>
    <P>Having made that clear and having re-emphasised that, can we not get away from the smokescreen that has been raised about an alleged judge confusing two issues, about a member of the Land Commission court deciding a case that he himself had prejudiced in some way by authorising an inspection notice before the hearing of the case?  Every notice for inspection since 1923 was authorised and signed by the very Commissioners who decided the case.  They had to sign these notices according to the law passed by this House.  How were they to know whether the allegations were right or wrong unless they got the inspector's report?  All I am asking the House to do in this section in order to streamline this procedure and eliminate this wasteful delay in having reports in this form sent up to the Commissioners, is to provide that the divisional inspector for the area can authorise that preliminary report.</P>
    <P>Let me explain that&mdash;I am sure Deputy Dillon knows this very well-the divisional inspector for the area would have seen whatever files there were anyway because they would have to come from the local office, whether in Cork, Mayo or Roscommon, through the senior inspector, the divisional inspector and up to Dublin to the Commissioners for the simple purpose of signing this section 40 notice to enable the preliminary inspection to be made.  Invariably the Commissioners have the papers before them; the divisional inspector would have made recommendations to them to have this inspection if he thought it desirable because it is the only way <Col N="407" /> they can get the true picture.  This is for the sole purpose of expediting this procedure, to enable that senior officer, the divisional inspector&mdash;there are only four of them, the most senior men outside the chief inspector in the whole Land Commission organisation &mdash;to be authorised to sign this preliminary notice of inspection.</P>
    <P>There has been some talk here about the awful thing it is to interfere in any way with the reserved powers of the Lay Commissioners.  I pointed out last night, and it is well to emphasise it and particularly to direct the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to the drafting of this section.  It starts off: &ldquo;For the removal of doubt ...&rdquo; because there is very considerable doubt at law as to whether this has been in fact a reserved function of the Lay Commissioners, although they are in the practice of signing these notices.  I quoted for the House last night the whole of section 12 of the Land Act of 1950 which spells out in detail the reserved functions of the Lay Commissioners and in section 12 (1) from paragraph (a) to the very end, there is not a line to indicate that the signing of these notices is a reserved function of the Lay Commissioners, nor have I been able to trace back through the Land Acts any specific power authorising the Lay Commissioners to serve this particular notice.</P>
    <P>I concede that was the practice but I cannot find any legal basis for it and it is for that reason that this section is drafted in this way: &ldquo;For the removal of doubt....&rdquo; There are some sections, including a section in the much-vaunted Act of 1950, which would indicate to the contrary.  I refer to subsection (2) of section 12 which says:</P>
    <P>Any power or duty for the time being vested by law (including this Act) in the Land Commission or the Lay Commissioners may, save in relation to excepted matters, be exercised or performed by&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the Minister, or</P>
    <P>(b)  any officer of the Minister or the Land Commission for the <Col N="408" /> time being authorised whether specifically or by reference to a class of such officers, in that behalf by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Again in subsection (8) of the same section, it is stated:</P>
    <P>The following provisions shall have effect in relation to schemes for the rearrangement of lands held in rundale or intermixed plots whether with or without the distribution of other lands to facilitate the said rearrangement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  no such scheme shall be approved by virtue of subsection</P>
    <P>(2)  of this section save by an officer;</P>
    <P>(b)  the Minister shall not authorise pursuant to that subsection an officer to approve any such scheme unless the officer is an officer of the Land Commission and not below the rank of Senior Inspector.</P>
    <P>This is to deal with the question of rearrangement schemes by inspectors.</P>
    <P>Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a power or duty is exercised or performed by virtue of subsection (2) of this section by the Minister or an officer, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in exercising or performing the power or duty it becomes requisite that any document should be sealed with the common seal of the Land Commission,</P>
    <P>the Minister or such officer (as the case may be) may cause the document to be sealed as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>Among all the specific powers set out under section 12 (1) giving chapter and verse for the reserved powers of the Lay Commissioners there is no reference to this form of notice being reserved to their exclusive jurisdiction. Indeed, from other subsections I have quoted it might well be read into the law that the Minister has already this power but in this case&mdash;and it is for that purpose, let me emphasise, that the section is introduced&mdash;it is for the removal of legal doubts.</P>
    <P>The reserved functions or powers of the Lay Commissioners that are so very sacrosanct today were not so regarded by Deputy Dillon and his colleagues in 1950 because, under the Act <Col N="409" /> of that year, for the first time since 1923, they took away reserved powers of the Lay Commissioners that had existed since the foundation of the State, including the very important power of dealing with the question of rearrangement schemes for rundale estates.  There was no doubt that these powers were the exclusive domain of the Lay Commissioners but the then Government did not think there was anything wrong in removing these powers regarding rearrangement at that time.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of whatever smokescreens are being raised here to terrorise the people outside, this is merely a section for the removal of doubt to enable the divisional inspectors of the Land Commission to sign these notices. The section does not enable and will not enable, the political head of the Department of Lands, whoever he may be, to decide whether land may be taken.  That is still the reserved function of the Lay Commissioners.  No matter how many smokescreens are raised, that is the position and that is still the law.</P>

      <P>In intervening here, I emphasised and repeated again and again that I fully understood and wanted all to understand that the question of the acquisition of land is a reserved function.  The Minister cannot possibly charge me with seeking to create any fog or smokescreen on the ground of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now, let us take the Minister's explanation.  He says this section is only to remove doubt.  It is very doubtful but that the Minister had this power all along but is it not powerfully reinforcing my argument that Ministers for Lands, even the present Minister for Lands, have repeatedly got up in this House and said: &ldquo;I have nothing to do with this and I do not want to have anything to do with it&rdquo;?  Deputies will make representations to the Land Commission and they will deal with them.</P>

      <P>The Minister makes a case but all that is being asked here is that the senior inspector shall have power to issue the instrument known as Notice No. 40.  That is where the Minister misunderstands our case.  If it is the Land Commission who have the exclusive authority to authorise the senior inspector to issue Notice No. 40, we have no objection.  The whole kernel of our case is that now you are transferring from the Land Commission to the Minister the power to direct the senior inspector to issue Inspection Notice 40.  The Minister says that is in order to avoid the delay which heretofore has been created by the junior inspector down the country hearing the local deputation, having to open the file and send it to the senior inspector. The senior inspector has to send it to <Col N="411" /> the district inspector and he has to send it up to the Land Commission. The Minister for Lands is himself a solicitor.  Does his practice in that important profession not carry great weight in his mind that 80 years' practice of the land law of this country and the administration of land law here has produced a vast amount of litigation? This 80 years' experience of running this whole business of inspection should have produced some elaborate form of procedure in order to eliminate as far as humanly possible any gross error of judgment.</P>
      <P>There was the local inspector who heard the local people and opened the file.  There was the senior inspector who knew the general situation and his comments were put on the file, which had to go to the district inspector who knew the whole area and who was able to compare one area with another.  His comments had to go on the file and it was only at that stage that the file came up to the Land Commission. The Land Commission, knowing all these men, knowing their capacity and prudence, or lack of prudence, would read their reports and weigh up that testimony.  They would know which case required inspection and would then issue Inspection Order 40.</P>
      <P>Was that not a good thing?  Was that not a source of reassurance to us all?  Was it not a sound thing around the doctrine of fixity of tenure? So when the Minister says it is only to get rid of this whole procedure that section 27 is brought here, it appals me that that should be his approach. Any judge, far from getting rid of that procedure, when he was advocating, would want to strengthen it.  I want to erect between the headlights of Deputy Corry's car on its nocturnal inspection as powerful a citadel of defence as it is in the power of our Legislature to do and the more formidable that rampart is the greater assurance I have of saying: &ldquo;Do not mind poor Martin; that is codology.&rdquo; We all have in our constituencies busy bees.  There is not a farm in county Monaghan that has not been divided 45 times over at a Fianna Fáil Cumann.</P>

He told us how he went out by night and, throwing the lights of his car on his neighbour's farm, inspected it carefully for all the countryside to see.  I am only saying that is his particular way of doing it.  I am sure Deputy Carter will admit at Fianna Fáil cumainn when the distribution of a large holding in the area was to take place, it was specifically canvassed amongst the sophisticated and more ambitious supporters of Deputy Carter's area around Longford.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Carter it was bunk.  Can we say that any more?  Because if in the future Deputy Carter is sent to Dublin to get a man's land inspected and he fails he will be told when he goes back to Longford that the Minister thinks Deputy Carter is bunk because his judgment and advice have been ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am grateful to Deputy Carter and Deputy Corry, for they illustrated most eloquently the very point I have sought to make.  I agree with Deputy Carter 100 per cent that up to the day when we enact Section 27 the lantern lighted meetings of the Fianna Fáil cumann to divide land or get land inspected in Ireland were pure bunk.  I cannot say that when Section 27 comes into law. Will the Minister not agree with me <Col N="413" /> that that is true.  Heretofore, he and I were in a position to say, if we were informed a meeting of a political organisation had been held to require the inspection of land or its division, bunk.  All they can do is report the facts to the Land Commission where they will be efficiently examined and appropriate steps taken.  If Section 27 passes can we ever say that again? It is my submission we cannot.  That is the very heart of the matter.</P>
    <P>I want to be able to say to Deputy Corry's carrying on exactly what Deputy Carter has said&mdash;it was bunk. I want to be able to say the next time I am called down to Monaghan to answer a suggestion that a Fianna Fáil Deputy has been dividing land at a Fianna Fáil cumann meeting that it was bunk.  I can never say that again in regard to the inspection of land for acquisition when section 27 passes. Now a Fianna Fáil Deputy will not go to the Land Commissioners but to the Minister and he can say to him: &ldquo;Well, even if you do not believe the land ought to be acquired, why can you not do me the good turn of sending out an inspector to inspect it? Then if the Land Commission turn it down we can put the blame on the Land Commission but, in the meantime, we will have knocked the roar out of the fellow.  That fellow was standing outside the booth running a car and this will give us a chance to put the Minister&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the means which are perhaps the only ones that some people in this country understand.  I <Col N="414" /> do not want to see that happening in our time.  I am not now pleading that the existing restriction be preserved solely for the control of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am asking that the existing restriction be preserved to control the political head of the Land Commission no matter to what Party he belongs, whether it be the Labour Party, the Fianna Fáil Party, the Clann na Talmhan Party or any other political Party in this House.</P>
      <P>The last matter which appears to me the Minister for Lands has wholly failed to understand refers to the case I have sought to make relating to the position of the Secretary of the Department of Lands who is appointed a Land Commissioner.  The Minister has pointed out here perfectly rightly that heretofore an Inspection Order No. 40 has been signed on the authority of the Land Commission, before which, subsequently, came the whole question of acquisition procedure.  That is true. The new position under this Bill, and it is a very special position and I beg Deputies to understand it, will be that the Secretary of the Department of Lands will have two separate and distinct functions.  One of his functions would be that of Land Commissioner. Here he is utterly independent of the Minister and in a quasi-judicial position. But his second position is that of Secretary to the Department of Lands and under the high professional ethics of the public service he is the Minister's faithful servant.  Whether he agrees with the Minister or not, his position is he has not only the right but the duty, when the Minister consults him, to differ emphatically from the Minister if he thinks the Minister is wrong.  But at the end of the discussion the Minister says a decision has to be made and he makes his decision. Whether the Secretary agrees with the decision or whether he most emphatically dissents from it, his duty is to say: &ldquo;Very well, Minister; effect will be given to your decision to the best of my ability to ensure its success.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Envisage the situation.  The Minister calls in his Secretary one morning and says: &ldquo;Instruct the divisional inspector or the senior inspector in such and <Col N="415" /> such an area to inspect Pat McAuley's farm.&rdquo;  The Secretary says: &ldquo;That is a most monstrous proposal; that is a well worked farm; the Land Commission have surveyed that whole area many times before; to send an inspector into that man's home will create pandemonium.&rdquo;  The Minister asks: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; and the Secretary explains the reason and puts the case very strongly against it, and says: &ldquo;Whoever put that recommendation to the Minister is a notorious mischief maker and is walking the Minister into seas of sorrow if he goes in there.&rdquo;  The Minister says: &ldquo;I have listened to all that; go and inspect it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Remember what the Secretary's obligation is.  He has argued with the Minister.  He has been perfectly open and frank.  He has stuck his neck out and has criticised, perhaps, a colleague of the Minister and said that the man is a notorious mischief maker.  The Minister says: &ldquo;Those are my directions: carry them out.&rdquo;  Now, Inspection Order No. 40 issued on the Minister's instructions, against the Secretary's advice, and the reports of the inspection come up to the Land Commission but the Land Commissioner sitting to consider the report is the Secretary now in his capacity as Land Commissioner.</P>
    <P>What is his dilemma.  His dilemma is not to reverse or change his own mind. His dilemma is: &ldquo;How am I to give effect to what I know is the Minister's mind in this matter as Secretary of his Department when, in my other capacity as a Commissioner, I entirely disagree with him?  I know precisely what to do as Secretary: my duty would be to carry out my Minister's instructions; but now I am in the position that as Secretary of his Department, I have an obligation to carry out his direction while as a member of the Land Commission I have a clear, conscientious duty to rule against him.&rdquo;  The Minister will say: &ldquo;My only instruction was to have the land inspected and there my decision stopped&rdquo;.  Technically, I think that case can be made but the Secretary knows perfectly well that if <Col N="416" /> the Minister, having heard all the objections, still says: &ldquo;Let inspection be made&rdquo;, the high probability is that the Minister feels the land ought to be acquired unless he is simply prostituting his office to do a political turn for a political colleague.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister tells the Secretary to have the land inspected, the implication is he does not feel the land should be acquired.  The Secretary's dilemma is whether he should fulfil and respect his obligations as Secretary of the Department or whether he should do his duty as a Land Commissioner. That situation is certain to arise repeatedly.  I want to re-emphasise that in this there is a slight departure from the law.  In our judgment, the individual who is today Secretary of the Department is eminently eligible for appointment to the Land Commission. In our judgment, the individual who happens to be Secretary of the Department is discharging the duty of his office with distinction and has done so, no matter what Minister he has served, and he has served various administrations.</P>
    <P>My submission is that under the law as it is proposed in this Bill you may have the Secretary of the Department discharging the dual function of Secretary and of Commisioner.  I do not know whether there is any use hoping for reason to prevail.  The Minister says this is merely a time-saving device. He says: &ldquo;That is all I want; I am interested in nothing else but a time-saving device.&rdquo;  We on this side look on this as fundamental, something very precious to us, something we feel is extremely important, something which we gravely apprehend will materially injure the whole system of land tenure in this country.</P>
    <P>We are readily conceding in public that there are many excellent proposals in this Bill.  Is it unreasonable, in these circumstances, for the Opposition to say: &ldquo;The only thing you seek to serve in this provision is the matter of a trivial expediting of inspection procedure.  In our eyes, this goes right down to the foundations of something we find is vital to the social stability of rural Ireland.&rdquo;  Even <Col N="417" /> if you do not agree with us, even if you take up the position that the Opposition are exaggerating and do not mean what they say, if we tell you with the utmost possible sincerity that that is our profound conviction, to the point of asserting that when we have the responsibility we shall repeal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Opposition feel so passionately about it, let it go.&rdquo;  I suggest to the Minister that if this Parliament is to do a useful function, that is a much more constructive approach to legislation than simply to stick your heels in and say: &ldquo;What I have written I have written.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the Minister were in a position to say: &ldquo;Here is a great principle on one side of which Fianna Fáil stand and on the other, Fine Gael&rdquo;, then there would be no solution but to put it to the test of a division, no matter how long the debate.  However, we crystallise it to the score where the Government say this is purely a device to expedite procedure, involving no question of principle, whereas we say the Government labour under a misapprehension, that this is a fundamental principle which we are most passionately concerned to defend.</P>
      <P>In such circumstances, is it rational for the Government to say they will not yield an inch?  For 80 years, in very much more difficult and tempestuous times, the existing system for the initiation of inspection proceedings has functioned quite satisfactorily&mdash; certainly as satisfactorily as Parliament functions, as trial by jury functions, both of which have their moments of exasperation, of apparently undue delays, but both of which in the long run have made substantial contributions to the social pattern in which we live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it unreasonable to say to the Government: &ldquo;Let us agree to differ: you think it is a trivial <Col N="418" /> matter; we think it is fundamental&rdquo;? This is a long Bill, on many sections of which we shall probably differ on principle and on which the Government will have to stand, but nobody can say this is a great matter of principle from the Government's point of view.  That is the way it seems to us and surely human prudence would suggest to the Minister, who is naturally anxious to get his Bill through the House, that he should say: &ldquo;Very well, then; let the thing ride.  Drop section 27.  If I find the operation of the land acquisition goal is being unduly held up, I shall come back to the House and ask to be allowed to prepare some scheme to remedy it.  We have got on without section 27 for 80 years.  We shall try to get on without it now.  Let us get the Bill passed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that were the Minister's approach to the Bill, he would get it.  It is not being held up because we think it is a bad Bill.  We think many of the provisions are good, the enactment of which we are anxious to expedite.  Here is something which the Minister himself describes as trivial.  To us it appears to be one of vital importance on which we are prepared publicly to stake our reputation.  Surely then, commonsense demands that the Minister should say: &ldquo;Drop the damn thing; let us get on with the Bill.  Tomorrow is another day.  I can always come back if I find it necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister should be prepared on a measure of this kind to meet all reasonable representations.  It is by that approach that improvements will be effected in the measure.  It is exasperating and wrong for any Government to seek to defend a matter which they themselves describe as having relatively no significance, as being nothing more than a device to promote expedition.  To refuse to make any concession whatever when the proposal presents itself to the Opposition in an entirely different aspect is unreasonable.  If he were reasonable, the Minister would drop section 27.  If pure dogged obstinacy is to be the tenor of our discussions, then our duty is to fight as long as we can and as hard as we can to see that a vital principle is defended to the end but that is a <Col N="419" /> kind of debate which I deplore, a kind of debate which does little to improve the kind of legislation this House produces.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to know under which particular thimble the pea is on this section because, the arguments of Deputy Dillon having been demolished when he suggested that there was something wrong in the Land Commissioners deciding something on reports sent up by their own inspectors he comes up in a rather different way, tying up Commissioner O'Brien with this section.</P>
      <P>He was careful to say that Commissioner O'Brien was a man of very high reputation and worthy of any public office in this country but he again suggests&mdash;and again this is for the purpose of misinterpreting the section&mdash;that Commissioner O'Brien must <i>per se</i> become, because he is Secretary of the Department, some type of political creature of any Minister for Lands that may be there.</P>

      <P>Commissioner O'Brien was appointed Commissioner for the further purpose, in my view, of improving the Land Commission administration but Commissioner Deegan, <Col N="420" /> before leaving the office of Commissioner for Lands as Lay Commissioner wrote this letter and left it in the Department:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before leaving the Department, I want to place on record my most definite view that the Secretary of the Land Commission cannot do his work as satisfactorily as he would wish to do it or as he should do it, unless he is at the same time a Commissioner.  From my administrative experience in other Departments and from outside knowledge of the Land Commission, I held that view when I came here as Secretary in 1930; my years as Secretary and Commissioner from 1930 confirmed it; the past couple of years when I have been Commissioner without administrative responsibility have doubly confirmed it for me.  It is, or should be, an axiom that the Permanent Head and Accounting Officer of a Department should be effectively aware of everything that is happening in his Department and should be in a position to ensure administrative and financial efficiency and correctness.  Here in the Land Commission a Secretary who is not a Commissioner does not come in contact with large blocks of most important work until something goes wrong; the most troublesome and danger-holding items of our business (those matters related to the acquisition and distribution of land) are routed direct to Commissioners and unless the Secretary is himself a Commissioner &ldquo;anything may happen&rdquo; without his knowledge, and, though Permanent Head of the Department, he has not the opportunity which he should have of controlling in good time, in the interests of efficiency, economy and financial correctness, the administration for which he is responsible.  It is definitely wrong that there should be work in progress in any Department in regard to which the Permanent head and Accounting Officer has no effective say: and, as regards the Land Commission, I wish to state to you, with the certainty born of long experience inside and outside the Land Commission, that that position can be avoided only if the <Col N="421" /> posts of Secretary and Commissioner are combined, and to emphasise once more my very definite view that the Secretary here should always be a Commissioner.  The fact that I held the two posts for so many years and during periods of exceptional stress shows that there is nothing impossible in the proposition&mdash;indeed each post makes the operation of the other easier for the holder.</P>
    <P>That letter was sent by Commissioner Deegan on 13th October, 1951 to the then Minister for Lands. Who appointed Commissioner Deegan?</P>

      <P>It is rather a pity that Deputy James Dillon did not, before he started on the headlights of my car, consult my colleagues in his Party who both congratulated me on doing a good job.  It shows where ignorance leads some people.  The facts in this case that Deputy Dillon has brought out so strongly were that for five years the Land Commission were willing to buy and the owner of the farm was willing to sell.  The crux between the two of them was on account of some provision of a Land Act that where there was not a case of migration the money must be paid in land bonds and not in cash.  That was the position that my predecessors in that part of the constituency endeavoured to rectify and failed.  Ultimately the farm was put up for public auction.  The auctioneer was my colleague, Deputy Burton.  The farm was to be sold on a Thursday.  As I have stated, I got word of it on Friday night and the first occasion that I could travel the 65 miles to my neighbour's farm, with the headlights on, was a Monday night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> I examined the position there in the light of whether there would be migration or not and I established to my own satisfaction that there would be migration into that holding.  All round it were smallholders whom we, my colleagues on that side, the Labour representatives and myself, agreed should get the holding divided amongst them.  I did my utmost and met the fullest co-operation of the Minister for Lands and the Department of Lands on it.  I arrived there at a quarter past 12 on Wednesday.  The farm was for public auction on Thursday and I was able to prove to the Minister and his officials that there would be migration into that holding and that, therefore, they were entitled to go down on Thursday morning, bid for that holding at the public auction and buy it. These were the circumstances and the result of it is that framed over there in the Land Commission for whoever succeeds the present Minister is a letter, the first letter of its type ever to come into the Land Commission, from all the tenants between whom that holding has been divided stating that they were all satisfied and thanking the Minister for his work.</P>
    <P>That is a monument and that is the monument to which Deputy Dillon objects.  He objects because power is given in this section to a Minister of this House, to an elected representative of this House.  Because we endeavour to give him power to rule in his Department he talks about the shaky Fianna Fáil Party and the danger of Deputy Corry's going in and threatening the Minister: &ldquo;Unless you divide up this place I will resign.&rdquo; There is no member of the Fianna Fáil Party who wants any dictation about loyalty and if we did the last person we would take it from is Deputy James Dillon.  Deputy James Dillon came into this House as a member of what he called a centre Party but, without consulting that Party, as soon as the Fine Gael Party became a Fascist Blue Shirt Party he left that Party and allied himself with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Who knows where he will jump next?  I do not think the Labour Party would take him.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. One of the important things about this section is that it does give the right to members of this House when they ask for a farm to be inspected to ask the Minister at a subsequent date whether it was taken over or not.  At the present time the right to do that is not there. That is a very important part of the section.  Secondly, as far as Deputy Dillon's reference to land grabbers is concerned, he does not realise that the modern land grabber is the man with more land than he is able to use and more money than he knows what to do with it, who has a craze for possessing more land and buys every bit of land that comes up within 40 miles of where he lives.  While I am not in agreement with many provisions in the Bill, if this section prevents this gentleman from continuing his activities it will be very useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister pretends there is nothing exceptional about section 27 of this Bill, that it is only meant to be used as a means of getting a pool of land quicker that would in any case be taken by the Commissioners if they had the opportunity and the time to get around to it.  It has been shown beyond all doubt that there is a much greater significance in it than this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us on this side of the House are anxious to see the largest possible pool of land being made available for the relief of congestion and for distribution among deserving people but the difference between us on this side of <Col N="425" /> the House and the people on the other side of the House seems to be that we are not prepared to get this pool of land at any price.  We believe the people who own land here at the present time have not robbed it and that that ownership entitles them to reasonable treatment. The owners of land in this country have gone through very hard and difficult times.  The agricultural policy of this Government has driven many people away from the land and away from the country but I believe that if this section goes through many more people will be driven away.  In the hard times many people clung to their farms and their homes simply because they felt they were the owners of those homes and when the worst came to the worst nobody could put them out of those homes.</P>
    <P>Here we have a section enabling the Minister to direct inspection.  That inspection is a serious thing in the country.  It is a serious thing once the Land Commission display an interest at all.  All dealings in a farm which is inspected are frozen for a period of 12 months according to this Bill.  The very fact that an inspector comes in there does an irreparable amount of harm to that landowner whether the land is subsequently taken away from him or not.  He himself feels acquisition is now inevitable, that he is not free to sell to anybody except the Land Commission. He loses interest in his holding and his credit position is ruined.  The Minister in dealing with the various sections of this Bill has quoted the National Farmers Association in support of it. He did not quote the National Farmers Association in connection with this section where they say:</P>
    <P>We consider that these powers should be reserved to the lay commissioners as heretofore and that the number of commissioners should be restored to six, if necessary.</P>
    <P>They have given a great deal of consideration to this Bill and they largely represent the people of rural Ireland, not only the people who at present own land but those also who are anxious to get farms or to increase the size of their holdings.  I would say their membership would contain many more people <Col N="426" /> who feel at present they have uneconomic holdings and that they are entitled to additional land, people who really have no land, who are farmers' sons and who are well qualified to make the best use of it, than it does those who are in possession of land at the present and who do not want to lose it.  I believe that many of the recommendations of the National Farmers Association represent compromise, because they know it has been the practice with Ministers of the present Government up to now to oppose with all their might the recommendations of rural organisations.  The Minister and his supporters are looking for more teeth.  There are many people who believe that Fianna Fáil Ministers have already far too many teeth, and they do not hesitate to show them.  There are many people I know who speak in whispers because they are afraid of political victimisation.  I believe this puts a powerful instrument in the hands of a Fianna Fáil Minister to enable him to victimise anybody who does not appear to be a supporter of him and his Party.</P>
    <P>This is a dangerous provision and it is one which should be resisted.  It will be resisted by all of us here.  It is our duty to inform people outside of the dangers inherent in this section. No one will henceforth feel secure on his land.  I believe this is only a beginning. We shall have more of this.  We shall have legislation, perhaps next week, or the week after, enabling Ministers to go in and inspect someone's shop or someone's factory and, if they are not satisfed with the way in which these properties are being used, they will promptly introduce legislation enabling them to take the premises over and give them to someone else whom they think will make better use of them.  It is time the people woke up to what is happening. As I say, I am sorry the opposition of the rural organisations is not stronger. What they recommend is a compromise because they feel that the most they can expect from the present Government is a compromise.  Otherwise, I believe the representations and recommendations would be very much stronger.</P>

      <P>Deputy Clinton and his colleagues are, of course, put out.  They do not like the idea of Fianna Fáil subscribing to the family farm.  They do not like the idea of the NFA agreeing tentatively with certain proposals. Deputy Dillon acted the bully here this morning.  He often casts himself in the role of the bully when anyone has the temerity to cross him.  He turns upon whatever Member objects to his views.  First of all, he tries to demolish him by ridicule.  When he cannot achieve that, he proceeds to preach a panegyric on the merits of prevarication, on the merits of ambiguity, on the merits of the Fine Gael policy of sidestepping every real issue that faces the country.</P>
      <P>I want to show up now some of the sidestepping tactics of Deputy Oliver Flanagan and the Deputies lined up behind him.  As I said last night, we are facing a by-election in Galway and the whole Fine Gael effort is directed at the farmers of South Galway, designed to pretend that the Fianna Fáil Party are undermining the foundations of the land of this country. We all know the need for this section. We all subscribe to it.  We commend the Minister for having the courage to introduce this provision.  If the Minister did not answer for this provision here where else would he do it? This is a democratic assembly and Deputies opposite know very well that the Minister is open to criticism here. They also know that any client who feels aggrieved has the Land Court at his disposal and, not only that, but he has two others as well to protect his property.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the main Opposition is obviously pretending and he carries his pretence to the extent of pretending to be frightened by the implications he says are contained in this section.  That cuts no ice with those who know the Leader of the main Opposition, who know his tactics, who know his fondness for prevarication.  He is pragmatic about the importance of this Bill merely because he knows that the Bill is designed to provide for the family farm.  It is because it does that that we so strongly support the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> We are prepared to take on the Fine Gael Party on this issue here or on the platforms in Galway.  We charge the Fine Gael Party with delaying tactics, with a desire to build up a great volume of paper in Merrion Street and with an anxiety to delay every step we propose in order to emancipate the small farmers and provide for them a decent standard of living in their own land.  That is what this section is designed to do and that is what the Fine Gael Party does not want it to do. We fought against Deputy Dillon and the Blue Shirts to establish and maintain a democracy here.  All down the years we have had to fight on this side of the House to ensure that that democracy will survive.  We do that in good faith and in the hope of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> providing a decent standard of living for all our people, including our farmers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon cannot stomach naked fact.  What is the naked fact in section 27?  The Minister for Lands has the moral and physical courage to bring before this House legislation without having a scapegoat.  For the first time, a Minister for Lands has no need of a scapegoat in the person of the Chief Executive Officer of his Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>The power is contained in the section.  The Minister should rightly have power to direct or ask his senior inspectorate to view and recommend the acquisition of any farm, the acquisition of which he thinks would further economic aims. The Fine Gael Party have every opportunity to query the Minister on any <Col N="429" /> steps he may take subsequent to the passing of the Bill.  Let it not be contended that anything detrimental to the liberty of the subject is being done. It is not.  I refute that kind of miserable propaganda, for that is all it is. What is the Minister trying to do? What is the aim of the section?  It implements not merely the recommendations of the late Pope John but also those of EEC and every progressive country in Europe to obtain for the farmers a reasonable standard of living. Measured by industry and commerce at the moment, the farmers do not enjoy such a high standard of living. We are setting out to raise that. That is why the old men of the sea in Fine Gael are vexed.  They do not like that.  They do not like the fact that we are cutting through red tape, burning some of the paper Deputy Dillon wishes to build up in Merrion Street.  Before the end of the 1970's, if we live that long, we shall see Deputy Dillon eating some of his speeches in this House and outside it. God knows there is no man in public life who would have the difficulty that Deputy Dillon would have eating his own speeches.  No man on this or the other side of the House would have as much difficulty as Deputy Dillon eating the reams of paper with the empty slogans and the empty shibboleths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to arouse political acrimony in this debate nor do I want to prepare a platform for Galway, but whether Fine Gael like it or not the Fine Gael Party have done just that for us.  They have paved the way to make a case for section 27 and, indeed, for the whole Land Bill.  As the Minister rightly said, he has the power to delegate to his senior inspectors, of whom there are about four, the power to look up land.  What is wrong with that?  If we side-step&mdash;as Deputy Dillon would not&mdash;the paper build-up, the passing of files here and there from country to Dublin and back again, what do we find?  We find that those inspectors, from a long knowledge and wide experience, will be able to do the task that the Minister assigns to them. Deputy Dillon bewails the fact that in 40 years this was the first time such <Col N="430" /> a provision was sought in land legislation. Of course, but I should like Deputy Dillon and his colleagues to know that this is the first time the real problem of land division and rearrangement was grappled with. Merely because the Minister has taken the initiative and is prepared, as I said, to defend and maintain his attitude the Fine Gael Party do not like it.  They would much prefer a vague attempt being made with a weak Executive and, of course, look out for scapegoats as usual.</P>
    <P>One cannot visualise a clean-cut programme for land division under those circumstances.  One cannot visualise the Fine Gael Party subscribing to or tackling a clean-cut system of land re-settlement.  That, in short, is precisely what is wrong with Fine Gael and why we hear all this shouting across the House and why we see the attempt to make out that Fianna Fáil would like to be cast in the role of another Khrushchev.  Deputy Dillon would very much like to be a Khrushchev; he might have the intellectual ability to be, but not the moral or physical courage, but he will accuse us on this side of the House of emulating such characters when we are merely trying to regulate something that Michael Davitt and the men who fought the Land War dreamed of and thought up longing to see the day when there would be viable units in the country and the smallest farmer would at least be able to say: &ldquo;Well, I have a reasonably economic farm of land.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputies who spoke this morning seem to be directing most of their energies against the Fine Gael Party and criticising the speech made by the Leader of the main Opposition.  Deputy Carter made no reference to the section with which we are dealing.  He said that he is anxious to see the small farmers getting a decent standard of living and that that is the policy of his Government. In order to give the smallholders a decent standard of living on the land one must first give them security.  To have a high standard of living on the land and be overshadowed by the evils of insecurity and instability will not <Col N="431" /> encourage people to remain and work on the land, to respect and love the land.  We hear Government speakers endeavouring to present a case in support of section 27, to give the impression they are devoting their energies towards improving the standard of living of people on their holdings whilst at the same time they are depriving them of the security and fixity of tenure they have enjoyed for almost 100 years.</P>
      <P>This section has been debated at great length and much sound opposition has been advanced, but the Minister for Lands has given no reason for the section beyond the fact that, when this becomes law, he claims it will speed up and expedite the acquisition and division of land.  The Leader of the main Opposition made a very reasonable plea to the Minister this morning.  I want to refer to that plea briefly.  I am prompted to do so by the allegation of Deputy Carter that we are deliberately obstructing this Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Carter repeats that allegation, along with applause from himself.  This Party have never held up legislation for the benefit of the community.  On the contrary, we have always expedited the passage of such legislation.  We have stated that there are provisions in this Bill with which we wholeheartedly agree, but the main reason for our opposition to the Bill is the very section we are now discussing.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Carter is anxious for a speedy passage of this Bill, could he and his colleagues not ask their own Minister to view this matter with commonsense and intelligence and have the inspection of lands come, not from the Minister, but from the Land Commissioners? What we fear, and what every landowner is shivering in his boots about, is that some future Minister can, at his own whim, reduce the value of land overnight, be it ten or 500 acres.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but I seem to <Col N="432" /> have heard all that on several occasions before.

      <P>Despite our best efforts, we have not succeeded in extracting from the Minister an explanation as to why he is pressing this section.  More serious still, there has been no explanation from him as to why the Secretary of his Department should have the right to sit as a Commissioner and decide on the merits or demerits of inspections carried out at his direction.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that on the records of the Land Commission was a letter written by Mr. Deegan to the Minister for Lands in October, 1951, prior to Mr. Deegan's retirement.  I do not know why the Minister for Lands should today quote a letter written in 1951, which has no bearing whatever on the situation today.  Everybody knows Mr. Deegan was Secretary of the Department and a Commissioner many years ago.  If section 27 had been enacted in legislation when Mr. Deegan was Secretary of the Department and a Commissioner, what would his views have been?  The Minister has endeavoured to paint a picture that Mr. Deegan asserted the proper procedure would be that the Secretary of the Department should be a Commissioner in order to be familiar with the entire workings of the Department of Lands and the Land Commission and that it was necessary in the interests of efficiency and economy and of having the best possible expert advice.  But what the Minister did not convey to us was that at that time the Minister for Lands had no right to instruct any officer in his Department to carry out an inspection of any farm in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I prophesy that the Minister is creating a position in which the Civil Service head of his Department will find it intolerable to remain on as a <Col N="433" /> Commissioner.  Nobody is more anxious to see this Bill pass than I am.  I am very much concerned with the relief of congestion and I realise what a problem it is.  If the Minister wants a speedy passage for this Bill, let him admit there is no comparison between the terms of this Bill in 1964 and the period when Mr. Deegan was Secretary of the Department and a Commissioner.</P>
    <P>In the past hour the Minister and other speakers have tried to convey that Deputy Dillon in his speech this morning said the present Secretary would be acting on political instructions. Everybody knows that that charge was not made from this side of the House.  Anybody familiar with the brilliant manner in which the present Secretary discharges his duties would be far from making an accusation of that kind.  Deputy Dillon prefaced his remarks by stating that in this country today there was nobody more highly qualified to occupy the position of Secretary of the Department than the present Secretary.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister what will be the position when, for political purposes or otherwise, pressure is brought to bear on him by his Party and he feels that, to comply with the wishes of his Party, an inspection of lands should be carried out, no matter how undesirable this may be and no matter whether the holding is large or small.  That will be the situation facing him if this section is passed.  Will the Minister carry out the instructions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the principal purposes of the Bill is to make it possible for the Government to implement and ratify <Col N="434" /> the Fisheries Convention concluded in London along with three associated Agreements and Protocol, on 9th March this year.  The Convention, Agreements and Protocol were signed by the Taoiseach on 18th March. Copies have been laid before both Houses for the information of Deputies and members of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>We are not concerned in this Bill with the territorial seas but only with the exclusive fishery limits of the State, and I wish to emphasise that the breadth of the territorial seas of the State remains at three miles, in accordance with section 3 of the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that we were very glad indeed to accept the invitation to take part in the Conference on Fisheries which assembled in London on the initiative of the British Government. The outcome of that conference &mdash;the Convention which is now before the Dáil&mdash;is the welcome culmination of persistent efforts by the Government for a number of years to secure the extension of our exclusive fishery limits.  Since 1958 my Department and the Department of Fisheries have taken part in several international conferences and have been in constant diplomatic contact with many Governments with a view to getting acceptance of an appropriate world-wide international agreement on this problem.  I am happy to say that although we failed to obtain the world-wide agreement we sought we have at least succeeded in getting the extension of exclusive fishery limits with the goodwill of our neighbouring countries.</P>
    <P>Deputies may recollect that, despite the great measure of international approval for the Canadian and United States proposals at the First Geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea in 1958 and for the joint United States/Canadian proposals at the Second Geneva Conference in 1960 in favour of extending exclusive fishery zones beyond the territorial seas, no further progress in this matter was made until the conclusion of the London Fisheries Convention this year. This Convention is a regional agreement only, but is in conformity with <Col N="435" /> the growing tendency in all parts of the world, accelerated since the 1958 and 1960 conferences, to recognise the right of States to exclusive fishery limits extending beyond the territorial seas.  The tendency may perhaps be attributed to a gradual recognition in international law of the priority rights of fishermen of the coastal state to exploit the waters within a reasonable distance of their own coasts even though those waters are not within their territorial seas.  The tendency may also be described as an obvious practical means of ensuring the conservation of fishery resources around the coastal state and their development primarily for the use of the local population.</P>
    <P>The London Convention provides that a party to it may, without objection from other parties, extend its fishery limits to a distance of 12 miles from the coast or straight baselines, as the case may be.  Within the outer six miles of that 12-mile belt, a right to fish is recognised to States which have habitually fished there between January, 1953, and December, 1962. We propose to designate such States by order under section 3 (1) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Convention also provides in Article 9 that States parties which have habitually fished within the 3 to 6-mile belt should be allowed a reasonable period of time to adapt themselves to their exclusion from that belt.  The implementation of this provision of the Convention has been effected by one of the associated Agreements between the Government of Ireland, on the one hand and the Governments of Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain on the other, and in section 3 (2) of this Bill we take power to implement the provisions of this associated Agreement.  Under subsection 3 (2), the Government propose to designate Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain, thereby giving the fishermen of those countries a right to fish in the appropriate areas within the 3 to 6-mile belt up to December, 1965, where the baseline is low water mark, and up to <Col N="436" /> December, 1966, in areas measured from straight baselines.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Bill, therefore, will be that when it comes into operation, the vessels of the countries which I have indicated may continue to fish in the appropriate areas of the 3 to 6-mile zone until the end of 1965 along most of the east coast and where no straight baselines have been drawn, and until the end of 1966 around the rest of the coast; but after those dates, the vessels of those countries will be permitted to fish only in appropriate areas outside the six mile limit.  Vessels of all other states will be excluded from the 12-mile belt from the coming into operation of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party support this measure.  We express regret that agreement at the international conference to which the Minister referred was not reached and that it has become necessary to approach the problem of the rights of fishermen on a regional basis.  This development has been rendered necessary and it particularly concerns a country such as Ireland where the fishermen form an important part of our community with rights which it is important for us to safeguard and where the fishing industry is an important aspect of our economic life.  I should point out that the Bill gives effect to the suggestion which Deputies of this Party made some time ago in the Dáil when legislation to that effect was moved by members of the Fine Gael Party.  Accordingly we welcome this piece of legislation, which, as the Minister said, is to give effect to the Convention already signed by a number of Governments, including ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain aspects of the way in which this Bill will be worked out in practice to which I should like the Minister to make reference.  I refer in particular to the enforcement of this legislation.  We are all aware of the considerable difficulties that exist at present for the enforcement service in endeavouring to secure the rights of our fishermen within the three mile limit.  I do not think I can be accused of giving any information to poaching trawlermen if I say that our resources <Col N="437" /> are far from adequate to ensure that the effect of this Bill is realised in practice.  I would be happier with this measure if I were certain its provisions could be given effect to fully in practice.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should be interested to know the number of vessels available at present to protect these rights, and it would be of interest to know how many are in actual commission at present.  I believe the number is extremely small, and this Bill might end up as a dead letter unless steps are taken to ensure that situation is remedied.</P>
    <P>There is one matter of detail on which I should like some information from the Minister when he is replying. Will he indicate what countries will be subject to the order under section 3 (1)?  It is not quite clear to me from the Minister's remarks whether all the countries which he has mentioned are included under the order in section 3 (1).  I should be glad if he would indicate what countries he considers will get the benefit of that order which will give those countries the right to fish in the outer six mile belt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody welcomes the extension of our fishery limits.  All Parties in the country or at least within the House can claim credit over a long period of years for the extension of the fishery limits.  We should also welcome the fact that there was this conference on fisheries which has resulted in the signing of certain agreements between this country and other countries.  On occasions here in the House, when the Minister was questioned as to whether or not we should extend our fishery limits, he has invariably replied over the past few years that he was waiting for an international convention of a bigger size than the one referred to here so that there could be more or less a wider agreement with a bigger number of nations.  In any case, I think that the nations that have signed this convention are the only nations with which we would be concerned as far as our fishery limits go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On occasions, there have been complaints by Irish fishermen that certain <Col N="438" /> other nations fished within the three mile limit as we have now.  We had reports and evidence to the effect that Russian fishermen were fishing off the south and south-east coasts of this country.  I do not say that the Minister should have or could have come to any agreement with the Russians. I merely point it out to show that we still may be subject to incursions by fishermen of other nations.  In any case, it is satisfactory that we have this agreement with the British, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Belgians.  If the convention is strictly adhered to, we have more or less the type of fishery limits we have advocated here for some time.</P>
    <P>Of course, this is not the end of the problem as far as the fishing industry is concerned.  It does not necessarily mean that by the extension of fishery limits we will have far bigger catches and that the fishing industry will go ahead by leaps and bounds.  This is one step and a very desirable step but, in the ultimate, if we are to make progress in the fishing industry there must be vigorous action not by the Minister for External Affairs but by other Ministers concerned.  First, as has been referred to by Deputy Costello, there is the question of the protection of our fishery limits.  Nobody will contradict me when I say that even now, with the three mile fishery limit, we find it very difficult, if not impossible, to protect the fishing waters within that limit.  How much more difficult, then, will it be to protect the fishing waters within six or twelve miles?  The Government should take steps to ensure that our fishery protection vessels will be increased in number so that our fishermen will feel assured that the Government are doing everything they can in order to reserve these fishing grounds to our Irish fishermen.</P>
    <P>Another problem, which is not at all the responsibility of the Minister for External Affairs&mdash;it is the responsibility of the Government&mdash;is the equipping of our fishermen in a far better way than they are now.  I think that only a very small portion of our fishing fleet will be able to take advantage of <Col N="439" /> this extension.  Many of our boats are certainly not equipped nor are they of the size to extend their fishing up to the 12 mile fishery limit which is provided for in the convention, a copy of which the Minister has kindly circulated to us.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear to be too controversial or to cause any trouble and for that reason I shall mention this matter very briefly.  I notice that this agreement has been signed by the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government of Ireland and, on the other hand, by the representatives of the Governments of Belgium, the French Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  We have had some difficulty in recent years with regard to the right of the fishermen of the Six Counties to fish within the three mile limit we had up to the present time.  Would the Minister be in a position, today, to state the rights of the fishermen from the Six Counties and what will be the rights of the fishermen of the Six Counties from 1965 and 1966?  I raise this matter particularly because I note that one of the signatures to this convention is on behalf of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  I should like to know if the fishermen of the Six Counties are to be placed in the same category as the fishermen from the island of Great Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points in this measure to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister.  It is not a controversial measure from our point of view.  We are glad that the fishery limits are now extended to six miles and the user limits to a distance of 12 miles.  There are two points on which I think we ought to consult and advise together.  One is the matter mentioned by Deputy Corish.  I am not quite sure if he is conscious of the full implication of the matter to which he has referred.  The constitutional position of Ireland is that the coastal waters of this island belong to us.  So far as I know, nobody has ever said by statute or otherwise that the administration of <Col N="440" /> Northern Ireland extends beyond the land territory of the Six Counties of north-east Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I raised the matter because the convention describes the Government as the Government of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It has never been our practice to stand on meticulous detail of that kind.  In the negotiations for international agreement, we describe ourselves as &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;: we are&mdash;nobody can alter that fact.  But the Constitution in fact remains and it or the relevant statutes are studied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In other agreements with Great Britain do we refer to the Government of Great Britain or to the Government of Great Britain and Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter on which I would not be able to give a considered reply without reference to documents.  I think the Minister is right in participating in this international convention whether, for instance, the Federal Republic of Germany wants to describe itself as &ldquo;Germany&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Federal Republic of Germany&rdquo; or whatever cognomen it may elect to attach to itself.  We know well that when the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany signs an international instrument it refers to that part of Germany over which he presides though he may have reservations that he should be recognised as Chancellor of the United Germany.  However, this is not an occasion on which it seems to me appropriate to argue these high constitutional principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, from our point of view, it is important that we should bear in mind that nobody has ever claimed, in any of the long chapter of statutes regulating relations between ourselves and Great Britain, that the Northern Ireland administration was erected or established for any purpose other than to control the land territory represented by the six north-eastern counties of Ireland.  It is necessary to recall that fact and to recall that the <Col N="441" /> territorial waters of Ireland are the responsibility of the Government of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is also a practical conclusion to which I want to draw the attention of the Minister for External Affairs which, doubtless, he has had an opportunity of considering and perhaps he could give us the fruits of his reflection on it when concluding the debate.  We now have three categories of protected waters.  We have the old three-mile limit as qualified by the new definition of the base lines; we have the second category which is the new six-mile limit within which we may exercise exclusive fishery prerogatives for our own nation; and then we have a 12-mile limit in which we have the right to fish but are joined in that right by certain other nations who have traditionally fished in these waters.  And there is provision in the agreement to determine the identity of the nations that have traditionally fished in these waters.</P>
    <P>So far as our exclusive fishery limit is concerned, our protection task is simple, that is, to notify any trespassing foreign vessel that it must withdraw, or arrest the vessel and bring it before the appropriate court and impose the appropriate penalties prescribed by our law.  But when we get into the outer six miles, we have a much more complex problem because now the responsibility devolves on the Government of Ireland not only of protecting the rights of our own fishermen in the outer six miles but also of protecting the rights of those who, under the agreement, are recognised as traditional fishermen in that area.</P>
    <P>Here we are up against a fundamental difficulty.  To equip ourselves effectively to protect the three-mile limit was a formidable burden on our resources, naval, military and air force. To accept responsibility for the effective protection of a six-mile exclusive fishery area is going to create a further formidable burden on those limited resources, which, remember, consist of three corvettes which are now a quarter of a century old and which, in our experience, I think, nearly always have one of their number in port for <Col N="442" /> repair and maintenance.  To protect a six-mile exclusive fishery area with two corvettes and the helicopter is a task which will bring very serious problems. I imagine the Army authorities will press upon the Minister that if the job is to be faithfully done new equipment will have to be made available in the form of patrol vessels of different pattern and of far higher speed than the existing corvettes are capable of.</P>
    <P>I do not think I exaggerate when I say it is common experience that a fishery protection vessel, to deal with trawlers, requires a maximum speed capability of 27 knots.  I think the corvettes have a maximum speed capability of about 14 knots and nothing is worse.  It is bad enough if our limited resources do not permit of effective protection of Irish sea fisheries but to have an Irish fishing protection vessel on the scene and unable to function effectively is worse, if the foreign trawler can simply cock its tail and disappear over the horizon, leaving the corvette to plough a lonely furrow in its wake and watch the trawler vanish.  It has no course open to it but to open fire with possible danger to life, something nobody wants to be involved in.</P>
    <P>The desirable thing is to have a fishery protection vessel which can outstrip any trawler, rapidly overhaul it and board it.  Sometimes it is necessary to fire a shot across its bows but that is merely to fix them clearly with notice that they have been observed and are called upon to stand and render an account of themselves.</P>
    <P>There is a much more complex problem emerging now which I shall try to illustrate for the House.  In the outer six miles you have British trawlers, perhaps, recognised as traditional fishermen in that area and they call upon our fishery protection service saying: &ldquo;We are being harassed by other foreign vessels who do not enjoy the status of traditional fishermen in this area and we call upon the Irish Government to afford us the protection in these exclusive fishery waters which traditional fishermen are entitled to expect.&rdquo;  What are we going to do? <Col N="443" /> Suppose we have not the means effectively to reach the point of foreign trespass to the detriment of a permitted foreign fisherman, shall we be confronted with a situation in which the foreign permitted vessel says: &ldquo;If you will not protect us, we shall apply to our own Government&rdquo;?  What if that Government say: &ldquo;You have an obligation under the Convention you signed to protect our fishery vessels in the outer six miles of this fishery area but repeatedly our vessels have called for help when unauthorised foreign vessels have trespassed in these waters to the detriment of our fishermen and you have repeatedly and signally failed.  If you cannot afford the vessels the protection they ask for and to which they are manifestly entitled under the Convention, we ask you now can we send one of our fishery protection vessels with our fishermen?&rdquo; What are we going to reply?  Shall we say: &ldquo;No, we will not agree and we will not provide protection ourselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a dilemma of some difficulty but it is one that I think I must present to the attention of the Minister.  I think it will be the most embarrassing problem that will confront him.  So far as any inadequacy in the protection of our own vessels is concerned, it is something we can raise in Dáil Éireann and argue about ourselves and make the Government responsible for.  That is a matter between ourselves.  But if a second or third nation come into it and successfully claim from us the protection that under the Convention we have undertaken to provide and then say: &ldquo;We quite understand your difficulty in facing this vast additional burden of protection that the new area has thrown upon you but if you cannot patrol the area effectively and fulfil your obligation to our trawlers, can we send in our own patrol boats?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister when concluding this debate to give us his view as to how this problem is to be surmounted or perhaps give us an indication of the Government's intention to equip themselves with more up-to-date fishery patrol vessels of which I think we would want not fewer than four.  If you bear in mind substituting four modern <Col N="444" /> fishery protection vessels for the two or three existing ones, while the capital costs would be formidable, I admit, there would be a saving in the running expenses.  I understand the existing corvettes require a large crew, whereas more modern fishery protection vessels are smaller in size and, with their increased speed and superior arms, can be used more successfully than can our existing vessels.  In addition to this, I understand that the draught of the existing vessels is such that they can be stationed only at certain points of the coast, whereas modern fishery protection vessels, drawing much less water, can be very much more extensively based than the vessels which we are at present using.</P>
    <P>While we welcome the principle of this agreement and are glad of the new base line and of the fishery limit which this agreement provides us with, we do not think it would be right for us to pass this Bill without taking a responsible view of the implications of it and the additional responsibilities which we accepted in signing the Convention.  I am anxious to see this country accept the liabilities of the Convention which has been negotiated and not renege its responsibilities, with the subsequent embarrassment of having to say to our traditional fishermen fishing in the outside six miles: &ldquo;We cannot protect your rights and we will not let you provide protection for yourself.&rdquo; It is the Minister's duty to propose some solution.  Unless and until he does, we must view this new development with qualified enthusiasm, whereas we would very much prefer to give it our unqualified approval, enthusiasm and endorsement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember being invited to the Minister's office when he gave myself and some of my colleagues the courtesy of showing us what plans his Department had for the setting up of the base lines.  I appreciate that very much.  I will give the Minister the credit that when we asked him Parliamentary Questions regarding this matter of whether negotiations were going on, he paid us the courtesy of giving us adequate replies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> Now we have reached the summit of our ambitions and, having extended the limit from three to 12 miles, as both Deputy Corish and Deputy Dillon pointed out, we are not in a position to protect this 12 mile limit. We are not in a position to protect one inch of our fishing waters.  As far as I know, we have only one corvette actually in commission.  Another corvette has been cannibalised for spare parts for the other two.  These vessels are useless and I want to point out to the Minister that he must bring pressure on his Government in order that pressure may be brought on his colleague, the Minister for Defence.  This must be done and it must be done quickly.  Surely the Minister for Defence must have known, if he was paying attention to the affairs of this House, what the Minister for External Affairs was doing and he should have been making preparations accordingly. We have got most unsatisfactory answers from him and I should like to take this opportunity of pointing out that the proper method of protection of our fisheries is not with large corvettes but with a small type of vessel known in the USA as coastal cutters.  They can go out in all seas and they have a normal cruising speed of 12 to 14 knots.  Their top speed is up to 30 knots.</P>

We have information from people who have experience in fishing the coastal waters of many countries that the proper type of vessel to use to protect what the Minister for External Affairs has found for us is the coastal cutter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We had the three mile limit.  Even though we had that three mile limit, ships were coming in from behind the Iron Curtain and fishing off the coasts of Waterford and Wexford in the richest fisheries around this country.  I should like to point out to the House that one of these ships is geared up to catch more fish in one night than is caught in any of the small harbours in a whole season.  I am endeavouring to point out to the House what could be done with our new fishing territory.  If an armada came in, they could take away in a night what would be caught by practically all the fishing boats of Ireland.</P>
      <P>We should deal with this problem very promptly.  We should be conscious of it and we are not conscious of it from what has happened over the years.  Our fishing waters are the fishing waters of Ireland and are therefore under the control of the Government of this State.  It is open, as far as I know, to our fellow-countrymen in Northern Ireland to come and fish in any of our waters.  The actual quarrel, the actual dispute which has taken place is not in relation to their right to fish.  As a matter of fact, they are welcome to fish as far as I know, but they will not fish in southern waters or in the waters around our coast because there is objection by our fishermen.  That is the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I respectfully say I am in order in this.  The Minister says that he proposes to designate Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain, thereby giving the fishermen of those countries a right to fish in the appropriate areas within the three to six-mile belt up to December, 1965. If we are not in a position to protect the belt between the six and the 12 mile limit, representations will be made from those countries to the Minister for External Affairs, to the Government or to the Minister for Defence asking for protection.  As I said before, <Col N="447" /> the Armada from the Iron Curtain will be standing by.  I have said in this House before&mdash;it was a matter of great merriment the second time I said it for some people on the Fianna Fáil benches who were never near the sea except to put their toes in it&mdash;that there was an armada standing outside the three-mile limit.  I saw the lights of this fleet.  They were like the lights of a long road on a clear night over the sea.  They were standing by waiting to come in and sweep all the fish that were there&mdash;enormous shoals of fish to be robbed in one night.  I am sure the Minister for External Affairs will pay attention to what I am saying and that he will make representations to his colleagues in the Government.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister will not enforce this until December 1966.  That is reasonable, and it is right, because it will have to be made known to the fishermen of various countries that they cannot come in and fish up to our three-mile limit in the future.  I am glad this Irish delegation brought home the bacon, as the saying is, and I hope the delegation in London today will have the same measure of success.</P>

      <P>I am glad that even Deputy T. Lynch is pleased with this particular Bill.  I think we can all congratulate ourselves that the efforts made over the years to get a reasonable extension of our fishery limits have been finally successful with the goodwill and agreement of our neighbours.  It was very important that it should be done with the agreement and goodwill of our neighbours because we hope not only to catch fish, and more fish, but also to sell more fish at home and abroad. The goodwill of the countries to which we want to sell fish is of the utmost importance for the progress of the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that we have only one fishery protection vessel in operation. I do not want to go into the fishery protection question because that belongs to the Minister for Defence. Whereas it might have been uneconomic to apply more of our national resources <Col N="448" /> to protect the fishery rights, I hope, with the extention of our fishery limits, it will become profitable to expend whatever money is necessary to see that the rights which we have secured are protected and that the rights which our fishermen have to exclusive fishing in certain waters will be guaranteed to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon raised a constitutional question, and Deputy Corish was concerned about the use in this agreement by the British Government of the title &mdash;the Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  The British Government have used that in many international agreements which have been signed by all the Governments in power here over the years.  That is the term they use.  After all, they described their sovereign as &ldquo;King of Great Britain, Ireland and France&rdquo; at one time.  We hope the addition of &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; to their rightful title will also fade out over the years. The Bill before the Dáil effects no change in the constitutional position or constitutional claims over territorial waters.</P>
    <P>I emphasised at the beginning that the territorial waters will remain after the passage of this Bill as they were before it and as they have been over the years.  It provides, however, for the first time in international law, that countries have been given by international agreement a right to exclude foreign fishermen from certain areas that are not within their territorial waters.  We have good reasons of our own, which were discussed here before when we had the Bill measuring our territorial waters from a straight baseline, for deciding that we do not want to extend our territorial waters beyond three miles.  We have always wanted to extend our exclusive fishery limits and we have done so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon raised the point as to whether, when we give certain States, that are neighbours of ours and that have traditionally fished, a right to continue to fish in the six to 12 miles limits, we have, in fact, undertaken an obligation to see that nobody will ever put the bow of a ship across the 12-mile limit in order to fish in our <Col N="449" /> waters.  The agreement gives rights to other countries to fish in these waters, and we still retain the right under the agreement to extend the rights we have already given to a limited number of countries to other parties.  We have no intention of doing so.  We give this group of designated countries the right to fish within that belt just as we give it to our own fishermen, and we will afford them as much protection as we can reasonably give.  We would not be expected to do anything more than that.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with the points that have been raised and I am very glad, indeed, that the Dáil has welcomed this particular agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill was introduced in Seanad Éireann as a Private Members' Bill.  The sponsors of the Bill and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals deserve great credit for the manner in which they undertook the formidable task of preparing and introducing proposals designed to bring the legislation on the protection of animals into line with modern thought and practice.  In doing so they have demonstrated that their humanitarian ideals are supported by a practical and commonsense outlook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> Before being introduced to Seanad Éireann, the text of the Bill was made available to the Government Departments concerned and was considered by the Government.  There were discussions with the sponsors on certain aspects of the draft Bill which were unacceptable to the Government and a number of amendments acceptable to both sides were effected at that stage.  Some further amendments and modifications were made during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad and the Bill as it now stands, with some very minor exceptions, is acceptable to my Department and to the Government.  There are, however, a few matters in the Bill which I think should be clarified before being considered in the House.</P>
    <P>In the first place, this Bill does not aspire to be a comprehensive measure. It is designed simply to amend and extend the basic enactment which is the Protection of Animals Act, 1911. Furthermore, there are certain aspects of the subject matter of the Bill which are catered for in other legislation. I shall refer to these later.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill proposes to allow the use of poisonous gas in rabbit holes.  Its use is at present illegal under the 1911 Act and the sponsors have in mind the use of cyanide gas which is regarded as a humane method of killing rabbits.</P>
    <P>In Section 8 there is a provision proposing to prohibit as from 1st June 1968 the use of spring traps for the taking and killing of animals and there is an interim provision in Section 9 to regulate the use of spring traps in the meantime.  I consider that a period of not less than four years should be allowed between the enactment of this legislation and the &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; to enable alternative types of trap to be tested and I may ask the House at the Committee Stage to consider setting the appointed day for the purposes of these sections at a date later than 1st June, 1968.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill proposes to regulate the laying of poison.  This replaces a similar provision in the 1911 <Col N="452" /> Act and I welcome it as a considerable improvement on the earlier legislation.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that this section makes no special mention of strychnine. The reason for this is that special regulations to control strychnine are being made under the Poisons Act, 1961, and are at present at an advanced stage of preparation.  I do not intend at this stage to give details of the proposed regulations but I can say that they are in accordance with the recommendations of the Poisons Council and I am satisfied that they will provide adequate safeguards.</P>
    <P>Sections 19 and 20 relate to the exercising and leading of greyhounds. These sections have been greatly modified as compared with the original draft Bill and I consider that they represent a very sensible compromise between the views of the sponsors and the interests of the greyhound industry.</P>
    <P>The proposals in Section 22 of the Bill relating to the use of anaesthetics in operations on animals were evolved after consultations between the sponsors, the Veterinary profession and my Department.  At this point I should like to acknowledge the help given by the veterinary profession in the drafting of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to extend to the Minister for Agriculture my personal good wishes since this is the first occasion on which he has introduced a Bill here in his new capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is mainly aimed at bringing up to date a lot of old provisions dealing with this matter.  We welcome that.  It is true to say that there was a sharp cleavage of opinion on it when it was introduced in the Seanad.  It met with two different attitudes. The first was that of people who kept domestic pets and who were very anxious about the prevalence of cruelty to animals.  It was they who introduced the Bill.  The second attitude was put forward by people like the National Farmers Association and other groups representing farmers and cattle dealers who customarily keep large numbers of animals and who earn their living by so doing.  There is <Col N="453" /> a great difference, on the score of experience, between the two groups and it was only wise that the Bill should have been subjected to such lengthy debate and such considerable amendment during its passage through the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill as it now appears before us, farmers may still use poisons on their land to protect their animals. It will not be out of place at this stage if I emphasise that 100 sheep can in one night be destroyed by a pack of dogs from a neighbouring town.  We must not forget that though the dog concerned may be a domestic animal, maybe a lapdog, it was made to hunt and made to kill.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister adverted to the change in the law permitting the use of gas for the extermination of rabbits.  The use of gas is far preferable to the deliberate spread of myxomatosis, which is a very painful disease.  The question of traps has been dealt with and, I think, successfully inasmuch as they must be used in a certain specified way until such time as a painless gin trap has been prescribed by the Department.</P>
    <P>As the Bill now stands, it is not obnoxious to farmers or to people who keep large numbers of animals and at the same time satisfies all those in all walks of life who worry about cruelty to animals.  From that point of view, we on this side of the House welcome it.</P>
    <P>We should like to have another look at what I would call the &ldquo;sporting&rdquo; provisions&mdash;sections 19 and 20.  When the Bill arrived in the Seanad first of all the position was that if you were walking greyhounds in a public place you had to have them muzzled.  The Minister wisely introduced an amendment and this mistaken provision was removed but, at the same time, it is a pretty strict provision that you can now lead a maximum number of only four greyhounds simultaneously in a public place.  Again, I would emphasise that the ideas of a person in the country or even on the outskirts of a city who has been handling greyhounds all his life and the way in which that person, even if the person is a girl, would handle <Col N="454" /> four to six greyhounds, and the ideas of a person who never saw this done or who knew nothing about it and what could happen if the greyhounds became loose are as different as chalk and cheese.</P>
    <P>We of the country know that the people who are used to handling these animals have skill, which has nothing to do with strength, have the power to control, the power to bring back a dog that would not obey a person who is not normally used to handling dogs. These are things on which there can be a sharp division.  Let us face it.  If the Bill went through as it is a person could ride one horse and lead two, or if it were physically possible, could lead three.  On the other hand, a person can walk only four greyhounds.  The public beach when the tide is out has always been a place for exercising greyhounds. Greyhounds must be exercised when they are being trained.  There is no great danger to anybody in letting two greyhounds together up the strand but a person who does that after this Bill becomes law will be contravening Section 7.</P>
    <P>From the farmer's point of view, the fact that it is still possible to poison his lands so long as he properly displays notice that the land is poisoned, is a satisfactory situation.  We on this side of the House do not object to the provision in relation to minor operations and the use of anaesthetics.  We think the age limits for animals and the type of regulation laid down in the schedule are quite sensible but we would like to look again at this question of greyhounds and the general sporting provisions.</P>
    <P>It is a mistake to regard fowlers, huntsmen or fishermen or anyone who indulges in blood sports as cruel people.  I should like to emphasise that people who keep horses or dogs for hunting are people who look after these animals better than anybody else in the country.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me that if it does happen that a fox, which is vermin, a predator, and from that point of view would have applied to him the principle that he who lives by the sword must perish by the sword, is <Col N="455" /> caught by a pack of hounds, he dies in an instant.  There is no question of cruelty there.  He dies as quickly as if he were shot with a shotgun.  The dogs and the horses following him are among the best cared animals in the country.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the case of greyhounds coursing hares, it would be wrong to suggest that because greyhounds course hares and kill a hare when they get it there is a danger that greyhounds in a public place, if not controlled, will chase a child and tear it to pieces.  That is something that just does not happen. There is no evidence that it has happened. Greyhounds should be allowed in a place such as a public beach to be exercised as they always have been and, I have a feeling, always will be in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The question of cruelty in relation to strychnine is one with which we on this side of the House are very much concerned.  We welcome the statement by the Minister that Comhairle na Nimheanna is considering regulations in relation to the use of poison.  But the farmer must have the right to use poison to protect his animals from the most dreadful cruelty.  Anyone who has seen a flock of sheep attacked by a pack of dogs that congregated from, say, somewhere outside a town would immediately agree with me that it is one of the most cruel sights one could see.  I have seen sheep that were attacked by dogs running along a field trailing their entrails.  I am aware of cases where numerous deaths occurred in the lambing season due to attacks on flocks by packs of dogs.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential to protect the greater number of animals and the most domesticated and most easily terrified animals from other animals.  I am delighted that Comhairle na Nimheanna is considering the matter and as long as it produces a system by which the farmer can protect his animals from what is the utmost cruelty, we on this side of the House will be extremely satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let me on <Col N="456" /> behalf of the Labour Party say how glad we are to see the Minister making his first appearance as Minister for Agriculture.  If he brings the same breath of fresh air to this office as he brought to his previous office we will have very little cause for complaint.  I seriously mean that.  We welcome the change.</P>
      <P>If the Bill does something to deal with unconscious cruelty to animals, it will be a big improvement.  The fact that the Bill makes provision to deal severely with those persons who will not obey the ordinary code is a further big improvement.</P>
      <P>Cruelty to animals is the lowest thing that can be done.  Any attempt by a Government to prevent the abuse of dumb creatures should be welcomed by all right-thinking people.  I quite agree with Deputy Donegan that as far as sheep are concerned very special steps must be taken to weigh in the balance and find which is the greater hardship.  I do know that dreadful damage has been done to flocks because of the fact that dogs were allowed to go loose, particularly at the wrong time.  I would suggest that this matter can be dealt with otherwise than by the indiscriminate scattering of poison on land.  It could be dealt with by dealing directly with the owners of the dogs if they can be traced.  That is the proper way to deal with it.</P>
      <P>One matter which I hoped the Bill would be able to remedy but which I do not think that, as drafted, it will remedy is the question of stray animals.  People keep animals, pets of all kinds, for a period, particularly coming to the Christmas season, and early in January, for one reason or another, abandon them and the city, as well as rural areas, is littered with stray animals.  A lot of suffering is caused to these animals and they in turn cause a great deal of suffering and damage to other animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in agreement with Deputy Donegan on the question of greyhounds. My personal opinion is that four greyhounds are the very maximum any individual should be allowed to bring into a public place, particularly where a girl is exercising greyhounds <Col N="457" /> and some other smaller animal happens to cross their path.  I have seen it happen too often and there is no question that it is very difficult for a girl or even a younger man to control four dogs who want to get away after something which they think they should chase.  Therefore, I am all for the suggestion that the maximum number should be four.</P>
    <P>As regards allowing greyhounds to be exercised on the public beach, I live beside a beach and while it is all right in the early hours of the morning when there is nobody else on it, it is all wrong when there are other people using the beach to allow greyhounds, big or small, to be exercised. Since terrier racing started the same thing applies.  Terriers and mongrels are being exercised and they are a danger. I should be glad if the legislation on this aspect could be tightened up.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Donegan in regard to traps.  Certain types of traps should be outlawed.  Somebody will set a trap which will cause terrible torture to an unfortunate animal which possibly is doing very little harm and the animal is allowed to stay in it for days.  That should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>In regard to hunting, I do not intend to dwell on the aspect of the unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable, in view of the person who holds the office of Minister at the present time.  However, I will say that in many cases unnecessary suffering is caused to foxes because of the fact that somebody is more interested in exterminating the fox than in the actual chase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I was one of the Deputies who were asked by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to interest themselves in this Bill in the earlier stages.  I was particularly glad members of all Parties were approached because this is essentially a Bill which should receive unanimous support in its final form and obviously this is a Bill which it was proper should be drafted originally by a society such as the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  I do know that the Society had worked very hard on this Bill and <Col N="458" /> will greatly appreciate the tribute paid to them by the Minister in his speech a few minutes ago.</P>
      <P>It is worth recording that the Minister has paid this tribute, because the activities of the Society are very often grossly misunderstood by the public who are apt to regard people such as these as being interfering busybodies who have no real conception of the hard facts of life and the necessity of providing special facilities for those engaged in the breeding of animals as a profession.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been drawn up in a most realistic form and the Society deserve great credit for that.  I am particularly glad that at this stage of the passage of the Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas the Minister has decided to give his own sponsorship to the Bill by presenting it to the House for a Second Reading.  This is very much in order and I do know the Society greatly appreciate his action in the matter.  Personally, I think the Bill is an extremely good one.  In many ways it could be criticised for not going far enough or, perhaps, for going a little too far.</P>
      <P>The main sanction for enforcement of a Bill such as this is the force of public opinion.  If the public feel that this is a reasonable Bill or a reasonable Act when it has been enacted they will themselves ensure that it is enforced.  We should not leave it entirely to the Gardaí or others to enforce such an Act.  The passing of a Bill such as this through the House will give very welcome publicity to the fact that our legislation up to now has had far too many gaps, far too many loopholes and is very much out of date.  If this publicity has the right effect, as I believe it will, it will mean that members of the public will take a greater interest in the protection of animal life generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is essentially a Committee Stage Bill and I should not like to comment in detail on the various sections. I am particularly pleased that there is a provision for the care of impounded animals.  That omission was a glaring fault in previous legislation. The question of the use of spring traps is quite clearly one which will <Col N="459" /> have to be dealt with by the Minister with great care and consideration.  I welcome, too, in particular, the reference to the power given to the gardaí to destroy injured animals.  That is a matter which has frequently bothered members of the public and it has, very rightly, caused adverse comment in the past.  Where an animal is very severely injured without hope of recovery it is essential that somebody should have the authority to destroy that animal or have it destroyed painlessly at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting that this is the first time that a Bill has been put forward which increases the scope of the definition of the word &ldquo;animal.&rdquo; In section 13 this word is now extended to mean &ldquo;Any domestic animal or wild animal and includes any bird, fish or reptile.&rdquo; This is a very welcome addition to our legislation and I hope it will meet with general approval.  The question of public contests involving animals is one which is not of any great importance but something which it is well worth providing for in case the situation should ever arise.</P>
    <P>Abandoned animals, Deputy Donegan has said, have become quite a problem.  I myself have been horrified at a seaside resort to find that the local residents are always in considerable trepidation at the end of a season to find out how many abandoned dogs and cats they will be left to care for after the visitors have gone.  It is an appalling reflection on our society that people can take pets into their family and then abandon them at the end of a holiday rather than wait for a few moments to look for the dog or cat which has strayed slightly from the temporary home.</P>
    <P>The only other matter which has not been mentioned in any great detail is the question of the regulation of the sale of pet animals.  This is a business which has grown considerably and as the standard of living rises it will probably grow still more.  At the moment, there is virtually no regulation of the sale of pet animals.  Children in particular are becoming more and more keen and are being given <Col N="460" /> facilities to keep pet animals.  I am all in favour of this.  It is a very good training for a child to be given an animal to look after but we must ensure that those businesses which provide for this taste by having pet animals for sale are properly conducted. It will not, of course, add anything to the responsibilities of pet shops already in existence, but it will save unnecessary suffering in the case of hucksters and street traders, without any facilities, who might be inveigled into this trade.</P>
    <P>When the Bill comes up for consideration on Committee Stage, I hope it will have the same careful consideration as it received in the Seanad.  I am sure it will.  Any further deletion from the Bill should be avoided, if at all possible.  The Society has made a number of concessions, not only on its own behalf but also on behalf of the many people who support its aims.  The Bill is very nearly in its minimum form now and, from the departmental point of view, I do not think the Minister sees very much, if anything, wrong with it.  There may be some details to be tidied up but I am sure we can agree on those.  I recommend the Bill to the House and I trust its passage will be both swift and painless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to wish the Minister well in his new office.  This is, perhaps, a kind of double-edged wish because I have noticed that, when a Minister for Agriculture is successful in his office, he is the least thanked.  Let the Minister then examine the records.</P>
      <P>I miss some things from this Bill which appeared in the original draft, such as the provision whereunder pigs were to be gassed.  A new method of slaughter was to be used.  That has been removed.  That is a good omen because the Minister in his last Ministry would not delete so much as a comma, or add anything on our request.  I am glad he was prepared to listen to other people in this matter and allow himself to be convinced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never knew greyhounds were such dangerous animals.  I am not now finding fault with the Bill, because I think it is excellent, but people who own <Col N="461" /> greyhounds know their business and they take precautions.  They ensure collars and leads are right when they bring the dogs out to exercise.  I have seen more than four greyhounds exercised, and adequately and carefully, being no danger to anybody, by what we would describe as slips of girls. Limiting the number to four is a little bit much, I think.  However, we can deal with that on the next stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not go far enough where strays are concerned.  I have often seen poor dogs wandering around a town and, coming back to that same town much later, seen the same poor strays still wandering.  They may be fed one day and starved the next, with no shelter at night except some gateway, at the mercy of the wind and the weather.  Some power will have to be taken, and it must not be a vague one.  The animals should be impounded and, if unclaimed, permission should be sought from the court to put the dogs to sleep.</P>
    <P>I do not know of any method, except the laying of poison, whereby a farmer can protect his flocks.  Deputy Tully does not approve of poison.  He says the dogs savaging the sheep should be discovered and the owners identified.  That is not so easy because the dogs, having some peculiar telepathy, will not come the night a watch is set.  Every sheep farmer will tell you that.  I have known men who borrowed guns from neighbours and lay in wait for the dogs, and they never came.  I think it is a good thing the Minister has seen fit to permit the use of poison to enable sheep farmers to protect their property.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Society on the excellence of this measure.  I remember when horses were docked.  It was a very cruel thing to do, but I could not say a word because the people concerned were intimate friends.  It was fashionable to dock hackney horses.  I have seen those horses out on grass, pestered by flies and with no protection against them.</P>
    <P>In the case of impounded animals, some check or inspection should be made.  It is no harm to have that in this <Col N="462" /> measure.  A pound-keeper should be appointed.  Animals should not be placed in these enclosures without either food or water, or both.  In Waterford we have an excellent pound, well looked after.</P>
    <P>With regard to rabbits, while I do not altogether approve of gas, it would be better to have them gassed rather than tracked or allowed to die from myxomatosis.  Gassing should not be prohibited.  Rabbits can be a menace to the farmer.</P>
    <P>I have nothing to add except to wish the Minister the best of luck.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>Lest the Minister should be disturbed by the amount of information he has now imparted to the Kremlin or be deterred from a full frankness to the House by the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture, has he not had made to him proposals for the purchase of smaller vessels capable of doing 27 knots, which would carry a complement of from 20 to 30 men, instead of the deep-draught, larger vessels at present requiring 80 or 100 men to put them to sea.  Inasmuch as we have extended our responsibilities fourfold, at least in area, for fishery protection, does he not think, as Minister for Defence, the House is entitled to some reassurance as to whether he proposes to provide, or to try to provide, adequate protection for the extended area for which we have accepted responsibility by signing the Convention the House approved today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not received any <Col N="472" /> such proposal.  It seems to me what Deputy Dillon has in mind is somewhat akin to the type of specification already given by Deputy Lynch.  What we want are boats that will patrol and prevent illegal fishing.  Apparently, what the Deputies have in mind is a large number of boats located around the coast&mdash;of course, they will require a servicing base&mdash;that will sortie out of these various points when they see what looks like a marauding trawler. That will not give adequate protection to either our present fishing area or the one now proposed.  We would need four vessels of the type we now have to protect our 7,000 square miles.  If we were to supply what the Deputies have the habit of describing as &ldquo;adequate protection,&rdquo; we would want, I take it, on a proportionately calculated basis, at least four times the existing number.  That would be 16 ships.  It is quite easy to calculate what the cost would be of such a fleet, not to mention the annual cost of running it.  Indeed, we would be in the position of the man who got a new business system.  The system was such that he had to scrap the business to ensure that the system worked.</P>

      <P>I want to thank Deputies who made contributions in the course of the debate for the manner in which they accepted the Bill, and also for the kind personal sentiments they expressed in regard to myself and my new office.  I do not want to say a great deal at this stage because this Bill, as Deputy Booth pointed out, is primarily a Committee Stage Bill and we shall have an opportunity of discussing very fully on the different sections the points raised by Deputies on this Stage of the Bill.</P>

    <P>I feel I should say again how very worthy the efforts of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals have been in this regard.  I want to go on record as saying that far from being cranks or busybodies, we have found them, in the course of discussions on the Bill, to be very reasonable people indeed.  In this field of animal welfare it is from people from outside the ranks of what I might <Col N="476" /> call the legitimate workers in the field that we get hysteria from time to time. The people who labour day in and day out in the ranks of the various humanitarian organisations are always reasonable in their proposals and suggestions so far as I can see.</P>
    <P>I should like also to say that great work was done in the Seanad on this Bill.  We are indebted to a number of Senators with special technical qualifications, for a number of the improvements which were made to the Bill in the Seanad.  I hope we will be able to say the same about the Bill when it leaves the Dáil.  A number of Deputies have a special interest in this field and they have a great deal of technical knowledge about it.  I am sure that between us we will be able to agree upon a very useful measure indeed.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Committee Stage ordered for Wednesday, 11th November, 1964.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 3 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 10th November, 1964.</P>
