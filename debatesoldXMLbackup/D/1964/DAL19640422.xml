    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will immediately sanction the usage of Macroom Chest Hospital, County Cork (a) for the purpose of accommodating ordinary cottage hospital patients or (b) as an annexe to St. Finbarr's Hospital as a home for aged people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, I take it that the Deputy, in referring to the possibility of reopening St. Colman's Hospital, Macroom, as a cottage hospital, has in mind the type of institution more usually described as a district hospital.  There is already a district hospital in Macroom.  I am not aware of the need for further accommodation of this category in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to (b), I have already indicated in reply to several previous questions that I am reluctant to agree to the use of St. Colman's Hospital, and other small hospitals in County Cork, to accommodate persons normally accommodated in county homes. I gave my reasons for adopting this attitude and I said that I looked to the Cork Health Authority to prepare a well-considered plan for the hospital needs of their area, when the future of the hospital at Macroom and at other centres could be taken into account. While the Cork Health Authority have submitted proposals for dealing with certain aspects of hospitalisation in the <Col N="160" /> area, I am not satisfied that these proposals measure up to the requirements of the situation.</P>
    <P>This whole matter is engaging my close attention at present and, pending a final decision on it, I would not be prepared to approve the use of St. Colman's for the purposes the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that for a period of practically ten years this hospital has been maintained by the Cork Health Authority with the bedclothes folded and piled on the beds?  It is costing the ratepayers a certain sum of money to maintain this closed institution.  Furthermore, is he aware that at a recent meeting of the Cork Health Authority, there was a proposal to spend some £1,400 on the existing cottage hospital, or district hospital, in an effort to find additional accommodation for the normal patients?  Further, is he aware that there are a number of aged people from the Macroom district in hospital in Cork city, and if they could be catered for at this vacant institution, their relatives would be able to visit them?  Further, is he aware that there is gross overcrowding in Cork hospitals which could be alleviated if this hospital were reopened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity the Deputy did not put down his oration as a question and then I could have answered him in detail.  The Deputy has said it costs a certain sum to maintain this hospital.  While it may cost the Cork Health Authority a certain amount of money to keep this hospital closed and in good condition, it would cost a great deal more if it were opened and wrongfully used.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that many farmers have complained about the way drainage work was carried out on the Duff River; and that many acres of meadow land have been left useless, owing to the amount of clay that has been piled all over those meadows; and what action he proposes to take to remedy the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>A small number of complaints has been received about the way in which drainage work is being carried out on the Duff river. These will be investigated.  The deposition of spoil on the river banks is unavoidable in the execution of arterial drainage works.  On the Duff scheme as on others, great care is being taken to keep interference with the riparian lands to a minimum.</P>

I too am anxious that the drainage of the Suir catchment should be started with a minimum of delay but because of the great volume of preparatory work still to be done, I can see no hope of a start before 1970.</P>

Inquiries on administrative matters concerning implementation of this intention should be addressed to the Commission.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may take it that the Minister will not pry into the administrative affairs of the Commission. That is their day-to-day responsibility. The Commission is set up by me.

Surely there is nothing outrageous about a suggestion that simple information should be made available to the public, through this House?  Otherwise, will the Minister tell me how the public can know what ports are concerned in this case or does the Minister suggest that every member of the public interested in this matter must now write to the appropriate body which the Minister <Col N="165" /> has set up rather than be given that information through the elected representatives in this House who are not on this occasion trying to pry into the day to day administration?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether his attention has been drawn to press reports that during February there were record outputs of turf briquettes by Bord na Móna; whether he is aware that at the same time fuel merchants were being rationed to seventy per cent. of their last year's supply of briquettes; and if he will state the amount of briquettes exported by Bord na Móna during the month of February, and the reason why fuel merchants were rationed in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord na Móna confirm that output of briquettes in February, 1964, constituted a record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless owing to growth in the demand from industrial and institutional users to whom Bord na Móna have contractual commitments it has been necessary to limit supplies to fuel merchants to approximately 70 per cent of their 1962-3 intake.  Deputies will be glad to know that plans are <Col N="167" /> being formulated for a fourth briquette factory.</P>
    <P>The Board say that the quantity of briquettes exported in February, 1964, was 2,007 tons; that exports are almost entirely to Northern Ireland fuel merchants and that they are treated on the same basis as merchants within the State.  In fact total exports in 1963-64 were marginally less than in the preceding year.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.  As the Deputy is aware, under the arrangements for the proving of unemployment by recipients of unemployment assistance in rural areas, only those unemployed persons who reside within two miles of a local office of my Department are required to attend there daily to sign the unemployed register. In the case of unemployed persons residing over two miles from a local office, less frequent attendance at the local office or other signing centre is required, but this is a concession designed to take account of the longer journeys which are involved for the persons concerned.  To qualify for unemployment assistance landholders must be available for employment off their holdings and, accordingly, it is not understood how daily attendance at a local office not above two miles from their homes could seriously affect the working of the holdings.  The present signing arrangements are not onerous and they constitute the minimum safeguard necessary for preventing abuse of the unemployment assistance scheme.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that this is one of the finest fishing lakes in Europe and that this pollution is causing a lot of trouble there?  Salmon are clean fish and they are leaving the lake.  The pollution is caused by six tons or seven tons of feeding from the Danish fish farm, and the lake has been contaminated to such an extent that the fishing is deteriorating.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy's information is out of date.  About six months ago I arranged a conference between the hotel owners concerned about the preservation of salmon stocks, representatives of the fish farm project and engineers of my own Department.  They have agreed on certain measures in regard to preventing escapement and pollution from the fish farm.  Appropriate screening devices were established some months ago with the agreement of the parties concerned and I have heard nothing from them since in the matter.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann nominate Eugene Francis Suttle for appointment <Col N="180" /> by the President to be the Comptroller and Auditor General with effect from the 25th day of April, 1964.</P>
    <P>My notification to you, Sir, which you have now communicated to the Dáil, regarding the retirement of the Comptroller and Auditor General with effect from Saturday next, the 25th instant, explains the necessity for this motion.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the motion, I am sure that the members of the Dáil would wish me to express, on their behalf, our appreciation of the services rendered by Mr. Ó Cadhla, who can look back on a lifetime of service to the State.  He has held the important constitutional office of Comptroller and Auditor General for over ten years, and I should like, on your behalf, to convey to Mr. Ó Cadhla our very best wishes in his retirement.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Constitution provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General shall be appointed by the President on the nomination of Dáil Éireann.  The fact that the appointment is one for which provision is made in the Constitution is, I think, sufficient evidence of its importance in our administrative machinery.  It is hardly necessary for me to refer in detail to the duties of the office.  Deputies will be aware that on the Comptroller and Auditor General is placed the onerous duty of controlling the disbursement of public moneys and of ensuring that those moneys are properly spent in accordance with the wishes of the Dáil, and those members of the House who have served on the Public Accounts Committee will have a full appreciation of the responsibilities of the office and of the high standards of ability, integrity and tact that are required of the holder of the post.  They will appreciate, also, that the satisfactory performance of the duties of the Comptroller and Auditor General requires an understanding of the functioning of Parliament, a thorough knowledge of the intricacies of the work of accounting officers in Departments and of the principles that govern control of the public purse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> The duty of making a recommendation in the matter to the Dáil devolves on me, and I would like to assure the House that I and my colleagues in the Government gave very full consideration to the matter before deciding to recommend the nomination of Mr. Suttle&mdash;who is the present Secretary and Director of Audit in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General &mdash;to succeed Mr. Ó Cadhla.  It has been emphasised in this House, on each of the past three occasions on which a vacancy occurred, that the Comptroller and Auditor General is not a civil servant and that it is not necessary for a person to have had experience in the Civil Service before being appointed to the office.  We agree with that view.  At the same time, we feel that it would be unwise to go outside the Civil Service when we have available to us a man who is so eminently suitable for the post&mdash;a man who has had over 37 years' experience of the working of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office and who has served with entire satisfaction for the past seven years in the highest post in that Office after that of the Comptroller and Auditor General himself.  In accordance with precedent, I have consulted the leaders of the other Parties, and I understand that they share our views regarding the suitability of Mr. Suttle for the appointment.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that Mr. Suttle will prove to be a worthy Comptroller and Auditor General and, accordingly, I confidently recommend his nomination to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">

We on this side of the House should like to be associated with the expression of goodwill on the retirement of Mr. Ó Cadhla who so diligently and well fulfilled the duties of that office to the satisfaction of the House and the Committees which he served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> From my own experience as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and, presently having the honour to be its Chairman, I am very well aware of the eminence and ability of Mr. Suttle for this post.  His contributions to the deliberations of the Committee have been instructive and exhaustive.  He has been most helpful to the Committee in its work and has enabled them on a great many occasions to discharge the responsibilities imposed on them by this House.  We fully concur in the Taoiseach's proposal and we believe that the most suitable individual is being appointed.</P>

As I have never met Mr. Suttle, I have no experience of his work but from what the Taoiseach has told us, I think he must be eminently suitable for the post now being rendered vacant by the retirement of Mr. Ó Cadhla.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress last night, I was referring to the fact that the Budget tells the same old story of increased taxation, more borrowing and fewer benefits.  There is nothing in this Budget to indicate new thinking on economic and social problems. It contains no indication as to how the ambitious targets set out in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> can be achieved.  There is no provision in this Budget for the drastic overhaul of our educational services which is so necessary and no provision for a reorganisation of our health services.</P>
      <P>The Budget does not remedy what is perhaps the most glaring social injustice of all time, that is, the treatment of pensioners.  There is, however, some measure of relief in the Budget for our farmers and, coming from a constituency which more than any other, is vitally dependent on the dairying industry, I welcome the 2d. increase in the price of creamery milk for which the Budget provides.  In view of the fact that I have advocated that increase so often here, it would be churlish of me not to acknowledge the small concession provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a lot has been said about this increase of 2d. but I welcome the increase for three <Col N="184" /> reasons.  First of all, I welcome it because it will grant some measure of relief to our hard pressed dairy farmers. Secondly, I welcome it because I hope it will help to secure the increased milk output which is now necessary and thus help us to meet our export commitments during 1964.  The third reason I welcome the increase is one which has been overlooked by most other speakers in this debate.  I am hopeful that as a result of the price increase, the output of milk will expand to the extent that it will prevent the closing down of our creameries as recommended in the report of the survey team which examined the dairy products industry.  Indeed, in a constituency such as East Limerick where industrial employment depends almost entirely on the products of the dairy farmer&mdash;and the same applies to workers in the city of Limerick&mdash;it is only natural that I should be concerned with this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very much surprised at the attitude adopted by some Deputies towards this increase and particularly at the attitude adopted by Deputy Coughlan from my own constituency when he spoke here last week.  He referred to the demands of the dairy farmers and said that the protest marches were organised by ranchers and that ranchers' sons participated in them.  Possibly he did not realise what he was talking about.  I saw the people who marched in the city of Limerick and from my own knowledge I doubt if there was any rancher amongst them. If Deputy Coughlan looks at the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> he will find in Table 71 that 85 per cent of the farms in County Limerick are under £50 valuation and something like 66 per cent of the farmers are under £30 so I do not know where the question of ranchers comes in.  An interesting sidelight on the question of the increase in the price of milk granted in the Budget is to be found in a report of a symposium held last week at Newcastle West and attended by Mr. O'Reilly, general manager of An Bord Bainne.  Mr. O'Reilly said that the increase in the price of milk was very significant as well as being much deserved and much needed.  He went on <Col N="185" /> to review the efforts of Bord Bainne to reorganise the marketing of dairy products and in this connection he mentioned a most important point.  In 1964 the Board, in fact, found itself faced with a shortage of milk to match the requirements of its export commitments. It was anticipated, said Mr. O'Reilly, for the current year the total availability of milk for international and domestic needs would be something like 350,000,000 gallons or 7,000,000 gallons less than last year. This being so he hoped that the increased milk price would help to stimulate production and enable them to meet their commitments in the markets they had established abroad.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have never taken a narrow view on this question of an increase in the price of milk being of value only to the dairy farmer.  I am glad to see that my views have been borne out in the statements I have quoted.  There is another aspect also. One of the subjects under discussion at this symposium concerned a powdered milk factory, for which negotiations had been going on for a year and a half, and which had not materialised.  Mr. O'Reilly said any further diversification would upset the programme for 1964.  Another speaker, Mr. Patrick Kelly of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, said that in his opinion it would be disastrous at the moment to establish any further milk powder factories in view of our present commitments on the home and export butter markets.</P>
    <P>The increase in the price of milk is very much overdue and is very much needed.  Because the increase was not granted long ago we now have a situation in which we are faced with a shortage of milk to meet all our export commitments.  On the other hand, in County Limerick at least, we have lost one industry because proper encouragement was not given to milk production in recent years.  While I welcome the increase I do not admit that it is a generous concession.  In fact, it does very little more than cancel out the levy and certainly bears no relationship to the increased cost of milk production over the past decade. <Col N="186" /> I regret that it was not found possible to grant a worthwhile increase when the decision was being made, an increase which would really stimulate increased output and enable existing milk processing industries to operate at full capacity and also enable further processing industries to be established.</P>
    <P>Some speakers expressed the fear that an increase in the price of milk would automatically lead to an increase in the price of butter.  I do not accept that argument and I am very glad the Minister for Industry and Commerce allayed any fears there might be in that respect.  The argument that an increase in the price of milk would automatically lead to an increase in the price of butter has been expressed time and again over the past decade as a reason for not granting an increase in the price of milk.  I do not accept that argument.  The dairy industry occupies such an important place in our economy that it merits special consideration in the matter of State assistance.</P>
    <P>I am not merely referring to farmers. There are something like 100,000 dairy farmers.  I am including their families, workers employed by dairy farmers, workers employed in creameries and in the various processing plants.  Then, of course, there must be taken into account the exports provided by the dairying industry and directly and indirectly, the key place it occupies in the production of cattle.  Although I have not been able to find any definite figures for it, I believe that every £1 million invested in the dairying industry by way of Government subsidy would yield a far greater dividend than £1 million invested in any other direction.</P>
    <P>The next concession that has been granted to agriculture is an increase in the price of pigs.  This is also a very small concession but, as a Deputy for a constituency which has been traditionally associated with the bacon industry, which in recent times has been trying to operate in very difficult circumstances, I hope the concession, small as it is, will stimulate and increase pig production and thereby prevent the wholesale closure of bacon <Col N="187" /> factories which was recommended in another report produced during the past year.</P>
    <P>The next item is the rate relief. This, of course, is a valuable concession also but, again, it is very small and, in fact, is merely a stop-gap measure which does not attempt to solve the overall problem represented by the incidence of local taxation.  I understand that somebody has been examining the structure of local taxation over the past few years.  It is high time something was done to reduce the colossal burden represented by rates, not merely on the farmer but also on the urban dweller.  This Budget has not brought a solution to that problem any nearer.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the concessions that have been granted, I want to say a few words about the additional taxation.  First of all, the increase in the price of petrol is a very bad thing. It will add considerably to transport and manufacturing costs and will have an adverse effect on the tourist industry. In recent years the number of British tourists who have been coming here for a motoring holiday has been increasing, as has the number of tourists hiring self-drive cars.  I fear that the increase in the price of petrol will have a very adverse effect in that connection.  Up to now we have been finding it difficult to compete with continental countries in attracting tourists who desire a motoring holiday.</P>
    <P>Apart from the tourist industry and apart from the additional cost to manufacturing industries and business in general, the increase in the price of petrol will affect everybody, including workers, many of whom now have to use a small car or motor-cycle in order to get to their work.</P>
    <P>Time alone will tell whether the law of diminishing returns will operate in relation to the increase in the price of cigarettes.  Last year, in his Financial Statement, the Minister seemed convinced that the law of diminishing returns would operate.  In view of the research that has been carried out as <Col N="188" /> to the relationship between cigarette smoking and cancer and the publicity that research has received, there is every reason to believe that the further increase in the price of cigarettes this year will be followed by a reduction in cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about the increased Post Office charges.  That is also a serious matter.  There is very little justification for them.</P>
    <P>When referring to the concessions granted in the Budget, I omitted reference to the five per cent increase granted to State pensioners.  It is doubtful if it can be called concession.  In my opinion it is ridiculous and the less said about it the better.  The whole approach to pensioners is entirely wrong.</P>
    <P>To come to the general from the particular, may I say that in previous Budget debates I have referred to the increased cost of public administration? This year the situation is even wrose.  Not alone has there been no brake applied but it does not seem that any attempt has been made to effect economies in the cost of public administration.  In recent years the Taoiseach and other Government spokesmen have been exhorting business firms and management to modernise and to gear their industries to greater efficiency.  Surely, in this age of scientific management and efficiency expertise, it should be possible to effect some economy in the cost of public administration?</P>
    <P>In regard to savings, the position last year was somewhat disappointing. That is not surprising in view of the increase in the cost of living.  Prize bonds continue to be a valuable instrument of saving.  On previous occasions I made the suggestion that it might be worthwhile to experiment in order to see if a reduction in the value of the bond would lead to greater investment. I suggested a figure of £2 which might bring bonds within the reach of the ordinary worker.</P>
    <P>There is another method of saving to which I also referred in a previous debate.  It is the unit trust.  As a method of investment and saving the <Col N="189" /> unit trust has made tremendous strides in Britain in recent times.  In fact, there has been an overflow into this country in recent months.  I have been considering if it might be possible to introduce a system of unit trusts based on the semi-State companies.  I do not know whether that would be feasible or not.  If it were, it would be very desirable.  A unit trust is a tremendous instrument of saving.  Its main advantage lies in the fact that it brings the investment within the reach of the smallest investor.  It would be an encouragement to workers, particularly workers in large industries, to invest in such industries, thereby giving the workers a better interest in the running of industry.</P>
    <P>I take it the Budget is an appropriate measure on which to discuss the general question of economic development.  We have come to the end of the first five-year programme and have been issued with the outline of the Second Programme which will take us up to 1970.  Before looking at the Second Programme, it is well to take stock of the progress or lack of progress achieved by the first one. Despite all the boasting there has been about the success of the First Programme, when it is subjected to close examination and critical analysis, it will be found that its achievements were very few indeed.</P>
    <P>Let us look at a few facts and figures.  I realise a considerable amount of time in this debate has been taken up with quotations from statistical abstracts and official publications.  I do not intend to bore the House any further with those, but I should like to give a few relevant figures.  Taxation has increased each year to a record figure of £250 million last year.  This year £82 million will be borrowed.  The national debt has also gone up.  The cost of running the country has gone up by £100 million in seven years.  Our adverse trade balance is £110 million and we had an adverse balance of payments last year of £22 million.</P>
    <P>The question of employment is a very important criterion in an <Col N="190" /> economy such as ours.  There are 70,000 fewer people employed to-day than there were in 1956.  On 4th April this year, there were 57,957 unemployed, 200 more than a year ago and 3,000 more than two years ago.  In that period more than a quarter of a million emigrated and last year, according to the Minister for Health, who, over the week-end, thought it well to clear the air, admitted that 25,000 people emigrated.  The numbers employed on the land have gone down by 54,000 since 1957.</P>
    <P>Another method of gauging progress is a study of housing.  Statistics have been quoted lavishly here on this subject.  During this debate last year, I gave detailed statistics on housing and recall that the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Malley, who followed me then, was somewhat annoyed that he was not permitted to go into it at similar length.  This year, I shall not quote figures because they are now so well known.  However, I came across a very interesting document relating to housing which I think the House should be made aware of.</P>
    <P>The same document was referred to earlier this year by Deputy Declan Costello during a debate on the Estimate for Local Government.  The <i>Irish Times</i>, on Monday, August 5th last year, published a report furnished by the Housing League, an international organisation which obtains from all European countries figures of the average number of houses per thousand of the population built in given periods.  In 1962, 23 countries were included from Western and Eastern Europe.  Of them all, the country with the lowest number of houses built per thousand of the population was Ireland.</P>
    <P>For any Deputy, the acid test of Government policy, the real indication of progress or the lack of progress, will be found in his own constituency. In dealing with the question of economic development, I realise it is a bad thing to be parochial in one's outlook but, at the same time, no Deputy can ignore the evidence he finds in the area he represents.  In the constituency of <Col N="191" /> East Limerick, for which I have the honour to be a Deputy, we have an excellent basis for the study of the progress or otherwise of Government policy because it includes a large urban area&mdash;Limerick city&mdash;medium and small farms, small towns and rural villages.</P>
    <P>The picture in the rural part of the constituency is, I suppose, no different from most other constituencies. There are decaying towns and villages, small farm houses locked up, roadside cottages locked up.  In a survey carried out within the past six months, the county manager found there were 135 cottages locked up in Limerick. Because of conditions in small homesteads, the shutters have been going up.  Small shops in towns are being locked up as well.</P>
    <P>I recall a sentence generally used at the outbreak of the last war in 1939: &ldquo;The lights are going out all over Europe.&rdquo;  From my knowledge, the lights are going out all over rural Ireland at the present time.  I have given an authoritative figure of 135 cottages locked up.  In the city of Limerick, to which I referred earlier when dealing with the dairying industry, the bulk of industrial employment is in the traditional food processing business.  There has been, for the most part, a lack of new industrial opportunity for employment during the past four or five years, and the 1961 census showed a reduction in the population of Limerick city.</P>
    <P>I could quote statistics at length but if we examine the first five years of the Government's expansion programme from the point of view of the country as a whole, and from official statistics published, we find the picture is not good.  If we study it from the evidence in our own constituencies, we shall find it equally bad.  With the experience of the first plan behind them, it was only logical to expect that the Government would have learned a lesson from their mistakes and that they would have taken appropriate action.</P>
    <P>Instead, we find in the second plan only a rehash of the first.  No doubt, if <Col N="192" /> implemented it will lead to the same disastrous result.  I am convinced that the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> will merely continue the policy pursued in the first and will not achieve the targets which have been set for it.  I am further convinced that as long as the Government hold office and pursue the same inane policy, we can forecast the same Budget story for future years&mdash;more emigration, less employment, higher taxation, poorer social services and fewer benefits.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is vitally necessary that we should make a critical reappraisal now of our whole economic development.  There must be a willingness to admit past failures and mistakes and there must be a courageous determination to adopt new ideas, new attitudes and a new outlook on this whole question of economic development. One of the most controversial issues in current discussions on economic development is the role of agriculture in an expanding Irish economy. This controversy has been intensified by the publication of the Blue Book, the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  This controversy is very interesting because it emphasises in a very striking manner the fundamental difference in outlook and policy between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>It is now quite obvious that the Government believe that, while agricultural expansion may be desirable, it is not an essential condition for economic growth.  This, of course, is a traditional Fianna Fáil approach to economic development.  We, in Fine Gael, on the other hand, believe that agricultural expansion is an essential prerequisite for overall economic expansion. Instead of formulating a comprehensive development plan, embracing agriculture as well as industry, the Government have been approaching these two sectors of our economy as if they were completely distinct and separate entities.</P>
    <P>There is a marked difference in the approach to the planning for agriculture and the planning for industry. This was brought home when the NIEC was set up and when it became known that agriculture was omitted <Col N="193" /> from it.  This omission of agriculture from NIEC has been widely commented on.  I believe that the omission was a bad thing.  In the Blue Book, the target for agriculture is set at 2.7 per cent and that for industry at seven per cent.  Even with that small target of 2.7 per cent. provision is made for industry to enter the picture and step up its contribution in the event of agriculture not reaching this low target.  The expansion target set out in the Second Programme will mean a loss of 66,000 workers in agriculture and an increase of 86,000 workers in industry.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult, in my opinion to find any grounds for justifying this differential in targets as between industry and agriculture.  It is very difficult particularly when we consider that the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is based on the assumption that Ireland will be a member of EEC by 1970.  We know &mdash;indeed, it became very obvious a year or two ago &mdash; that there will be considerable disemployment in industry in the event of our entering EEC.  On the other hand, we have been told, and all the experts seem to think, that entry to EEC will open up new opportunities for agriculture.  One would have thought, in view of the fact that this Blue Book has been produced on the assumption that we will go into EEC in 1970, that the question of agriculture would have been looked at in a new light, in the light of the opportunities presented by entry to EEC and, more particularly, in the light of the difficulties which will be created for industry.</P>
    <P>We, in Fine Gael, do not accept this target of 2.7 per cent as a realistic one. We think&mdash;I personally am convinced &mdash;that if we are to have a continuance of the agricultural policy pursued by the Government over the past five years this 2.7 per cent might even be optimistic.  We, in Fine Gael, believe&mdash; I have no doubt whatever&mdash;that if we are given a realistic, progressive, dynamic agricultural policy this target of 2.7 per cent could be exceeded; in fact, it could be doubled.</P>
    <P>Two very interesting documents <Col N="194" /> have been produced in recent months, two documents which have a very important bearing on this whole question of agricultural development.  I refer to the document produced by the National Farmers Association and the document produced by Mr. Raymond Crotty on behalf of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association.  These two major organisations are to be complimented on having produced these documents.  The NFA document represents a major contribution to economic thinking.  It is a study of the development potential of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>Anyone who is concerned not merely with the development of Irish agriculture but also with the development of the Irish economy as a whole should not ignore this document.  It is the result of considerable research and its findings and recommendations are based on logical reasoning and hard facts.  Indeed, this NFA document, with its well reasoned, factually sound arguments and, in particular, its tone of optimism and confidence in the ability of Irish agriculture to play a major role in economic development, is in direct contrast to the dull, complacent, uninspiring, unimaginative document which has come to be known as the Blue Book.  The NFA sets a target of four per cent per annum, a target which would maintain the present numbers on the land.</P>
    <P>The other important document, that produced by Mr. Raymond Crotty, one of the leading agricultural economists in these islands, was produced at the request of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association.  Mr. Crotty's study corroborates the NFA study except that he places the target slightly higher at five per cent.  He argues that, unless this target of five per cent increase in agricultural output is achieved over the next five or six years, overall economic expansion will not reach the target expected in the Blue Book.  I believe these two documents together form a perfect basis for planning.  They should have been welcomed by the Taoiseach and the Government, at least as a basis for discussion on our economic policy. <Col N="195" /> Instead of that, the Taoiseach has rejected both documents as wishful thinking.</P>
    <P>The question of the role of agriculture in a developing economy is an interesting one.  It is not merely one in which the farmers organisations are interested but which has been the subject of much study by economists throughout the world.  I have here a report of a paper read to the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland by Mr. E. A. Attwood who, I understand, is an economist with the Agricultural Institute.  The paper, entitled <i>Agriculture and Economic Growth in Western Ireland</i>, was read to the Society on the 27th April, 1962. I quote from the introduction to this paper which is very relevant and significant to the present discussion:</P>
    <P>In the development of the economy of the Western Counties of Ireland industrial expansion, in order to diversify employment opportunities, has been given considerable prominence and insufficient attention given to the need for agricultural development.  The need for new industries is obvious, but the total numbers employed currently in industry is less than 12 per cent of those in agriculture; an increase in agricultural productivity is of critical importance if the level of national income produced in these counties is to be brought much closer in line with that of the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>In the same issue of the Journal of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland there is a paper entitled <i>A Dynamic Model of the Irish Economy</i>, produced by Senator Professor P. M. Quinlan of University College, Cork.  I do not intend to go into detail on this. I shall merely quote the conclusion:</P>
    <P>In short, for the provision of increased employment and a rising standard of living, we need to maintain our present rate of expansion in Industry and to double our present rate in Agriculture.</P>
    <P>That is not all.  I have here a summarised report of the Eleventh International Conference of Agricultural <Col N="196" /> Economists published in the <i>Economic Journal</i>, the quarterly journal of the Royal Economic Society for March, 1964.  In this summary there are passages quoted which are most relevant to what I have been saying:</P>
    <P>It can be shown algebraically that when agriculture is more than half the economy and produces much less per head than the non-agricultural sector, any growth that begins ... in the non-agricultural sector ... will not go far unless, and within a short time, there is a substantial rise in output per worker in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, speaking on the Budget last week, took a line which completely differed from that which has been taken by the various authorities I have quoted.  I quote from column 1783, volume 208, of the Official Report of 15th April, 1964:</P>
    <P>In programming a 2.7 per cent annual increase in agricultural output the Government were setting forth a view as to what was practicable and probable rather than what is desirable.  There is no doubt that Irish agricultural potential would permit of a much more rapid rate of expansion, if market openings could be assured for the higher output.</P>
    <P>Then, having realised, perhaps, the tone of gloom and pessisism which he had set, he said at column 1784:</P>
    <P>There is no reason for pessimism regarding world needs for the kinds of foodstuffs that are produced in this country.</P>
    <P>Why do we not encourage production instead of trying to put a barrier against it?  Again in this report of the symposium to which I have referred, Mr. O'Reilly, in commiserating with the Local Development Association in Newcastlewest for the loss of its industry, said he was sorry to have to make the statement in view of the enterprise shown by the local association but it was decided the position could be reviewed by 1970 and that by then it was hoped to have doubled the intake.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that, taking into <Col N="197" /> account the tremendous strides that have been made by Mr. O'Reilly and An Bord Bainne, looking at the tremendous break-through in the food processing field by the Irish Sugar Company, looking at the new markets for Irish foodstuffs which have been opened up abroad over the past year, the target of 2.7 per cent is ridiculous. I have the fullest confidence in the ability of our farmers to produce efficiently if they are given the proper encouragement and incentives.  I have the greatest confidence in our food processing enterprise and in our marketing board.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> will not succeed and that the most urgent need facing the Government at the moment is to create the economic climate which will make progress possible.  Towards this end there is need for a reassessment of our aims and objectives.  There is one instrument of economic and social progress which, so far, the Government have not been utilising to anything like its full potential.  It is what has now come to be known in international terminology as community development.  We have been hearing and reading quite a lot in recent times about community development but there are very few who yet seem to realise the significance of it.  Certainly there is no indication that the Government intend to adopt this instrument of economic development.  Community development has come to be recognised throughout the world as a major instrument of economic and social progress.  It has been utilised most effectively by UNESCO and, in fact, many Governments now have special departments co-ordinating, stimulating and organising community effort towards economic and social progress.</P>
    <P>Here in Ireland we know something about community development.  In fact, there have been numerous examples of successful experiments having been carried out, particularly in the fields of local government, agriculture, industry and tourism.  In fact, all the pioneering work in community development has been done <Col N="198" /> by Muintir na Tíre.  It is a matter of no little pride to us here in Ireland that this modern method of development, which is now being accepted throughout the world, was pioneered here a quarter of a century ago by the late Canon Hayes.  Unfortunately, when one speaks of community development, whether it be here or down the country, one is accused of engaging in academic discussion.  I should like to assure the House that I have no intention of engaging in academic discussion on this question.  In fact, I am concerned with the practical application of this new method, this new modern concept, to the problems of this country.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I can speak from personal experience in this field.  I happen to be associated with a local agricultural development group in my own parish. This group has been in operation for the past three years and through the application of the principle of community development and co-operation it has succeeded in three years in increasing output by 43 per cent.  That is an annual average of 14 per cent increase in output.  The Taoiseach says 2.7 per cent is a realistic estimate.</P>
    <P>I have seen how this method of community development can be successfully applied in the matter of promoting group water schemes.  In fact, I think the Government must have learned a lesson in regard to these schemes, because I am sure that if it were not for the fact that Muintir na Tíre forced the issue and went ahead with the organisation of these group schemes, the colossal, costly regional schemes which had been planned three years ago would have gone ahead and would have cost a good deal more.  I am sure the Government must have been aware of the way in which the principle of community development can be applied to the promotion of tourism and to the promotion of local industry. All this has been going on, I admit, but what I am perturbed about is the colossal wastage of effort and the lack of co-operation between the Government and the voluntary organisations, <Col N="199" /> local development associations, and so on.</P>
    <P>I want to go back again to the report of the symposium to which I have already referred, which was summarised in the <i>Limerick Leader</i>, on Saturday, 18th April, 1964.  The Secretary of the Newcastlewest Development Association, referring to the loss of the industry to which I have already adverted, said that the Association had spent fifteen months negotiating for this industry, that, in fact, it had sent a representative to Germany.  Mr. O'Dwyer said that this Association would have been saved a lot of time, effort and expense if they had been told of the position when they started their campaign about fifteen months ago.  There should be more intercommunication between semi-State bodies and local voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to this community development idea.  In fact, I think he attended a seminar at Gormanston College last year.  A very detailed report of that seminar has been produced.  It is interesting to note from that study that all the experts who came here and examined our economic and social problems are agreed that community development cannot be overlooked and must be utilised if we are to progress in this country.  We have good experience of applying this method of community development to the promotion of industry, the organisation of agriculture and the promotion of local initiative in tourism, and in the matter of the provision of rural water supplies. We have considerable experience of it and all that is necessary now is for the Government to adopt this method as official policy.</P>
    <P>I believe if the Government could harness this vast reservoir of local initiative, local enterprise and goodwill we could achieve a rate of progress which has never before been envisaged and which many people think now would be impossible.  If any Deputy wishes to examine the possibilities of the method of economic development known as community development, there is a very comprehensive <Col N="200" /> report in the current issue of <i>Administration</i>.  It consists of a number of articles by various experts.  I should like to quote one particular paragraph, which is very relevant.  It is an article entitled &ldquo;Local Government and Community Development,&rdquo; paragraph 2. The writer here quotes from the United Nations Report, <i>Concepts and Principles of Community Development:</i></P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;community development&rdquo; has come into international usage to connote the processes by which the efforts of the people themselves are united with those of governmental authorities:</P>
    <P>1.  to improve the economic, social and cultural conditions of the communities;</P>
    <P>2.  to integrate these communities into the life of the nation; and</P>
    <P>3.  to enable them to contribute fully to national progress.</P>
    <P>As I said, I felt compelled to deal with this particular subject.  I feel it is very relevant to the Budget debate where we discuss the general question of economic development.  From my own experience I am really sold on this idea.  I believe the Government have given it some thought judging by the statement of the Taoiseach at Gormanston, but I feel now that we are embarking on a <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> this is the time to get down to an examination of how the methods of community development, which have been so successfully applied in other countries, can best be applied here on an organised approach.</P>
    <P>I shall summarise what I have been saying here about economic development. I believe we need, first of all, a realistic and enlightened Government economic policy.  We have not had that up to now and there is no indication in the Blue Book that we will have it over the next six years. Secondly, we need a comprehensive development programme embracing agriculture, industry and tourism.  We have had programmes in the past but programming is not enough.  We need rational planning to give effect to these programmes.  Yesterday, my colleague, Deputy Declan Costello, adverted to <Col N="201" /> the important factor of planning as opposed to mere programming.</P>
    <P>Finally, and perhaps most important of all, we need dynamic leadership from the Government, leadership which will stimulate and encourage local initiative to make the best use of all our resources.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is many years now since the debate on a Budget introduced in this House faced its conclusion so quickly. In the past, Budgets were debated into the long hot days of June and early July.  If you like, it is a change for the better that the speeches and discussions are not now as long drawn out.</P>
      <P>One of the most disappointing features of the debate to me is the absolute and complete lack of criticism in any form from the Opposition side of the House.  Every student of politics knows that to administer the science of government effectively, not only do we want an active Government, but it is also essential to have an Opposition.  They need not necessarily be engaged in destructive criticism, but should be ever watchful of the needs of the people they represent and devil's advocates closely watching the actions of the Government and their proposals.  It is their duty to criticise; it is their duty to criticise constructively; and it is also their bounden duty to make counter-proposals when they strongly object to the proposals put forward by the Government of the day.</P>

      <P>In Ireland today an Opposition does not exist, with the exception, we might say, of some representatives in the Labour Party who at least throw a little light on matters here from time to time.  I am addressing my remarks, in the main, to the Fine Gael Party.  Never was their complete lack of unity of mind, unity of thought, unity of planning, unity of action and, above all, unity of policy, more apparent than it was yesterday.  We read and digested, to <Col N="202" /> the best of our ability, the pontifications of Deputy Dillon on the Budget, and yesterday we listened to a very interesting discourse by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello <i>pére</i>.  They are two elder statesman and distinguished members of the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon described the Budget as a gambler's Budget, reckless and indiscreet.  Deputy Costello, a former Taoiseach, with years of experience as head of a Government, criticised us for being conservative in the extreme.  To the ordinary student of politics there, in the main, is one of the defects of the main Opposition Party in this House&mdash;their inability to come together to try to achieve a united front so far as the discussions in this House are concerned.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that the annual Budget should not be in its present form but that it could be framed in such a way that it would cover perhaps two years.  We know it is mentioned in section 39 of the OECD Report that there is need for a more flexible use of the Government's Budget as an instrument of demand management policy.  Personally, I feel there could be re-thinking on the role which the Budget plays in the economic life of the country, and that there is a lot in the suggestion made from time to time that it should cover a longer period. With this new thinking on the Budget, I think the shortest period which it should cover would be a period of five years.</P>
      <P>I do not necessarily mean that we should not have an annual review during that period, a type of balance sheet or annual report on the finances and the state of the country.  That would be necessary even if a five year period were adopted.  On the other hand, more conservative economists believe that the Budget in its present form is justified as it is so closely allied to the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and that, in fact, by this process of evolution from the first and second programmes, the Budget as we have known it in the past does not play as prominent a role as was its wont.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally in this Budget it was, is, <Col N="203" /> and will continue to be, the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party, when we can do so, to increase the social welfare payments to the less well-off members of the community.  Unfortunately, on this occasion, while 2/6d. per week costs a great deal of money, I personally am disappointed that a greater sum could not be afforded.  It will be our endeavour in the future not only to continue giving increases but, if possible, to make them substantially more.  I do not think any section of the community would quibble with that.  With a buoyant economy, and with a rising standard of living, we have a grave responsibility to make these figures realistic.</P>
    <P>No one can say that the present social welfare payments are what everyone in this House, and outside it, would like them to be.  That is one of the tasks which we must approach and tackle vigorously.  In that connection I personally would not have regretted if, say, another 3d had been put on cigarettes if, as a result we gave increased payments to the old age pensioners, the widows and other social welfare beneficiaries.  Were I in a position to do so, I should certainly have advocated a minimum of 6d. From the point of view of tourism and the economic aspect, the price of 20 cigarettes in England at the present time is 4/10d for 20 while our price for the ordinary cigarette is now 4/-for a packet of 20.  I thought it could have borne more.  When the standard of living of the ordinary, fair-minded man in the street goes up, and when he benefits, he then appreciates that there is a responsibility on him to make a sacrifice to the other sections of the community who are not in as good a position as he finds himself.  I think the inhabitants of the State appreciate that now and it is along that line that we should go in the future.</P>
    <P>Of course, criticism was made by members of the Fine Gael Party that the Budget did not balance without increased taxation.  Perhaps when Deputy T. F. O'Higgins follows me he will bear this in mind.  Did we not give the increase in social welfare payments? <Col N="204" /> Did we not give the 2d per gallon to the creamery milk supplier? Did we not give alleviation in respect of the agricultural land rates demand?</P>
    <P>It is quite correct to say, then, that the Budget would balance without any increased taxation but that, as has been pointed out by the Minister for Finance, was not the policy of the Government.  It is interesting to know, too&mdash;and they are not my figures; they are not my statements&mdash;that we have the lowest taxation in the world with our standard of living&mdash;I am uncontradicted&mdash;and we have the lowest taxation in western Europe.</P>

      <P>I have no intention of going into long quotations but I should like to remind those who need <Col N="205" /> reminding of what I can only call the hell of a cheek the Fine Gael Party have, through their financial wizard, Deputy Sweetman, in criticising the present Government and particularly the present Minister for Finance, An Dochtúir Séamus Ó Riain.  Let us cast our minds back not to any ordinary speech made in those days but to the statement made by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, in 1956, when he introduced his Budget. Perhaps Deputy T. F. O'Higgins and Deputy A. Barry would dwell on the few extracts which I shall read as they make most interesting reading.</P>
      <P>The speakers in the Fine Gael benches have waxed eloquent on this tax on petrol.  Having spoken about the effect it will have on industry and what this 3d. per gallon will mean as a further burden on the cost of living and industry generally it is interesting to compare what Deputy Sweetman, the then Minister for Finance, said in his Budget statement on 8th May, 1956, as reported at column 37 of Volume 157 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>Consumption of petrol has been rising steadily over the years and reached the figure of 84,750,000 gallons for the year 1955-56 compared with 80,380,000 gallons in 1954-55 and 76,730,000 gallons in 1953-54.  The duty was raised by 5d. in 1948, by 2d. in 1951 and by 5½d. in 1952.  These increases seem to have in no way hindered the increasing use of motor transport and it will be conceded that much of that use is for less essential purposes.  I propose to raise the customs duty from 1/9½d. to 2/3¼d. a gallon, that is, by 5¾d. a gallon, with a complementary increase in the excise duty. This will probably mean an increase of 6d. a gallon in the price of standard petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman has certainly changed his tune since then.  At that time, these increases would not hinder the increasing use of motor transport and it will be conceded that much of that use is for less essential purposes now.  Deputy Sweetman, Deputy Dillon, the Leader of Fine Gael, and <Col N="206" /> all the other speakers have waxed eloquent on the subject during the course of this debate but that is not cutting any ice.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing, too, is that in the last line of his statement, under the heading PETROL, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, said:</P>
    <P>The cost of this concession will be £20,000 this year leaving the net additional yield at £1,330,000.</P>
    <P>In other words, for 6d on the gallon he would get £1,330,000 and yet, from 3d on the gallon, the present Minister for Finance estimates a yield from this tax of £1¼ million, if I am not mistaken, which is very interesting.  I was going to quote what Deputy Sweetman said on the petrol tax this year but we know from memory what he said.  He castigated the Government for the increase. As the House is aware, we have increased the packet of cigarettes by 3d.  Again, Deputy Sweetman's castigations were interesting.  Introducing his Budget in 1956 he said:</P>
    <P>Allowing a margin for the trade, this will have the effect of increasing the retail price of the 20 standard cigarettes by 5d.  The increased duty adds about 6d to the selling price of an ounce of pipe tobacco ...</P>
    <P>In the same Budget the same Deputy Sweetman increased, in his wisdom, the price of the box of matches to 2d.</P>
    <P>One of the most interesting observations of Deputy Sweetman was when he stated the following on 14th of this month in relation to the Minister for Finance:</P>
    <P>He came to the House at a time when, as he said himself, there was a substantial danger of inflation, having himself for the third successive year brought the year to a close with a Budget deficit, a Budget deficit which arises this year, as it arose last year, and the year before, not because of a shortfall in revenue but because of increased expenditure and because the Minister for Finance failed to exercise the control that it is his duty to exercise.  If, therefore, <Col N="207" /> there is any danger in the inflationary position today it is a danger that arises solely because of the action the Minister himself initiated last year ...</P>
    <P>We have also been criticised for our failure to do sufficient for education. Looking at the figures, it will be appreciated that this year the House will be asked to vote the highest expenditure, on education in the history of the State.  It is possible that a higher sum could have been devoted to this expenditure, but a large amount of capital expenditure takes quite a while to plan.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish in his brief Budget statement, said that the Estimates should be pruned and gone through more accurately by the various Departments. I can assure Deputy Corish&mdash; and I am sure he knows it from his own experience as a Minister in the Coalition administration&mdash;that when a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary can get away with any expenditure from the conscientious officials of the Department of Finance&mdash;over-conscientious, I think, at times&mdash;he is doing a good day's work.  Every item has to be justified and substantiated. Queries are put and answered.  Substantial cuts are made by these officials in the interest of economy and sound administration.  When a figure finally appears in the Estimate, you can rest assured it is more than justified.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish, when he speaks later today, might clear up one point that caused me some anxiety.  He seemed to be worried about the increases in the Post Office costs.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he agrees with these increases.  In the main, the increases are designed to put us in a position to pay the increased wages and salaries to Post Office workers.</P>
      <P>There was a deal of criticism by Fine Gael speakers on our external assets.  It must be appreciated that external assets can only be used to pay for some tangible asset coming into the country.  We must always hold a certain amount to cover abnormal imports at any particular time.  I think it is agreed that the present limit is not too high and there is no cause for concern.  Mention was made of our close ties with Britain and the Bank of England.  It should be appreciated that we in Ireland, like many other countries, are members of the sterling group.  That means that sterling is the basis of exchange with other groups and, of course, our £ is exchangeable for, among others, the British £.  But it must be remembered we are only a strong member of this group as long as we have the external assets, because they ensure our £ is negotiable for the other £s. in the sterling group.</P>
      <P>We get these ultra-republicans telling us to cut the tie with England's economy and sterling system.  The other members of the sterling group are: Britain, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Ghana, Cyprus, Nigeria, Kuwait, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Kenya, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma, Jordan, Libya, Iceland, Malaysia, Sierra Leone, Tanganyika, Uganda, Western Samoa, Zanzibar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks for reminding me.  I nearly forgot that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall remind the Deputy of a few other points before I sit down.  The Minister said in his Budget Statement that the 2/6 was not sufficient nor what he would wish to give.  The Taoiseach subsequently reminded the House that even though it was only an increase of 2/6 a week, in the period when Deputy O'Higgins played such a vital role in the last Coalition Government, they were able to afford only one miserly 2/6d. in their whole period of office and that was payable only to old age pensioners. Those in receipt of unemployment assistance, orphans' pensions and children's allowances got nothing. Does the Deputy agree with that?</P>
      <P>As the Deputy thanked me for reminding him, I should like to remind him also&mdash;no doubt he will be speaking of this shortly&mdash;that before the 1957 Budget, to take a typical example, a man with a wife and four children on unemployment assistance had 48/7d. a week in urban areas and 38/7d. in rural areas.  An unemployed person on stamps at the time got 71/7d.  After the 1963 Budget, in urban areas a man in similar circumstances got 95/7d. and in rural areas, 87/7d.  His unemployment benefit was 132/7d.  Fine Gael have put the case that the value of the £ has gone down and point out the cost of living now compared with when the 1956 Budget was introduced.  All social services from 1956-57 show an increase of 69.2 per cent in the financial year 1964-65, notwithstanding the fact that the actual net increase in the cost of living was 16.8 per cent. Those are figures on which Deputy O'Higgins and members of Fine Gael should dwell.  Not only have we increased social service benefits to keep in line with the cost of living since 1956-57 but we have increased all social welfare expenditure by 69.2 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Criticism has been levelled against the extra tax on petrol, not only because of the burden on industry but <Col N="210" /> also because it is suggested it will be a deterrent to the tourist trade.  There are a number of countries where petrol is far dearer than in Ireland. In France, premium petrol costs 7/7d. a gallon and they have wiped out the vouchers which they used issue to tourists.  In Spain, it costs 5/11d.; in West Germany, 5/8; in Belgium, 5/10d. and in Portugal, 5/10d.  In Britain, it is 4/10½d. still but it must be borne in mind that there is a very high purchase price there on new vehicles which more than counteracts the petrol cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Many tourists will be tempted to go to the Northern part of Ireland rather than to the south, by-passing the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very weak argument and indicative of the general tone of Fine Gael on this occasion. Last year I pointed out that one of the reasons for the turnover tax was that the main tax items, beer, tobacco and spirits, would no longer bear a further increase.  Actually, what was said was that we could no longer rely on these commodities for the very substantial revenue required.  I find it very difficult to follow the arguments of Fine Gael and, to some extent, those of the Labour Party.  When they opposed the turnover tax, they did not give us any alternative suggestions.  It was maintained by them that this was the job of the Government but they did not agree that we should extend taxation on the ordinary taxable items up to then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having criticised the increased taxation they want more for health, for education and for the pensioners.  The question everyone in the country is asking, even those with no firm political <Col N="211" /> allegiance of any kind is: how do Fine Gael think the people are such fools that they can be &ldquo;codded&rdquo; into thinking you can get increased educational facilities, build more schools and more houses and get higher social benefits without increased taxation? Perhaps Deputy O'Higgins would let us know&mdash;or Deputy A. Barry&mdash;how these things can be done.  It is easy to say that half-a-crown is a miserable pittance to give old age pensioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall tell the Deputy what I said and what I say now, that I am, and the majority of my Party are, convinced that the social welfare benefits in Ireland are very far removed from what they should be and what we would wish them to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The man beside me, as the Deputy describes him, is quite well aware of that.  He is also well aware of the ranting, raving and screaming that would be indulged in by the Fine Gael Party if there were further taxation.  They want the best of two worlds.  They are only fooling themselves.  They might fool themselves but they will not fool the ordinary man in the street.  Nowadays he is reasonable, politically mature and in the main, educated, and he has the capacity of the Irishman for seeing through false arguments.  If Fine Gael want to get anywhere, they will have to stop this bluffing and get down to hard facts.  When they do criticise, let them come with some alternative or else let them keep quiet about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a T. D. for my own city and county of Limerick, I suppose I would be entitled to make a few general observations.  I have been approached by people who not alone did not get the ninth round wage increase but some of whom did not get the seventh or eighth round.  It is as well that these people should know what the position <Col N="212" /> is.  Subject to correction, I feel that a very serious position obtains in Ireland whereby responsible employers&mdash;the State among others, are responsible employers&mdash;are carrying out the agreement between the Federation of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and have been followed by the Government and local authorities in regard to the 12 per cent increase.  It is alarming to think that there are thousands of people in employment who have not benefited not alone from the increase this year but from the previous increases.  The city of Cork, I know from my sojourn there, for the by-election, was not above reproach.</P>
    <P>The only advice I could give to these people is that it is one reason above all others why they should be organised in a trade union.  Looking at it from a commercial point, is it not all wrong to think that hotel owners, factory owners or shop owners should be able to get the same service from their workers while charging their customers higher prices when in fact they are paying a miserable pittance to some of their employees?</P>

      <P>I was glad that my colleague Deputy O'Donnell referred to the increase of 2d. a gallon paid to the dairy farmers. We are both from a constituency in which the farming community depend, in the main, on their income from milk. They are all very pleased with the increase and I suppose, like a good trade union, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers feel it should have been a little higher.  As long as this Government stay in power and as long as the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> continues, as there is every indication it will, we will look after the dairy farmers as we have done in the past.</P>

      <P>For the record, I should like to correct a statement made by Deputy Dillon.  The net increase since Bord Bainne first put the increase of 1d. on the levy in May 1962 was two and five-eighth pence.  It is well to get that point clarified.</P>
      <P>The attitude of the Government with regard to investment of foreign capital has been made clear time and time again.  We welcome with open arms the provision of foreign capital as long as it is used in the main to develop the export industry.  Of course it has the advantage also of attracting people who have foreign know-how and techniques and particularly foreign markets through their worldwide contacts and associations.</P>
      <P>I want to refer now to the different climate which obtains in the financial year 1964-65 compared with the last inept year of the Coalition Government. At that time Ireland generally was at its lowest ebb, economically and socially.  Many people had thrown in the sponge.  Emigration rates were unprecedented and when we took over in the dying days of January 1957, the unemployment figure was 100,000. National loans had failed to fill; the Government of the day were unable to meet their commitments and the local authorities were unable to carry on the housing programme. Employment, not only in agriculture, but also in industry, was falling.  Outside investment in Ireland was negligible. Our standing among the nations of the world as an area which offered attractions was not very bright. Since then, it must be admitted, irrespective of one's political affiliations, Ireland has made tremendous strides.  It must be admitted, on the figures I have given today, that even with the increase in the cost of living of only 16.8 per cent since 1957, the tremendous increase in social services, the real increases in money value to those in employment are very substantial indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a new air of confidence in the country.  There is no point in trying to state otherwise.  My only criticism would be that I should like to see much quicker progress in certain <Col N="215" /> respects than is the case.  That is the feeling generally of all of us in the Fianna Fáil Party.  There are social problems, such as the eradication of unsuitable school buildings, these hovels which go under the name of schools.  There are some thousands of schools in the country today which have not water or sanitary facilities. I do admit that we are spending on school buildings and alterations over £3.4 million this year, which is the highest capital sum spent for that purpose in the history of the State, even allowing for increased costs of building.  We appreciate that we must not become complacent, that we must do all in our power to wipe out in as short a period as possible this appalling problem.</P>
    <P>In regard to housing, the figures are given from time to time.  We are spending on housing construction £5 million more than was spent in 1956/ 57, even allowing again for increased costs.</P>
    <P>I have already pointed out that for our standard of living our taxation is the lowest in the world, that our system of taxation is the lowest in western Europe and that the climate is right for further development.  One of the most encouraging things in Ireland to-day is the appreciation on the part of the young people that a Government can only guide and indicate, that the State steps in only where private enterprise fails.  Of course, we will not hesitate to use direct State intervention where it is found to be necessary but it is most encouraging that the young people, the future tradesmen, business and professional people, are coming together in committees and discussion groups, studying how they can make their country, their city or their town a better place to live in and a more prosperous place for them and their children.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying also to see so many coming back from abroad, so many who have qualified in specialised trades and professions, coming back to place their services at the disposal of the expanding nation.  It is now realised all over the world that Ireland <Col N="216" /> holds an honoured place not only for her attitude in the United Nations but generally for the manner in which we have tackled our economic problems.</P>
    <P>In regard to the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, as the Minister has pointed out, all the various statistics, reports and critical examinations are now concluding and are being analysed and the findings, as the Government see them, will be published shortly and should be a further basis for an economic upsurge.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, criticised us for being too conservative as far as the anticipated output in agriculture is concerned.  Were we to be unduly optimistic we would be worthy of censure but we are reasonably sure that the targets set are the targets which can be obtained.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the members of the opposition to discontinue the boring, tedious speeches such as they have been making down the years on every Budget which has been brought in by this Party.  Let them appreciate that there is a new outlook and a new mentality in Ireland.  The voter who, in the long run, decides whether we sit here or not, is far more mature and the ordinary man in the street is far better educated and circumspect about matters political than some of us might imagine.  The day has arrived when a very high percentage in this Dáil recognise that what is required is constructive criticism and an appreciation that we are living in an Ireland that has a tremendous future.  The cooperation of all sections of the community is required, and constructive criticism by all sections in the House. If that is forthcoming, I have no doubt that we will succeed in the tremendous task which lies ahead.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would address a remark to Deputy Corish in particular.  I do think that he should reconsider his attitude to the removal, to a certain extent, of tariffs being carried out by the Government. He has these natural fears in regard to unemployment.  We all have, I suppose, but perhaps some of us have made a more detailed and minute examination as to what the actual results will be.  It is a far-sighted, wise <Col N="217" /> decision, to remove tariffs to a certain extent because there are industries in Ireland today and the only way in which they will be jolted out of their complacency, the only way in which they will be compelled to get rid of their archaic, antediluvian and Victorian machinery and methods, particularly of management, is to get a little taste of competition.  If we are to join the European Economic Community, and even if we never joined it, we have reached the era of world trade, now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To deal with some of the industries concerned, we must act quickly and give them a jolt which will make them appreciate that the 70's. are not very far away.  By doing that, the Government are in fact doing a tremendous service for the workers; they are showing that they are looking after the interests of the workers in the long term.  Adaptation grants and other financial facilities provided by the Industrial Credit Company, An Foras Tionscal and other bodies are going a long way.</P>

      <P>In case I should forget it later, by way of interjection earlier, I indicated my concern about the reduction of tariffs.  As I said, we are proceeding as if we shall be members of the EEC by 1970.  It is to deal with the period in the meantime that the ten per cent has been fixed. I am not certain, and neither, I feel sure is the Parliamentary Secretary, that we shall get into the EEC.  The Parliamentary Secretary surely remembers that three years ago every speech made here was interspersed with references to the Common Market, how it would affect us militarily and economically, how it would affect the erection of even a pigsty, how it would affect social welfare and all these things.  The Taoiseach made a speech lasting more than an hour last week and not once did he mention the EEC.  We have not heard a word about it in recent times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like the analogy.  I should like to bet, though, that the Parliamentary Secretary will get into Heaven.  He is more certain of that than of getting into the EEC. The fact is that enthusiasm for the Common Market, interest in it and information about it, have waned in recent years.  Everybody must by now be aware of the Labour Party's attitude to the Common Market.  We have not been as enthusiastic as Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael and we have given our reasons.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary when he says he does not think so many of our industries should have been protected for such a long time. The protection was introduced 30 years ago, the idea being that it would last for a time to help to get our industries on their feet.  However, a number of them did not use the crutches or the splints given to them at that time.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach opened this debate on behalf of his Party by describing the speeches made by members of this side as boring.  That may be the point of view of the Taoiseach.  Our point of view is that the speeches made from these benches give expression to our attitude to the Budget.  Our point of view is that it is important we should give expression to that attitude.  What I found disturbing in the Taoiseach's statement then was this passage, reported at column 1766 of the Official Report for 15th April last:</P>
      <P>However, I suppose we have to go through the motions of debating it, but it is clear that, so far as the Government are concerned, we have not got any great problem on our hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is more disturbing than the reference to the boring speeches.  His attitude was worse than he suggested the attitude of the two previous speakers was.  He supposed, he said, we have to go through the motions of <Col N="219" /> debating it.  Have we come to the pass where the most important debate of the year is to be dealt with, according to the Taoiseach, by going through the machinery of debating the Budget?</P>
    <P>That is also indicative of the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I must admit he made a reasonable speech: he did not go back too far; he was not abusive; and he did not make the unfair comparisons usually made.  I thought he was reasonable in parts of his speech.  He expressed dissatisfaction in respect of some things, but he is only kidding himself if he thinks we are making great strides.  There have been advances in industrial employment and the monetary value of social welfare benefits has risen.</P>
    <P>It is true the Government have at last accepted the policy of the Labour Party in the matter of planning the economy.  We were laughed at and jibed when we advocated that we should have a planned economy.  The Conservatives in Britain adopted the British Labour Party's planned economy and it is now gratifying to know that the Fianna Fáil Party show, without expressing it in any way, that they also believed in planning.</P>
    <P>Do not let anybody think that as far as private enterprise is concerned the Labour Party feel there should not be dependence on it.  I believe the economy can grow even if we are absolutely dependent on private enterprise. We agree, however, with the sentiments of the Parliamentary Secretary that when private enterprise is unable or unwilling to do the job, the State should step in.  We have been saying that for years and for our pains have been described by the Tánaiste and others as some sort of political animals.</P>
    <P>It is good that the Conservatives in England have been won over to some sort of economic planning and that the Parliamentary Secretary and his colleagues have similarly been won over to more planning, which need not constitute interference with private enterprise. Fianna Fáil have been very reluctant to take their share of credit during their period of office for what they have done in the matter of planning, <Col N="220" /> certainly in the matter of the establishment of State industries.  I do not know who started it.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Party can take credit, I suppose, for the establishment of the Sugar Company and the ESB.  We have all participated.</P>
    <P>What we must be most concerned about is the provision of more employment and the possibility that the Government will take more effective interest in fuller employment by trying to improve the economy.  The Taoiseach said they had no problems in so far as the current Budget is concerned&mdash;it could have been easily balanced, he said, if it were not for the agricultural and social welfare sectors.  That may serve to please the economists but it does not fulfil the functions of a Budget.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke about social justice.  If we are not to become smug in our complacency, we must decide what the problems are and, in the Budget, try to correct them.  Merely to single out a section of the community and say we shall give them a few million pounds, is balancing the Budget all right.  That system is not peculiar to this Budget: it is a pattern we have had over the past 15, 20 or 30 years.  We are not afraid of taxation; we are not afraid of expenditure of money on capital projects, of investment of money in projects we know will do the country good; but as far as the current Budget is concerned, what we should be thinking about is from whom the taxes are levied and how the money will be spent.</P>
    <P>It is quite true, as the Parliamentary Secretary says, that national taxation as a percentage of national income, or even as a percentage of gross national product, is not alarmingly high when one compares it with the figures for the various countries in Western Europe.  It is not so dangerously high as some may think it is.  What we are concerned about, however, is the incidence of the two types of taxation, direct and indirect.</P>
    <P>Let us say that the percentage of national taxation as a percentage of national income is about 25 per cent; of that 25 per cent, 70 per cent is indirect taxation and 30 per cent direct <Col N="221" /> taxation.  At least, they were the figures last year, or the year before, and I do not think they have changed substantially in the meantime, except that there is a greater concentration still on increasing the burden of indirect taxation.  Now, when we advocated that the burden of direct taxation should be greater than the burden of indirect taxation, we were told by the Taoiseach that there is not a great deal of wealth in this country; we have no millionaires or big industrial concerns whom we could mulct to the extent that that 30 per cent could be changed to any considerable degree.</P>
    <P>We all admit we have no Americantype millionaires or British-type industries from whom or from which we could draw moneys by way of tax, but the Minister accepted last year the suggestion made by the Labour Party in October, 1951, and embodied in the election programme published that year&mdash;I do not know whether or not the Minister saw it&mdash;that he should get after those who, over the years, had been evading the payment of income tax.  That is part of our policy, and not just last year, or the year before, but for years back.  The Minister got a fair amount of money out of that and, last year, by our votes and in our speeches we supported him, as we did in the other measures he took in order to get money from a particular source.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister inferred&mdash;I do not pretend to quote his exact words&mdash;that drink and tobacco were out; the inference was that the best horse for us to back as far as taxation was concerned was the turnover tax. As far as the obtaining of revenue is concerned, that has been a pretty successful tax.  The Minister's estimate last year was not exceeded by very much, perhaps £250,000.  He estimated that in a full year he would get £10½ millions. This year he expects to get £14 millions.  Now, last year, as I have said, he inferred that drink and tobacco were out as far as the raising of revenue was concerned for certain reasons.  He inferred&mdash;he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that taxation on these commodities had more or less reached saturation point.  The Parliamentary Secretary said today that in <Col N="222" /> fact they have but, with the buoyancy in the economy and so on, it was still possible to get something out of them. The something this year is £5 million, a pretty substantial amount of money: £5 million would give many halfcrowns to old age pensioners, to widows and orphans, and so on.  Of course, last year we were being sold the idea of the turnover tax.  The tax was being justified to us.  As far as tobacco is concerned, the figures last year, or the year before, or the year before that again, did not show that tobacco had reached saturation point.</P>
    <P>The Minister last year introduced certain measures which brought him in a certain amount of money, measures designed to ensure people would not evade income tax, putting a tax on rents and increasing corporation profits tax.  Has he ever thought about a capital gains tax?  I do not know what money he would get from it.  I have not the intimate knowledge the Minister has, with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance behind him.  Surely it is time we thought about this tax?  The Conservative Government in Britain operate a capital gains tax.  If it will get something, then I think it is justified, and even more justified when we remember some of the methods by which money is obtained, legitimately obtained in this country.</P>
    <P>If a man makes £2,000 gambling, so to speak, or by investing on the Stock Exchange, that is income for him.  If a man works on a building scheme, or is employed in an office, and if he earns £2,000 over a period, he must pay tax on that.  Surely it would be logical to tax the man who makes £2,000 by speculating in property over a short period or on the Stock Exchange?  That is income; that is money.  He can buy things with it. He can buy clothes.  He can buy food. He can buy all sorts of things.  That is his way of life.  That is how he makes his money.  The builders' labourer who makes his money by working is subject to income tax.  With the money he earns, he must buy clothes and food. Nevertheless, that money is taxed.  The Minister ought to examine this matter. <Col N="223" /> Perhaps he has given some consideration to it.</P>
    <P>Accepting that there are no millionaires in this country, there is a certain amount of money being used and circulated by the people who are not paying one penny tax on it.  That is why we are concerned about the method of taxation.  We cannot reconcile that situation with a tax on foodstuffs. The Government made a fatal blunder, in my opinion, in taxing foodstuffs.  We had an objection to the form of the tax, but we said very definitely last year that, so far as a tax on certain commodities was concerned&mdash;call it a turnover tax, a purchase tax, or anything else&mdash;where the money was required for a good purpose, we would have no objection.  We are, however, entitled to revolt, as we did in anticipation of what was coming in the Budget last year.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands assured people it was impossible even to think that anybody would tax food.  He may be a bit indiscreet&mdash;he has been only three or four years, I think, in the Dáil&mdash;but he certainly indicated that he and his supporters in Roscommon would be revolted by the idea of anybody taxing food.</P>
    <P>It is a shocking thing that on the very commodities people need to keep alive&mdash;they do not need luxuries&mdash;they must pay tax.  The Minister said last year that, if he did not tax food, taxing other items would mean something like 2/- in the £.  I do not think people would object to a tax on quite a number of commodities in order to bring in the same amount of revenue, provided food and the other necessaries were allowed to go free.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour again the great problems created by the introduction of the turnover tax, particularly in the matter of prices.  The trade unions played their part very well. They showed themselves a responsible organisation, both in the manner in which they discussed and in the manner in which they negotiated the recent wage increase which gave their members, at least, a 12 per cent increase. <Col N="224" /> I do not want to appear to be agitating, but trade unionists generally must be concerned if their 12 per cent is to be wiped out.  They are fighting for a certain standard of living, a standard that has been improved in recent years, and they would be fools if they allowed anybody to diminish that standard in any degree.  They have made a bargain with employers that this national agreement will obtain for two years.  It is only reasonable for them to expect that there will be stability in other directions, particularly stability in prices.</P>
    <P>To the economists and many politicians, including many members of this House, the control of prices is anathema.  We should not be afraid of the control of prices as such.  We are told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that by dint of competition prices will come down.  Maybe it is too early but we certainly have not seen any evidence of that as yet. In respect of many commodities&mdash; dare I say the majority of commodities?&mdash;while there is no fixed agreement whereby commodities are sold at fixed prices, there is some sort of unwritten law, some sort of mysticism, which results in the prices of various commodities all over town or country being the same.</P>
    <P>There is a perfect example of that in the sale of petrol.  I know it was investigated by the Fair Trade Commission but it is still a mystery to me and to many other people that prices in the petrol trade are exactly the same in five or six companies that are supposed to be in such competition, especially in the matter of advertising and things like that.</P>
    <P>The Government should concern themselves with prices.  They interested themselves&mdash;I suppose, as a gesture&mdash; in the matter of the price of sugar. They had some control over the Sugar Company and it was all right for them to say to the Sugar Company: &ldquo;Hold your price increase until we examine it.&rdquo;  Why could they not do it with manufacturers and other people who, they believe, were raising prices, for instance, the flourmillers?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce had <Col N="225" /> the price of sugar investigated and it was decided there would be a reduction in the proposed increase.  If a reputable&mdash;I use the word deliberately &mdash;and efficient body like the Irish Sugar Company can, after an investigation, be told they will not be permitted the full increase they proposed, is it not possible, to say the least of it, that many other organisations, manufacturers and distributors would be having a try-on in regard to proposed increases?</P>
    <P>The Government need not be afraid of the investigation of prices.  I am sure they are not.  One of their basic principles is that in certain circumstances prices should be investigated.  It was this Government who brought in the Prices Act of 1958.  It was this Government who established, by way of legislation, these prices advisory tribunals. As far as I know from the public, there is certainly now a case for the establishment of many of these prices tribunals to see whether or not there are unusual and unfair increases in the price of many commodities, increases which are blamed on wage increases, turnover tax and for which many other excuses are made in order to justify them.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance talked about the Government's record in social welfare. As I said at the outset, it is true as regards the old age pension it was 22/- at one time; then it went to 25/-, to 27/6 and now it is 37/6.  We shall never get to the end of the argument if the Parliamentary Secretary says: &ldquo;You gave only 2/6 in 1956.&rdquo;  They are the facts.  When I was Minister for Social Welfare, the old age pensioners got 2/6.  The Minister can say: &ldquo;You want me to give more than you gave in 1956.&rdquo;  This is 1964 and what I am concerned about is whether the nation is doing justice to these people in accordance with the resources of the nation.  That is the important thing.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat the figures particularly for the Parliamentary Secretary who said he was not entirely satisfied with what was done.  I am sure no member of the Government is.  Out of tax revenue in the year 1957-58, only 24.8 per cent was devoted to social <Col N="226" /> welfare.  In 1963-64, the figure fell to 20 per cent.  This year, as far as I can make out, it will be 19.1 per cent. I could go back to 1956 and say we had the food subsidies and that the £ was worth more then.  We could say a lot of things like that but we would never get to the end of the argument. I have quoted figures like these this year, last year, the year before and possibly the year before that again but I have never got an adequate answer to that sort of argument.</P>

      <P>To continue my argument&mdash;the Minister and everybody else should have an opportunity of commenting if needs be&mdash;we were always told from the Fianna Fáil benches that if we could get more money, we could afford to give more to these people.  As far as the unemployed are concerned, the bulk of those are on unemployment benefit; some of them, the smaller number, are on unemployment assistance.  Taken all round, widows' and orphans' pensions, contributory and non-contributory, unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, old age pensions&mdash;there is no substantial change in the bulk of those.  As far as unemployment is concerned, the figures are now running somewhat higher than they were two years ago.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil always put a round figure on it and call it 100,000. The kernel of my argument is that we are spending, as a percentage of tax revenue, less each year on these people. It annoys me when the Government, the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary talk about the great strides <Col N="227" /> we have made, the buoyancy of the economy, the exports we have, all these statistics designed to indicate the prosperity of the country, while it all boils down to the one problem, 37/6d per week for the old age pensioner.  We must consider whether or not this nation can afford to give them more.</P>
      <P>I came across a woman last Saturday whose case I thought was fantastic but it is genuine.  This woman has a contributory widow's pension of £2 2s 6d per week.  She pays 13/9 rent. She has a net income of 29/- per week. The local authority will not give her any money; they say their finances are not geared to give it to her.  The Government say it is the local authority's responsibility.  The local authority say it is the Government's responsibility. But the net point is that this woman has 29/- per week on which to live.  I want to assure the Parliamentary Secretary, if he is interested, that that is a genuine case, and there are many more like it in the country.</P>
      <P>We will be told: &ldquo;You refused to give these people the halfcrown because you voted against the tax on cigarettes, petrol and tobacco.&rdquo;  We did because, as I said at the beginning of my speech, we are concerned about the method by which the money was raised and how it was spent.  We do not believe that the taxation imposed in recent years, contributed by the hundreds of thousands in this country, was given in the proper direction.  The turnover tax, which brings in £14 million a year, taxes the things these people have to buy and even taxes tobacco and drink, which some of these people buy.  It amounts to a formidable sum and will amount this year to £19 million.  Still we are giving the same halfcrown to the old age pensioner.  I do not think we have any idea of values.  A halfcrown in 1957 or 1958, or away back in 1949, was very different from the halfcrown given to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, because he was politically embarrassed at the time, accepted a motion in this House, tabled, I think, by Deputy Sherwin, and said, in effect, that every time there was an increase in wages by <Col N="228" /> way of national agreement, social welfare recipients should benefit.  He accepted that in principle but there is no evidence here in this Budget that the principle embodied in that motion has been accepted.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach talked about the capital Budget.  I repeat that if money has to be raised, by way of loan or otherwise, in order to ensure that our agriculture will progress, to ensure that we will have houses and that industrial development will be carried on, it will get the full support of the Labour Party.  The amount would appear to be formidable but, so long as it is a good investment, we are for it.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance referred to something I said on Budget day when I said I thought there should be an investigation with a view to pruning.  I appreciate that every civil servant in the various Government Departments is conscious of the need of his Minister to have things pruned.  After all, civil servants do not give political decisions and political decisions have been made over the past 40 years in relation to this or that particular scheme.  I think there is no possibility of this without perpetuating schemes that were started as far back as 1923 or 1933 and which are no use either to those concerned or to the economy of the country, things which Deputies might by agreement decide to cut out because they are uneconomic.  It is for that reason I suggested on the Vote on Account that a Committee of the Dáil might be set up, similar to the Committee of Public Accounts, to investigate capital expenditure in many of the Departments of State.</P>
    <P>I am reluctant to talk at length on agriculture but it has always occurred to me, and I have stated in this House, that a lot of the money devoted to agriculture finds itself in the wrong hands.  I do not think we need concern ourselves too much about the man who has a big holding and who is recognised in his own district as a well-off or successful farmer.  We should be concerned about the small or modest type farmer.  In relation to his value and in relation to his needs, I do not think he gets a fair share of the <Col N="229" /> odd £40 million that will be put into agriculture this year.</P>
    <P>We have not yet seen the bill providing for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  It amounts to £1,400,000. Who is to get this?  Will it be given in accordance with the valuation?  I assume it will.  That will mean that the big farmer who is represented by a big valuation will get the bulk of the money.  But the man who is to be assisted is the man in the 20, 25, 30 or 60 acre class.  I think, therefore, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government ought to try to see whether there are any means whereby the small farmer can be assisted in accordance with his needs. That obtains, in my opinion, right through the whole system.</P>

    <P>I do not think that in many parts of the country we can be proud of the housing progress.  I notices today the Minister for Local Government, through the columns of the <i>Irish Press</i>, has announced some new plans for housing.  Everybody will wish him well if it is successful, once and for all, in clearing up the appalling position <Col N="230" /> we have, particularly in many of our provincial towns.  We still seem to maintain a backlog of housing needs year after year, and that in 1964 is certainly not good enough.</P>

On one occasion the Minister for Local Government insisted in this House that only 30 houses were needed.  In the past three or four years, plans have been made for some hundreds.  That is indicative of the attitude of the Department of Local Government but certainly it has no regard for the actual needs of the people.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to that.  I do not know whether I should delay the time of the House further. The figures I gave for employment refute the suggestions of the Parliamentary Secretary that we are making great strides.  The years 1955, 1956 and 1957 are regarded by the Fianna Fáil Party as black years for this country.  How can that be if we had 54,000 more employed in the country?  People should be fair in all these things and the Parliamentary Secretary and others in the Fianna Fáil Party should remember that and not talk about ineptitude and suggest that there was a bunch of people in what they call the Coalition Government who were reckless and wanted to ruin the country.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should remind himself, as he would if he thought, that this was a bad period in Britain as well as in <Col N="231" /> Ireland, that no matter what we think, we must always realise that conditions here are affected by conditions in Britain to a large extent.  He knows how helpless we are in the matter of the price of money.  I spoke about control of prices.  We can control prices but there is one thing we cannot do, that is, control the price of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am trying to tell the Parliamentary Secretary is, that conditions in this country are to a large extent affected by conditions in Great Britain and that is mainly because of the price of money.  The Deputy will remember a month or two ago when the bank rate in Britain was changed, we had to change it upwards, too.  If it goes down, we change it downwards.  We are caught in that sort of trap.  I do not suggest I have any solution for it but, when people talk about these things, they should appreciate the fact that conditions in Britain certainly affected conditions in Ireland at that time.  There may be other reasons.  The Parliamentary Secretary is entitled to make allegations against the Labour Party in that Coalition Government, or the Fine Gael Party or anyone else, but that is a fact that should not be ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying that the claim that we are making great strides is exaggerated.  We all want to see progress and to work towards progress no matter what our Party, but these are facts.  We have an agricultural industry but we do not seem to be getting results.  The industrial revival &mdash;as it is described&mdash;does not appear to be as successful as the claims made for it suggest.  The Parliamentary Secretary should remember that when the late Deputy Norton, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, advocated <Col N="232" /> foreigners coming in here and establishing industries, there was a lot of criticism from the Fianna Fáil Party suggesting he was selling out the country.</P>
    <P>We should also be very conscious of the employment and unemployment situation, and conscious of the fact that, while the figure for emigration is lower than it was some years ago, it is still not at a level at which we can afford to be complacent.  We have many problems.  If the Government and the supporters of the Government assume we are making great strides, and that everything in the garden is rosy, their complacency can lead to disaster.</P>

      <P>Introducing the Budget, the Minister referred to net national production as having increased by four per cent last year.  I am assuming that figure is correct.  I am also assuming it is a desirable thing.  We all believe it to be a desirable thing.  Having achieved a four per cent increase last year, and wishing to continue and increase it, why then did we get the Budget which, in point of fact, we got?  That is something the Minister has not attempted to explain. This Budget has not given any help to national production.  In so far as national productivity increases in 1964&mdash;and I hope it will increase&mdash;it will not have increased as a result of this Budget.</P>
      <P>We are apt to think nowadays of the Budget as being not only a statement of the housekeeping of the Government for the previous 12 months, but above all we have become accustomed to expect the Budget to be a help, an incentive, and a spur, to national production and employment generally.  That is one of the great functions of the Budget.  It also should &mdash;and does to a certain extent&mdash;deal with matters such as pensions and so on.  A small increase has been given to the poorer sections of the community. It is a very small increase and it is insufficient. However, I shall not discuss that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Broadly speaking, we expect from the Budget something which will increase trade and make better employment <Col N="233" /> possible.  I take it that is a desirable thing in the Budget and, indeed, in the Minister's opening remarks we see that that is what the Budget should do.  In point of fact, it does not.  It is a patchwork.  It gives a little in the way of increased pensions, but it takes away a great deal more in general expenses. The Minister referred to the risks involved in the ninth round of wage increases.  That is a very far cry from the triumphant introduction of the ninth round to prevent, as the Taoiseach said, a free-for-all which was imminent.  He also said we would have stability for 2½ years as a result of those increases.  I sincerely hope that we will have stability for 2½ years but there was not any free-for-all imminent &mdash;no such thing.</P>
    <P>A 2½ per cent sales tax&mdash;it is called a turnover tax but in point of fact it is a sales tax&mdash;was imposed in November. We were told it was to meet increased services, and we were told that if we had not that tax, we would have increased taxation of various sorts.  We were told it was not a big tax, that it was a very small tax.  Of course 2½ per cent does not sound a very big tax, but it is one of the largest taxes ever imposed in this country.  A 2½ per cent turnover tax, as well as being an entirely new concept of taxation here, was a huge tax.  We know that the estimated yield has been well realised, and that it has brought in more money than the Government thought it would.</P>
    <P>There was a contradiction, of course. It was said that tax would be anti-inflationary. We were told it was a very small tax, but if it was a very small tax, its effect on inflation would be negligible.  As I said a moment ago, it was a big tax, and it has not turned out to be anti-inflationary.  The public kicked up a rumpus about that tax and the Government lost the by-election which took place at that time. Things began to get a bit hot and the Government decided they would have to do something about the next two by-elections which were to take place, so they brought in the ninth round which was supposed to be wonderful, and supposed to prevent a free-for-all. In point of fact, it was all for free, and that is the difficulty about it.  It will <Col N="234" /> take the country a long time to get over the inflation which was inherent in the reckless bringing in of that increase.</P>
    <P>We are all glad to see increases in wages.  Personally, I am glad to think that people are getting more money but we know that unless production increases, it will be very difficult to justify a large increase.  That was to make up for the 2½ per cent tax.  The 2½ per cent turnover tax was for the purpose of finding more money.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 12, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say if the House has considered the seriousness of this section.  That is why I feel that an opportunity is now given to us to stress upon all sides of the House the importance and the seriousness of the provisions of this section.</P>
      <P>It is clearly laid down in the explanatory memorandum circulated with this Bill that section 12 provides that the subdivision, subletting and letting of all agricultural land in the State shall be subject to Land Commission consent.  I consider that that is a very serious threat to the full rights of ownership.</P>
      <P>When this Bill is enacted, and if this section is incorporated in it, then it will be necessary for the owner of agricultural land to relinquish his rights to do as he wishes with the land which probably for generations has been in his family.  It is a very strange provision.  I feel that the majority of the land owners in this country, big or small, and particularly the small owners, seriously object to the provisions of this section because they are an infringement on the rights of the owner of the land to do as he wishes with his own property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time, the State is intervening <Col N="235" /> in the rights of the citizen who is the owner of the property.  This type of legislation might be expected from somebody of the type of Fidel Castro, Mr. Khrushchev, Marshal Tito, Mr. Bulganin, or some of those people. Here I see the Minister for Lands masquerading as the defender of the people's rights but now taking it upon himself to introduce this very serious section.</P>
    <P>Even if it becomes an Act, it is extremely doubtful if it will be constitutional to interfere with the rights of citizens in relation to the ownership of land.  I feel that the vast majority of the members of this House do not realise the seriousness of this section and the effect it will have on rural Ireland.  This is a section which should be opposed and certainly it ought not to be passed by this House without very serious examination.</P>
    <P>Last week, the Minister for Lands went to great pains to point out that although the section will be incorporated in our legislation it is not of a very serious character and it will not interfere with the rights of the landowners of this country.  Of course, it would interfere with the ownership of land and with the rights of a person to do what he likes with his property.</P>
    <P>Whilst we accept the Minister's assurances that all conacre lettings, all 11 months lettings, all grazing lettings, all the meadowing sales that usually take place under the conacre system are excluded from the powers of this Bill&mdash;we take it that they are&mdash;nevertheless, when it comes to dealing with the law as it stands, if any circuit court judge or high court judge is asked at a later stage to interpret the law in relation to section 12 of this Bill, when it is enacted, there is nothing in this Bill to enable that learned judge to decide that a conacre letting or any other suitable temporary letting does not come within the scope of section 12 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's assurance that his intentions are really good at this moment in relation to this matter but, nevertheless, there will be no use in any aggrieved landowner presenting <Col N="236" /> himself in court and saying that the Minister for Lands said in the Dáil during the passage of the Bill that conacre and other temporary lettings, and the usual short-term lettings we have in the country dealing with grasslands, meadowing, and so on, are excluded from the law.  Naturally enough, the learned judge will be concerned only with what is before him in black and white and with what this House passes. The section clearly says that all lettings, all sublettings, all subdivision of all agricultural land will be affected. That is very wide.  There is no narrowness there.  Sooner or later a problem will arise.  It will be no use for a landowner to go to court to contest this section because no letting, subletting or subdivision can take place without the consent of the Land Commission.  It is an infringement of the right to free ownership of land.</P>
    <P>Many agricultural organisations have protested against this section.  Even the auctioneers' association have made strong representations and recommendations in relation to it.  It is easy for the Minister to give us his assurances here, but they will be gone when the Bill is signed by the President and becomes an Act.</P>
    <P>It is wrong for the State to interfere in a matter of this kind.  The right of every farmer in this country to own his land is being contested.  This section will give wide powers to Land Commission officials.  We will reach the stage where the Minister will tell the House he is not concerned with the everyday workings of the Land Commission and that the putting into effect of section 12 is a matter for the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>There are many objectionable sections in this Bill, and there are many good ones, but this is the most serious one.  It is attacking the right of ownership of land.  We are now going to set up the Land Commission as an institution to judge the owner of every acre of agricultural land and say whether he will or will not be given permission to do as he pleases with his own land. Is this not a steady step towards dictatorship?  Is it not a first step towards interference with the ownership <Col N="237" /> of private property?  I think it is. I am sorry that when we are dealing with the rights of the ordinary people of Ireland to own the land of Ireland there is not a single Government Deputy in this House but the Minister for Lands.</P>

      <P>This is a matter which should concern every Deputy in rural Ireland.  The seriousness of this will not be felt until some farmer is seeking consent to have a letting or sub-letting carried out.  The Minister is being extremely vague about this.  He referred to Land Acts of the past.  We are not dealing with Land Acts of the past, but the present Bill, and particularly section 12.  When speaking last week, the Minister did not satisfy us as to the necessity for the inclusion of section 12.  Can he give us greater assurances than he has?  Can he tell us on what basis Land Commission consent to letting or sub-letting will be granted or refused?  Will it be on the authority of the Commissioners or on the authority of the Minister?  Are we going to reach the stage eventually that section 12 will be used for a privileged few in this country to do what they like with their land?</P>

This is State interference with the right to the ownership of land.  This side of the House have always been the champions of <Col N="238" /> the ownership of private property and have always safeguarded the individual's right to his property.  It is an immoral section.  I feel that if it were tested in the courts it would be found to be unconstitutional, and I am not so sure that it will not be tested.  When I see the landowners of this country now having to crawl on hands and knees for permission to have their lettings carried out, I believe it is going too far in bulldozing the people of rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Chair is the best judge of that and I accept your ruling.  While I admit I have been guilty of repetition, I feel this is the one section that, if the order of the House permitted it, repetition should be allowed.  It is a very serious matter and I ask the Minister to review entirely the terms of this section, which is undesirable and unnecessary.  It will be too late when it is passed.  We now have the opportunity of dealing with this and we should give it the most serious consideration possible because of its far-reaching implications for landowners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Flanagan has said about the Minister's assurance is perfectly correct.  No judge dealing with the case, if such a case is contested before him, will bother considering what Dáil records say.  A judge dealing with such a case will look at the Act and interpret it as it emerges from this House and the Upper House and is signed by the President.</P>
      <P>I have said practically all I want to say on this section.  It is an outrage and impertinence for the Minister and the Department to introduce such a section.  It is not sufficient to say that without producing support for the statement.  Let us throw our minds back to the time of our grandfathers when the land was owned by about 3,500 landlords, if I remember correctly, and the whole Irish population were regarded by them as serfs to pay any rent they liked to impose.  These people arose&mdash;we had no native Government then&mdash;under Parnell, Dillon and Davitt and succeeded through the Land League in forcing the British Prime Minister, Gladstone, to bring in the Land Purchase Act, the first of many that became law.  The landlords were purchased out and compensated and the tenants are now the registered owners of their holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must not forget they bought that ownership at a very exorbitant price down the years and God knows how many of them found the annuity twice yearly when gale day came around.  But they found it because they prized ownership of their holdings so highly.  I do not give a fig for the <Col N="240" /> assurance the Minister gave us.  I say conacre comes definitely within the scope of subletting and any judge or district justice will so have to interpret the wording of this measure.</P>
    <P>We have had 23 or 24 years of Fianna Fáil rule during which public enemy No. 1 seemed to be the small farmer and, by every economic means and pressure, they forced him out of the smallholding to England, leaving three or four out of every five small-holdings in the country vacant.  Now, see what the present Minister for Lands is doing under section 12.  He says: &ldquo;If these blackguards who went to England and deserted the country do not come home and look after their own country, I shall take their land from them.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can see, with all respect, it is a red herring point to try to put me off my track.  I am not dealing with the subdivision side of this but in particular, with the words used in the section &ldquo;letting&rdquo; or &ldquo;subletting&rdquo;.  Whether the Minister likes it or not, I assert that any judge or district justice interpreting this measure will have to determine that a conacre letting, whether tillage or grazing or sale of meadow on the 11-months system is subletting.  The point I was making is that, having chased the small farmers over to England, we are now calling them blackguards for having deserted the land, although they were run out of the country by the carelessness and neglect of the Government to give them a living here. Now we are going to grab their small-holdings. Let nobody doubt that this <Col N="241" /> section is aimed at the poor unfortunates who were squeezed out of the country.</P>
      <P>We heard great talk in the past about the clearances of the landlords but when history comes to be written, Fianna Fáil will go down as the clearance Government who cleared the small farmers out of the country.  A good many years ago the present Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, who was then Minister for Agriculture, said there were too many people on the land.  Of course there are and it would be very nice if we could force the people to be so servile and down-trodden that they would have to join the ranks of Fianna Fáil and come hat in hand to beg crumbs from the rich Fianna Fáil table.  Whether the Minister likes it or not, I object to the Land Commission trying to take back the ownership of land.  What right have they, sitting in Merrion Street, to say: &ldquo;We will determine how you will use the land&rdquo;?  Is that not claiming ownership of it?  If the Minister goes to the fair to sell a beast, the very fact that he drives the beast out the gate is proof of his ownership, but if I meet him on the road and say: &ldquo;You will sell under certain conditions&rdquo;, I am claiming part-ownership of the beast. That is what the Minister is doing in this section.  He is undoing the work our forefathers did in acquiring ownership.</P>
      <P>The last word I want to say on the section is that I hope I shall be returned to the Dáil some day and see a Government&mdash;I shall do my best to ensure it&mdash;one of whose first acts will be to repeal this obnoxious section.

      <P>Deputy Blowick and Deputy Flanagan have rightly spoken with some indignation on this section.  Perhaps one tends to be repetitive on this question but certainly, in this Parliament 40 years after the formation of the State, when, by our own legislation we begin to repeal one of the three Fs, it is an occasion that should lead to some indignation in speaking here.  The right <Col N="242" /> of free sale, the right freely to deal with one's land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The right of free sale and the right freely to deal with one's land is part and parcel of the history of our whole land movement here.  This section restricts the operation of the right of ownership. It is one of two sections.  The Minister says it has nothing to do with free sale.  Section 13 has.  We are dealing now with section 12 and in the way it will operate, it will undoubtedly restrict a farmer's ability to deal with his own land.  I know well that from the time of the Land Acts, just before the Hogan Act and subsequently carried on in the Land Act of 1923 and in other Land Acts, there was always retained in the Land Commission, where any portion of money advanced for the purchase of land was still outstanding, the right to control the subdivision or letting of a purchased holding.</P>
      <P>That was debated here originally on the Land Acts in the 1920s and the defence put forward for it was that the State was still owed in respect of that land portion of the money which had been originally advanced, but at all times it was conceded that once the person who had the land repaid the entire outstanding amount of the advance and had the land certificate handed to him, he was as free as the air to deal with his land as he thought fit.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is.  I have no doubt that what I said is reasonably accurate.  The point I want to refer to is this.  Here under the guise of a section in a Land Bill <Col N="243" /> is something which brings in a new concept of our land law code.  Any part of land, irrespective of how it is acquired by its present occupier or owner, any agricultural holding, is now to be controlled by the Land Commission.  What picture does that conjure up for us?  We can well imagine an inspector going around the country with two or three assistants and, if he has this power, controlling every single farmer he meets in the way he deals with his land.  Decisions will be taken by whom?  Is it the Minister for Lands or the Lay Commissioners sitting in Merrion Square? What sort of tale bearing and title-tattle is to go on now in relation to dealings with land?  What sort of anonymous letters will be written, poison pens set in motion and all the rest because, say, Deputy Blowick's neighbour contemplates letting his land or apparently has somebody working it and must have let it?  What letter will go then to the Minister for Lands and arising from which action will be taken?</P>
      <P>What sort of system of secret control is to be set up under this section to restrict further the right of people to act freely in accordance with their own convictions and dictates as to the way they would like to live?  What is the purpose of this section?  The Minister cannot say that the section is necessary to enable the land resettlement problem to be solved.  As the law stands, if the Land Commission see a farm of land being run down by faulty management, through a wrong policy being adopted or anything of that kind, and if there is a congestion problem, there are ample powers at the moment to enable that land to be acquired and made available for resettlement.  Why is it necessary to introduce this power except for the purpose of intimidating people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, I feel there is something sinister behind it.  I do not say there is something sinister on the part of the Minister but it is the system, the bureaucratic control that has grown up across the street.  I know of certain inspectors in the Land Commission who would dearly love to have this <Col N="244" /> power, dearly love to be able to tell&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think I am entitled to say that the effect of this section, if it is passed, may be to have the Land Commission officials and representatives of the Land Commission exercising arbitrary power which will have an adverse effect as it may also cause injustice and hardship to people owning land.  This is a serious section.  I have not done this before but I think it is right that it should be done.  I want a house and I want inside in this House the Deputies who intend to vote on this section.</P>

      <P>I called for a House in order that Fianna Fáil Deputies&mdash;I am glad to see that Deputy Lalor has arrived&mdash;who will be asked to vote on this section will realise what their Minister is asking them to do.  They are being asked under this section to restrict the right of free farmers in dealing with their land, in letting it as they wish and in selling it.  The Minister interrupted me a moment ago.  I was not quick enough to keep one eye on the Minister and the other on the section.  He interrupted me to say that this section had nothing to do with free sale.  It has.  I think the Minister knew that it had, because the section says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An agricultural holding shall not be let, sublet or subdivided without <Col N="245" /> the consent of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Are we to have the situation in this country that any small farmer, or any farmer, big or small, who owes no money to the Land Commission or to anyone else, will not be entitled to sell portion of his land if he wishes to do it, without the consent of the Land Commission?  Surely, the object of the land movement in this country throughout the last century was to establish fixity of tenure, a fair rent and the right freely to deal with one's lands as one wishes without the consent of any supervising authority, be it the Land Commission or a landlord?</P>
    <P>That is the principle involved in this section.  It is a serious section. There is a very large principle involved and certainly if Deputies are asked to vote on this section, they should at least sit in the House and understand what is involved.</P>
    <P>I do not know the object or why this section has become necessary in the Bill.  That may appear.  The Minister may be able to tell us that later on. I do know that the Minister in earlier discussions said that the section has nothing to do with conacring or temporary lettings, and so on.  On what basis does the Minister say that?  It is an interesting fact&mdash;again, I hope Deputies will understand this&mdash;that in no part of the Land Acts that I am aware of is there any definition of letting or sub-letting which would safeguard a person making a conacre or grazing letting.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to give assurances in the House but, later on, if the powers conferred by an Act of this House come to be tested in the courts or anywhere else no one will pay any attention to the pious hopes or aphorisms of a Deputy or Minister speaking inside this House.  We now have the power to deal with legislation. Once we walk into the division lobby and vote, our function is finished and it is important that we should realise when we are deciding a matter of this kind that we may be doing something in relation to dealings with land which can have very wide effects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> I think this is a retrograde step.  If it were the case that the Minister was able to come in here and say that this is essential to resettlement of land in Ireland, I certainly would consider it then very carefully, as I think any Deputy would, but no such case has been made.  I do not believe such a case could be made.</P>
    <P>There are ample powers in existence at the moment to enable the Land Commission to proceed with its work without this section.  The inclusion of this section may bring about a form of control of landholders in this country which is not desirable.  It is a bad section and should be opposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Minister, the purpose of this section and the amendments which he has introduced to the section is to prevent the subdivision of holdings into uneconomic units.  That is the purpose according to the Minister.  In fact, this section will provide a weapon that will enable whatever Government are in power over the next five years, if they implement the Bill, to bring about the structural changes which, according to the Minister, are so necessary if we are to become a member of the EEC.</P>
      <P>Personally, I have given the most serious consideration over several weeks to this section and I have not the slightest compunction or qualm of conscience in asking the House to reject the section, although there is no Deputy in this House who is prepared to go so far as I shall go on the question of land division and I have been called many things inside and outside this House as a result of my views, which are described by many people as extreme on the question of land division.  But I shall not listen in this House to a Minister from the west of Ireland betraying the small farmers of his own constituency and the other constituencies in the west and other congested areas and allow such a section through without protesting in the strongest possible fashion and making known the reasons why I feel as I do on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here the report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Problems of Small Western Farms, <Col N="247" /> These are not the musings or discussions of amateurs; this is a report of professionals, of serious experts on the subject.  This is what they have to say, on page 13:</P>
    <P>The Land Commission has powers to prevent subdivision of holdings (for which an obvious need has existed over the years)&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>In other words, what the Minister has in section 12 is, according to this Inter-Departmental Committee's Report, already in operation in the country. This is the key.  This report goes on to say:</P>
    <P>but it has no corresponding powers, for which a need may also exist or may be developing, in regard to the undesirable agglomeration of holdings by private individuals or concerns.</P>
    <P>In other words, the group that examined the problems of the small farms recommended that action be taken by legislation to prevent one individual from buying up an entire townland.</P>
    <P>I want to say that there is no danger today of any farmer on a small holding in rural Ireland looking for permission to subdivide what is already an uneconomic unit.  That is not a problem.  That problem has solved itself through the people leaving the localities and today, as this report of the Inter-Departmental Committee states, the real problem is to prevent the grabber, the opportunist, the speculator, the non-national, the gombeen man, or whatever you like to call him, taking advantage of the fact that his neighbours living on uneconomic holdings are forced to emigrate and thus allow him to move in and grab up all the small holdings that are left. This section is in order to enable that speculator to get away with that. Why?&mdash;because, the Minister says, we must adapt ourselves in the next four to five years for European conditions. &ldquo;We must adapt ourselves&rdquo;&mdash;that is what he had to say.</P>
    <P>He is reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Monday, 29th January 1962, speaking at the annual dinner of the <Col N="248" /> Tralee Chamber of Commerce, as saying that he was examining the stark reality of some of the provisions of the Treaty of Rome and their implications for countries joining the Common Market.  We can take that statement in conjunction with the Minister's opening remarks on the Second Stage of this Bill where we find that, right through, the question of membership of the EEC runs like a thread.  We can add to that his remarks in connection with the necessity for bringing about structural changes in so far as small agricultural units are concerned.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were taking power under section 12 to deal with conacre settings of land in areas like Meath and Kildare I should not object&mdash;I would walk in and support the Minister in the Lobby.  However, the Minister has stated that conacre lettings are excluded.  Who is he protecting by that device?  Whose confidence is he gaining?  Is it of the small, uneconomic holder in the west?  It most certainly is not.  I have here a list of 105 people from Counties Dublin, Kildare, Louth, Meath, Kilkenny and Carlow who, between them, have 40,000 acres of conacre.  Of these, some are non-nationals and some of them work under the subterfuge of limited liability companies.  They can still take land on conacre for the growing of wheat or, under the new priority given to beef, they can take land for the grazing of cattle.</P>
    <P>Is section 12 there for the purpose of trimming those gentlemen's sails? Is there anything in section 12 to give the Land Commission authority to move in and say they will acquire those holdings?  According to the Minister, section 12 precludes the Land Commission from dealing with lands let for conacre under the 11 month system.  What, therefore, is the position and what groups will be affected by the section?</P>
    <P>We have the answer, again, in the Report of the inter-Departmental Committee on the Problems of Small Western Farms.  It is enlightening to read.  On page 12, under the heading Vacated Holdings, it says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> The problem of these holdings seems to be a growing one as migration gradually develops into emigration. At present wholly let holdings amount to some ten per cent on average in many western counties. In some of these cases the original family still lives on the holding but for one reason or another is not in a position to work the land.  In many of these cases, however, the owners have emigrated.  The emigrants understandably hope to return some day and wish to retain the house and holding and will temporarily let it to neighbours or friends rather than sell it.</P>
    <P>What is the recommendation?  It is this:</P>
    <P>It is accordingly suggested that holdings let and not properly worked are left vacant for a period of five years might be taken over by the Land Commission and used for the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>That is an exhaustive report, well prepared and well directed by those experts.  Now we find this is the locality to which section 12 of this Bill referred.  Instead of dealing with the ranchers, the people who take the large acres for the growing of wheat on the 11 month system, for the grazing of cattle to benefit by the new priority scheme, it is concentrated on taking land from congests in the west and other areas where congestion obtains. What are we asked to do?  We are asked to take the five, ten or 15 miserable acres from the unfortunates who were forced to leave, forced to emigrate to earn money in order, as the report I have just quoted states, that one day they would be able to return and resume occupation of the house and the holding they had temporarily let to neighbours or friends during their absence rather than sell it.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I have already made the point that this section deals solely with the consent of the Land Commission to division of holdings for redistribution.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with the situation Deputy McQuillan deals with.</P>

      <P>What I am most concerned about is that the Minister will come out in the open and tell us what the full implications of this section are.  There is no statement by the Minister that, if we take the land, we will ensure permanent employment of some kind, or some means of livelihood will be provided, for those from whom the land is taken.  While this Minister is preparing to decimate whatever number of small farmers remain in order to get huge units of land, we have the Taoiseach bringing over Dr. Knapp from the USA to preach to us the value of co-operation amongst small farmers.  How can we reconcile the co-operative movement, which the Taoiseach now seems to have embraced, with the aims of the Minister in this section to get rid of smallholders all over the country? What kind of divorce is there in the mind of the Government in relation to this, or is this a deliberate plan on the part of the Taoiseach and his Minister for Lands to delude small farmers in regard to what the future holds for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a bad section and there is need for some curb on control by the Land Commission, if only because, and I speak from experience now and quite apart from politics, a great deal of division has occurred because of local agitation. This agitation is sometimes founded on real need and sometimes not.  We have already given the Minister power to institute proceedings and, in my opinion, it is entirely wrong to strengthen that control in another section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, too, the psychological factor that land is now making a great deal of money.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation take two values when they make a loan, the selling value and the value from the point of view of profitability; in other words, the value the land should have if the buyer were interested only in existing profitability as against exploiting it with a further investment of large sums of money.  If we create a situation in which people &mdash; I include non-nationals &mdash; believe that, by a stroke of the pen, the Land <Col N="251" /> Commission can wipe out the deal and refuse to allow them to buy land, we may find ourselves interfering to a grave extent with the money that can be lent by the commercial banks and, perhaps, even the Agricultural Credit Corporation itself.</P>
    <P>Up to this the Land Commission had certain rights but they could not automatically put a stay on the sale of land.  If a deposit had been paid and the deal was under way, as it usually was, the Land Commission could do nothing about it.  That may be right or it may be wrong, but, after all, land is personal property and the whole basis of our democracy is founded on the right of a person to hold property and to exploit it.  If that person decides to sell and makes his deal before the Land Commission move in, it seems only right and proper that he should be allowed to do so.  If the land were needed for subdivision, why should the Land Commission not move in first?</P>
    <P>This makes me think of French law; any sale of land means an application for subdivision to the Land Commission, an application which may be refused without any reason being given and, of course, at that stage the sale is null and void.  Is it our intention to reduce land values?  What will be the result if we do?  It must be all of ten years since the rough definition in Britain that, if you rent land, as you must in Britain because you cannot own it, then, in regard to a farm worth £10,000, your landlord wanted you to have another £10,000 to exploit it.</P>
    <P>I may be labouring the value of employment on the land but where I come from, land is a very valuable asset where there is sufficient capital available to exploit it.  If we create a situation in which people feel they have something which is not an easily disposable asset, we will force people off the land, people who should be on the land, exploiting it, and paying good wages out of it.  This may be construed as a defence of the purchase of land by foreigners but, so long as these purchases by foreigners or by wealthy nationals do not constitute a major part of the movement of land from <Col N="252" /> one citizen to another, from a national to a non-national, or <i>vice versa</i>, I do not think it is too important.</P>
    <P>It has been my experience that where wealthy people have come in, they have given good employment and paid far more than the minimum wage. There is nothing wrong in that.  There is nothing wrong in a man owning 500 acres if on every 40 or 50 acres, he employs a man and pays him £10 per week.  A non-national who lives three miles away from me employs people all through the year on piece rates and employees are earning as much as £12 per week on the taking out and packing of vegetables.  These people would never make £10 a week on a subdivided holding.</P>
    <P>We need land division.  There is no doubt about that.  The need is founded far back in the days of Cromwell and the Penal Laws.  Minute divisions of land put the whole economy wrong. But, even if we do need subdivision, are we going too far when we do something in section 12 which will weaken the whole fabric of our agricultural economy and our agricultural financial framework, which is so important? I do not know any progressive farmer today, unless he happens to have a sock capable of holding more gold sovereigns than any normal sock would, who does not have to have an overdraft.  So far land has been, and will continue to be, I hope, when this section is removed, good security without collateral because it is always worth something.  Land values have increased over the past ten years.  This is not a bad thing because it allows people to borrow in order to exploit the land.  Will we be right in creating a situation in which people will not buy something because they cannot sell it?</P>
    <P>I remember not so many years ago a widow in my parish, Lord rest her, who suffered from two physical disabilities. She owned 37 acres.  She had 18 acres in the home farm and 19 acres three miles away.  The case ended up before the Lay Commissioners, with her parish priest and myself arguing against the Lay Commissioners.  We succeeded to the extent that the outfarm <Col N="253" /> was not taken from her.  Later she handed that over to her nephew. He is now farming it and farming it well.  Was it not a good thing these provisions were there?  Was it not a good thing that what the Minister describes in his explanatory memorandum as &ldquo;the unsatisfactory patchwork&rdquo; allowed this to happen?</P>
    <P>Is it the intention now to create a position in which the Land Commission will always be right no matter what happens?  When one is always right, one can grow careless.  Whenever a decision a person makes is one in which there can be no kick back, unless someone ensures that values drop or that there is less investment in land, then one can become very arrogant.  It is said that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  I think this section goes too far.  The 11-months system is being dealt with in the wrong way.  A few years ago we had the wheat ranchers, but they have left.  There were a few bad harvests.  Some of them owe money to the people who gave them seeds and fertilisers.  Now, because we had a few dozen of these ranchers, operating, there is a sort of idea that wheat ranchers live exclusively in Louth, Meath, Kildare and elsewhere. That is not so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This list to which the Deputy refers should be a list of landholders but he is producing, as far as I know, a list of people who are wheat ranchers.  I do not know how the Deputy can produce this list of 105 people with so many acres but I can say that in Louth, Meath and Kildare, there are not many of these people still existing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can tell Deputies another reason for this 11-months system in these <Col N="254" /> counties where a lot of land is set on this basis.  There are farmers who, because they have done well, have, for instance, a herd of cows and are supplying liquid milk to the Dublin milk sales district and getting 2/10 for it in the winter and 1/11d. in the summer.  It is quite a good price and these people find they cannot keep their followers because they have not enough land.  Because they have, perhaps, spent 15 or 20 years breeding up a good yielding cow, they do not want to sell the heifer that cow produced because they want to keep her to find out has she produced better results than her mother.</P>
    <P>It will be found in Louth, Meath, Kildare and other places that the farmer with 20 cows, or maybe six, seven or eight cows will take a field and pay £12 an acre for it.  I want to be quite specific about this.  He is getting no profit out of it but it allows him to maintain his herd as an entity.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the ordinary farmer, who cannot be described as a wheat rancher because he decides that being a 20 or 30 acre wheat man, in order to defend his crop and make sure it will not be rejected for various reasons, he must have a combine harvester which will cost him £700 to £900.  In order to get the capital for this expenditure he takes 15 acres of wheat land and sows them.  All he will get out of that are the overheads that will enable him to see his way to have this machinery. There are very few wheat ranchers in this country.  Nobody wants them. There are hundreds of people who take land on the 11-months system for the reason that their own holding is just not big enough for the unit of machinery, the unit of stock and even the unit of employment they have. Anybody who is involved in agriculture knows such men cannot be described as wheat ranchers.</P>
    <P>Take my own experience.  Four years ago, I leased 50 acres of land from a neighbour and a friend for five years because her husband had died. It suited me and it suited her because her family was young.  Next year I walk out.  Is there anything wrong with that?  If this had happened this year <Col N="255" /> rather than four years ago, would this particular lady not say: &ldquo;I will not set it to you because I do not want my name in the Land Commission as a person who has too much land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are simple cases of ordinary parish society finding reasons for disposing of their lands for a period.  Why should the lady in this instance, who had young children going to school, not set her land to a customer who wanted to use his units of machinery and wanted to give more work to the men he was paying on the farm?  Why should her name be listed in the Land Commission so that in years to come when there might be congests in the area, the Land Commission might say to her: &ldquo;We want 100 acres.  You do not want it.  You leased it to Paddy Donegan some years ago.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>People fear what may happen in this connection.  While the Minister might be doing a good job in relieving congestion, if this provision is passed, he will strike at the whole fabric of agricultural society.  As far as I am concerned, the 12 million acres of arable land are there; the definition is also there of £1,000 million invested between the value of the land, the value of the stock and machinery and the value of the farmyards.  Anyone who wants to read about this can read it in the NFA document produced three weeks ago.  However, if the viability of the land is removed and if the Minister says: &ldquo;Land cannot be sold,&rdquo; he may do good in the particular instance, but as far as agriculture and the employment of our people at a good wage are concerned, he will not be doing anything worth while at all.</P>
    <P>On the question of unoccupied holdings and holdings that are not being worked by their owners, if the attention of the Land Commission is drawn to a holding that is not being worked and that is being set, they can move against the owner.  The 11-months system has one great defect, that it is too short for rotation.  The farmer who wants to set his land and who wants it to be looked after properly has to set it for grass and, <Col N="256" /> following that, for wheat, then for another crop and so on.  This cannot be done on the 11-months system.  He cannot do as I did, lease the land for five years and organise rotation.  If he does it, he has to go to the Land Commission and put himself on a list as a person who does not want his land.</P>
    <P>There may be a period of a decade and perhaps more in the life of any family when they cannot work their land.  People may be too old or too young; people may be sick.  A people in a business are entitled to work in the business or away from it and if their health or their age does not allow them to work their business, they are entitled to set it to whomever they like. Is there anything wrong if the man who is too old to run his public house sets it to the man who worked it for him and allows him to continue until his son, who may be five or six when the arrangement is made, reaches 21 and then, by an amicable arrangement, takes over?</P>
    <P>The rights of the individual are most important.  On a farm there is exactly the same situation.  Why should a family who have owned a farm for 300 or 400 years have that land taken from them because for a period they are too old to work it?  They may not want to hand it over to a nephew or somebody else who is coming after but, as in a case I know in County Louth, to a person who is no relation but of the same name, or even to a person who works in the yard.  If they are old, they may feel that the needs of their old age are safe in the hands of that person, whether he is a relative or not.</P>
    <P>Why should they be interfered with? Under the old system, they had some defence at least.  Under the new system, so far as I can see, they have no defence. Even if the Minister says there is no great difference, he has hit the money market for land.  Some people may think that is bad, but I think it is good so long as it does not go too far.  In my opinion, this is a very bad section, and it should be deleted from the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to wander about dealing with the various bogeys put up, but to deal again with <Col N="257" /> what is in the section, as I did at great length on the last occasion it was before the House.  I shall start with Deputy Flanagan who, of course, made the very same speech this evening as he made on the last occasion.  Indeed, I have lost count of the number of times he made it on the last occasion the Bill was before the House.  He is obviously trying to raise a scare as well as killing time.</P>
      <P>He suggested that this section was brought in by me as a Fidel Castro or Khrushchev for some sinister dictatorial purpose.  I should point out to the House that if this is true of this section in my case, it was equally true of the late Deputy Paddy Hogan of the Fine Gael Party who introduced the Land Act, 1923, in this House.  Let me again quote section 65 of the Land Act, 1923.  It provides:</P>
      <P>(1)  Where the Land Commission have after the date of the passing of this Act made any advance for the purchase of a holding or parcel, the proprietor thereof shall not subdivide or let the holding or parcel without the consent of the Land Commission, and every attempted subdivision or letting in contravention of this provision shall be void as against all persons, and on any such contravention the holding or parcel shall at the option of the Land Commission vest in them.</P>
      <P>That is the law, and has been the law, for all land purchased under the 1923 Act.  I am sorry to see Deputy Donegan leaving the House because I propose to give him some free legal advice.  It is this: the letting to which he referred in his county for five years was completely and absolutely void under section 65 of the 1923 Act, if he did not get the consent of the Land Commission and, after the first year for which the Deputy took the land, if someone offered her 10/- a year more, the lady who gave him the lease for five years could have pitched him out if he had not the consent of the Land Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have repeated the purpose of section 12 of this Bill over and over again to the House.  If it earns me the accolade of a Castro or a Khrushchev, as suggested by Deputy Flanagan, <i>a fortiori</i> those expressions apply to the man who introduced the 1923 Land Act, and who provided this complete control over subdivisions or lettings on all land purchased under the 1923 Act.  Indeed, long before the passage of the 1923 Act, there was a certain amount of control.  Many years before that, certain forms of control were exercised over subdivisions and sublettings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had better correct another complete misstatement of the law and the purposes of this section made by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins this evening. He wanted to know the purpose of the section.  He called for a House to enable Deputies to contemplate the terrible things that would be done under this section, and he wanted me to explain it.  If Deputy O'Higgins had such a great interest in the section,  <Col N="259" /> and if he could spare the time to come in here for the hours of discussion we have had on this section already, he would have his explanation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins is, no doubt, a distinguished lawyer in his own field, but he will never set the heather on fire with his alleged knowledge of the Land Acts when he does not know what every legal schoolboy knows, as I said before, that conacre lettings or agistment agreements are not controlled and are outside the Land Act, and have been for the past 80 years. There is not a first year solicitor's apprentice who does not know that. That is the answer to those people, including Deputy Blowick, who want to create the scare that conacre lettings are being controlled for the first time under this section.</P>
    <P>Now, let me come to the other point made by, I think, both Deputy Blowick and Deputy O'Higgins about the sinister reasons for the introduction of this section, who had the power to give consent, and the awful things that may be done under the section if the Minister has any power to give consent to subdivisions.  That comes very strangely from Deputy Blowick who, for the first time, provided in the 1950 Land Act, which he had passed through the House with the assistance of Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Flanagan, that subdivision would not be an excepted matter for the Land Commission and would be exercised by the Minister for Lands.  That principle was laid down for the first time in the history of this Dáil in Deputy Blowick's Land Act of 1950.  Those are the Deputies who are accusing me of having sinister intentions and exercising the withholding of consent in some sinister manner under the proposed section 12 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan also took I think rather a bad example when he suggested, for instance, that anybody can let a public house if he feels like it and it does not interfere with his right of sale or any of his rights over it.  Deputy Donegan should know, or some of the legal luminaries over there should know, that, under the Landlord and <Col N="260" /> Tenant Act, 1951, if any business premises in this country are let for a period of three years or over the owner cannot ever get them back and the tenant is entitled to go to court to get a lease for 21 years, renewable forever, on that particular property.  So, on this question of getting consent and the statement that property outside land is quite free and easy to be dealt with without any restriction, Deputy Donegan is completely incorrect and what he says is completely untrue.</P>
    <P>This requirement of the Land Commission's consent to the subdivision of land in the future, as set out under this section, is for one purpose only and that is to make the law uniform. Take, for example, lands purchased under some of the older Land Acts prior to 1903 which were not caught by the section I have quoted of the 1923 Land Act.  By redeeming the annuity in these cases, the owner could subdivide at his own sweet will without the consent of anybody.  One cannot do that, as I have pointed out, with any land purchased under the 1923 Act which I think deals with most of the land purchased in this country, certainly a very large amount of it. This is making the same law that was passed by the Dáil in the year 1923 applicable to all other types of land.</P>
    <P>Again, Deputy O'Higgins does not know what he is talking about when he alleges in respect of land purchased under the 1923 Act that if the annuity were redeemed one could subdivide it without any consent.  That is not so. That is not the law.  Any land purchased under the 1923 Act, whether or not the annuity is redeemed, is for all time subject to the provision that it cannot be subdivided without the consent of the Land Commission.  Indeed, if any rural Deputies look at their own folio they will see written across it that subdivision without the consent of the Land Commission is prohibited in respect of every single perch of land purchased under the Land Act, 1923.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this section is to apply the very same control and the very same necessary consent in respect of other lands outside the 1923 Act. Under this Act, we are making it applicable to all the land in the <Col N="261" /> country irrespective of the title to it so that lands that were formerly held, for instance, under a Fee Farm Grant or what lawyers call main lands will be brought under this Bill.  There is no reason, to my thinking, why these lands should not be subject to the very same rules against subdivision and subletting as was the position with the vast majority of the lands of this country that were purchased under the Land Act, 1923.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to follow all the bogeys which Deputy McQuillan raised under this section but he has a different approach altogether from that of Deputies opposite on this matter and attributes a different type of sinister purpose to this section.  He asks: &ldquo;What is the necessity for having this section at all?  Why have this control at all?&rdquo;  The reason for the necessity for this control against the fragmentation of holdings is quite obvious.</P>
    <P>Would it not be ludicrous if we, through legislation in this House and at the taxpayers' expense, built up economic units without at the same time maintaining control so that the units built up at the taxpayers' expense can be parcelled out and sold indiscriminately in sections, say, the following week or the following month?  I think that that, as a proposition, should make quite obvious to anyone the necessity for having control against subdivision.  Millions of pounds have been devoted down through the years and will be devoted towards increasing the size of holdings and towards endeavouring to build them into economic units.  If we have no control, what will be the position? Consider, for instance, a man who gets an addition of land and the following week, shall we say, flogs it to whoever comes along to him with a good price and he is quite free to do it.  The purpose of this section is to stop operations of that kind: I am speaking now of subdivision.</P>
    <P>As far as sublettings are concerned, the law has been all the time since the operation of the section I quoted in the 1923 Act that any letting of more than one year, any letting of two, three, four or five years&mdash;as has been <Col N="262" /> cited here &mdash; was completely and absolutely void without the consent of the Land Commission.  I have seen many cases.  The Land Commission give their consent as a matter of form in most of these cases.</P>
    <P>Of course, we always shall have on this section Deputies quoting the completely improbable and unrealistic case of a widow with a young family who will not be allowed to sublet her land. I have been listening to the widow's story since this Bill came into the House.  I am not prepared to shed any tears over it here.  Everybody knows that that is not the type of case the Land Commission bother their heads about.  Everybody knows that if a widow with a young family wants to let her holding for a period of years, she will get consent under this Bill, when enacted, in the same way as she got consent since the passing of the 1923 Act at any time she applied for it, merely for the asking.</P>
    <P>This section is merely making the law uniform.  It is merely applying the same provisions and the same control to all land in the country as those provided for away back in the year 1923 under section 65 of that Land Act.  I think I may have had to repeat myself but I have been doing this for hours on this section.  There are some sections of this Bill which, I concede, can be a matter for argument but to raise this bogey and to try to create this smokescreen in order to frighten our people about a section that is merely extending the same law as has been in existence in this country since 1923 to all land is beyond me. I have nothing further to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister admitted that he has power under the 1923 Act. I should like to know, briefly, why he is trying to bulldoze this section through the House now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion we discussed this Bill, I complained that it had been altered so much by amendments that we had now more amendments than Bill.  I have another complaint to make now.  I think we can call it the &ldquo;Bits and Pieces&rdquo; Bill, after the &ldquo;pop&rdquo; record.  It is being shoved in for discussion any time there is no other business for the House. <Col N="263" /> It is unfair both to the Minister and to Deputies who want to discuss the Bill that this sort of action should be taken.</P>
      <P>I was rather interested in the Minister's last comment that he was not going to lose any tears over the widow. As recently as a week or a fortnight ago, under existing legislation, as I pointed out, a widow in similar circumstances with a few acres of land was visited by an inspector and told that because she had let her land for a few weeks, not for a few years, she would lose the land.  A few days afterwards, she got a letter from the Land Commission confirming that.  I am afraid the Minister is either not quite clear as to what is happening in his Department or is not telling us exactly what is meant by this section.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I have written to the Minister's Department.  I do not like bothering the Minister with matters which are matters purely for his Department.  I regret to say that I have not yet received a reply.</P>
      <P>In regard to the subdivision of land, perhaps my approach is different from that of some others who have spoken. I do no agree that people with small holdings should be threatened that their holdings will be taken from them if, because of economic circumstances or any other good reason, they have to sublet for a period.  However, I agree that those who have a lot of land and who let it year after year for conacre or on the 11 months system for grass, are not entitled to hold on to that land. Unlike Deputy Donegan, I see no good reason why they should be allowed to continue.  If that were simply the issue in this section, it would have my support. Unfortunately, it is tied up with the other aspect.  It also entitles the Land Commission to take possession of small holdings of a few acres because of the fact that somebody&mdash;often a greedy neighbour, I am afraid&mdash;puts his eye on it and decides he will bring it to the notice of the Land Commission and ask that it should be acquired.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>We know from the Minister's statement and from past experience that the power of consent to the subdivision and letting of land was in the possession of the Land Commission under the 1923 Act.  We can also say from experience that in most cases they used this power reasonably well and wisely.  In this section power is also being taken to deal with lands other than those mentioned in the 1923 Act and I should like to clear up one or two points in this regard.</P>
      <P>If you extend the power to lands other than those covered by the 1923 Act, there must be some reason for it. I was not here for the discussion on the Bill last week.  We are all aware of the amount of land held under the Ashbourne and Wyndham Land Acts and other Acts as well.  Power is not confined in this case.  Amendment No. 24a in the list of additional amendments circulated by the Minister states:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 29, after &ldquo;and such consent may be either general or particular&rdquo; (inserted by amendment number 24) to insert the following :</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and may be subject to such conditions (if any) as the Land Commission think fit.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In a further amendment for an extension of the powers being sought under the Bill, the Minister goes on to say:</P>
      <P>The power of the Land Commission under this section shall be so exercised as to prevent the creation or continuance of holdings which, in the opinion of the Land Commission, are not economic holdings.</P>
      <P>No one in this House or outside it, or in the Land Commission, have issued a blueprint of an economic holding.  I have never yet heard a definition of an economic holding.  Those are some of the matters on which I should like to get information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an application is made to the Land Commission for the purpose of letting there should be some reasonable specific time mentioned.  It might be useful to say whether or not the Land Commission give consent or withhold it.  The Commission should at least <Col N="265" /> notify the applicant within a reasonable time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister saw fit to give me some free legal advice.  I rejoined, in the rather flurried atmosphere, that his advice was worth exactly what he defined it as&mdash;nothing. I have not the sections of the 1923 Act before me, but we know what has been the practice of the Land Commission over the years.  It is when the Land Commission have given notice of their intention to walk the lands that this question of subdivision arises.  The fragmentation of holdings was something they could refuse at all times.  I am not talking about that.  What I am talking about is this.  If you had a 150 acre farm&mdash;not a huge holding but certainly an economic holding&mdash; what normally happened over the years was that if a person sold that holding, it was hardly ever interfered with&mdash;I would say never interfered with&mdash;so long as the Land Commission had not lodged their notice before the sale. Under this section it appears to me as if the affair is strengthened to the extent that the Land Commission can refuse consent to the transfer of the holding and that is the end of it.  That is the step forward, as I understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This has nothing to do with transfers as the Deputy will see if he reads the section.  It deals with subletting and subdivision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the 150-acre holding where a man is selling 75 acres. What is going to happen then?  Can the Land Commission come along and stop the sale of it?  People are beginning to see that there is a future in land and beginning to pay high prices for it and beginning to pay men.  That is good, and it has only happened in the recent past.</P>
      <P>There is definitely a change here. The explanatory memorandum defines it:</P>
      <P>It is intended as a global provision taking the place of the unsatisfactory patchwork of control...</P>
      <P>There is a definite change.  The Minister's amendment, quoted by Deputy Carter, in fact, does not add anything to it:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> The powers of the Land Commission under this section shall be so exercised as to prevent the creation or continuance of holdings which, in the opinion of the Land Commission, are not economic holdings.</P>
    <P>The subdivision of the large farm between two sons which would create two economic holdings for them could be opposed on the grounds that there were congests about and that land would no longer be available that should be available to them.  I find the section most obnoxious.  I think the Minister is going too far, that the whole Bill goes too far and certainly section 12.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the section because it represents a further encroachment on the rights of ownership. We have had examples of this in the Town Planning legislation that went through the House a short time ago under which a man may not now decide to paint his house outside with a certain colour without having the previous consent of the town planning authority.  I can see that, by looking for extra power for bureaucracy, we are reaching the position where one would be afraid to cough without previous permission.</P>
      <P>This section is being opposed by every Deputy on this side of the House and by every Labour Deputy.  The Minister said it is being opposed for different reasons and that is true.  I am opposed personally to Deputy McQuillan's view.  He objects to the letting of land.  I have known many uneconomic holders who made themselves economic and were able to provide themselves with decent living standards because they were able to take a certain amount of land each year.  There are many parts of the country where for a generation or so this has been the practice.  I know one instance in Deputy Donegan's constituency where the practice has ceased to be possible for one reason.  That upset small uneconomic holders so that they did not know where to turn for a livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all right for the Minister to say here that conacre lettings are not legal <Col N="267" /> lettings.  A short time ago when the Minister for Local Government made certain statements here regarding his Department, I quoted these statements in our own local authority and our law agent said: &ldquo;I do not mind what the Minister states in the House; that is not law.&rdquo;  There is no good in having on record the Minister's assurance if it is not written into the Bill.  It is all right for the Minister to say it was a Cumann na nGaedheal Government that was responsible for the 1923 Act which controlled lettings.  I should safely say that if the late Deputy Paddy Hogan were alive today he would be the first to admit that in practice this was a wrong and undesirable provision and he would be the first to agree that it should be removed.</P>
    <P>I assume that the whole purpose of this piece of legislation is to improve existing legislation but if it consolidates the provision in the 1923 Act where there was this restriction on letting or ownership I would be prepared to stay here a long time opposing it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has complained that he is being kept a long time on this section and that it is not worth that. If it kept us here until Christmas it is worth it, I think, because I have seen so many families who could not have carried on and kept farms for their families.  I have experience of this in my own family and I am very bitter about it.  A family of eight, we had an outlving farm and we were persecuted by the Land Commission coming to have that outlying farm taken away from us simply because there was local agitation to have that done.  My parents were waiting for the family to grow up.  These are now two economic holdings doing a good job, thank God, but if the Land Commission gets absolute power local pressure will, I think, always bring about unjust actions.</P>
    <P>The people in Merrion Street cannot expect to know and should not know the intimate details of families, financially or otherwise.  People should not be asked to explain why, for a particular period, they have to let their lands.  That should be their business. If a man owns a shop or a factory he <Col N="268" /> can let it, or portion of it, and there is no power that I know of to prevent him.  I do not see why we should give this power to the Land Commission. It is undesirable and I think any Deputy who has any interest in rural Ireland should be here to oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am really at a loss to know what the attitude of the Fine Gael Party is to this section.  I could understand it if the previous speaker, Deputy Clinton, came along with his Party's policy on this matter with an amendment to wipe out the law of this land on subletting and subdivision since the 1923 Act which was passed by the predecessors of his own Party.  I cannot understand the hares raised here by Deputy Flanagan and others as to what will happen under this section when, in fact, all the section is doing is making what is the law of this land since 1923 applicable to other forms of land under different titles.  That is what this section is doing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Carter wanted some explanation of the subsection under which the Land Commission may give consent to subdivision generally or in a particular form.  The purpose of that is to save time-wasting red tape where, for instance, land subject to the Land Act of 1923 is being bought by a local authority.  In such a case a local authority would have to apply to the Land Commission, if they wanted to erect 20 labourers' cottages on that land, for 20 different consents.  In the same way, a building contractor who wanted land for development would, as the law stands, have to apply for Land Commission consent to make each subdivision of the land legal.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the sub-section is, in cases such as this, to enable the Land Commission to say: &ldquo;Since the purpose of the application for subdivision is what is stated you can go ahead and divide the land into as many subsections as you like for your building purposes.&rdquo;  The same applies to a local authority.  It will not be necessary for them to come back to the Land Commission for a separate consent in each case.  It is true that as the law stands their consent can be subject to various conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> What is envisaged are conditions the same as apply now.  Where small sections of land are involved and there is a subdivision, it involves the operation of the annuity on the whole portion of that holding and where the amount to be apportioned to that small portion that is sold is small, the Land Commission only make it a condition of their consent that the purchaser who is getting the small portion will redeem any annuity on it so as to avoid book-keeping on the part of the Land Commission and indeed to save himself the trouble as he might be issuing receipts for perhaps fivepence or sixpence or a shilling a year in respect of the subdivided portion.</P>
    <P>The other point referred to by Deputy Carter was in regard to the subsection which deals with the basis on which the Land Commission should refuse to give consent to subdivisions, that is, to prevent the creation of uneconomic holdings.  That has been the whole purpose behind this control of the Land Commission down through the years but it has never been expressly written out in our law.  Invariably when the Land Commission refuse their consent to the subdivision of a holding, it is for the purpose of stopping fragmentation of small holdings.</P>
    <P>Sometimes reasons are advanced as to why the subdivisions should go through and invariably the Land Commission would make it a condition of their consent that the purchaser of the divided holding would be an uneconomic holder and the piece purchased by him would be consolidated with his parent holding, so that he at least would be getting a better economic unit and two uneconomic holdings would not be created.  The Land Commission in this sense cannot look to the individual on the letting for the time being.</P>
    <P>It may be that the individual who was trying to subdivide his holding may have some outside work and wants to sell a portion of it.  He might be all right because of his occupation and could carry on in that unit but in ten or 20 years' time he may be gone from that unit and his son or some relation who inherits may not have <Col N="270" /> the same skills and would be back again on the books of the Land Commission looking for migration or an addition.  That is the reason it is necessary to exercise strict control in the matter of fragmentation of our land.</P>
    <P>As I said, that has always been the position in respect of land purchased under the 1923 Act and I think that that section of the 1923 Act captured land purchased under the 1903 Act but other lands purchased, or other advances made under other Land Acts prior to that, were free of that control. In relation to the Acts I have mentioned there is not such a large area involved but it is there.  There was also the position in regard to land purchased under the Acts prior to the two I have mentioned, that by paying off the annuity the owner could divide it up anyway he wished, irrespective of whether he was creating uneconomic holdings or otherwise.</P>
    <P>It is simply to bring in these lands, the control of which was not captured under section 25 of the 1923 Act, that this section is here, to make the one law for all lands as was laid down under the 1923 Act and the principle of which has been accepted by this Dáil and by the country at all times down through the years since 1923. As I have already pointed out, I think it would be the height of economic lunacy to be spending the taxpayer's money building up holdings without having the power to stop the individual who got the addition from subdividing and selling it out a week after the Land Commission had finished with it. I do not think any sensible Deputy would stand for that, or that the House would stand for it.</P>
    <P>As I said, nothing has been mentioned by any Deputy this evening in regard to this section with which we have not already dealt on the last occasion.  If the Party opposite feel, as evidently Deputy Clinton feels, that it is Fine Gael policy to repeal the Land Act of 1923, let them introduce the Bill and we will debate it.</P>

      <P>It has been chased around this House so much that it is nearly out of breath.  Chase it down in Cork.  You got a bad run there when you started chasing hares.  The purpose of section 12 is to provide the same provisions in regard to subletting and subdivision as have been the law since section 65 of the 1923 Act was passed.  If I said that once, I have said it a thousand times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the Minister is correct when he says that the 1923 Act had the same provisions. For one thing, not three minutes ago, he said that there was an extension of these provisions.  I have not the Bill before me and I have not the opportunity to examine it in detail, but, as I understand it, the position was that there were certain strictures only when the Land Commission had in fact moved.  That is what I understood from what the Minister said to me but certainly if he wants to throw legal jargon across the House and insist there is no change, then we do not accept it.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, there will be a great difference between present practice and the actual position when this Bill becomes law, if it is implemented as it now stands.  Then a list will exist in the Land Commission of every piece of land that is left in any way and this will constitute a list from which the Land Commission can move on holdings and it will mean a drop in the value of those holdings, with a reduction of value and fewer people employed on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take a subdivision which took <Col N="272" /> place in my parish many years ago. There were 18 men employed on an estate that was then in the possession of M. Delap, a Frenchman, whom I mentioned here a week ago, who was supposed to have got a large fund from the British for betraying Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo.  It is divided now.  There is one family and there are four or five bachelors.  That is the sum total of the whole business.</P>
    <P>Are we to give power to the Land Commission who will be free to do this sort of thing anywhere they like? I have given an instance tonight where subdivision of a holding was effected by the Land Commission.  The total holding was 37 acres and it took the parish priest and the local Deputy to go before the Lay Commissioners to stop it.  Deputy Clinton has given an instance of a family of eight on a large farm who, because the mother and father were not in a position to farm the land for health reasons for a period of perhaps a decade, were afflicted by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Let us face it.  We have to look at section 12 and every section of this Bill on the basis that there will be political agitation in a district.  I, personally, hate land division as such except it is land division involving a movement from the west to a very big farm that is not being used.  As far as local land division is concerned, I have no objection to being reported in the local paper or the national Press as saying that I hate it, that it has done no good and I am personally opposed to it.  How my Party deals with it is a matter for the majority in the Party.</P>
    <P>This is a most intricate Bill.  My Party will deal with it section by section and when it comes, as amended, to be voted on, the Party will vote on it as the majority decide.  The individual Deputy, whether he is a member of a Party or not, can say what he thinks.  That is the way my vote will be inside my Party.  We have to look at every section of the Bill on the basis that, in my parish and in Deputy Corry's parish and in every other Deputy's parish, any holding that, say, for a decade or part of a decade, has been let, any holding that seems to be, for a while, not fully used, is open to local political agitation for subdivision <Col N="273" /> and a full list will be compiled in the Land Commission, a list that never existed previously.</P>
    <P>I never knew of the section of the 1923 Act being implemented whereby if there was a letting, that letting was registered in the Land Commission.  I never knew of it to happen and I have known of plenty of lettings for more than 12 months.  I have been involved in many lettings.  I am in the agricultural business and I know of these things.  I have never known of it to happen and the Minister says there will be no change.</P>
    <P>I am certain that what Deputy Clinton said is quite correct, that if the late Deputy Paddy Hogan could turn in his grave, he would do so in respect of some of the sections of the Land Act of 1923.  Apart from the question of bringing people from the west and setting them up on a large estate, what real good has the Land Commission succeeded in doing in regard to subdivision?  I could give no instance in my county, which is a county of small farmers, where the result has been better than the original situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister can abuse me for my opinions, if he likes.  He can say they are wrong.  He can say that I am a man for the big farmer, that I am against the small farmer.  He can say all these things but we must look at this section in the way that I see it now, that there will be a list of all the land that is let and this means that if you lease land in Ireland you have to work it or, if you cannot work it for health or financial reasons or for any other reason, that land will be on a list in the Land Commission and that means that it is open to local agitation or political agitation.</P>
    <P>Would it not be far better if, instead of these strictures and lists that will be prepared as a result of section 12, the Minister had inserted in the Bill a section whereby he would set up a farm apprenticeship scheme and from there set up a system of leasing or purchasing land over a period?  There is no suggestion that this will happen. What the Minister wants is power and more power.  I do not see the reason for it.  I think the Land Commission <Col N="274" /> has far too much power already. There can be a bid at an open auction by a solicitor or any other person who need not give his identity until such time as he has got the land, which means that nobody knows that the Land Commission is the bidder.  That is sufficient power.  The only exception is the one I specifically mentioned where it is a question of a large estate on which there is no employment and where there is the congestion that Deputy McQuillan speaks of, in which case it might be a good thing to bring 20 people out of the congested area and set them up on the estate in question.</P>
    <P>Here we have a list being produced. For instance, in Louth, where there are 1,000 people earning £15 a week in GEC in Dunleer and another 500 to 600 persons employed between the two industries in Castlebellingham, five miles away, not counting female employees, is there anything in saying to a man who has 25 acres: &ldquo;I will give you 10 more acres and your son can stay there&rdquo;?  Do you know the sons who are staying there?  They are the sons who are rejected by the factories, who cannot earn this £15.  There is no case for land division in Ireland today, except on the basis of a movement from the west.</P>
    <P>This section, to me, seems quite extraordinary.  Of course, the Minister has not made any specific exclusion of conacre.  He has produced amendment No. 24b which indicates that this section is to be used to prevent the creation or the continuance of uneconomic holdings.  That can be defined any way you like.  The section can be used for any purpose you like.</P>
    <P>There is far too much power being sought and, with the exception of the case in which the Minister and Deputy McQuillan would be more interested locally than I would be, for instance, that is, the case of a movement of congests from the west, I do not see any case for giving more power to the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>Deputy McQuillan referred to conacre.  There is the stub of a cheque below with Peter Odlum for £27,000 paid to one farmer for wheat grown in conacre last year.  That gentleman does not live in this country. He could afford to do that on a net profit from a quarter barrel of wheat per acre.</P>
      <P>What about the 40-acre and the 50-acre farmer carrying on rotation tillage?  What are his profits; where will he find himself?  A sand and gravel merchant in my county has about 900 acres of grain tillage in Tipperary.  I suppose it was against him the boys got an injunction in the court the other day.  You have that going on throughout the country and side by side with it you have men endeavouring to eke out a livelihood on 18, 15 or, in some cases, 10 statute acres of land.</P>
      <P>I have given instances of it here.  Unfortunately, today the Land Commission will have to pay five times the price that an inter-Party Government could have got it for if they had been prepared to buy it during their term of office.  I mentioned the case of the 425 statute acre farm.  The three Deputies for the constituency came here and appealed to the then Minister for Lands to purchase that holding.  The Minister refused.  The pull of the Unionist section in that area was stronger than that of the elected representatives.  The farmer sold the holding for £7,000.  It was afterwards bought by a cattle dealer for £14,000.  Later still it was bought by a German for £37,000.  He has had it for seven years.  Is it not time he was got out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taxpayer will now pay £42,000 for that farm which could have been <Col N="276" /> bought for £7,000 when Deputy Blowick, as Minister for Lands, refused to acquire it.  That is a bitter fact. Last week I mentioned another holding of 1,000 acres.  It was recommended for division to the Land Commission and they took 15 acres out of it.  That was their measurement.  I was amazed. Within three miles of my area, in Carrigtuohill, we took over a farm, again occupied by a German.  I found, within a mile of that holding, 13 holdings smaller than 15 acres each. They were occupied by farmers who all deserved sufficient land on which to get married and rear families.  I do not know about the fellows in Louth, the bachelors about whom Deputy Donegan complained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

      <P>They must be tainted with the dirty milk.  We have cases like that every day of the week.  An English lady came over and bought 80 acres. That has been let to two farmers during the past five years and she is living in the house.  That holding, acquired and divided, would give two decent farms to two decent families prepared to live and work on it.  The PLV of the land is 35/- per statute acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Deputy worth his salt, who wants to do his job for his constituents, should go out after these holdings, put his finger on them and see them cleared out.  That is his job.  I mentioned that last case to the Minister last week.  I shall now mention another.  A foreign firm came in and bought about 2,000 acres of land&mdash;for an industry, they said.  The industry was supposed to extend and expand to such an extent that many acres would be sold out in patches for industrial units.  Now we find 1,200 acres of that land set for four years to one individual.  I raised the matter here last week and warned the Minister I would keep at it until something was done, until the land was acquired and divided among the people.  I have a job to do for my constituents and I shall do it and I do not care whether people like it or not. <Col N="277" /> Deputy Donegan dealt with his constituency, one-third the size of mine.</P>

      <P>The section seeks to prevent subdivision into smaller holdings.  That is what is giving the trouble.  You get a holding of 30 acres.  The owner has two sons and he gives each of them 15 acres and they are miserable for the rest of their lives. To any Deputy who cares to visit my constituency I can show a holding of 20 acres.  One field is Mike's, another is John's and so on right through the <Col N="278" /> miserable 20 acres.  When the old man was dividing the land, rather than have them arguing about it he had them toss a coin.  That happened down in Carrigtuohill.  Thank God, we now have the hundred odd acres we took off the German and we will be able to settle them.  One meets that state of affairs everywhere one looks.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister about ten questions last week in connection with areas which should, in my opinion, be declared congested areas because of the condition of affairs I found in them.  There has been talk about the value of land.  Last year one holding of less than 100 acres was purchased by the Land Commission in Ballymacoda. The Land Commission paid £13,000 for it.  That was considered an enormous amount of money.  In fact, I think the Land Commission nearly kicked against paying that amount for it.  That holding was let a month ago in conacre amongst the prospective tenants, pending division. What rent did they get?  They got £1,800 for 97 acres over a period of 11 months.</P>

      <P>So much for the lighter side of Deputy Corry's contribution.  To get down now to the serious implications of the section, I want to tell the House that the auctioneering profession decided to seek the best possible legal opinion on the section.  They did so.  The auctioneering profession, I may say, hold the Minister for Lands in the highest possible esteem.  He is the only Minister for Lands who ever did anything practical for the auctioneers. He was responsible for taking the necessary steps to pay the auctioneers the five per cent commission on land being disposed of and purchased from clients by the Land Commission.  In that I think he was right.  As one member of the profession, I applaud him for taking such a courageous step, a step with very gratifying and satisfactory results.  I sing his praises. We all appreciate what he did.</P>
      <P>The auctioneering profession has a very high opinion of the Minister for Lands.  They appreciate his efforts. They look upon him as a Minister for Lands who has an intimate knowledge of the law since he is himself a very eminent professional man, or was before he became Minister for Lands, and, in that capacity, he shed great lustre and contributed in no small degree and in a very distinguished manner to his profession.  Neverthetheless, the auctioneering profession decided, having read the Bill and having read section 12 particularly, that in order to get first-hand information on that section, they should seek the highest legal opinion they could obtain, and they did so.  For the record, may I quote from the legal opinion which was obtained by the auctioneers association?</P>

      <P>Yes, to be used in connection with this section.  It says:</P>
      <P>It seems to us that section 12 is now so widely worded that it is very serious interference with the general right of property ownership.  Indeed, a question may arise as to whether the section is unconstitutional.  There may be some merit in controlling the disposition of land which has been acquired initially with the assistance of the Land Commission and in respect of which an annuity still may be payable.  But the section will equally apply to land not held under any of the Land Acts and to land in respect of which all land annuities have been fully paid off.  It seems a gross interference with the right of property ownership that the landowner in such a case cannot deal with his land without the consent of the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>It seems a fair inference that this section has been put in so that the Land Commission may be put on notice of virtually all cases where land is being let because the landowner is not directly working the land himself.  The Land Commission then has an opportunity of looking at the land with a view to acquisition. The Land Commission will then have an opportunity of negotiating from a position of strength for they can prejudice the landowner's own freedom of action through the expendient of refusing him permission to let the lands and then taking advantage of that to try to depreciate the price at which the land could be purchased.</P>
      <P>If article 12 is allowed to stand unchallenged, it would be a serious interference with the right of property ownership.</P>

      <P>This expression of opinion is shared by all people of commonsense and average intelligence. They know quite well the serious implications it has in regard to the right of the individual who owns property.  Let me leave aside for one moment the valuable expression of legal opinion obtained by the <Col N="284" /> auctioneering profession and come to a further opinion with which I am sure Deputy Corry will not find fault. It comes from the National Farmers Association.  The National Farmers Association is a very reputable and distinguished body, representative of all the farmers.  The considered opinion of that body was sent, under the title &ldquo;Observations on Land Bill, 1963&rdquo; to members of this House and particularly to the Minister for Lands.  The NFA had something very special to say about section 12 in this memorandum which was issued from their headquarters at 27 Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin.  They say:</P>
      <P>Section 12 provides that the subdivision, letting and subletting of all agricultural land in the State shall be subject to Land Commission consent.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that this does not and is not intended to apply to conacre or agistment lettings.  No specific exemption is written into the Bill itself, but amendment 24b, put down by the Minister, states that &ldquo;The powers of the Land Commission under this section shall be so exercised as to prevent the creation or continuance of holdings which, in the opinion of the Land Commission, are not economic holdings&rdquo;. This indicates that the emphasis is on preventing fragmentation of holdings and we agree that such prevention is essential.  However, bearing in mind that there are adequate provisions elsewhere in the Bill to control undesirable forms of conacre, we recommend that conacre and agistment lettings should be specifically exempted in Section 12.</P>
      <P>We see no reason why a reasonable time limit, say, one month, should not apply to Land Commission consideration of applications under this section.  Failing any objection by the Land Commission within one month the applications should be deemed to have been granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the considered opinion of the NFA, the farmers.  In the NFA there are smallholders, uneconomic holders and conacre tenants as well as substantial farmers.  Therefore, when the <Col N="285" /> NFA speak, I presume they are speaking with the full knowledge that they are the mouthpiece of the farmers.  I am glad I have placed on record the legal opinion obtained by the auctioneering profession, and the considered opinion, after lengthy consideration, of the farmers through their organisation, the NFA.  What greater incentive could the Minister have than to act on the knowledge and advice obtained by the auctioneering profession and the farmers?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister even at this late stage to withdraw the section from the Bill entirely and completely, or to tell the House what does he propose to achieve by leaving it in the Bill.  He has not done so.  Every time the Minister rises to speak on section 12, he says he has dealt with it all before, that he will not go over it again, and sits down.  I did not leave the House from the time the Land Bill was first mentioned today till this moment, and I did not hear the Minister deal with section 12.  I heard him make rambling statements, roving and roaming through various Acts.  He quoted the Hogan Act and other acts but we are dealing with the 1963 Bill, and section 12 of the 1963 Bill.</P>
    <P>When the Minister gets up to speak again, I am sure he will comment on the legal opinion and the opinion of the NFA which I have quoted.  Will he tell the House what does he propose to achieve by leaving section 12 in the Bill?  Will he do what he was requested to do and make clear what he proposes to achieve with the section? Referring to Deputy O'Higgins's speech he said that every first year student knows that conacre lettings are excluded in the 1923 Land Act, and excluded from the terms of this section and this Bill.  There is nothing in this Bill or in this section to indicate clearly and legally to me that conacre lettings are excluded.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out 20 times multiplied by ten in this House, when you are before a learned judge, he will be determining not what the Minister says, not what Deputy Corry says, not what any Deputy says, but what is in the Bill.  That is why the NFA have <Col N="286" /> asked in a reasonable, mild, cool and calm way that agistments and conacre lettings should be exempted from section 12 and that the Minister should say so.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants the speedy passage of the Bill.  Would it not be very easy for him to stand up and say: &ldquo;In view of what has been said, in view of the expressions of opinion that have been quoted, and moved by the eloquence of Deputy Corry, on Report Stage I will put in three lines exempting agistments, conacre and temporary lettings&rdquo;?  If that were done, we could all sit down, pass the section, and say we had done a good night's work.  The Minister would get a halo from the auctioneering profession to go around his head.  We might even consider purchasing a bust of the Minister and putting it in the main hall of our office.  The Minister appears to have lost his patience.  From time to time we all lose our patience.  The Minister may now be in a more pleasant mood than he was earlier, and I ask him to come back on Report Stage and exempt conacre, agistments and temporary lettings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was inclined to pay some heed to the legal opinion quoted by Deputy Flanagan until he followed it up with a statement of the losses the auctioneers would be at if section 12 went through.  We all know what legal opinion is.  If you could not get two legal opinions from two legal gentlemen, there would be no law cases and no judges.  The first thing a legal gentleman asks is what will suit you. Certainly he had 100 per cent proof from Deputy Flanagan that what would suit the auctioneering profession was that he should condemn section 12 in all its moods and tenses, and he did so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How often have we gone to one of those gentlemen and got five or six pages of a legal opinion?  How often have we seen it sent to the local authorities and when the case was over, you would wonder what had happened when you came out and found you had lost the case, with costs given against you.  That is all I care about legal opinion.  They ask: &ldquo;What does he want us to say&mdash;that the section is all <Col N="287" /> right or that it is rotten, harmful, wrong and contrary to the Constitution? If he wants us to say that, we will do so.&rdquo;  That is my point of view on legal opinion and I do not care who likes it and who does not.</P>
    <P>I have given instances of the harm that has been done by this widespread letting of land, particularly in the vicinity of Dublin.  I have mentioned the man with the cheque for £27,000. Either the auctioneers combined to take all the conacre for him, or they had their instructions: &ldquo;Look, knock it down to So-and-So, no matter what happens and no matter what price it goes.&rdquo;  That man had between 2,000 and 3,000 acres of land under wheat. That has driven the ordinary tillage farmer out of grain.</P>

      <P>That is what we want to know.  Deputy Flanagan tried to put the tail and horns on my statement about the holding the Land Commission purchased.  The facts were that it had to be proved that portion of the holding was acquired from migrants or else it could be paid for only in land bonds.  As an auctioneer, Deputy Flanagan knows that, if he knows anything at all about it.  I can understand Deputy Flanagan's worry and the worry of other auctioneers in this matter.  It is sticking out a mile. I have already given here the condition of affairs as I found them in my constituency which is supposed to be a completely non-congested area and the absolute necessity for getting hold of land there and it is my intention to get hold of that land come hell or high water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief on this occasion.  I want to answer the remarks of Deputy Corry.  He referred to the stub of a cheque for £27,000 for conacre wheat which somebody in Dublin or some wheat miller has in his possession.  I accept the Deputy's word about it.  I have referred also to 105 transactions in seven counties and the 105 transactions were in connection with the conacre letting of land for the growing of wheat.  The total lettings were 40,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> I want to make my position clear in this matter.  Section 12 will not strengthen, according to the Minister, his hands in the slightest degree in any effort he may make to take that land from those individuals who are letting it or the people who are exploiting it.  There is nothing in section 12 that will enable the Minister to lay hands on the land for which Deputy Corry stated £27,000 was paid for the letting. That is the trouble.</P>
    <P>While we oppose this section, I want to make it quite clear that we do so for motives completely different from those put forward by Deputy Donegan. I should like to quote what the National Farmers Association did say in their full comment on section 12. I agree with Deputy Flanagan that their criticism, as he quoted it here, is accurate but he should have finished it.  They went on to say that the Minister had introduced amendment 24 (b) which states:</P>
    <P>The power of the Land Commission under this section shall be so exercised as to prevent the creation or continuance of holdings which in the opinion of the Land Commission are not economic holdings.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister was out to allay the fears of the National Farmers Association by saying: &ldquo;Look, boys, I shall not touch the 100-, 200-, 500-acre farmers but I shall concentrate on the small farmer and on the uneconomic farmer in the congested areas&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>I have borne in mind particularly the demand of the people in the congested areas for a higher standard of living.  The fact that in certain parts of the country many <Col N="290" /> holdings lie vacant and let.... The Report of the inter-departmental Committee on the Problems of Small Western Farms was most revealing also in filling out the picture of the problems confronting us.</P>
    <P>The Minister went to the report of the Committee on Small Western Farms in order to get a certain background to suit him in regard to this measure.  He did so not for the purpose of improving the conditions of the congests but in order to get sufficient arguments that would enable him to bring in a measure to bring about the structural changes which in the process of bringing them about would eliminate the small holding.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 11 of the inter-departmental Committee's Report states that the table attached to the report in Appendix D gives particulars of the lands let in the West of Ireland and in the congested areas.  Even in this report, they sought to suggest that in the west the greatest amount of land was being let.  On that basis, the Minister brought in this section to deal with that and to get rid of the small farmers.</P>
    <P>What is the position?  In fact, in the east and in the midlands of this country, according to Appendix D in the report of the inter-departmental Committee on Small Western Farms, over 10.4 per cent of the lands are either wholly or partly let and in the west of Ireland where all the talk is about and where the report concentrates, the figure is only 10.5 per cent. There is a difference of .1 per cent between the letting figure for the east and west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Let is look at the types of holdings in the east of Ireland which are being excluded according to the Minister. Here are the figures.  In the 100- and 200-acre groups in the east of Ireland, 8.4 per cent of the lands are let.  In the over 200-acre group in the east of Ireland, 12.9 per cent of the lands are let.  If we compare the number of 200-acre holdings in the east of Ireland and in the west of Ireland it becomes really apparent to this House that there is no comparison whatever&mdash;if I might <Col N="291" /> repeat that word again&mdash;with regard to the numbers.</P>
    <P>There are few holdings left in the west over 200 acres but we have a large percentage of holdings in the midlands over 200 acres&mdash;and over 12 per cent of those are let.  Section 12, according to the Minister, will not touch those holdings because at the moment they can be described as economic.  But consider the small holding and the uneconomic holding in the west.  Fifty per cent of the owners had to get out of the country and the same 50 per cent would like to come back to rear their families here at some stage.  They will now be caught under this section.  The very man Deputy Corry mentioned in Cork, with the 15 to 20 acres surrounding the 500-acre farm, waiting, and rightly so, for a division of that estate, can now be caught under section 12. If they attempt, in the meantime, to go to England and sublet their lands, they can now be caught by the Minister under this section.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry should think twice before supporting the Minister on this. It is bad enough to find that 47,000 people have left the land in six years because no attempt was made to hold them and allow them rear families on proper-sized holdings.  We are now legislating to drive far more off the land.</P>

      <P>I gather from what Deputy Flanagan said that the Minister, intervening in this debate, referred to the view I expressed earlier with regard to the definition of letting and subletting in section 12.  Apparently, the Minister said that any first year law student would know certain things.  I am not a first year law student; I am a Deputy of this House, and anything I express I express as a Deputy.  May I repeat what I said earlier that, as far as I am aware as a Deputy, in none of the Land Acts is there any definition of what letting or subletting means.  In the Hogan Act passed by this House in 1923 provision was made that all tenanted land in Ireland would on an appointed day vest in the Land Commission.  That was an Act designed by the late Paddy Hogan to end, once and for all, the idea of landlordism in this country. It achieved that by providing that every portion of agricultural land which happened to be leased or tenanted to a landlord would on an appointed day vest in the Land Commission. From that on until the property was dealt with, it would be held from the Land Commission.  The Minister says in that Act there is a definition of letting which excludes conacre, pasturage and provisions of that kind.  I challenge him to point out where it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, I presume the Minister did not say that. May I repeat what I said earlier: in <Col N="294" /> none of the Land Acts is there any definition of letting and subletting which excludes conacre, pasturage, agistment or lettings of that kind. There have been common decisions by judges, of which I am aware, but that is not an issue.  The interesting thing in this Bill is that there is a definition section which defines a congested area and various other things but nowhere is there any effort to define the words we are concerned with in section 12 &ldquo;letting or subletting&rdquo; or &ldquo;subdivide&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister has offered us an opinion, based presumably on advice given to him, but has not offered to write it into the section.  I think what Deputy Flanagan said is quite a reasonable observation.  If the Minister is so clear that this section could not possibly refer to what Deputy McQuillan feels it does refer to, why not put the matter finally at ease one way or another by so providing in the section?  Why is it that the section leaves it so vague using the terms &ldquo;letting or subletting&rdquo; without defining them, leaving Deputy Flanagan, Deputy Donegan and myself to draw one inference and leaving Deputy McQuillan to draw an entirely different inference, with the Minister quite happy in between?  This is a section which is unnecessary and is kept in the Bill for some reason which has not been satisfactorily explained. If it is passed, it will give to some authority a power which should not be there and is unnecessary to the solution of the land resettlement problem. On all grounds, it is, in my view, obviously a wrong section to have in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan has, in fact, produced an excellent argument regarding this problem.  I am sure he can see that on our side we have, for different reasons, reached the same conclusion that this is a bad section.  Why, as the Deputy said, when the Minister sought to placate the NFA by putting in amendment 24 (b), did he not go on to specify conacre lettings and agistments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I hear there is to be a list in the Land Commission&mdash;I maintain this <Col N="295" /> is against the Minister because this is the first time such a list will be compiled of all lettings&mdash;I begin to worry whether this will result in land division by the officers of the Land Commission. For the first time also, in another section, the Minister has the right to start division proceedings where perhaps things should be left as they are.  With the exception of the clearance people from Deputy McQuillan's area, I still insist there is no case for anything but the bid by the unknown bidder and the Land Commission at the auction.</P>
    <P>I heard the other day from a reputable auctioneer that if an auctioneer sends in a list of clients with land to offer to the Land Commission, he will get full commission on the first £5,000 of any purchase and a lesser commission on the balance.  What does that open up?  It is another sort of list.  Who is an auctioneer's client? Take the situation where an auctioneer comes up to a man that he thinks might sell his farm and says: &ldquo;I may have a customer for your land.  I take it the value might be £7,000 or £8,000. Have I the right to inquire for you?&rdquo; The farmer says: &ldquo;Yes, you have.&rdquo; Why should he not, if he is interested in selling or if he thinks the price would suit him?  That is his first reaction and he is probably a friend of the auctioneer.  But when this Bill is forgotten and is a piece of legislation, down goes his name on a list in the Land Commission.  Later, some junior official in the Land Commission, looking at the number of congests in the area and the kind of land it is, reaches a conclusion and before the man knows where he is, the first bid is in from the Land Commission or perhaps acquisition proceedings are begun.  At that stage his land may have changed in value by 50 per cent.  Will this lead people to make investment in land?</P>
    <P>I put down a question a few weeks ago about a particular estate, the name of which I did not mention and will not mention now.  I asked if it were Land Commission policy to institute proceedings for the purchase of land when a farmer of £40 valuation with three boys and three girls growing up <Col N="296" /> had paid a deposit on the land to purchase it?  I got an inconsequential answer.  I asked supplementary questions. Deputy Faulkner from my own constituency also came in.  The next thing happened was that the Land Commission went in and bid more money.  The good deed I did was to get more money for the owner of the land. More luck to him.  I am delighted with that.</P>
    <P>There are other factors to be considered. There is no use in saying that everything goes back to the Lay Commissioners, four people with the standing of High Court judges, and that the Minister, the Fianna Fáil cumann or the Fine Gael branch or the Labour Party branch has no influence on the Land Commission in the division of land.  Under this section we are to have a list of all the land let in the country except the 11-month lettings and also a list of another kind and queer things can happen.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Corry and his £27,000 cheque for wheat, I think it was rather like his Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday purchase and sale and division of land.  The snag about it is that the man mentioned does not buy himself but through agents.  He could not have known the name of the individual farmer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should accede to the very reasonable request of Deputy O'Higgins regarding an addition to the definition section.  The Minister is taking a wide power that, no matter what he may have said earlier, this Parliament never attempted to take before.  In that regard I want to protest against the terms of the explanatory memorandum issued in respect of this Bill and which is used by the Press and others for the purpose of explaining the Bill to the public.  We are told in it, at page 3, that section 11 provides that the subdivision, letting or subletting of all agricultural land in the State shall be subject to Land Commission consent.  It would be much fairer, more honest and explicit if the alleged explanation said the section <Col N="297" /> provided that the subdivision, letting and subletting of all agricultural land in the State shall be subject to land Commission control.  That is what it means, no matter what the Minister may say.</P>
      <P>More and more control is being exercised over the ordinary citizen in regard to rights in his own private property.  I should like to refer the House to what exactly &ldquo;holding&rdquo; means in relation to section 12.</P>
      <P>In this section &ldquo;holding&rdquo;, in relation to a particular tenant or proprietor, means all the property held by him at or after the passing of this Act under a single demise, whether fee simple, fee farm grant or leasehold or from year to year, etc.</P>
      <P>All estates of any land are subject not to the consent&mdash;I defy the Minister to deny this&mdash;but to the control of the Minister and the Land Commission and some hidden hand somewhere over which the property owners have no control once this section passes.  In these circumstances, the very least&mdash;I would deem it no concession&mdash;the Minister can do is accede to Deputy O'Higgins's request that people whose land is now to be subject to the control of some person or persons described here as the Land Commission, should know exactly what letting and sub-letting mean.</P>
      <P>Let me protest again against the compendious terms of this section and against the manner in which it was submitted to the House by way of alleged explanation in the explanatory memorandum which goes on to say:</P>
      <P>It is intended as a global provision taking the place of the unsatisfactory patch-work of control operating under existing enactments which are listed for repeal in the First Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would understand that sentence to mean that the Land Commission already had these powers. That is not a fact.  The Minister knows it is not and when this explanatory memorandum was submitted to Deputies, it <Col N="298" /> was known that it was not a fact and this was, in my opinion, deliberately or otherwise, a misrepresentation of legislation which this House is asked to pass.  It was never a fact that up to now all land, whether fee simple, fee-farm grant, or leasehold, or from year to year, or held jointly or in common or alone or in severalty, was subject to the control which the Minister now seeks to obtain over it for the Land Commission.  Again let me protest against this: it is revolutionary in the extreme and it is a section which the House should not pass.</P>

Unfortunately, I am not in the position that Deputy Corry is in and when I report a big farm with a number of small farms to the Land Commission, they tell me in six months' time that they had not <Col N="299" /> been able to get around to it.

      <P>The position as we see it is that conacre, and I am referring to conacre on a large scale and particularly to what remains of the wheat ranches, is not interfered with in the Bill.  The Minister&mdash;I hope I am not misquoting him&mdash;says that conacre will still be allowed.  If conacre is still allowed, wheat ranchers can without let or hindrance continue to take large tracts of land and make a fat profit, whether they come from Germany or from Cork.  It does not matter where the farmer comes from&mdash;he can get the conacre and if the weather is fine, pick up a very substantial profit.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party do not want the small farmers' rights interfered with but we do believe&mdash;and here is where I disagree with Deputy Donegan&mdash;that if there is a big farmer who is continually letting his land, whether for conacre or on the 11 months system, or for five years or ten years, it is right that the Land Commission should consider taking it from him.  We have no objection to that and we would support the Minister on it.</P>

      <P>We do not say that the Land Commission should have the right to go to the holder of a small farm and have the further right to take the land from such people because through some unfortunate circumstances they had to let the land over a short period.  I do not think there is anything wrong with that and it should be allowed.  As Deputy McQuillan said, it is quite clear what the Minister wants to do here.  He wants to get authority to get at the small farmer.  What assistance this is going to give him in the relief of congestion I do not know.  Perhaps I do not know enough about the west of Ireland but Deputy McQuillan <Col N="300" /> certainly does and I am prepared to take his word for it.  As far as Meath is concerned, there are large farms which can be taken over by the Land Commission but they do not seem to be in a hurry to do so.  They have a sizeable amount of land and if there is talk about subletting, they should be the first to stop it because they have 9,000 acres sublet for a number of years and they will continue to do that as long as they feel like it.  We will support the Minister on the question of subletting of large farms&mdash;the Land Commission should take them over&mdash; but we are not prepared to have the small farmer further abused.</P>

      <P>He is catering specifically for the small landholder.  When he is trying to do that, I submit he is entitled to fair play, whatever criticism we may express about the Bill.  We know that there are derelict small holdings in Deputy McQuillan's county. Why should the Minister not have the same control and be able to say to the owners of these derelict small holdings: &ldquo;You must return here from abroad and indulge in some form of husbandry; otherwise I cannot permit you to continue to let your land whilst I am at the same time going to penalise a landholder in Meath, Longford or Westmeath&rdquo;?  Why should Deputy McQuillan or Deputy Tully seek to introduce a form of partition, if you like, into section 12?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> We have heard a great deal from the opposite benches about foreigners buying land and every Order Paper carries questions regarding the division of lands.  We must look at this matter in a reasonable fashion.  As we know, there is a demand for more land division. There is pressure in this House every day in the week in regard to it and there is also pressure from outside, as Deputy McQuillan has stated.  From platform and pulpit, we hear the call for more land division.</P>
    <P>It is assumed that if the Minister wants the Land Commission to play an active part in the rearrangement of holdings and the division of land, they must have the necessary powers so that their intentions in this regard will not be exploited as, we happen to know, their intentions were exploited in the past.  All of us know that if a holding is for sale and it is mentioned in the locality that the Land Commission is a potential buyer, the value of the land automatically goes up.  We must have sufficient common sense to realise that if the Minister is to allow the Land Commission to stand by powerless while manipulation of the kind we have talked about is going on, he could be deemed to have no power or authority over land division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in the Bog of Allen.  I can go to the Deputy's own door and point out derelict holdings to him, some of which have been derelict for the past ten or 12 years. It should be our aim to encourage a pattern of good husbandry, not merely on large farms but on small farms. As I have said at the outset, no one <Col N="302" /> has given me or has given the House a blueprint for an economic holding. I want to ask the Deputy: why should the Minister not have the same power of consent in regard to land in the congested areas as he would have, say, in regard to land elsewhere?</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Donegan's argument, I do not think he favours land division at all.  He comes from a very good county.  He was candid enough to say that much; that, in fact, he does not agree with the policy of land division or rearrangement at all.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>The net point is this: Every Deputy would need a Land Bill of his own and none of us would be satisfied even if we got permission to introduce a Private Member's Bill. It might be the easiest solution for the Minister if he were to say, &ldquo;I will leave it to the House.  Let each Deputy bring in a Private Member's Bill to suit himself.&rdquo;  Each of us would do that.  The more I listened tonight to the various arguments made, the more I am convinced that each Deputy would want to divide land in his own way, to suit his own locality and the people living there.</P>

      <P>Whatever long-winded arguments we may have heard about the NFA, the NFA, if I interpret their intentions correctly, issued documents regarding foreginers buying land here and the NFA were as long-winded on this subject as any other organisation or as any Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Including Deputy Carter and Deputy McQuillan and others. There is also the fact that the NFA did not formulate a blueprint, so far as I am aware, for land division.  It is a <Col N="303" /> matter that the NFA or any other voluntary organisation would shy away from because it is a difficult problem.  As we are all aware, it is tied up with historical emotions which have been handed down to us from the past.  Land has been the cause of major conflicts here and of minor conflicts also and, to that extent, no one will begrudge the Minister for Lands whatever power he seeks in this Bill, short of, as he said himself, setting out to exterminate the farmers.  The powers he seeks in the Bill are powers with which we are all familiar and some of the powers, as the Minister said, have existed since the 1923 Land Act. Therefore I cannot see why the Labour Party, in particular, take such a strong view of section 12.  I cannot see anything in it that will operate to the detriment, shall we say, of the small holder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene to try to alter Deputy Carter's view of this question of creating a new form of partition in the country.  It has been suggested that Deputy Tully's speeches and my speeches have sought to create a sort of partition in so far as land is concerned.  In fact, it is the Minister and Deputy Carter who are seeking to create a form of partition in this matter.</P>
      <P>My reading of the section, and the Minister's expressed interpretation of the National Farmers Association document on it, make it quite clear that the large holding set to conacre is to be excluded from the terms of the section, but the small farmer&mdash;the congest in Roscommon and elsewhere, with ten or 15 acres of land, who could not live on it economically, who has set it and is living in England pending the time he can return and resume occupation&mdash;is to be included. This section enables the Land Commission to acquire that man's holding, whereas the 200-acre holding set for conacre in County Longford is to be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not any 200-acre holdings in Longford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like Deputy Carter to get his mind clear. If they have not got any such holdings in Longford, such holdings are not too far away from his constituency.  It is not so many years since I raised questions here on a number of farms, including a chain of farms in County Longford which had been bought by the jodhpurred gentlemen.  We have now got the truth from the Deputy. Is it the Fianna Fáil view now, as expressed by Deputy Carter, that the ten-acre holder in the west, who through economic circumstances was forced to emigrate, must now return on the direction of Fianna Fáil and resume occupancy or get out?  Is that the purpose of the section?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Carter made a charge against me in reference to Roscommon.  He suggested that I knew farms sublet, with the owners in England.  Of course I do, but I also know the reason why.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to do that.  I merely endeavoured to point out the number of farmers who are leaving my constituency and the fact that they are doing so against their will.  They leave but they did not want to go.  They go because they have to. Now we have this segregation, this partition being imposed.  They are the people who are being got at in this section, not the farmers in Meath or Westmeath, or the occasional one in Longford about whom Deputy Carter does not seem to be aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will not have any difficulty, as far as the Labour Party are concerned, if he makes it clear that the section is to embrace the type of farmer Deputy Tully and I have been referring to.  I do not want to be repetitious.  I want the Minister to say whether or not it is correct that 200-acre holdings in the midlands <Col N="305" /> which are being let and used for conacre purposes are to be excluded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">

      <P>Deputy Carter will realise that the small farmer who depends on the production of pigs to a great extent is not in the same position in regard to subsidies as the rancher&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the small farmer, at present existing on the production of pigs because he cannot make a reasonable living otherwise on his ten-acre holding, who is being hit while the man subsidised for wheat growing on 200 acres is to be excluded.  Where is the genuine equality of treatment?  If it is there, I cannot see it, and I am surprised at Deputy Carter from Longford taking the view that there should be one law for the small, the weak, the uneconomic and another for the rich and the well to do.</P>
