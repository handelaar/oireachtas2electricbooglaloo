      <P>Section 6: In subsection (1) (a), lines 29 to 31, &ldquo;served notice of his intention to do so on the accused or the Attorney General, as the case may be,&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;notified the accused or the Attorney General, as the case may be, of the application,&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to amend section 6 and its object is to make it unnecessary to have notice of the intention to apply for a transfer of trial formally served on the Attorney General or on the accused, as the case may be, by the means prescribed in the Circuit Court Rules, that is to say, by personal service, or by delivery at the residence or place of business of the person concerned, or by sending the notice by prepaid post addressed to the person at his last-known residence or place of business.  It will be sufficient for the Attorney General or the accused, as the case may be, to be notified by any means of communication whatever.  Such informality is desirable from the point of view of the accused, who may be in custody and not legally represented.</P>

      <P>This is a simple amendment which has to do with the proving of services by registered post.

To allow time for the return of the envelope to the sender if undelivered, it is provided that the statutory declaration shall not be made until seven days at least after the posting of the envelope.  The Post Office authorities now advise us that in exceptional circumstances and particularly if the name and address of the sender does not appear on the envelope the return may take up to ten days.  The amendment proposed is necessary to cover this eventuality.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration. &mdash; (Deputy Cosgrave.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress last night, I was dealing with some of the remarks made by Deputy Tully.  He went on to say that prices had increased up to 15 per cent because of the turnover tax but he was careful not to substantiate any of those remarks.  It would be impossible for anybody, even the Minister, to meet such an unfounded accusation. Deputy Tully went to great extremes to insist that the 12 per cent national wage increase was not given by the Government.  Nobody will deny that the unions and the employers negotiated this 12 per cent increase but the climate and the background for it were set up by Government action and Government leadership.  We remember that the Taoiseach went so far as to say that increases of eight or nine per cent could be given by employers without any serious increases in prices. <Col N="178" /> The eventual agreement was an increase of 12 per cent.</P>
      <P>There have been increases in prices and Deputy Tully and the unions have been to some extent responsible, due to the claims they made.  Deputy Tully and other members of the Labour Party have been pressing the Minister to bring in price control and I have heard the Minister reply that price control is not the best method, that open competition is the best method. If one were to examine the practicability of price control, where would one begin?  Would one begin with the manufacturers, the distributors, the wholesalers or the retailers, with the efficient and well organised business or with the inefficient, badly-managed business?  If a choice were to be made between price control in a time of plenty and free competition, I would go for free competition all the time.</P>
      <P>There is always a case for price control in a period of shortage but there is never such a case in a period of plenty.  If the Minister were to consider any question of price control, the people who would be mainly represented at the conference table dealing with that matter would be the small producers and distributors.  If the Minister were to base his proposals on the standards of the more efficient sectors of industry, it would be tantamount to wiping out the small and less efficient trader and wholesaler.  I cannot see how any responsible person could hope to supplant free competition by price control.  There must always be included in a system of price control a guaranteed profit for everyone who handles the goods.  This would be far from desirable and should not be encouraged by anyone inside or outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave was anxious to have established a rational code of wage fixing.  He mentioned that some Scandinavian countries had developed such a system.  That is not news to us on this side of the House.  The Taoiseach has been hard at work at the idea of arranging a regular national adjustment of wages for every section of the community and he has gone quite a way in achieving this type of agreement.  The 12 per cent which <Col N="179" /> was agreed upon early this year has been fairly generally applied and I hope that with this coming together of employer and employee more progress will be made along these lines.  I wish good luck to all concerned in this work.</P>
    <P>Reverting to price control, Professor Busteed said at a recent union meeting in Cork that price control was impracticable and could not be operated.  If we go back to the debate on the turnover tax, we can remember that Deputy Dillon said that small shopkeepers were working on a gross profit of four per cent, but if any Minister told the small shopkeepers that, under a system of price control, they would have to work on a gross profit of four per cent, that would not be accepted. The more general average of 25 per cent would be demanded and expected. Price control would be impracticable and unworkable and would lead to increases rather than to decreases in prices.</P>
    <P>Industrial activity in 1963 was generally buoyant.  Production in the manufacturing field has shown an average increase of 6½ per cent and from the Minister's speech we learn that, taking the base 100 in 1953, it has moved up to 159.9.  That is a considerable improvement which deserves every encouragement from all sections of the community.  The increase in employment is shown at 3.4 per cent and this is not out of harmony with the Government's aim for the future. If that can be maintained, one can foresee a great uplift in the standard of living.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to note that there are some 167,000 people employed in manufacturing industry and that it is planned to increase this by a further 85,000 or 86,000 during the next five years.  This will take a considerable amount of work in the Minister's Department.  It will not happen just by chance nor has the work done to date happened by chance.  The Minister stated that last year in the field of industrial activity some 44 new industrial undertakings or expansions commenced business.  This is a commendable <Col N="180" /> effort.  It shows that the policy of the Government is the correct one, that their efforts are meeting with success in attracting new industries. The Minister goes on to say that the total investment in these undertakings is almost £9 million, with an estimated employment potential ranging from 2,100 at the initial stage to 6,300 at full production.</P>
    <P>One notes from these figures that it does not take an exorbitant sum of money, as is sometimes thought, to put one worker to work.  The probability is that it is something less than £2,000 per worker.  This is not always true, especially in the heavier industries. However, even with the figure of £2,000 per worker in regard to the lighter industries, it will require a tremendous amount of capital investment to achieve the Government's aim of something like 86,000 workers during the next five years.  An expanding capital investment is what is needed.</P>
    <P>It appears that 32 new factories are in course of construction.  When these are at full capacity, they will employ 8,600 workers.  We are also told that applications before the Industrial Development Authority number 55. The Industrial Development Authority deserve credit for their efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>Of the new industries set up during the year, 34 of them had foreign participation.  The encouraging thing is that quite a large percentage of these new industries are wholly Irish and that is the type of development I welcome.  I certainly welcome foreign industrialists who invest their capital here but the ideal arrangement is that the principals and the capital be Irish. It is not always possible to have this and we must encourage the foreign industrialist to come here.  He has years of experience of manufacturing but, more important than that, he has experience in marketing and in this respect he can often get off to a quicker start.  The range of industries is a very wide one.  The Minister lists clothing and textiles, plastics, porcelain, electronics, trout farming, fish processing, broiler hatching eggs, <Col N="181" /> diamond cutting and polishing, and so on.  He went on to say that promotion is being carried on in many countries, including the USA, Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Austria, Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands. One would like to see more and more coming from all these countries and one is pleased to hear that some of the American companies are moving in. During the year we had the opportunity of seeing one of their factories being opened in Sligo.</P>
    <P>Taking all the industrial activity under the Undeveloped Areas Acts and other legislation, we find there is a considerable sum of money committed to industrial investment.  I think it can be said the figure is close to £68 million.  A great deal of money is being expended to prepare industries for greater competition and steps are being taken to safeguard the high labour content of these industries.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister has recently taken steps to extend the capital of Irish Steel Holdings, Limited, at Haulbowline, Cork, to £6 million and to support in every way possible the development of that very worthwhile industry. Whatever the arguments against this project, I certainly think there are good economic arguments for retaining this steel industry and developing it.  The Minister and those associated with its management and direction deserve to be complimented.</P>
    <P>The Minister also gave approval to the establishment of the nitrogenous fertiliser factory at Arklow.  We are told the construction of this factory is making good progress and that even at its construction stage it is giving employment. More important still is the amount of employment that will be available, once it is in production. This is farsighted policy and one we shall come to appreciate in future years.  Our farmers are using more and more nitrogen every year and I believe the output of this factory will be fully utilised and that an expansion of production will be called for.</P>
    <P>As regards the experiments in the growing of grass on peatland which Min Fhéir Teoranta are carrying out at Geesala in west Mayo, I understand <Col N="182" /> the grass meal produced this year is of high value.  This experiment is well worthwhile.  We have plenty of bogs, some that are cutaway and some probably unsuitable for agriculture and an attempt to utilise each bogland and find out the best method of doing so is a valuable effort.  Min Fhéir Teoranta in carrying out experiments with all kinds of herbs and grasses and other plants deserve every encouragement. I think they are making progress in a worthwhile contribution to our knowledge of what can be done with our peatlands.</P>

      <P>The <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> sets a fairly high target, a volume increase of seven per cent in production each year and a 150 per cent increase in exports during the present decade.  To my mind, that is very courageous and I think it can be realised.  Sometimes I <Col N="183" /> have the opportunity of going abroad to trade fairs and I can see clearly potential markets for manufacturers who have the right article at the right price.  The number of our manufacturers who are able to compete in world markets is growing daily and I have no doubt this target will be achieved.  As it is so high I shall not say it can be improved but I am satisfied it can be achieved with the co-operation of all sections from the factory floor to the dockers.  It will require the co-operation of our people inside and outside this House.  We must not have sections deprecating industrial effort at any time.  It is sometimes the practice to deprecate the efforts or the programme of a Government simply so as not to give them credit for it but I ask all concerned in this effort to desist from that. There may be a fair case in politics for saying &ldquo;Anything you can do we can do better&rdquo;, but if the policy of saying: &ldquo;Everything you do is bad and everything we do is good&rdquo; is adopted, it will help nobody.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt in Europe as to what is happening in Ireland.  From the most recent edition of the OECD <i>Observer</i>, No. 10 of June, 1964, I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The five years 1959 to 1963 witnessed the fastest growth in 20th century Irish history.  An economy that had been growing at the rate of only one per cent a year suddenly began expanding at an average rate of more than four per cent.  At the same time unemployment fell and fewer people were forced to seek jobs abroad.  Even more important, there was a remarkable transformation of public attitudes towards growth.  Whereas in 1959 many people considered a two per cent growth rate too ambitious, to-day it would be difficult to persuade the public that the growth target for the next five years should be anything less than has been achieved during the last five.  Chief credit for this achievement is given by OECD's Development Review Committee to Ireland's First Programme <Col N="184" /> for Economic Expansion, launched in 1959.</P>
    <P>That tells its own story in a single paragraph and needs no remarks of mine to emphasise it.  It goes on to say that our first five year programme has succeeded.  Is there any reason we should doubt our ability to make the Second Programme a stupendous success?  I do not think so.  We should proceed with all haste, putting our shoulders to the wheel to secure our next target.</P>
    <P>The big increase of £21 million in our exports is very commendable and the Export Board, Córas Tráchtála, deserve to be congratulated on their efforts in this field.  Some short time ago they produced a very fine report full of information and worth studying by any Deputy or any member of the public.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to reflect for a moment on the need for a Government agency such as the Irish Export Board.  We all know our history and we know that whatever merchandising tradition we had before the Act of Union of 1800 was completely destroyed from then on.  Dublin had been a major port, shipping goods to all countries and had a class of people who were merchants and shippers.  All this went after 1800 and all our exports had to go through Liverpool and London.  The British economy boomed to an extraordinary degree while Ireland's economy was depressed and ports were abandoned.  Today if you go around the coast of Ireland, you will see installations and you will often wonder why they were put there.  But the pattern is changing again and one can see a return to activity and confidence among Irish manufacturers and merchants. We know what has been done in the past and what can be done and we can be confident we shall achieve our target and take our place with any other nation in the world.</P>
    <P>The Irish Export Board had to fill a great void and it has been doing it fairly well.  Their activities are fairly limited inasmuch as they explore markets abroad and notify Irish manufacturers and one wonders rather whether <Col N="185" /> more could not be done.  I believe more could be done.  Large firms have at their disposal the means to go abroad, explore markets and make their own arrangements.  The small manufacturer, however, who may have an article that could be exported, finds exporting quite a difficult business.  It involves customs forms, credit arrangements, insurance, shipping arrangements. These constitute quite a formidable task.  Being told he can sell somewhere, and being given some help at the moment by the Irish Export Board, generally he has himself to go out and find the market and try himself to find a footing in it.</P>
    <P>The idea has occurred to me on numerous occasions, and I cannot understand why it should not be translated into action, that merchants and agents who have experience in trading inwards and outwards, who know the set-up, as it were, and who know all the answers, should be encouraged into some large-scale merchanting organisation.  They could well go abroad, taking with them the products of Irish manufacturers, checking their saleability on the export market, checking the price that can be got for them, and then advising the home manufacturer that he can get a market for 50,000 or 100,000 of some particular article at a certain price.  If that were done our manufacturers could get down to the job they really should do, namely, manufacture in larger quantities on an assembly line in order to cut the cost of production.  That is one way.</P>
    <P>These agents or merchants could also bring home from their travels abroad items that could be manufactured here.  That would encourage manufacturers either to expand or to go into the production of new items which could be sold abroad.  They would have confidence in producing what they were seeking to sell if they could get a reasonable price abroad. The pattern to which I have referred is the tradition in most industrialised European countries.  There are well established merchanting services in all the major ports and the people who man these services find markets for the manufacturers in their respective <Col N="186" /> countries.  We are unfortunate in that we have not got that type of merchanting service here but there is no reason why it should not be established.</P>
    <P>We are all satisfied, I think, that by bringing labour and material together here we can manufacture as good an article as any other manufacturing country.  What is important, however, and what will give us the success we want, is markets abroad. It is not possible to over-emphasise the importance of marketing.  It is not sufficient just to leave the inexperienced manufacturer with the small plant or factory trying to grope his way through Europe to find a market. In most cases he is totally inexperienced in such a venture and, in many cases, he is actually frightened of going abroad.  The suggestion I make would solve the problem for all. The activities of Córas Tráchtála have been manifest.  We can see from the list of countries to which we are now sending manufactured goods that they cover a fairly wide territory.  We wish them well in their effort.  The Board is comprised of experienced manufacturers.  It would be a simple matter for the Minister to obtain their views as to whether or not they consider the recommendation I make worthwhile.  Everyone on the Board is a wellknown Irish exporter and would, I think, support me in this recommendation.</P>
    <P>The OECD Report underlines one very important matter, and that is the change in the attitude of the Irish people&mdash;the new wave of confidence that has been instilled into our own people, the faith in themselves that they can do it.  It is high time we had this changed attitude.  For years the policy was to sit back and let Irishmen and Irishwomen emigrate.  It was obvious to all what our countrymen were capable of abroad and some were frustrated in seeing that effort lost at home.  This lack of confidence showed a failure on the part of Irishmen in their ability to think and plan and work.  Thanks be to God, that day has gone and we can now look forward with confidence to the future.</P>
    <P>A small organisation known as the Irish Exporters' Association are doing <Col N="187" /> a very fine job in a course they run in conjunction with the Rathmines Vocational School.  They issue a diploma in exporting or the handling of materials for export to boys specially trained as clerks in this kind of work. That is a very commendable effort, indeed, and the Association deserves a word of praise.</P>
    <P>I also want to mention a very successful exhibition I visited some months ago.  It was put on by 12 Irish exporters.  The exhibition filled me with hope for Irish initiative and Irish effort.  It was put on by virtually a one-man-band, as it were, in conjunction with Córas Tráchtála.  He did the planning.  The results were phenomenal and the interest taken in the exhibition was commendable.  The display was excellent.  The goods were of the best quality.  All those participating in the venture were well satisfied with the results for the money expended.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the year 1970 could see a big jump in our industrial and other exports.  I trust we will all take whatever steps are necessary to bring this about.  From time to time here there is a good deal of talk about external relations <i>vis-à-vis</i> trade.  Only yesterday there was a great deal of commotion here as to whether or not we are going into the Common Market and it was argued we should state our case.  Whether or not we go into the Common Market will not materially alter our present position.  There is, however, one thing certain: the planning we do now, the markets we establish, the progress we make will make us better equipped for any subsequent event, be it full membership of the European Economic Community or remaining as we are.  I do not think we have any reason to panic or any need to state our case and say specifically what we are going to do.  I think we are quite right to sit this out.  The position is not changing radically.  If there is anything that might worry us, it is the other trading group.  Whether it will persist against the Common Market countries is anyone's guess.  It is my view, and my guess, that the European Common Market will become a reality sooner <Col N="188" /> or later.  For that reason, any planning we do now will prepare us to play our part in it, if and when we get into it.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints about reductions in tariffs.  I hear more complaints here than I see in the newspapers, or hear from manufacturers. There have been two decreases, one in 1963, one in 1964, and the third will be in 1965.  In the aggregate, that is somewhere around a 30 per cent reduction, and despite that we are making steady progress.  If the taking away of the blankets is the cause of increased activity by Irish manufacturers, that is a good thing.  No one, including myself, will make an effort, if we get things too easy.  If we face up to it, Irish industrialists can meet the challenge of competition from anyone.  I look forward to the day when tariff barriers between countries will disappear.  Irish men and Irish manufacturers will be able to take their place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Indeed, I look forward to those conditions.  I look forward to a rising standard of living for workers, and I hope that, when they retire from employment, they will be safe and secure, and have reasonable pensions having regard to their income at retiring age.  Those things are all possible and, if we want them, we can achieve them, but we must work for them.  Activity outside the underdeveloped areas seems to be pepping up, and I should like to see greater activity within the underdeveloped areas in the West.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt about that, and I want to ask the Minister for his full co-operation. There is a peculiar problem in the west of Ireland.  In that part of the country, there are small farmers and poor farmers and, as the years go by, fewer and fewer people will be employed on those farms.  It has a high birth rate, but the people will be moving out looking for jobs.  The people in the west of Ireland have always been very intelligent and very adaptable.  I know from experience that they are very easy to train.  They acquire skills and crafts and absorb knowledge relatively easily.  The Government should consider this problem to a greater extent.</P>
      <P>The grants given by the Industrial Development Authority and Córas Tráchtála are something like two-thirds of the cost of building and machinery installation.  The day is now here when this problem must be considered, and to create momentum in the west greater financial assistance must be given.  Indeed, I would go so far as to ask for some State participation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should not say too much about that.  The selection of special industrial areas is vital in the west.  I should like to see an industrial centre in Sligo, and radiating 40 miles from it.  I ask the Government to examine plans in that regard because I am satisfied it can be done.  The basis is there, and the engineering industries are there.  We have reasonable industries at the moment but I should like to see <Col N="190" /> more in Ballymote, Dromahair, Manorhamilton, Drumkeerin, Enniscrone, Easkey and Ballaghy.  I should like to see an industrial centre in those areas radiating from Sligo, the capital of the north-west.  Supply industries could be sited in those towns.  That area is ideally suited for the light engineering industry.  I am confident that the industries already there will develop in the years to come but it must be done faster.  I should like to see 10,000 jobs created in the Sligo region&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What is good in one area would also be good in other areas. The industrial centre in Shannon is proving a success, and I am satisfied that what can be done in Shannon can equally be done in Sligo and around it.  This is not original thinking on my part: it has been recommended to the Government on other occasions.</P>
      <P>Small industries in Sligo and Tubbercurry at the moment are making great strides.  All of them are exporting as well as meeting home market needs. For the information of Deputies, there is in Tubbercurry a very modern industry where the most up-to-date needs of industry can be met.  It is a precision engineering factory for the manufacture of tools, and the boys there are the best trained in this or any country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From earlier speeches, one is inclined to get the impression that Foras Tionscal welcome nobody but foreigners.  Of course, that is totally untrue.  I was sorry to hear Deputy Tully speak of the poor reception given by Foras Tionscal to small industries manufacturing hurleys and such products. It is difficult to cater for every one of numerous small industries.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Tully mention an enterprise in Cork.  It was <Col N="191" /> a worthwhile undertaking which ran into difficulties and I deplore its being mentioned in the House.  It is a wellknown fact that factory premises are never wasted and accordingly capital put into their construction is not wasted.  Even if they are vacant for a time, the buildings and the machinery always find a place in the economic pattern.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to notice during the year the increasing confidence in Irish industrial effort.  The ESB sought money and had no difficulty getting it; Bord na Móna wanted £2 million and had no difficulty in getting it.  The position a few years ago was that when this body needed money another firm had to subscribe it.  Demand for Irish equities is tremendous, showing the desired confidence in the Irish economy.  This is a welcome change. It is above all a vote of confidence in the Government.</P>
    <P>The staff of the Department, senior and junior, deserve the greatest praise. I have always found them to be an outward thinking body of officials. They are tremendously painstaking and they have the utmost patience.  Of course they have had a long tradition of good leadership from progressive Ministers, beginning in 1932 with the present Taoiseach.  As well as being excellently served by civil servants, this Department also have the advantage of an excellent service from the agencies associated with them.  Nobody thanks a civil servant for doing a job, but let him make a mistake and he is booted out.  Consequently, he must be careful and I suggest it is up to those who must approach officials in this Department to have their schemes well prepared.  If they have, they will get wonderful assistance from officials in the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister deserves a special word of congratulation.  He has displayed courage and decision.  He has backed the development of State industry when others would have shut it down. The nitrogenous fertiliser factory is an instance of this.  Others would have doubted its value.  We know the risks he takes and we compliment him all <Col N="192" /> the more on his courage and confidence. He is the type of leader we need and I hope he will be with us for a long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If I do not distribute as many bouquets as Deputy Gallagher did, it is because I do not view the scene with such rose-tinted spectacles as he does.  The picture we must take from the Minister's statement yesterday embraces some salient factors, one of them being that we are adding to employment in this country at a capital cost of roughly £2,000 per job.  I stress this now because I wish to deal with it later.</P>
      <P>We hope to add 85,000 jobs to our working roll before 1970.  I hope our present industrial employment does not diminish in the meantime and so reduce the net addition the Minister calculates.  I am sure it is a hope shared by Deputy Gallagher and by each Deputy who spoke.  There is, however, another side to the coin.  It is that we shall lose between 40,000 and 60,000 agricultural workers in the same period.  Even if agricultural output increases, the pattern of decline in agricultural use of labour would dictate that fact to us.</P>
      <P>If the Minister, the Government and the House succeed in adding 85,000 jobs in the industrial sector, the net gain will therefore be 35,000 by 1970. Our normal population increase, taking the figure of 25,000 per year, should add 150,000 to our population in that time and that would mean that we would have, if there were no emigration, 115,000 idle hands.  If all of our normal population increase emigrate, we would then have 35,000 new jobs. Since 1957, we have lost twice that number of jobs in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two years ago the Minister's brief was devoted very fully to our confident application for membership of EEC. We all felt then that by 1964 we would probably be very good Europeans.  We are not.  Our hopes have receded.  We sit outside the European Community with our friends, the British.  We are wondering still why we were rejected, despite our protestations of solidarity with Europe.  The truth is that the British <i>bona fides</i> were probably <Col N="193" /> suspect, and not ours.  But we are so completely associated with them that we, willy nilly, must go where they go.  I do not believe we are going to go it alone; despite what the Taoiseach said yesterday, we are not that mad. Where the British go, we will go.  I think Deputy Gallagher shared my doubt in this matter.</P>
    <P>The surveys made of our industrial sectors to probe our ability to survive in the conditions we would encounter in the Common Market gave us hope rather than certainty that we would be equal to the job.  Perhaps it is a good thing that the blast of competition we would have to face has been postponed or, maybe, put off for ever. But we have not completely postponed it.  I think we have opened the windows of competition a bit too wide.  We are proceeding now as if membership of EEC were certain tomorrow. We are dismantling our tariff walls.  Every year we have taken bricks off them.  Last year I said to the Minister that he was enacting the part of Hamlet without the ghost.  The ghost was the threat in the mind of every factory manager and owner about the continual reduction in our tariffs and the increase of import quotas.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made very slight reference to that this year; yet it is one of the most important things the House should consider.  Time sees some curious changes and some strange bedfellows.  The Fianna Fáil Party were the Party of high protection in this country.  There is one part of the Minister's speech at which I scratch my head.  It says:</P>
    <P>Irish industry has sometimes been regarded in the past as a form of economic development capable of existing under conditions of protection and concerned solely with meeting the requirements of the domestic market.  Whatever may be the validity of this viewpoint (and I am not to be taken as subscribing to it) it is plain that a transformation has taken place in the attitude of industry itself in relation to competitive marketing.  It has now been established, that, over a large range of products, Irish industry is capable <Col N="194" /> of meeting keen competition in external markets and of overcoming that competition, notwithstanding the existence of external trade barriers which have to be surmounted.</P>
    <P>That is an interesting thesis, but I am doubtful whether it is true.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that I think we are proceding too fast in this regard.  I referred to the curious pattern of change we observe in the role of the political Parties.  Fianna Fáil were originally the Party of high protection. We find ourselves now pleading with the Minister that he is moving too fast in the direction of free trade.  Indeed, in regard to other Departments, the same kind of change can be observed. Ministers in my Party 30 years ago were referred to as &ldquo;Ministers for Grass.&rdquo;  Now the most important and most highly praised activity by the Government is good grassland farming and livestock rearing and export. Wheat is a weakening policy.  The lesson of it all is that we should be moderate and should make haste to change slowly.  I am satisfied we are dismantling our tariff machinery too rapidly.  We are asking far too much of industry in this.  As agriculture declines in its employment giving power, we are asking industry to create jobs and to absorb the growth in the population. But we are placing too many difficulties in the way.</P>
    <P>The truth is that we have featherbedded industry in this country.  Now we are asking them to sleep on the floor.  Our industries grew up under a tariff wall.  Now we are hacking it down.  We are increasing quotas where tariffs did not apply.  My fear is that the wrong kind of countries will benefit from this&mdash;the dumpers, who will not buy from us.  But they will be in very rapidly over this lower tariff wall to sell to us.  Two cardinal facts seem to emerge from this.  One is that, if you reduce tariffs, imports must grow.  The second is that, if you liberalise quotas, imports must grow.  If imports grow, then, amongst other things, balance of payments problems grow.  The net result must be that every increased quota unit must displace an Irish unit and an Irish worker.</P>
    <P>I want to know what countries we <Col N="195" /> deal with have returned this compliment, and where are our goods going now that they did not go before as a result of these tax concessions to foreign producers.  Did any exporters tell us of the results of this liberalising policy bringing a favourable reaction to us?  Is it easier for us to export because of this liberalisation?  Did any exporters or producers tell us that the home market was being nibbled at by those who came in over these lower tariff walls?</P>
    <P>We heard the last speaker saying that the day is rapidly coming when we will abolish our tariff walls altogether. This is 1964, not 1864.  Cobden and Bright are long since dead.  We are celebrating this year the four hundredth anniversary of Shakespeare's death and I think we should remember the policy adopted by the Merchant of Venice.  We should take our pound of flesh for any concession we give.  I do not want the Minister or the Government to listen to what industrial directors or managers say, or even what trade unionists say.  The fact is if we dismantle our tariff structure, we will increase the flood of imports.</P>
    <P>I want to know what is the urgency about our entry into the EEC?  There is a mystic date, 1970, printed on all our foreheads.  What are the chances of our being in the EEC by 1970? What are the British chances of being in by 1970?  If there is a change of Government in Great Britain, will the Labour Ministers be of the same opinion as their Tory predecessors? Will they tend to have a look at the hard-working European who works long hours and is less well paid than his British counterpart?  Will they say: &ldquo;That is not a gain for us and we will stay where we are?&rdquo; If the British decide not to go in or if they feel the note of urgency is not there, are we not going to go with them?  I think we should have these questions answered.  We should say, if the British are not going in, we will not go in, or, if we are to go in alone, we should tell the people what it is going to cost.</P>
    <P>Monsieur Couve de Murville certainly <Col N="196" /> thinks we should not go in alone because of our close economic ties with the British.  We have been getting away for many years, with vague generalisations about many things.  These generalisations are moving out of the political field into the economic field but you cannot just generalise about an important thing such as this.  If we are to enter EEC by 1970, we are dismantling our tariff structure too soon. This is an unsound and dangerous policy and will injure us in the future. Many of us have these doubts.  I think the Minister and the Taoiseach have them.  Now is the time for the Government to convey these doubts very clearly to us as well as to the people.</P>
    <P>If we are to enter the EEC, what have we got to barter with to secure that entry?  If we go on the way we are going, we will have no tariff wall at all by 1970.  We have to sell something. We have to protect the great investment the Irish people have already made in the industries of our country.  How are our woollen manufacturers to compete?  If they have to prepare to meet this blast of competition we are told will exist when we get into the EEC, they need equipment to meet the financial strain to withstand that blast.  Why should we divest ourselves of all tariffs in unnecessary competition with imported goods?</P>
    <P>We have been 30 years making a very considerable investment in Irish industries. It has been a great burden on the Irish people.  They have reluctantly agreed to have high tariff walls erected and they have paid high prices for goods so that these industries would build themselves into a fairly strong and enduring position.  Now, we propose to take down these tariff walls virtually overnight.  I should think, without stressing any recent political development, that a great deal more progress needs to be made.</P>
    <P>Due to the policy of protection followed since 1932, the industries we developed in this country were pampered rather than virile.  Now, the Government, with all the fervour of a convert, are proceeding to embrace <Col N="197" /> free trade overnight.  It reminds me of the Finnish sauna treatment in which you immerse yourself in a steam bath, are sweated profusely and then taken out and frozen in snow.  Virile industries would probably prosper from that treatment but many others would get pneumonia.  We expect too much from our industries and I do not think they are strong enough for this rapid liberalisation of trade.  Some of our industries are strong and well conducted but others are not so well conducted.</P>
    <P>Some industries have developed markets and they have taken any help they got from the Government and the people.  They have done the best they can.  Good planning would give that kind of enthusiasm that is given in tax remission reward to those who can do the best with their industries.  Good planning would also ensure that the shaky industries were not exposed too rapidly to the blast of competition.  The Government are ruthlessly deciding to cut tariff walls on industries before they are ready for the blast of competition.</P>
    <P>If we continue at the present rate, we will do an injury to many of our industries.  The Minister said it works out roughly at £200 per head for every one disemployed in industry in this country.  The Irish people have always contributed over the years to keeping our industries going.  If we have many people disemployed in industry by reason of cutting the tariff wall, we are doing a grave injury to everybody.</P>
    <P>As I said before, these industries were sustained over the years by a grumbling Irish populace.  They felt they were paying a high price for protecting them.  We should make sure now that that investment participated in over the years is protected by an intelligent and rational approach to these industries.  It just does not make sense.  Lack of moderation never makes sense.  We have had years of success with restriction and in excessive liberalisation moderation is essential.  In this matter it is an elementary precaution. It is the wish of all those who direct and work in industry that we <Col N="198" /> should make haste very slowly in this matter and, above all, if we propose dealing with external organisations in future, that at this stage we should not discard our bargaining weapons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the optimistic tone of the Minister's speech, I believe the Government are far too complacent about what is being achieved, far too complacent when one remembers that, in the favourable month of June of this year, we still have about 50,000 persons unemployed and emigration is running at the rate of about 25,000 persons per year.</P>
      <P>I was rather attracted to some of the comments made by Deputy Gallagher.  He, not being as complacent as the Minister, suggested that where private enterprise could not establish industry, the Government should take a hand.  I welcome the belated conversion of Deputy Gallagher and, indeed, the belated conversion of many other people in this House who have only recently begun to believe and to say that the State has a responsibility for the establishment of industry and for the provision of employment.</P>
      <P>I believe private enterprise has a very important purpose to serve in the matter of the promotion of economic activity but I do not believe, as many people in the country seem to believe, that our economy should be entirely dependent on private enterprise.  I do not believe that, despite what people may say to the contrary, has been the fact in this country because we have seen State investment and State enterprise do a tremendous amount of work in the promotion of the economy and, incidentally, and very important, providing very many thousands of jobs for Irish men and women.  Neither do I believe that we should be as dependent as we appear to be or be as complacent as we appear to be as to the role of foreign investment in this country.  I believe that a combination of the private enterprise of Irishmen and the public enterprise of an Irish Government could do much more than is being done in the promotion of industry and in the provision of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason it is encouraging to <Col N="199" /> hear a Deputy like Deputy Gallagher saying that the State should take a hand in the establishment of industry, if not necessarily by itself, by cooperation with private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is right that a Minister for Industry and Commerce in this country, in a 30 page speech, should devote only three lines to the question of industrial employment, as if this were the whole picture.  All the Minister says on page 7 of his speech is that the average number of workers engaged in manufacturing industry rose to an estimated 167,000 in 1963&mdash; an increase of 5,500 or 3.4 per cent over 1962.  That is the end as far as the Minister is concerned on the question of industrial employment.</P>
    <P>Everybody applauds those figures. Everybody applauds the fact that there has been an increase in industrial employment but it is not the full picture; it is not the problem for which the Minister and the members of the Government have responsibility.  The people have now come to accept it as a fact that many thousands will go from employment, or one might say, unemployment, in the rural areas and drift to the cities, the big towns, the small towns and the provincial towns to seek employment.  According to statistics, there are many thousands of such persons seeking employment. Nobody suggests that they will secure employment on the land.  Everybody accepts that if they are to be employed it must be in industry.  While an increase of 5,500 in industrial employment may appear to be spectacular it does not do anything substantial to reduce the figure of 50,000 unemployed or to diminish the emigration figure of 25,000 per year.</P>
    <P>The State has been successful in its intervention and its interest in the promotion of industrial projects in this country.  There is no necessity for me to list them here now.  It may be that engagement in projects such as Bord na Móna, the ESB, Irish Shipping, Aer Lingus, and such projects, mainly services, has been exhausted but the State could do much more than it is doing in the matter of the establishment <Col N="200" /> of industries.  The State is generous&mdash;let us all acknowledge it&mdash;in the amount of assistance it gives to persons, whether foreigners or otherwise, who want to establish industries but that is not enough.  That sort of financial incentive is good in itself but if people do not avail of it for the purpose of establishing industries then the State has a moral responsibility to do the job.</P>
    <P>Deputy A. Barry made a very sensible comment on the practice that the Government are now engaging in of stripping industry of the tariff protection that has accumulated over a period of approximately 30 years.  I do not think any of us in the Opposition can be quite satisfied with the latest pronouncements, or announcements, by the Taoiseach and by the Government Information Bureau on our relationship with the EEC or what is commonly known as the Common Market.  Without being offensive to the Taoiseach, I would say that he was most evasive yesterday in his replies, so evasive that he tried to distinguish between an associated member and association, knowing full well what was in the mind of his questioners and knowing full well what they meant by &ldquo;association&rdquo;.  These replies were designed merely to obscure what is already a very obscure subject in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I must confess I got this speech this morning.  The only opportunity I had of reading what the Minister said was the abbreviated reports in the morning newspapers but even after a quick glance over this copy of the Minister's speech, in a matter of minutes, I think it would be true to say&mdash;let anybody who likes correct me&mdash;that the Common Market is not mentioned once. This is a remarkable change inasmuch as two and three years ago reference to every subject that arose in this House&mdash;industry, agriculture, education, Posts and Telegraphs or the Gaeltacht&mdash;was tempered with some reference to the Common Market and what our position would be in industry, agriculture, education, television and radio when we joined the Common Market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="201" /> The Government will have to be a little more specific in their statements with regard to our future <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC.  Everyone of us would agree that whether or not we will go into the Common Market, there will come in time an era of, if not absolute free trade, freer trade than has been experienced in this country over the last 30 years.  Deputy Barry is absolutely right in repeating what members of the Labour Party have said over the past two or three years, that this stiff exercise of dismantling protection in a short period will not be sufficient if we are to maintain employment or, shall I say, if we are to improve employment. I think he described the situation very well.  I do not think it is good enough to say to Irish industry: &ldquo;You who have been protected for a period of over 30 years must now strip yourselves of that protection in four, five or six years.&rdquo;  Everything in this country now seems to be pointed towards a year that is called 1970. What is sacred about 1970, unless we have something specific, or some form of assurance, from the Government that we are, or are not, going into the EEC by 1970?</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Taoiseach was most evasive when asked by various people on this side of the House whether or not we were going on alone as far as our application for membership of the EEC was concerned.  He did not say specifically that our application is dependent on what happens to the application of Great Britain, or whether or not under a Labour or Tory Government, Britain will pursue their application for membership of the EEC.  He knows that is the case.  I think he should say that in as many words, and not have to be questioned five or six times in order to get that sort of information out of him.</P>
    <P>I think the fears of Deputy Barry as far as dumping is concerned are very real indeed.  It may be now, because we have only had two years of tariff reduction, each of ten per cent, that the full effects are not being felt but the workers particularly and industry are very fearful of the next round, if there will be a next round. <Col N="202" /> It was consoling to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce say yesterday that after the next reduction of ten per cent, on 1st January next, there would be a review.  There certainly should be a review.  There certainly should be review and consultation with industry and the trade union movement as to what damage may be caused if there are further reductions in respect of several industries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry mentioned the clothing industry, and I think there are real fears for it, if the various reduction exercises are to be engaged in from now until 1970.  There certainly are real fears for the boot and shoe industry as well.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce recently received deputations from the boot and shoe industry and the trade unions engaged in that industry.  I think they gave him good reasons as to why this exercise of quick tariff stripping should be suspended for a while in order to allow these industries to prepare themselves for free trade.  It is only three years or less, perhaps two years, since one of the CIO sub-committees made a survey of the boot and shoe industry.  They made certain recommendations and expressed fears as to what would happen the industry if certain things were not done and if these recommendations were not adopted by the industry.</P>
    <P>As far as I can gather, and I think the Minister has corroborated this, the boot and shoe industry has expressed its willingness, and shown evidence of it, to carry out certain changes, to readapt and equip itself for free trade, but it does not believe this can be done within the limited period.  I do not think it unreasonable for either the boot and shoe industry, the clothing industry, or any other industry, to say to the Minister:&mdash;&ldquo;Stop for a while; give us time to carry out the recommendations made by the Committee on Industrial Organisation, and when we have done that, then it will be time enough to think in terms of taking away the tariff or quota protection which we have had for so many years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have questioned the Minister <Col N="203" /> several times here on prices.  He referred to prices on page 19 of his speech, again disdainfully discarding the idea that there should be price control.  He got some sort of agreement from the speaker of the Fine Gael Party after him.  The Minister must show a little more concern about the question of prices.  During the past few weeks, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions expressed their concern to the Minister.  Two weeks ago, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in a letter to the Minister said that if there were not proper control of prices, the trade union movement could not see how the recent wages agreement could obtain for two years.</P>
    <P>Everybody welcomed, and the Minister particularly welcomed, the wages agreement negotiated in January of last year and the agreements preceding it between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Employer's association. This was something new.  It was a national wage agreement.  It was a wage agreement that applied to all those who were members of trade union, and it was to obtain for a period.  The trade union movement played their part in that.  The employers' association did their part. This was reached on the basis of there being stability in the country.  There was to be stability in wages and stability as far as industrial relations were concerned for a period of two years.  Was it unreasonable, and is it unreasonable, for the trade union movement to expect that there will be some attempt at stability in prices?</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a list of price increases which he said he had investigated. These may be important in themselves.  Some of them are very important but there are very many commodities which are of particular importance to the housewife, which are essential to her, and which were never investigated.  I wonder what function the Prices Act of 1958 is supposed to fulfil at all.  The Minister talks about invoking the powers given to him under that Act in an emergency.  Does the emergency of which he speaks mean only war, or does it mean scarcity?  Is that why we introduced <Col N="204" /> and passed the Prices Act of 1958?  I think it must be agreed, and the Minister has conceded it, that from evidence of the past 18 months there has been a virtual emergency as far as prices are concerned.  The Government have to take responsibility for this.</P>
    <P>Let us not argue taxation.  The Government have to take responsibility for the upset they caused in prices on the introduction of the turnover tax in the Budget of 1963.  The workers decided they would have to be compensated. Despite the foolish things the Taoiseach said last year, the stupid White Paper that was issued, <i>Closing the Gap</i>, and the green light signal he pretended to give in November, 1963, the trade unions decided that, no matter what the Taoiseach said, no matter what White Papers were issued, they would get compensation for the increase in the cost of living and the increase in production.  The Taoiseach, members of the Government, members of the Fianna Fáil Party, subsequently tried to take credit for the 12 per cent increase the trade unions had negotiated. We shall arrive at a very dangerous stage when the Government attempt to fix wages.  Let me repeat what I said on the Vote on Account, that no credit is due to the Taoiseach or to the Fianna Fáil Government for the 12 per cent wage increase.  If the Taoiseach had had his way&mdash;I assume he speaks for the Government&mdash;that increase would have been a mere eight per cent.</P>
    <P>In any case a wage agreement was negotiated.  In my opinion, there has not been any real attempt to control prices.  The Minister talks about investigations he carried out around the country and says there is no real evidence of price fixing.  I suppose he is right in saying that, inasmuch as there were no formal meetings.  There was no conspiracy, as such, between traders, distributors, and so on.  But, for years and years, there has been a tacit understanding between the distributors, traders and sellers about price.</P>
    <P>It is no consolation to the public when the Minister says that the responsible section in his Department investigated <Col N="205" /> the proposed increase in the price of any commodity.  Not alone must justice be done but it must be seen to be done.  Investigations into proposals for price increases, especially for essential commodities, should be held in public.</P>
    <P>A worker seeking an increase in wages must go to the Labour Court and prove his case in public.  His submission to the court is reported in the newspapers.  He has to give the reasons for his getting an increase.  In the same way, the public should be convinced as a result of a public hearing that increased prices for essential commodities, especially foodstuffs, are justified.</P>
    <P>The Minister carried out an investigation into the proposal to increase the price of sugar.  He discovered and announced to this House that the proposed increase was too much.  If a reputable State body which I admire and which I regard as progressive propose an increase in the price of sugar which the Minister's Department finds to be unjustified and if errors can be made in respect of the price of a commodity produced by a State company, how much more frequently can a proposed increase in price by other manufacturers and other industries be in error?</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to say that competition will ensure that prices will find their level and that the public will get the best part of the bargain. Even if there are no formal meetings to decide these things, there are understandings between the people concerned to ensure that there will be a fixed price.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that a reduction in tariffs would mean a reduction in the prices of certain commodities.  On 1st January last year, we had a ten per cent reduction and on 1st January this year, we had a further ten per cent reduction in respect of nearly all imported commodities but there has been no visible reduction in prices.  We were told that one of the attractions of membership of the EEC is that imported goods will be cheaper.  As yet, there has been no evidence, despite two tariff reductions of ten per cent each, that the price of the commodities <Col N="206" /> concerned, especially imported clothing, has decreased.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the expansion of industrial exports.  I often get the impression that only a minority of Irish firms export and that many of our firms do not even try to export.  I suppose they have got into the bad habit, by reason of feather-bedding over a period of 30 years, of confining their activities to the home market.  Córas Tráchtála may have its faults but it has done quite a lot to encourage exports and for that it ought to be congratulated.</P>
    <P>Those who participated in investigations by the Committee on Industrial Organisation will know that many firms have almost to be kicked into trying to develop an export trade. Apart from the efforts of Córas Tráchtála, Irish industry itself should do somewhat more to encourage Irish firms to export.  As Deputy Gallagher said, the Irish Exporters Association has done an amount to encourage exports.  In addition to the efforts of Córas Tráchtála, Irish industry itself could profitably invest money in market research and in inducing many more Irish firms to export.</P>
    <P>I said I was attracted by the belated conversion of Deputy Gallagher in advocating greater State participation in the establishment of industry and, better still, in participation by the State in private enterprise.  The Deputy also mentioned what the Committee on Industrial Organisation advocated in one of their reports, the establishment of industrial regions.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has commented on many of the Committee's recommendations on re-adaptation and re-equipment for entry into the Common Market but I do not think that either he or the Government made any comment on the recommendation in regard to the establishment of industrial regions.</P>
    <P>We should not be entirely dependent on foreign investment for the establishment of industry.  The Irish Government should be prepared to participate more than it has up to the present.  The financial incentive is not sufficient.  I do not know whether this <Col N="207" /> is a deliberate phrase of the Minister's or not but it is a phrase which recurs year after year in his introductory speech: &ldquo;X firms came to my notice as having been established during the year.&rdquo;  I do not know what that means.  Does the Department of Industry and Commerce know the number of new industries established? &ldquo;Came to my notice&rdquo; is a pretty weak phrase.  One wonders if the Minister is absolutely conversant with all the industrial activity, the establishment of industry and the enlargement of industry throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I do not know if other Deputies have noticed as I have the reluctance of those who inquire about the establishing of an industry to build a factory.  I wonder is there any significance in that.  I know of one case in which inquiries were made by people who came from abroad and who wanted to establish an industry but who were not keen on building a factory, who merely wanted to rent a factory.  I wonder are many of these people just carrying out experiments to see what way the ball is going to hop.  I suppose it does not make much difference to the locality in which the industry is to be established whether they want to rent or build a factory, but that is one of the reasons why the Labour Party have always advocated greater participation by the State in the establishment of industry.  If there is to be control mainly by those who come from abroad, there is always the danger that at a certain time in the future some of them, or all of them, may decide to get out.  That may appear to be a very pessimistic view but the person with the stake in the country or in an industry is certain to remain.  Those who come from abroad and who have no obligations whatever to the country may in time decide to get out.</P>
    <P>Finally, I think that the Minister should not appear, as he appears in his speech at least, to be so complacent about employment, not in industry especially but in the country as a whole.  I also believe that if the trade union movement is to play its part in providing stability in the economy the Minister will have to give a firmer <Col N="208" /> assurance that there will be some attempt to control prices so that the increase won by the trade unions will not be eaten into during the two years during which the agreement is to obtain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say one or two words on this Estimate because I think that people are losing sight of the fundamentals.  Inflation is the prince of thieves; it robs the poor and it enriches the speculator.  I conceive it to be the primary duty of every democratic Parliament in the world to protect the defenceless sections of its community against the evils of inflation. What are they?  The first characteristic of inflation is a rising cost of living.  Now this Government protested when they introduced the turnover tax that the cost of living would increase by 2½ per cent and no more.  We told them that if this tax were introduced it would have repercussions all through the economy and result in a very marked increase in the cost of living.  Since this time 12 months ago the cost of living went up by 12 points.  It went up to 171 points, at mid-May of this year, compared with 159 points at mid-May, 1963 and the cost of living is continuing to rise.</P>
      <P>Those who are organised in trade unions and so forth have managed to get some compensation for the increased cost of living but there is a wide section of the community who are now on that endless escalator trying to chase the cost of living with their income and discovering that they are not able to do so and so having thrust upon them a lower standard of living. It is these elements in our community who have no organisation to speak for them who suffer the impact of this burden.  They are the self-employed farmers working the family farms, the people living on pensions, on fixed incomes of one kind or another; they are the unorganised workers who have not benefited as fully as the organised workers have in increased wages and working conditions, and they are the wide section of the community who fall within no broad category but whose problems arise at every turn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give the House an instance of the kind of problem that inflation <Col N="209" /> involves for the young married couple. I know of a case&mdash;and I believe there are many such&mdash;of a young married man or a young man contemplating matrimony, who arranged to buy his house and budgeted for the house and for the furniture he would put into it and calculated that he would be able to meet the charges on them from his wages.  The wedding day was fixed and then he was informed by the building contractor who was to build the house:</P>
    <P>With reference to your booking fee paid on Site 219.  We now inform you that owing to the rise in prices of materials and labour, stemming all round from the 12 per cent rise in wages, the price for this house is now £2,715 nett.</P>
    <P>The original price was £2,460.  The letter continued:</P>
    <P>This is a fixed price, not subject to increase on signing of contract, or on your written confirmation of acceptance of this offer.</P>
    <P>We regret that we have not been able to inform you of this increase before, but we have been unable to stabilise a price because of the continuous rise in materials.</P>
    <P>We would be glad to have, before June 16th, your confirmation that you intend to complete the purchase.</P>
    <P>We would confirm that there will be no further rise in price of this house to you.</P>
    <P>He was also informed that if he wanted a garage, for which there was to have been a charge of £180, it would now cost him £220.  The man who contemplated purchasing that house simply cannot buy it.  He could not get the house out of his wages and he has had to give up the idea and look for alternative accommodation for himself and his wife.  These things are going on all around but we close our eyes and pretend they are not happening.  They are happening and they are creating hardships.  They are the direct and inevitable consequence of the decision of the Government to raise their revenue by taxation on the essential food, fuel, and clothing of <Col N="210" /> our people.  It is dishonest to ignore that fact and in my submission it is catastrophic to the long term interests of the country.</P>
    <P>I recognise that &ldquo;inflation&rdquo; is a word too easily employed without any precise definition of its meaning. Mark you, it would be a very useful thing, both in Oireachtas Éireann and elsewhere, if this whole question and the true meaning of inflation were more precisely defined.  I suggest to the House that if you want to determine whether a community is in a state of inflation, you have two criteria.  One is the cost of living and the other the balance of trade.  If you find, in an open economy such as ours that these two are moving up at the same time, you ought to look out for storms.  Our adverse trade balance in the year ending April of this year was £118 million and the adverse balance of payments was from £20 million to £25 million which is large enough.  It would be twice that but for the movement of foreign capital into this country and we ought to turn our minds most deliberately to the question of foreign capital coming in here.</P>
    <P>The influx of foreign capital is a good thing for the development of industry and the promotion of exports so long as it is based on the provision of decent employment for our workers, the production of exports and the financing of the interest charges on capital investment.  That is good for our economy and for the country but I want to ask Deputies this question: is it desirable, when you are running a large adverse trade balance, to finance a substantial part of the adverse balance of payments by selling out old established businesses and the land on which the people have lived for generations? There is a fundamental difference between capital investment for the establishment of new industries and for the promotion of exports and capital investment by way of take-over.</P>
    <P>Capital investment which increases exports of existing manufacturers or produces new exports is good but suppose you have an industry operated by our own people, the profits of which have circulated in our own community and the dividends of <Col N="211" /> which have been garnered by shareholders in Ireland, an industry owned by our own people and carried on by them for generations.  Is it desirable to see an anonymous foreign financial enterprise take over that industry and, without any addition to the total output, simply collect the dividends?  I do not think it is and it is a trend that we ought to watch with acute care.</P>
    <P>So great a country as Canada has reacted most violently against that trend. United States investment in Canada has reached such a scale that Canada finds it difficult to extricate herself. This has created bitter resentment at the extent to which the economy of Canada has come under the control of America.  France also has reacted most emphatically against the take-over.  In all countries you will find the distinction made between the investment which creates new industry and new exports and the kind of investment which means the take-over of existing industries and, in our case, the take-over of our land.</P>
    <P>There are grave economic and social implications in this problem and it is one to which I advise the Government to turn their minds.  In my judgment, investment of the take-over character is of an extremely dangerous order and we should watch with great care such investment in our industry except in exceptional cases.  There are exceptional cases in which the take-over procedure can be a benefit.  If you have an industry producing a commodity for export and that industry finds itself cut off by the operation of foreign <i>cartels</i> from its export markets, the only solution is to establish a contact with the particular <i>cartel</i> and through it to get access to the markets.  Rather than see that industry closed down, it is better to make peace with the <i>cartel</i> and to get access to the markets of the <i>cartel</i>.  This means that one must be prepared to face a realistic world and a realistic world is not a pretty world.  There is no use in cutting off one's nose to spite one's face and in those circumstances the take-over procedure must be tolerated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> Where a take-over is founded on no better basis than that an enormous foreign financial trust sees an opportunity of a quick profit, we should be on our guard and we should not accept calmly that though we have an adverse trade balance of £118 million, the adverse balance of payments is only £25 million because we are selling out for cash our businesses, our land and our assets.  So long as the money for these purchases is coming in we do not have to worry but we should remember that every million pounds that comes into this country for the purpose of financing a take-over imposes for the future an annual charge of approximately £70,000 on our balance of payments.  It is unwise to imagine that the capital that comes in take-over produces corresponding visible or invisible exports.  That is by no means all the consequences of such a sale as I described.</P>
    <P>The Government's whole attitude to the cost of living is irresponsible and well-nigh criminal to the whole economic future of this country.  I do not believe that there is any use in applying the soothing unction to our souls that if you do all the things calculated to increase the cost of living, you can then prevent it going up by holding public inquiries.  We have had inquiries into the prices of soap and other goods and in every case the Minister has come back to the House and said he found that the increases were justified. You have deliberately taken fiscal measures to increase the cost of living and there is no use persuading yourselves that the cost of living will not go up.</P>
    <P>We told that to the Government and the country 12 months ago.  We heard the Taoiseach say, after the imposition of the turnover tax, that the cost of living would increase by 2½ per cent. Now we are learning the bitter fact that it increased by much more than 2½ per cent and that the increase will continue.  The increases will go on and the economic consequences are as inevitable as the dawning of tomorrow's day.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware that in these days of inflation a great many people feel <Col N="213" /> there is more money in circulation; wages are going up.  It is a rather enjoyable experience and it is very often not politically profitable to point out the inevitable trend.  Nevertheless we in public life have a certain duty and that is, whether it is popular or unpopular, to speak the truth to the people.  What I am saying now is the truth and the Minister for Industry and Commerce knows it is the truth.  I believe the Taoiseach knows it, too, but he is a gambler and he trusts that something will turn up to remedy the situation and, if nothing else turns up, he lays this flattering unction to his soul, that everybody else is doing it and it will all come out in the wash. That is the rock he will split on.</P>
    <P>There is an inflation going on, certainly an inflationary trend both in Great Britain and the United States of America at the present time as a result of the political events that are impending in those two countries. What the economic atmosphere in Great Britain and the USA will be after the elections have taken place is quite another story but anybody who reads about or has any contact with Europe is aware that in Italy, Holland, even in Germany and Switzerland energetic measures are on their way to reverse inflationary trends that have been developing in those countries.  If we imagine that our costs of production can continue steadily to rise and that we shall remain competitive in Great Britain or any other foreign market indefinitely we are making a terrible mistake.  If we lose our capacity to compete in foreign markets with our industrial goods we shall find it very difficult to get back into the markets into which we have so painfully and with such great effort made our way.</P>
    <P>The short view is the comfortable view.  The long view is the honest view and our responsibility, we believe, is not to plan for today and tomorrow but to plan for the long term.  We must ensure that, if we invite 100 men into employment in this country, invite them to marry and establish families, we are not creating a situation in which, when the family responsibilities have gathered around them, they will <Col N="214" /> find themselves on the side of the road because the industry in which they have entered and in which they have made that incomparable investment not of their money but of their lives folds up under them and leaves them, perhaps in early middle age, with the skill of their particular employment but without the means of using that skill because the industry in which they have made the investment of the best years of their working lives is no longer able to compete in the market where its output must be sold.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing to me how people can deceive themselves as to the real trend.  I do not think anybody will deny that vast sums of public money are being spent for the promotion of employment.  The Government have already borrowed £280 million and we are going to borrow £85 million this year.  That is over and above the revenue which is being paid out by the Government amounting to £215 million and which is twice what the Government were spending seven years ago.</P>
    <P>Yet we have the astonishing fact, in spite of all the Government building that is going on, in spite of all the investment in building and capital activity of one kind or another which is engendered by this vast expenditure of borrowed money, there are more unemployed people on the 6th June, 1964, than there were on the 6th June, 1962, in every category.  There are more men drawing unemployment benefit on the 6th June, 1964, than there were on the 6th June, 1962.  Taking the total of men, women, boys and girls, there are more drawing unemployment benefit in 1964 than there were in 1962.  If you take the people on unemployment assistance, applications current, in every category there are more people drawing unemployment assistance in 1964, on the last available date, than there were in 1962.  There are 1,400 more people on the live register on the 6th June, 1964, than there were in 1962.  I confess that figure astonishes me because when I see the scale of the capital expenditure being financed by the Government I should have imagined there would be a very substantial fall in the number of unemployed.  When I remember <Col N="215" /> that in the last seven years approximately 300,000 young people between the ages of 18 and 30 years have emigrated to Great Britain, it is a source of amazement to me that at this moment we have more unemployed than we had two years ago.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has any explanation to give for that because I find it extremely difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>When I hear of the glorious triumphs of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> which seem so to intoxicate Deputy Gallagher, I ask myself what is the purpose of economic expansion if it is not to employ our own people in our own country; what is the purpose of a plan for economic expansion that shovels 300,000 young people out of the country and leaves us with more unemployed to-day than we had two years ago?  If that is the result of a programme for economic expansion, then all I can say is that I am not greatly impressed.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt there are some people who have made money out of it.  I do not doubt there are some people better off to-day than they were five or six years ago.  I admit that in the presence of an inflation the rich get richer and the poor get poorer but what happens to the poor in this country is that when they reach a certain state of poverty they emigrate. There are 300,000 gone.  That is what I mean by the poor getting poorer.  I do not deny there are more Mercedes Benzes going around the town.  I see a few Rolls Royces travelling around the town.  I see Bentleys getting relatively frequent.  They are welcome to them and I acknowledge their proprietors have done well.  The rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer but that is not the kind of economic expansion I ever thought we would glory in in this country.</P>
    <P>If we were living in a closed economy and if those 300,000 were gathered around us in poverty, clamouring at the doors of the labour exchanges, demonstrating in the streets because they were poor and claiming <Col N="216" /> their fair share, a very different atmosphere would obtain in Dáil Éireann. I doubt if we would be reading glowing accounts in the OECD report about the triumphant success of the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> Where would we stand to-day if the 300,000 poor had not emigrated? Instead of having 45,860 unemployed, would we have 345,860 unemployed? I certainly do not glory in the fact that the poor have grown poorer while the rich have grown richer or in the fact that the poverty has been concealed from us because we have shipped the poor to Birmingham, Coventry, London or Glasgow or other industrial slums in Britain.</P>
    <P>I knew a young chap who went abroad in 1938 and he worked in England all during the war.  At the end of the war, he went to America and then he came home.  I said to him: &ldquo;John, what change do you see?&rdquo; He was living in the country.  Said he, &ldquo;I see two changes: one, the houses are a bit better and the second is that the people are all gone.&rdquo;  He is now living in the west of Ireland.  &ldquo;When I was here last,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you could go out and walk into seven or eight houses on a summer evening without any trouble.  Now it is very hard to find any house that is lived in within a reasonable distance of your own home.&rdquo;  That silent, catastrophic change is proceeding.  In our open economy, it is the consequence of the poor becoming poorer and the rich richer.  It is not a development of which I think we have any reason to be proud.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to a very strange kind of investment. First, I want to make this clear: I believe that where private enterprise cannot provide the capital to establish a desirable industry that will provide our people with employment in their own country, the Government or the community ought to do it.  I have not the slightest hesitation in rejoicing on looking back on the capital investment that was made on behalf of our people in the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;£60 million.  I rejoice to look back on the fact that we provided the <Col N="217" /> capital to establish the beet sugar factories.  All these were good investments. They could not have been established without Government investment.</P>
    <P>I think there are other spheres where Government investment might very suitably be considered, the fertiliser industry and other industries where a virtual monoply exists, the flour milling industry and where industries fail to fill the needs of the community I would not hesitate to see public investment in them in order to ensure that they are expanded and developed for the service of the people rather than for ulterior motives.  But then I come to an investment about which the time has come to speak out and, if I am wrong, correct me in public. It is much better that this kind of thing should be said in public rather than whispered behind closed doors. The Minister has a right to have any matter of this kind raised so that he can challenge it and correct it if the story circulating is not correct.</P>
    <P>I was told through the public press that Verolme Dockyard at Cork secured, after intense and fierce competition, a contract to build a ship of 30,000 tons deadweight.  The ship was called the &ldquo;Amstellhof&rdquo; and the order to build it, it was alleged, was obtained in the face of exceedingly stiff opposition from shipyards all over Europe. That order, I understand, was placed with the Verolme dockyard by the Netherlands Freight and Tanker Company, Limited, of The Hague.  The chairman of that company is Mr. Verolme.</P>
    <P>Mr. Verolme, chairman of the Netherlands Freight and Tanker Company, went out and, after exceedingly stiff opposition, gave himself a contract to build a ship in the dockyard at Cork.  We can all picture Mr. Verolme competing and wrestling with himself and eventually yielding reluctantly to the superior competitiveness of himself and he decides to build the ship in Cork.  That was all very nice.  About three weeks before this vessel was completed, the Minister for Industry and Commerce came in and announced that he proposed to give Mr. Verolme a subsidy of £350,000 in <Col N="218" /> order to enable him to meet the contract price on foot of the agreement which had been made in the face of exceedingly stiff opposition between Mr. Verolme and himself.  We provided £350,000 to enable him to reach his target and he reached his target and the &ldquo;Amstellhof&rdquo; was launched&mdash; I am not sure whether the Minister went down to launch it or whether it was the Taoiseach who went.  There was a party and great celebrations when the &ldquo;Amstellhof&rdquo; took to the sea.  It sailed in ballast for Vancouver to take on a load of wheat for the Netherlands for the Netherlands Freight and Tanker Company Limited.</P>
    <P>But a remarkable development took place.  Before the Blue Peter was lowered and the &ldquo;Amstellhof&rdquo; took to the sea the vessel was sold to N. V. Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland of Amsterdam.  Nobody knows what that company paid for the &ldquo;Amstellhof&rdquo; but it has been estimated that it was not less than £1 million sterling.  I should like the Minister to tell us if he is informed of the history of these transactions and, if it is true that this order was obtained by Mr. Verolme from Mr. Verolme in the face of exceedingly stiff opposition, how it came about that it was necessary to pay a subsidy of £350,000 on the ship and, if it was necessary to pay it, how did it come about that it was suitable or becoming that the ship should be sold for an unascertained sum estimated to be not less than £1 million within a few days of its having been launched?</P>
    <P>Another ship is now in hands on which we have undertaken in advance &mdash;as I understand it&mdash;to provide another £350,000 subsidy but this time she is not being built for the Netherlands Freight and Tanker Company of The Hague.  This time she is being built for the Liberian National Shipping Lines. God knows, Liberia is far enough away from the Hague, down on the west coast of Africa, and this order has been obtained in the face of stiff opposition from many other yards.  But then when you begin to inquire into who is the Liberian Shipping Company, some remarkable facts begin to come to light.  The Liberian National <Col N="219" /> Shipping Line is a company in which there is substantial State participation. Fifty per cent of the capital of the line belongs to the Liberian Government. But there are two other shareholders and the House will not be astonished to discover that one of them is Mr. Verolme.  He owns 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>Here, again, Mr. Verolme has been wrestling with himself all over Europe and the outside world in this stiff and vigorous competition and the nett result has been that the traditional pattern has been followed.  After all the dust and sweat of the arena of competition, Mr. Verolme has bought the boat from himself, but with the provision that we will contribute £350,000 to the transaction.  I am all for building ships if we can build them on any basis which holds out a prospect that, at some stage, we will be delivered from the necessity of assisting the purchases thus dramatically entered into.</P>
    <P>Are these facts substantially correct? If they are not, I hope the Minister will correct me.  If they are substantially correct, as I believe them to be, I want to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce does he think that this type of investment in industry is calculated over the long term to help the workers of this country? I would be prepared to contribute a good deal towards creating employment for 600, 800 or 1,000 men in Cork if the employment were permanent employment, if the employment were enduring employment.  But, if all the wrestling and competition and struggling to secure shipbuilding contracts so far has, in fact, been Mr. Verolme wrestling with himself in his various roles, whether it be as Dutch shipbuilder, Liberian capitalist or any of his other various capacities, I ask myself are we creating a permanent and enduring industry in Cork or are we teaching men skills&mdash;remember, the workmen in Cork are investing their lives in this industry&mdash;which in five, ten or 15 years' time they will be told are no longer required?  The picture, as it appears at present, does not seem to me very reassuring.  I <Col N="220" /> should like the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give us some correction, or reassurance, in regard to that particular matter.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, there is another very strange story which has reached me and which I think it right to give the Minister the opportunity of dealing with in public.  We authorised the Government to spend £1,000,000 on the establishment of a trade and industry exhibit, or a stand, at the New York World Fair.  It is, of course, perfectly proper that due emphasis should be given to cultural and other aspects of our life as well as to matters strictly relative to trade and industry.  I assume that this large investment of public money was designed to have some return other than the edification of the crowds who are attending the New York World Fair. Mark you, many of the sophisticated visitors to the New York World Fair may be intrigued by extracts from Shaw, and Joyce, and Yeats, and from others of our national poets, but pleasant as they may find the exhibition, with its scenic pictures and so forth, and bearing in mind the general cross-section of the public attending the Fair, I should imagine they have a good deal of interest in more practical aspects of life as well.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate that every due regard must be had to national dignity, and so forth, in the administration of a stand of this kind but, having surveyed the circumstances fully, it was decided apparently that there should be made available to visitors to the Irish stand refreshment, alcoholic and otherwise, for those who wanted to buy it.  That decision was taken, I suppose, after prudent consideration with the best advisers we could secure in New York.  Notwithstanding that, this astonishing fact has been reported to me by people who have visited the stand: on being informed that alcoholic refreshment was available for those who wished to pay for it, they asked for a glass of Harp Lager, or a glass of Guinness, and were told that those commodities were not available on the Irish stand.  Now the Dutch stand, the Danish stand, the German stand are all promoting their respective <Col N="221" /> national products and I think it is true to say that, if one goes to the Dutch stand, one will get only Dutch lager beer and, if one goes to the Danish stand, one will get only Danish beer and, if one visits the German stand, one will get only a cross-section of German beers.  If one goes to the French stand, presumably one gets French wines.</P>
    <P>I could understand it if the Irish stand said: &ldquo;We do not propose to provide refreshment of any kind.  We will cut that right out.&rdquo;  It might be a mistaken decision, but I could understand it.  But when they take the decision that there must be made available for the convenience of their guests and visitors alcoholic and other refreshments on request and then it is discovered that people calling at the Irish stand, asking for the products of the biggest brewery in the world, which is spending some hundreds of thousands of pounds on advertising in the United States, cannot get Harp Lager or Guinness and, if they want lager, must go to the Danish, the Dutch, or the German stand seems to me the essence of insanity.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear I am not authorised to speak on behalf of the brewery here.  I am speaking on information given to me by constituents of mine who were in New York and went to the World Fair and who were astonished to be told, when they asked for a glass of Harp Lager at the Irish stand that if they wanted to get lager they had better go elsewhere.  That seems to me to be quite daft and represents such an extraordinary low level of judgment that I find it very hard to understand it.  For all I know, maybe the brewery would not provide beer for the Irish stand.  I do not think that is so, but possibly it is the explanation the Minister will give us.  Of course, if the brewery refused to provide the beer, or collaborate in any way, there was nothing the Minister could do about it.  But I do not think that is so and I think it is a matter of material consequence, and one on which I am entitled to expect a full explanation from the Minister, because he is the Minister responsible for trade <Col N="222" /> promotion with special reference to export, when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>The last thing to which I want to refer is this question of the Common Market.  One of the most interesting things in public life is watching how public questions mature in the minds not only of public men but of the community as a whole and how frequently the whole genesis of a fundamentally important question gets lost.  I shall not speak much longer.  I am afraid I have exceeded the allotted time to which we agreed to confine ourselves but the House will perhaps excuse me if I ask for a further five minutes in order to refer to this matter.</P>
    <P>The plain inescapable fact is that, when the Common Market was established, and Great Britain applied for full membership, this country was faced with the dilemma that if Great Britain went in, we had to go in, and, if Great Britain stayed out, we had to stay out.  Why?  If one looks at the 1963 Report of Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Export Board one finds that our total exports amounted to £195,908,000, of which £140,948,000 went to Great Britain and to Northern Ireland.  We cannot afford to stay out if Great Britain goes in, because if we did, the Common Market tariffs would be raised up between us and the area to which we send 70 per cent of our exports.  We cannot afford to go in if Great Britain does not go in, because we cannot afford to raise the Common Market tariffs against the best customer we have.</P>
    <P>Now, the attitude of Fianna Fáil is that this is true but we must not say it.  I think that is dishonest and disreputable. I listened to the Taoiseach yesterday wriggling like an eel in a bucket when the query was pressed on him: &ldquo;What are you going to do about the Common Market?&rdquo; That is what we are going to do about the Common Market.  If Great Britain goes in, we will have to go in, and if she does not go in, we will not go in.  I can assure Deputies it is humiliating at international gatherings on the continent of Europe to see people sniggering behind their hands at some of the representatives of this country <Col N="223" /> talking about Ireland &ldquo;going it alone.&rdquo; They know perfectly well&mdash;and they fully understand it&mdash;that that is quite out of the question.  They know the agony which Denmark is going through because her trade is half with the Common Market and half outside it, with the area to which we send 70 per cent of our exports.  To talk of our going into the Common Market on our own is just blatherskite, and everyone who understands the situation knows that.  It is a humilitating situation that our Government, for what I think are unworthy motives, are prepared to say that they are prepared to &ldquo;go it alone.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To me the Common Market was indissolubly associated with the concept of the Atlantic Partnership.  I say with profound regret that having regard to the death of President Kennedy, and the foreign policy of the President of the French Republic, I am afraid the whole concept of the Atlantic Partnership is now long postponed. That is a great tragedy for the world and it involves the world in substantial danger into which it would not be proper for me to go on this Vote.</P>
    <P>I want to renew my affirmation of faith in the over-riding concept of the Atlantic Partnership enshrined in the speech made by President Kennedy at Philadelphia on Independence Day, 4th July, two years ago.  I believe that great concept will one day be revived, but I do not believe it will be revived in the immediate future.  Therefore, for me the Common Market has lost much of its attraction.  I want to warn the House that if Great Britain enters the Common Market, we will have to enter it, but I think that, as it is developing under the growing influence of the Government of France, this country will have to take a look at the Common Market again and ask itself if the Common Market is developing into the kind of political and economic unit in which this country positively desires to participate.</P>
    <P>In my judgment, it is changing from what it was first conceived to be.  I hope that change will not take it too far down the road which would make it very different from the organisation <Col N="224" /> of which we aspire to become a full member.  Changes are taking place, and, in the absence of the Atlantic Partnership, and in the presence of those changes, I think this whole concept requires close and careful consideration. I would not be prepared to predict what the future of the Common Market will be until after the election in Great Britain, the election in the United States of America, the election in Sweden, and the general election in Holland.  We will know with a great deal more certainty on 1st January of next year.</P>
    <P>In the long term, I believe a united Europe and an Atlantic partnership is the destiny of the free world.  Looking at it from the long term, I want to be part of it, and I want Ireland to be part of it.  I imagine that some day a united Ireland can form a useful and constructive part of it.  In the short term, until that ennobling concept comes within our vision, we should walk warily, and reconcile ourselves boldly and honestly to the fact that if Great Britain joins the Common Market, we will have to join it, and if she does not, we cannot.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell us what he thinks of the situation in regard to the cost of living and the adverse trade balance.  Where does he think we are going?  Is he easy in his own mind in respect of the two specific matters I have raised in connection with the Verolme dockyard and the Guinness products on the Irish stand at the New York World Fair?  I think we are entitled to a pretty detailed explanation from him.</P>

      <P>Since I came into this House.  I have had to listen continuously to figures of emigration and statistics given here.  Quite frankly, I cannot understand how a man of the calibre of Deputy Dillon could stand up in front of us and give figures and statistics which cannot be borne out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a world of respect for Deputy Dillon.  One would have to have respect for a person who had reached the pinnacle of his career, <Col N="225" /> I suppose, as leader of the Opposition Party, but when he enters into the realm of figures, he should make sure that his figures are correct.</P>
      <P>There are no statistics in this country which bear out a loss of 300,000 people.  I have figures from the Census of Population of 1961 which go back to 1901.  The total drop in the population between 1956 and 1961 was 79,923 people.  The drop between 1951 and 1956 was 62,329 people.  The total reduction between 1936 and 1961 was 150,079 people.  The total reduction in the population between 1901 and 1961 was 403,482 people.  Between 1901 and 1936&mdash;the biggest drop&mdash;it was 253,403 people.  We have also an equivalent figure of 400,000 fewer people born which would more or less wipe out the entire reduction. Admittedly, fewer people have been dying, but nowhere do statistics bear out the figure of 300,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>If the Deputy can get some economic magician over there to try to juggle these figures, I shall, of course, accept his figure.  I do not think he can.  Probably the Deputy believes he is right, but I can tell him he is not.  I do, however, suggest to him that that kind of argument can do a terrific amount of harm to the country.  I do not base my case on the 79,000 people who have gone out, the cream of our population, but I submit it does not help our country to try to enlarge such figures out of all proportion. It can do grave damage at a time when we need all our people.</P>
      <P>At this time we could do with 100,000 more agile people working on the land.  How we can ever get so many back I do not know, but certainly these statements from across the House will not help the national effort.  Let us at least try to be united in this, because our young people are looking forward with hope.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that we have many poor people, but would point out that in America, the richest country in the world today, one will find the poorest of the poor.  That is the setup of civilisation today.  We all hope for a change for the better here: we all hope we can get more and more people to work to produce the wealth which will make the lot of the masses better.</P>
      <P>I suggest the Minister should bend his efforts to bringing about a position in which people will be induced to bring more industry to the western areas.  Deputy Corish commented on the CIO report on the desirability of more centralisation of industry.  I do not agree with that.  If we move our people out of their local towns, their home areas, into other counties, they will eventually move to England and America and will be completely lost to the national effort.  The Minister should therefore experiment in the west as he has done at Shannon.  It would help the people to stay in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large, good work is being done in the industrial sphere.  We are marching forward and our people can look to the future with hope.  I forecast that those of us alive in five years &mdash;certainly in ten years&mdash;will see a <Col N="227" /> vastly different Ireland.  The people believe in their country; they are finding pride in our national endeavour. I would therefore appeal again to the Opposition Deputies to give every assistance and encouragement to the youth of the country who are beginning to take the reins into their own hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Our main hope of increased prosperity lies in industrial expansion. I realise agriculture has a big part to play in increasing our gross national production, but due to the average size of our farms and the complacency of farmers in producing only enough for their own needs&mdash; there is always among them the fear that any further production will create a glut on the market&mdash;our main hope lies in industrial expansion.  That is our main hope of achieving any planned programme of production expansion.</P>
      <P>The Government have given us a White Paper on planned industrial and agricultural expansion.  While the Government have the duty and responsibility of producing such documents, it is very little practical use putting down on paper what we hope to achieve.  We must also have the co-operation of everyone in the country. At this stage of national development our interests can best be served by the co-operative combination of three sectors&mdash;the Government, the employers and the workers engaged in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have the responsibility of providing the finances necessary for investment in new industries, of providing money for employers in long-established industries to help them improve working methods.  The employers themselves will have a part to play by ploughing back into their industries part of the profits they are at present receiving from their investments.  Provided a suitable agreement is reached to give them security, improved working conditions and a share of increased profits in the form of better wages, the workers must undertake that they will be willing to improve production methods, co-operate in the use of <Col N="228" /> advanced techniques and new machinery and, above all, to be subject to the instructions of their trade unions and to give up unofficial and &ldquo;wildcat&rdquo; strikes.  If we could get between the Government, the employers and the unions representing the workers an accepted policy, with guarantees on all sides, I am sure we could not only achieve the progress planned by the Government but go considerably beyond it.</P>
    <P>However, the Government must realise that in the past workers have found to their dismay in many cases that, as a result of increasing production, they either worked themselves or their colleagues out of a job.  They found that the profits secured by improved production did not go towards reducing costs or were not ploughed back into the business but rather were used to swell dividends and pay high salaries to company officials.  They found that instead of improving their conditions many of them were thrown out of employment and that firms often resorted to short-time working.  In the matter of increased production, the employers have responsibilities as well as the workers.  Until the employers are prepared to co-operate with the trade unions in reaching an agreement, and show their honesty by guaranteeing higher wages and improved working conditions and fringe benefits, all the efforts of the Government and those who wish the country well will be in vain.</P>
    <P>Higher wages are a sign of progress. Too often in the past we have been told that if wages go up inflation is bound to take place.  You cannot have increased production without workers demanding higher wages.  You cannot have higher wages and greater spending power within an economy unless a certain amount of inflation takes place. Attempts to keep down inflation by increasing indirect taxation is simply an effort to deprive the worker of the fair reward he achieves for the increased effort he puts into his work in response to Government pleas for increased production. You cannot encourage the worker to produce more and, at the same time, deprive him of the benefits <Col N="229" /> of that production by more indirect taxation.  The Government have a responsibility to the workers to see to it that the hard-won earnings secured from increased production are not taken away by indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his proposals to enlarge the activities of the Labour Court, as referred to in the newspapers and outlined briefly in his speech.  I should also like to join with the Minister in complimenting the Labour Court on the magnificent work they have done since they were established.  While it is true on many occasions they failed to avert disputes&mdash;disputes of national importance, inflicting great hardship and affecting many other industries besides the industry concerned&mdash;nevertheless, I still feel the Labour Court have done a wonderful job.  But I believe, with the new recognition between employers and workers, there is room for a considerable extension of the activities of conciliation officers and, in fact, for arbitration on points of lesser importance which can arise in a dispute between trade unions and employers.</P>
    <P>I should also like to congratulate the Minister on the proposed establishment of technical colleges in regions selected by him.  I appreciate that my constituency, my native city of Waterford, has been selected as a centre for one of those colleges.  That was a wise decision.  In Waterford, we have the facilities for the college, the necessary teaching staff and the industries to absorb the qualified technicians who will flow from this college shortly after its establishment.</P>
    <P>There is one flaw, as far as I am concerned in connection with my constituency, or I should say my county because I believe it is just outside my constituency&mdash;the grass meal factory at Affane near Cappoquin.  I understand from the director, Mr. Jameson, and his fellow directors that, due to the activities of the Government-sponsored grass meal project, they have found competition so severe in the home market that they have been forced to close down part of their industry at Janesville, County Waterford, at the cost of some 30 workers, who prior to <Col N="230" /> this had received full-time work and in addition 15 to 16 seasonal workers.</P>
    <P>I also understand that the parent factory in County Waterford near Cappoquin is, during the course of this season, being reduced to part-time employment.  It is not fair competition when a Government-sponsored and financed body can place on the home market a product below the cost at which it is economic for a private firm to produce.  I feel that the employers and the management of the grass meal factories of the country should be received in consultation with the Government and endeavour to establish an economic price for their produce that will give a reasonably good standard of living to each of the workers at Janesville and Cappoquin and a reasonably fair profit to those who manage the industry.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that the grass meal company in County Waterford was a very good company, paying standard trade union rates, with pension schemes paid completely by the management for their employees and giving excellent conditions.  I wonder whether the Government-sponsored body can claim the same? If unfair competition and low prices are the result of unfavourable working conditions, profits and wages, then both the workers and the management of the grass meal company in Waterford have a complaint that is really justified.</P>
    <P>I feel, like Deputy Corish, that the Minister has been rather complacent in connection with the control of prices. I do not propose to take individual items to prove my case but I do say that, all during the past month when we have met tourists from Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the one expression on all lips was the difference in prices between articles of clothing and wearing apparel in this country as compared with, say, Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  Surely, as Deputy Corish says, with two reductions in tariff, on clothing and footwear, some reflection should have been shown in reduced prices.  Unfortunately, that is not so.  We do not get the reduction. In actual fact, prices are steadily mounting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> It is amazing, in this country of plenty, to see the prices that are being charged in rural areas for the essentials of life, foodstuffs.  It is true that in the cities and major towns a certain amount of stabilisation has been secured by the opening of supermarkets, but in rural areas, where the population would not justify that type of competition, we find the cost of living increasing daily.  I am afraid the impact of the ninth round of wage increases has not yet been fully felt and, justified or not justified, that an increase will again be passed on to the various articles manufactured.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Corish said, the promise of stability for two years to come will have to be re-examined by the trade unions, unless the Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce exercise the powers in the 1958 Prices Act.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister personally and his Department officials on the co-operation I have always received from them on all occasions when I had the responsibility of placing before the Minister certain proposals with regard to the establishment of an industry in my constituency. I am happy to state that, as a result of the Minister's help and as a result of the IDA, we hope in the very near future, in my native town of Dungarvan, to have established two industries from the USA which will be mainly engaged in export trade.  There is a proposal actually on the agenda on the urban district council to sell to these two companies land, the property of the council, which we have held in readiness for just such an eventuality.  I should like to thank the Minister and his staff for their co-operation with us over the past year when we were seeking to establish these industries and to thank him for that help now that we are in sight of achieving our goal.</P>

      <P>Ar dtúis, ba mhaith liom comhgáirdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Aire mar gheall ar an obair atá á déanamh aige sa Roinn seo ó chuaigh se isteach ann.  Tá dul chun cinn an-mhaith déanta maidir le cúrsaí <Col N="232" /> déantúsaíochta ar fud na tíre, go h-áirithe im cheantar féin.  Tá mé buíoch den Aire as ucht an chuidiú a thug sé i gcónaí agus as ucht an chuidiú a thug an Roinn fosta.  Tá saol eacnamaíochta na tíre ag brath go mór ar an obair a déantar sa Roinn seo agus tá saothar eáchtach á dhéanamh ann.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that while there is progress on all economic fronts, the rapid expansion of Irish industry in the past few years has been one of the greatest successes of the Government's <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> When it is noted that it is on the expansion of industry that we are dependent in the main for the creation of employment possibilities and the provision of new jobs, and remember that this is one of the objectives of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> it is clear to everybody how very important this expansion is.</P>
      <P>The Minister is certainly to be congratulated on the manner in which he has succeeded in keeping up the momentum in our industrial drive and for the way he has been endeavouring, successfully, if I may say so, to accelerate and increase that drive, particularly by the introduction of the various amendments to the Industrial Grants Acts and by the provision of more money so as to leave Foras Tionscal greater freedom in their efforts to induce industrialists to set up industries in this country and also, as a result of the Committee on Industrial Organisation reports, by providing aid to Irish industry to adapt itself to more intensive competition here at home and in the export markets following the gradual reduction of tariffs on goods coming into this country and the reduction of tariffs between the countries forming the EFTA group.  Might I add here that the fact that a vastly increased number of our industrialists have availed of the grants during the past year is a very good omen.  We hope this trend will continue at an accelerating pace in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reports furnished by the CIO give a clear insight into the various industries examined to date.  Even though this Committee was originally set up to make a critical appraisal of <Col N="233" /> the measures required in the event of our entering the Common Market, the reports are nonetheless valuable even though we are now unlikely to enter the Common Market for some time.</P>
    <P>Recent events <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EFTA countries show that free trade is definitely on the way.  I read recently where the General Secretary of EFTA stated that it was hoped there would be an end to tariffs and quotas in the countries forming that group by 1967.  In that respect, the decision of the Government in relation to tariffs after Britain's rejection by the Common Market proved wise.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, coming from a constituency where there are many industries and where, I might say, the future of industry is of vital importance, I must sound a note of warning.  It is obvious that there must be a limit to one-sided freeing of trade from the point of view of employment in individual industries.  If we were to continue to free our trade unilaterally, for obvious reasons, some of our industries would not survive, not because they were inefficient in themselves but because the lack of reciprocal trading arrangements would place them in a most disadvantageous position in relation to their foreign competitors.</P>
    <P>I recognise, of course, that there was definite need for the freeing of trade to the extent that that has been done so as to impress on our less efficient and less progressive managements the need for reform if they were to exist in the highly competitive trading and industrial world of today and also to ensure that if we were to become members of the Common Market a sudden drop in tariffs would not dislocate industry to such an extent as to cause wholesale unemployment.  I further recognise the need when you consider that our advantage in the British market has been whittled down to a very low point by British concessions to her EFTA partners.  Nevertheless, I feel that it would be wise at this point to hasten slowly in the dismantling of tariffs unless we can get fair trading advantage in return.</P>
    <P>I made representations to the Minister during the year to keep a very <Col N="234" /> close eye on imports from low cost producing countries, particularly the Far East, so as to prevent dumping.  I know he is watching this matter very closely and that he is well aware of the danger this constitutes to industries here.  Because of the shockingly bad wage rates and working conditions in these countries, I find from investigations I have made that goods from these countries can be landed on our quays here at a lower price than we would pay for the raw materials in Ireland.  Obviously, then, if imports from these countries were to gain in volume they would have a considerably detrimental effect on our industries here.  I know, of course, the Minister has this whole matter very much in mind and that he has recently brought in a Control of Imports Bill which will enable him to take the necessary action when he feels that is desirable.</P>
    <P>Excellent work has been done by the Footwear Adaptation Committee. We must recognise that adaptation in the footwear trade will take a considerable time.  The footwear industry is now facing the problem of a change from the quota to the tariff system. Here, again, we should proceed slowly so as to permit the changes designed to increase efficiency to take place as smoothly as possible.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in this matter because my constituency might be termed the headquarters of the industry.  Very large numbers of my constituents are employed in this business. I am keenly conscious of the effect the change-over would have if imports from low cost producing countries were permitted in here unrestrictedly. If a change from the quota system to a tariff system is found necessary, then the tariffs ought to be sufficiently high and should be retained until such time as the industry has had an opportunity to adapt itself. There is a first-class effort being made by the industry to bring itself to the stage of efficiency where it will be capable of meeting competition in freer trade conditions.</P>
    <P>It is well to place on record that over the past six years there has been an almost 50 per cent increase in our industrial output.  It is a truly magnificent <Col N="235" /> feat resulting in the creation of 26,000 more jobs.  This, coupled with the more than doubling of our exports over the same period, is a tribute to our workers and management alike. We are all very grateful to them.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note the very large increase, of almost £2 million, in the money being made available to An Foras Tionscal.  I am particularly gratified by the Minister's statement that much of this money is needed to make payment of grants which have been approved for the enlargement and adaptation of existing industrial undertakings to meet conditions of freer trade.  The work being done by the Industrial Development Authority and An Foras Tionscal is exceptional and the enthusiasm and high efficiency of those engaged in this work is to be very highly commended.</P>
    <P>In relation to the adaptation grants which are being made available by Foras Tionscal, I should like to see as broad a view as possible being taken on each application.  I know it is a condition that Foras Tionscal must satisfy themselves that the particular industry will benefit from a grant and that it will be capable of meeting competition under free trade conditions.  It would be well, however, for An Foras Tionscal to take into consideration the number of people employed in the particular industry.  If they have a doubt as to the benefit to be derived from a grant by an industry they should give the benefit of the doubt to the industry concerned.</P>
    <P>I also note an increase of £65,000 for Córas Tráchtála.  Here also we have an organisation which is doing excellent work.  Before I say any more about it, I should like to compliment Córas Tráchtála, first of all, on the information made available to us in their annual report and also on the design of the report.  As far as I know, Córas Tráchtála have some responsibility for improvement of design and I think they are showing the way excellently in the format of their report this year.</P>
    <P>We all agree that there is little value in producing more and more, no matter what the quality, if we cannot <Col N="236" /> sell the goods.  Here Córas Tráchtála takes a hand with its intensive efforts to gain new markets and expand existing markets, and also with the unlimited supply of information and the many services which it makes available to our industrialists and exporters generally.  Many industrialists in my constituency over the past few years have had occasion to seek the help and advice of Córas Tráchtála. I have heard nothing but the greatest praise for the courtesy, efficiency and helpfulness of this organisation.  Those who have not had reason to give close consideration to the activities of Córas Tráchtála would be amazed at the variety of its activities, its trade missions, marketing research, industrial design, staff training operations, its shipping services which do so much to reduce transport costs, and so on. While I am pleased by the fact that £65,000 more has been made available to this organisation, my only complaint in relation to a service which is of such vital importance to the economic life of our country is that I feel the amount being made available is not sufficient.  Markets and more markets are our most urgent and greatest need and I think it would be false economy to economise on this facet of our national development.</P>
    <P>On this Estimate it is usual to refer to the beneficial effects on the economy of the country of buying Irish goods.  Perhaps it is more particularly relevant this year when a number of 10 per cent reductions have taken place on tariffs on foreign goods coming into the country.  The attraction and temptation to buy these goods will be all the greater.  I have spoken on this topic on many occasions and pointed out that by buying Irish goods people are helping themselves, helping their neighbours and helping the nation.</P>
    <P>I often wonder whether we have the right approach on this matter.  Perhaps if we were to have a sell Irish campaign and if we were to convince our shopkeepers on the importance of selling Irish goods we might reap better results.  Perhaps it is expecting too much from our people to have them continually ask in the shops whether <Col N="237" /> an article they are buying is manufactured in Ireland.  We all know from experience that the public, as a rule, tend to buy the articles that are on display, and perhaps even more so the articles which are presented to them in the shops.  A lot depends on whether the shopkeeper displays his goods in an attractive way, and on whether he pushes the sale of Irish goods.  While I agree this is so in many instances, and while recently very valuable efforts were made by some of the big stores in Dublin to encourage the sale of Irish goods, nevertheless, it is not universally so, particularly in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I was very disturbed by one case which was brought to my notice a short time ago in relation to a certain commodity which is produced on a large scale in a number of factories in my constituency.  These factories have a large export market.  I mention this to show that the product produced by them is of high quality and is price competitive.  Two members of the management of one of these factories passed a large city store recently where there was a display of this particular commodity.  They noticed that in the whole display there were only two articles of Irish manufacture.  I understood later from these two people that the assistants in this particular shop were being paid commission to sell the foreign goods. There may be a higher profit margin on the foreign goods but I cannot understand the mentality behind this. These people ought to realise that, by their action, ultimately they will deprive people of work in those factories and there will be nobody to buy their own goods.  I do not wish to dwell on this particular subject and I have deliberately refrained from mentioning the shop or the product as I am not interested in sensationalism, but it is high time these people realised what their duties are.</P>
    <P>In a statement the Minister said that the Irish Productivity Committee will be able to offer direct services to industry, to give expert appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses in a firm's operations and also that they will be able to give specialised information to individual firms.  This is all the more <Col N="238" /> valuable at the present time, especially when special grants for the re-equipment and expansion of industry are being made available by the Government to assist industry to adapt itself to meet free trade conditions.</P>
    <P>It is true to say I have spoken on almost every Estimate for Industry and Commerce since I came into this House.  On most of these occasions I have complained that my constituency was being passed over, and I pointed out the need for new industries there. I think it is only fair, now that industrial development is proceeding rapidly in my constituency, that I should thank the Minister, Foras Tionscal and the Industrial Development Authority for this happy state of affairs and for the assistance they have given.  While we are not entirely satisfied, and for the sake of progress, I hope we will never be satisfied, we are grateful for their co-operation with us and we know when we ask for the same co-operation in future it will be forthcoming.  Industrial development is proceeding apace in Louth.  We are very pleased with developments there over the past few years.</P>
    <P>I shall now deal briefly with the alleged case of taking an industry from Drogheda to Limerick which got considerable publicity in Drogheda.  The Fine Gael Deputy who asked the question concerning it is considerably out of touch with realities in relation to the situation in Drogheda.  Industrialists visit us there regularly.  We give them all the information they require We show them the sites.  We point to the natural advantages of Drogheda, which are many.  After that, some of them decide to set up industry in some other part of Ireland and some decide not to set up industry in Ireland at all, but the remainder of them&mdash;a considerable number, I may say, at the present time &mdash; decide to stay on in Drogheda and to build their factories there.  Might I say, as an aside, that I find it peculiar that, two years ago, the Fine Gael Party condemned me for stealing, as they put it, an industry from Ardee and bringing it to Drogheda and now, by implication, they condemn me for what appears to be the exact opposite.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> About a week ago, at a Fine Gael convention in Monaghan, I was again condemned by a number of Fine Gael speakers for having, as they said, taken an industry from Ardee and bringing it to Drogheda.  This only goes to prove that so far as Fine Gael are concerned, I can never do right.  However, so long as the people support me in my efforts to get more industries for Drogheda and for my constituency, I shall not be worried unduly about Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked in the Dáil if it was a fact that a Parliamentary Secretary influenced the bringing of an industry to Limerick and this question implies that it is wrong to try to influence an industry to go to a constituency. I reject the implication in the Deputy's question entirely and state quite unashamedly that I have made every possible effort to induce industrialists to come to my constituency&mdash;and with considerable success. I am at present doing my utmost to induce other industrialists to come to Drogheda.</P>

      <P>If I do not succeed I shall not wail: I shall instead tackle the next one with the utmost vigour.  I can sympathise with the Fine Gael Party in my constituency in their efforts to get a little publicity from what, to use fishing parlance, might be described as the one that got away, particularly as they had so very little to do with the new factories that stayed in Drogheda.  We must remember that the Deputy who asked the question supported a Coalition Government between 1954 and 1957.  During that period, we had not the slightest anxiety about a new industry leaving Drogheda because none came near Drogheda, but we had considerable anxiety during that time about existing industry in Drogheda and in the constituency generally which the Fine Gael and Labour Coalition left on the brink of ruin.  The workers of Drogheda and my constituency generally dreaded Friday night during those years lest they should be handed their cards&mdash;and many of them were <Col N="240" /> handed their cards during that period.</P>
      <P>Today, under Fianna Fáil administration, the older industries in County Louth have not only recovered but are expanding rapidly.  In the past three years, we have got four new large industries for Drogheda.  They are all built now: one was opened a few days ago and the others will be opened shortly.  We have also got a number of new smaller industries there.  In Dundalk, the General Electric Company have built a large new factory which will be opened towards the end of the summer.</P>
      <P>The extraordinary improvement in the economic life of my constituency, has left the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party at their wits' end to find something which might draw the attention of the public but without success. They are presently rather foolishly trying to build up an industrial policy on what they think are the mistakes of our Party.  I feel that this Parliamentary Question is symptomatic of this whole approach.  I am amazed to read statements by the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party in my constituency in which they speak of the dynamic industrial policies they would put into operation if returned to office.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that words are cheap when one is in Opposition.  If the people in my constituency are to decide between the policies of the Fianna Fáil Party and the policies of the other Parties, then they must do so by comparing like with like. One cannot come to a reasonable decision by comparing the success of our policy with the promises of the other Parties.  One must compare like with like.  One must compare the success or failure of our policies for industry in County Louth with the success or failure of the Coalition policies when they were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no more striking contrast in my constituency than the gloom and despair of our people in industrial employment during 1956 and the confidence and drive existing at present under Fianna Fáil.  Let me give one typical and practical example of this. In a particular industry in my constituency, the number employed had been reduced during the Coalition <Col N="241" /> years to 211 on 31st December 1956, and the majority of those 211 persons were working on a four-day week. Today, in that same industry, there are 1,350 people working, most of them on overtime.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to thank those people who so earnestly and at no small cost to themselves in time and energy gave me such assistance in my efforts to procure further industries for Drogheda and my constituency generally.  I should also like to express my thanks publicly in this House to the <i>Drogheda Independent</i> which has been very discreet in matters of publishing information about prospective industry if they felt there was any danger that the prospects of Drogheda would be damaged by publication. It is true to say that as soon as I got on the track of an industry, I informed the paper of it and kept them informed all through the negotiations. I have never had any reason to regret my confidence in them.</P>
    <P>I would once again invite industrialists, Irish and foreign, who have in mind the setting up of an industry in this country to take a good hard look at my constituency before deciding on a location for the industry.  We have much to offer.  We have good ports. We have excellent road and rail services. We are close to Dublin Airport. We have good schools, both technical and secondary.  We shall soon have a technological college in Dundalk.  Most important of all, we have excellent workers with a first-class industrial tradition.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies who know the amount of industry we have got in County Louth may wonder why we should be continually pressing, even though we have got so many new industries recently, for more industries. In a constituency such as mine which is highly industrialised we have our own problems.  Many of the industries we have were established in the 1930's, or were expanded very considerably at that time, and if we take the average age of those engaged in them at that time as about 25 years, the same people would be only about 55 years old now and they are still working in the industries and will <Col N="242" /> work for a considerable time to come. Because they were in relatively good employment, they married at a young age.  Their families are now in their late teens or early 20's and we must provide more and more industry if we are to employ these young people.</P>
    <P>I believe in about ten or 15 years the whole situation will adjust itself much as it has done in a country where there is a long industrial tradition.  In the meantime we have to continue in our endeavours to get more industry, even though we have a considerable number of new industries.  A suggestion was made some time ago in a CIO report regarding the setting up of industrial areas.  I have advocated this on a previous Estimate and I advocate it again and I recommend the Government to have another look at this matter.  County Louth, particularly, lends itself perfectly to the setting up of such an area.  We in the Fianna Fáil Party have never promised that the achievement of the measure of success we have got in County Louth would come easily; we said it would need hard and sustained work to get it and that has been proved, and we in County Louth are prepared to do our share to achieve further success.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister, the Department and the various subsidiary bodies for the help and sympathy they have given me during the year in my efforts to improve the industrial position in my constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Minister's speech this year has followed the same pattern as in previous years.  At the beginning he deals, quite properly, with the question of industrial employment.  He told us that employment has increased from 161,000 in 1962 to 167,000 in 1963. While one is grateful for that, taken in the context of the employment question in general, in which it should be considered, we have to recognise the lamentable fact that in spite of all the boasted dynamic of which we heard so much during the past 12 months, we still have an unemployment figure of about 50,000 to 60,000, and we have 70,000 fewer people employed than six <Col N="243" /> or seven years ago.  The annual rate of emigration varies from about 20,000 to 25,000 and different speakers have mentioned figures of 250,000 and 300,000 for the total number of emigrants who have left over the past ten or 15 years.  Whatever the prognostications may be in regard to increased industrial employment, we have to recognise the altered pattern in agricultural employment where over the years there has been a substantial drop in the number employed.  A decade or so ago about 40 per cent of our people were engaged in agriculture but now that figure is down to something like 35 per cent and it looks as if that pattern will continue.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that 44 new industries were established during the year and represented a capital investment of £9 million.  I find from his statement last year that 40 new industries were established representing a capital investment of £7 million. Later in his statement, he deals with the amount of foreign participation in industry but we never seem to get a figure in any year for industries which have folded up.  On one occasion, I put such a question to him and his reply was that he had no such information available to him.  It seems extraordinary, particularly in reference to industries for which Government subventions have been forthcoming, that if subsequently such an industry disappears, there seems to be no record in the Department of Industry and Commerce to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult to reconcile some of his statements regarding industrial grants.  It may be that in my quick reading through his statement, I may have misinterpreted his figures.  I find here, as regards grants to undeveloped areas, that in 1964 Foras Tionscal approved of £1.3 million for industrial grants and that the employment potential stemming from these projects is stated to be 12,000, but I find that in 1963 the industrial grants approved for the undeveloped areas amounted to £1.5 million and the employment potential was also stated to be 12,000. I find it difficult to reconcile these two figures.  As regards grants to other <Col N="244" /> areas, the Minister states that in 1964 grants to the total of £1 million were approved which makes the total of approved grants up to date £6.7 million, of which £3.3 have been paid, but in his address in 1963, when £2 million were approved, it was also stated that the approved grants up to date totalled the same figure of £6.7 million.  I also find it difficult to reconcile these two figures and I should like the Minister, if he can, to explain the apparent discrepancies.</P>
    <P>He also states that the capital investment in 1963 was £30 million and in 1964 it was £29 million.  I find it difficult to understand these figures.  I do not happen to have the report of Foras Tionscal with me which would perhaps make it clearer but from the Minister's statement I find it difficult to reconcile the two statements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry dealt at length with the question of tariffs and quotas.  He sounded a note of warning regarding the too rapid reduction of our tariff protection.  It seems that the Party who were once the great protagonists of protection and who came into power largely on the doctrine of absolute and complete protection in every phase of industrial effort, have now veered to the other extreme and become wholesale free traders.  I understand that there will be a reduction of tariffs of 30 per cent on 1st January next and a corresponding increase in quotas.  Even from the other side of the House this has brought a note of warning as regards the possibility of dumping.</P>
    <P>I hold no brief for incompetent industrialists who made no effort to put their house in order at a time when conditions were favourable for dong so in order to meet international economic conditions which they should have seen would arise in the future.  At the same time, I must confess that in recent years they have had to face difficult conditions due largely to Government policy.  The tariff and quota reductions of up to 30 per cent represent quite a handicap on all our industries.  The increased corporation profits tax introduced in the Budget of last year and made retrospective is a severe handicap on <Col N="245" /> them.  The turnover tax and its aftermath, the 12 per cent increase, have also handicapped them.  There has been an increased cost of raw material and in the servicing of industrial equipment. There has been a substantial increase in rates and our last Budget increased the cost of transport, particularly as regards petrol, and also the cost of correspondence and telephones.</P>
    <P>There has been a general increase in the cost of living not completely reflected in the cost of living index figures.  All these difficulties are facing our industrialists at the present time so there is some case to be made for a more careful review of the question of lowering our tariff walls indiscriminately and, perhaps, too rapidly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned that our adverse balance of trade stood at £118 million at 30th of April last. Our balance of trade figures for the first three months of this year have advanced to £33 million.  I do not know if that could be multiplied by four to give a forecast as to what the position will be at the end of the year but it indicates a substantial advance on the previous year.</P>
    <P>The question of our entry into EEC has become hackneyed in this House. We seem to have developed a curiously ambivalent approach to this matter. One time we say that we cannot enter the Common Market unless Britain joins in and another time we say we are to &ldquo;go it alone&rdquo;.  On the Continent, we are &ldquo;going it alone&rdquo; but over here we say that we cannot join unless Britain joins.  We seem to be divided on our economic attitude towards it.  If our progress is to be based on farming we say that we will go into the Common Market shortly but, at the same time, we say that if we do not get in we will be all right too, that our tariff walls will not be reduced so completely and that we will not have to meet the fierce impact of the competition of free trade.  On the other hand, we say that if we get in early it will be of advantage to our farming community.  Either way we cannot lose out.  We have a wonderful adaptability in this country and, if we displayed the same adaptability in <Col N="246" /> trade and commerce, we should be unbeatable.</P>
    <P>It is natural that in a debate on Industry and Commerce, industry and manufactures should be particularly stressed but we must never lose sight of the fact that in spite of all the talk we have about industry, and I do not want to decry it in any way, agriculture is still the sheet anchor of our exports.  If we take the report of Córas Tráchtála, we find that on page 13 the exports for 1962 and 1963 are given carefully.  The exports are given under four headings, live animals, food, drink and tobacco, manufactured goods and raw materials.  The heading food, drink and tobacco covers such items as frozen beef, stout and beer, creamery butter, chocolate crumb, mutton, lamb, dried milk, beef and vegetables.  Some of these are processed products that are basically agricultural and if the two figures are added together: live animals, £50 million, and food, drink and tobacco, £70 million, there is £120 million of our total exports of £193 million.  This shows agriculture is still the fundamental basis of our economy and it has the added importance that most of the commodities do not involve much in the way of imports.  They are primary exports and any expansion of these products is a net gain.  We can always expand our exports if we ignore imports. However, we must always take cognisance of the fact that industrial expansion has to be weighed against the amount of industrial imports it carries and the effect of that upon our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned the question of foreign investment, its quality and type.  He mentioned the question of Canada.  It is true that American investment in Canada has been a source of worry to the Canadians for a number of years.  Mr. Coyne, the President of the Canadian Bank, has been vocal for years about the dangers to the Canadian economy of a complete take-over by American financiers.  I do not know whether we have in our Departments adequate investment data to show how foreign investment in our economy is developing and how investment by our nationals is developing. <Col N="247" /> It would be interesting to know what type of investment has taken place here in the past few years, whether there are figures for the actual items into which foreign money has been going or whether merely broad data are given in relation to investment.</P>
    <P>Inflation is a matter of extreme importance at the present juncture. Inflation means, in effect, too much money chasing too few goods or services. Inflation also means that our productive position deteriorates <i>vis-agrave-vis</i> other countries.  I understand there have recently been consultations between the Foreign Ministers of the EEC countries with a view to controlling inflation in that Community and that they have agreed to a control by taxation.  I understand they have suggested that taxation should increase by five per cent per annum.  Taxation means increased expenditure.  Government expenditure in itself would stimulate inflationary trends.  If that is true and if like measures are forced upon Great Britain, then we must take cognisance of the development.  I understand that there is not an inflationary trend in the United States but it is particularly important for us to watch this trend in Great Britain with which we do 70 to 80 per cent of our trade. If Britain controls an inflationary trend occurring in her economy and if we do not do so here, then our trading position would be seriously adversely affected.</P>
    <P>I have here a report, which every Deputy has received, of the Footwear Adaptation Association.  This is something in which the Minister is interested and he has expressed his disappointment that sufficient use was not made of these adaptation measures over the past year or two by our industrial companies.  This footwear association covers 29 firms with an employment content of 5,800 people, paying out about £3 million per year in salaries and wages, having an export content of £2 million and a total production of £8 million.  Therefore, it is an important industry in our society and particularly important in so far as it uses a considerable amount of native <Col N="248" /> leather.  This industry seems to have made a praiseworthy attempt to come to grips with increasing economic difficulties which the free trade future holds for us.</P>
    <P>In this age of integration, take-over bids and mergers, it is clear that 27 small firms up and down the country could not, on their own, in days of free trade adequately compete with the large combines they would have to face in international trade.  This association seems to have done a very worthwhile job.  A couple of them have merged and have entered upon co-operative effort.  They have established training facilities for some of their operatives and have joined SATRA which is the international advisory body for the shoe industry.  They have established customs clearance and warehouse facilities.  They have also established productivity and fashion committees. These are the lines on which industry of this nature with a small number of units should proceed.  It is a form of co-operation and, apart from actual merging, it is the only way in which they can hope to survive against international competition of a serious nature.  The Minister should again make an effort to encourage industrialists to avail of these adaptation facilities which are there for the asking.  I think he should again point out to them that these loans and special grants for adaptation purposes will terminate next March.</P>

I took up the matter with the local authority, and last February received from them a copy of a report of the chief medical officer giving his opinion that the dump caused a nuisance and was injurious to health. I have since been informed by the urban district council that filling of the water-holes is now complete; that dumping by the council to reclaim the remaining land which has been drained by them, will be necessary for some months to come; that the dumping is being carried on by controlled tipping by an internationally recognised method, but that nuisance is being caused by unauthorised dumping and interference with the dump which is taking place at week-ends and at night when the council workmen are absent. I have suggested to the local authority that they take effective measures to prevent trespass and unauthorised dumping.  I have also asked them for a further report from the chief medical officer.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the number of British postage stamps sold annually at the General Post Office in Dublin; if there is a limit to the number sold to any particular purchaser at one time; if so, what is the limit; and why it is imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of British postage stamps sold at the General Post Office, Dublin, in the year ended <Col N="256" /> 31st May, 1964, was 32,400.  There is a limit of 5d. to the value which may be sold at a time to any one person.  This is because only small stocks are held and also to restrict the use of the stamps for remitting money, for which other services are available. It is not the normal practice for one country to sell the stamps of another; Irish stamps are not available in Britain.  British stamps are sold here as an entirely exceptional arrangement to meet casual requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Bartley) Gerald Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Clonree House was evacuated as officers married quarters by the two last occupants in Eanáir and Aibreán, 1963, it was felt that, in view of its condition and the then estimated cost of necessary repairs, it would no longer be economic to retain it for use as officers married quarters.  Subsequent to its evacuation the matter was again examined in more detail to see whether there was any possibility of having the building repaired at an economic figure to render it suitable for continued use as officers married quarters. This involved much detailed technical investigation and estimation.  It was finally decided in Samhain, 1963, to offer the house and adjoining stables for long lease by public competition.</P>
      <P>The necessary formalities towards the disposal of the property are now nearing completion and it is expected that the property will be advertised in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first information I have received that amendment No. 1 has been ruled out of order.  I cannot see how many amendment making provision about the disposition of the funds received by CIE could possibly be ruled out of order, particularly <Col N="273" /> when a provision which allegedly has to do with the revival of the Irish language is considered to be of relevance to the Transport Bill while a provision which will affect some 600,000 people using the Dublin bus services is ruled out of order.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not yet received it, and he was in the House all day yesterday and all day today. In any event, the House is entitled to an explanation as to why an amendment asking that the profits of the Dublin Transport services be used for the benefit of the users of those services was ruled out of order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter sent to the Deputy informed him that it is long established practice that an amendment to an amending Bill such as this must be relevant to some provision in the Bill as read a Second Time.  The amendment tabled by the Deputy did not satisfy those requirements and was accordingly ruled out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I got this communication from the Chair only ten minutes ago.  It informs me that amendments Nos. 5 and 25 in my name have been ruled out of order.  With respect, Sir, I should like an explanation as to why these amendments have been ruled out of order.  Amendment No. 5 is a simple amendment asking that the Board shall furnish to the Minister such information as he may from time to time require regarding matters which relate to its activities. It would be a great help to the Minister. From what we know of him in the House, the Minister is not apparently able to get any information from the Board.</P>

      <P>Again, the Deputy was informed that it is long established practice in this House that an amendment to an amending <Col N="274" /> Bill such as this must be relevant to some provision in the Bill as read a Second Time.  I would point out to the Deputy that the Bill does not open up for amendment the existing position of CIE <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Oireachtas in relation to the conduct of its undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was put in last week.  I was in the House all day yesterday until 10.30 p.m., and I got this letter only today &mdash;just now as I was coming into this House.  That does not appear to be fair to me at all.  I consider that amendment No. 5 should be allowed to stand.  Section 3 states:</P>
      <P>The Board shall not incur any expenditure that is properly chargeable to capital unless it is satisfied that the expenditure is essential for the efficient operation of its undertaking or that the project in relation to which it is proposed to incur the expenditure will be remunerative to the Board.</P>
      <P>In view of that, I think my amendment is a fair one.</P>

I should also point out that the Bill deals with the financing of Córas Iompair Éireann, redundancy compensation, entry to the clerical grade of CIE, development of property by the Board and some other minor matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I may be a bit more fortunate than the others who have raised this matter of the exclusion of these amendments. I was informed about an hour ago of this.  I want to say, within the rules of order, to you that I think it is reasonable that we who are the victims of this continuous campaign of being ruled out of order, particularly in reference to this Minister and this Department, so far as amendments and questions are concerned, should have a public explanation in the House for the benefit of the people outside the House.  I cannot circularise everybody in my constituency, nor can I afford the time or the money to do it, to let them know what has happened to my particular amendment which reads:</P>
      <P>Córas Iompair Éireann shall institute a system of reduced morning and evening fares for persons going to or returning from their places of employment.</P>
      <P>That is a vital matter which the public would expect would be discussed on this Bill.  I am privately informed, an hour before this debate, that discussion will not be allowed upon that amendment.  How am I to convey that to the electorate?  There should be a public statement in the House in regard to these amendments and, with all due respect, Sir, I do not think that the explanation given by the Chair fits the situation.</P>
      <P>I may say, with all due respect to you and to the Chair, that we are being asked to provide a colossal sum &mdash;£2 million&mdash;which must surely affect every aspect of the running of CIE and here we are being denied an opportunity to talk about this industry which is vital to the nation.  We are being denied once again the chance to say what is in the minds of the people outside.</P>

This Bill is described as &ldquo;an Act to make further provision in relation to transport&rdquo;. I respectfully say the amendments to which Deputies T. Lynch and S. Dunne have referred and the amendments in the names of Deputy Byrne, Deputy Reynolds and myself&mdash;the one dealing with the Dublin services and the one which says that it shall be the duty of the Board to convey old age pensioners on scheduled passenger transport services of the Board free of charge&mdash;are matters which relate to the making of further provision in relation to transport.  We are pressing this point and I am sure I am speaking for certain of my colleagues when I say that if you rule against us in this matter, the Committee Stage will proceed under protest and the Minister will have to await the further Stages of this Bill until such time as another tribunal, a proper tribunal, has determined whether or not the Chair's ruling in this matter is right.</P>

My calculation is £17 million with whatever is the undetermined expenditure covered by paragraph (5), that is, the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of the expenses incurred in the administration of the Act.  Certainly there is £17 million clear covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances, I, with other Deputies, thought we had better have <Col N="278" /> a new orientation towards the Minister in respect of the expenditure of these moneys, and I put down an amendment which you ruled out of order, that is, amendment No. 4, to the effect that the House should be informed from time to time on such matters as the Minister would require information on in order to keep Deputies informed and, through Deputies, to keep the public informed.</P>
    <P>Under section 3, the Board is not to incur any expenditure that is properly chargeable to capital.  How are we to investigate that?  If we ask questions, we will be told certain things are day-to-day administration and will not be permitted for discussion.  As Deputy Ryan has pointed out, this is an Act to make further provision in relation to transport and one of the prohibitions now is that the Board is not to charge expenditure to capital unless it is satisfied that the expenditure is required for the efficient operation of the undertaking or else that the expenditure will be remunerative.  Again, how are we to know that?  If questions are asked here with regard to expenditure, say, on a big number of lorries, and a refusal is given in the House to an application for information on that matter, how are we to know whether the judgment of the Board is to be accepted as to whether it is remunerative or not, unless we can ask these questions?</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I put down this amendment that we should have such information from the Minister as might be required to keep members of either House informed of the activities of the Board; in other words, to inquire whether it is properly chargeable to capital and whether it is remunerative.</P>

I am making these points in order to ask you to withdraw the ruling that my amendment, No. 4, is out of order.</P>

      <P>Could we deal with the Ministerial amendment to section 3 and the Deputy can then proceed to discuss his point on <Col N="280" /> section 3.  Amendment No. 6&mdash;the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 24, after &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or to enable it to carry out the general duty imposed on it by subsection (1) of section 7 of the Act of 1958&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the course of the Second Stage debate in Dáil Éireann, Deputy Casey suggested that the provisions of section 3 might be interpreted to prohibit capital expenditure by the Board on the restoration and maintenance of long stretches of permanent way, sections of the railway which are not making a profit, or on the provision of better office accommodation and facilities for the staff, and similar views were expressed by Deputy Corish and Deputy Mullen.  I also met the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on this matter and they were worried about the actual statement in the section and so I am moving this amendment so that it relates section 3 to subsection (1) of section 7 of the 1958 Act which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It shall be the general duty of the Board to provide reasonable, efficient and economical transport services with due regard to safety of operation, the encouragement of national economic development and the maintenance of reasonable conditions of employment for its employees.</P>
      <P>The amendment therefore relates the general purpose of the section to that subsection of the 1958 Act and thus ensures that the capital can be spent when required for the proper maintenance of the system, for the restoration of the system, and that capital can be provided, if necessary, for social purposes within CIE for the improvement of social conditions within CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment goes some way to meet some of the objections made by Deputies of this Party. I note that the Minister referred to section 7 of the 1958 Act and said that CIE were charged with promoting general economic development in the <Col N="281" /> country.  I think I heard the Minister correctly in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The encouragement of national economic development and the maintenance of reasonable conditions of employment for its employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That satisfies me.  I am sure that in this whole matter the Minister is concerned with maintaining employment as far as he can in, for example, the workshops of CIE, and I would say therefore that under section 7 of the 1958 Act, CIE must have regard to the value of employment in the workshops.  The Minister, however, is aware that CIE have told the trade unions recently that from September next until January, 1966, they propose to construct 255 single-deck buses but that the parts for the construction of these will be in an imported condition &mdash; I understand the term is a &ldquo;completely knocked down condition&rdquo;&mdash;and that from the latter part of 1965 to March, 1967, the company propose to construct 120 double-deck buses and the material for these will also be in a completely knocked down condition.  The Minister must also be aware of CIE's responsibility for maintaining employment and the desirability of doing all the work that can be done in their own workshops in this particular regard.</P>
      <P>I am informed that CIE have told the trade unions that between 50 and 100 operatives will be dismissed by reason of this action by CIE.  I know the Minister has been made aware of this and I should like the Minister's observations about the desirability of assembling and constructing buses and importing parts from abroad concurrent with the proposed dismissal of some 50 to 100 men.  The Minister and CIE have a responsibility in this matter to maintain employment where it is possible to do this work in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter will really arise more appropriately on the sections relating to redundancy but, if Deputy Corish would like me to deal with it now, I will.  The decision to import the bus bodies in a completely knocked down condition is a departure from previous <Col N="282" /> practice but it is only as regards the main framing of the bus body and the introduction of a quantity of fibre-glass into the design, and the outer panelling and inner trimming and finishing of the bodies will be carried out in the usual way as before.  I gather that this is the result of worldwide changes in the techniques of bus design and manufacture and will enable CIE to incorporate up-to-date design and methods without being involved in prohibitive re-tooling costs. It is one of these inevitable productivity operations which are taking place in all parts of industry.  In so far as redundancy may take place within the staff, there naturally will be negotiations between the trade unions and CIE.  I would hope that we have reached the stage now where it may be possible for some of these men to be transferred to other parts of CIE and that re-training can be arranged for them.  As the Deputy knows, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has already received a report from the CIO about re-training in industry consequent on new productivity methods.  I think this comes within the ambit of those matters. In any event, CIE will certainly be negotiating with the trade unions with regard to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not entirely satisfactory from my point of view. The Minister says that the modern trend is to engage in a different type of construction and introduce fibre-glass into certain parts of the bus bodies and that we have to do this in the name of progress.  Is it absolutely necessary to do all these things when it means the disemployment of anything up to 100 people?  I do not know what reply the Minister will give us on the section dealing with redundancy but it was pointed out on the Second Stage that there was no suggestion&mdash;and I do not think there was any suggestion in the Minister's reply, either&mdash;that there would be redundancy compensation where men were displaced from workshops. It is not set out specifically in the Bill. It does not appear to us that there is any redundancy compensation in a matter such as that.  These workers <Col N="283" /> in the CIE workshops who have been engaged in the construction of buses, especially in the Spa Road workshops, have been complimented on their high degree of workmanship.  I do not think the Minister should condone, or appear to condone, the disemployment of so many workers in the name of what is to me in any case doubtful progress.</P>
      <P>The buses plying around the country seem to be satisfactory and are most attractive and mechanically they seem to be pretty good.  Why we should in our present stage of development try to ape or copy the buses plying in the USA, Germany, France or Great Britain I cannot imagine.  One of the fundamentals at present is to ensure that men will not be disemployed.  I am not impressed either by the Minister's assurance that his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has proposals for re-training and compensating and all that sort of thing.  He, too, has been questioned about his proposals in regard to workers who will be rendered redundant by reason of anything the Government may do in preparation for our entry into the European Economic Community but he has not been specific.</P>
      <P>I believe that we should not allow this sort of thing to happen, no matter what the results may be.  We should not be importing buses in any condition at all.  We have too many unemployed in this country and there has been serious redundancy in CIE.  If the Minister can give me an assurance that these men will be placed in other sections of CIE, I will be satisfied but he has not given us any such assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister answer Deputy Corish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given Deputies full information on this subject. I would say that the buses which we have in this country need replacement badly and I would also say that we need the most modern type of bus that can be found at whatever cost is reasonable.  The competition between buses and people travelling together in motor cars is going to become more intense and unless we have buses <Col N="284" /> produced by the most economic means and in the most up-to-date manner we can get, the only result will be a decline in the numbers travelling by bus.  You may have possible reduction in employment for drivers, conductors and maintenance men on the one hand, and the possibility of some reduction in assembly, on the other.  This is something that is going on all over the world.  The more rapid the growth in the economy, the more substantial are the changes in techniques in industry.</P>
      <P>CIE have agreed to enter into discussions with the trade unions as to what steps will be taken in the event of redundancy but it is impossible for me to say what arrangements for transfer will be made and also, if the economy advances, what demand there will be for people trained as fitters and vehicle builders.  The Deputy has referred to extensive unemployment but I would argue that there is no very extensive unemployment among skilled workers in Dublin.  In some sectors of industry in Dublin, there is good employment; in others, there may be occasional unemployment; but the Deputy has only to look at the figures given each month by the Central Statistics Office to see that the situation has changed very much for the better as compared with five or ten years ago.  I do not think we need be unduly alarmed about this matter while the workers have the right to negotiate with CIE about the position.</P>
      <P>I could not restrict the advance of modern design in bus building.  I feel it is absolutely essential for CIE to have the most modern and up-to-date buses that can be obtained at a reasonable cost and I know that the new buses coming from CIE are much more advanced that those of previous years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said it is necessary for him to use new techniques in order to save money. Does the Minister mean that the new techniques should enable him to introduce buses that are too long?  CIE bought buses that were 36 feet long while all the time 30 feet was the legal length of the buses allowed to travel the roads of this country.  The Minister's colleague in the Department of <Col N="285" /> Local Government made an order legalising that purchase.  I put down a question to the Minister about the matter and he would not answer it. Now he is getting the result of that.</P>

      <P>Why do we have to import buses even partially assembled, as appears to be the case?  What is the meaning of the term: &ldquo;completely knocked down&rdquo;?  Why could we not import the material and build the buses from the ground up?  I assume the new buses to be acquired will be something of the type we have brought over from England and which have been travelling around the roads in the south county for the past month or so.  If that is so, there appears to be some doubt as to whether these will carry baby-carriages and prams.  It is said that they are incapable of this. This may seem to be a light matter for some people here but it is not a light matter for the people of Ballyfermot where, thank God, they have the largest baby population in the country.  I would like an assurance that these people's prams and baby-carriages can be carried on the new buses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

I do not believe that any change in the type of bus will alter the extent to which these people can be facilitated.  In regard to the question of assembly, this is a result of a worldwide change in the technique of bus design and it enables CIE to keep up with this design without having to undergo an extensive re-tooling process the cost of which would be very high. I could not give the cost of any particular type of bus but Deputies will be well aware of the enormous cost of a re-tooling process.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that CIE will do its best.  Many years ago it was said that CIE would do its best to make the undertaking pay.  Now we are being asked for £17 million for CIE.  That is what CIE means by doing its best.  There was a limit imposed, I expect, after consideration of safety on the roads, on the length of buses to be allowed.  CIE apparently bought buses longer than the maximum length allowed and an amendment had to be made on an order by the Minister for Local Government in respect of that. Previously, as we know from questions to the Minister here which were not replied to, CIE bought engines which would only run backwards.  All information on these matters was refused, the Minister saying this was day-to-day administration.  The Minister has introduced an amendment which brings into the section that the Board is still under obligation to run an economic and efficient system.  How <Col N="287" /> would we know that?  How would we know what capital expenditure is properly incurred?  How would we know what capital expenditure is likely to be remunerative to the Board unless we are entitled to ask questions on that matter?  Is the Minister now opening the door to us in that respect, so that when questions are put here, after section 3 and particularly after the amendment is carried, he will indicate why it is properly incurred capital expenditure and why the capital expenditure is likely to be remunerative?</P>
      <P>The Minister said that there is no shortage of employment for skilled workers.  Are we getting back to the old days when, if I remember them, railway employment was so secure that railway employees were not asked to subscribe to unemployment insurance? Their occupation was regarded as so good that they would never get any benefit from unemployment insurance. Does the Minister state we are getting back to that stage?  Will he tell me, when he said the other day that 900 people have been declared redundant in CIE, whether they are people he would regard as being unskilled?</P>

I was merely indicating that, by and large, CIE has been successful in negotiating with the trade unions in regard to these important matters and I hope, as a result of the improvement in relations that has taken place recently and the improvement in the method of negotiation, they will have further success. I am not committing myself to making any specific statement in regard to any particular group of men who may be found redundant in CIE in the future.  I was just giving the general trend.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is under an illusion about this.  As the Deputy knows, there are quota restrictions in regard to motor assembly. CIE will be bound by the quota restrictions and import duties which apply to the whole of the motor car industry. They will be no different from the other assembly plants.  They are putting themselves in line with that.  They are merely taking the advantage of whatever degree of importation is permitted for the general motor car industry.  They are not seeking to assemble here and there is no alteration in the general quota system or in the general import duty system.  They will be in exactly the same position as other motor car assemblers.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been asked whether the death-knell has been sounded for coach building in Inchicore.  He told me yesterday 42 buses were brought into service at 31st March, 1964, at a cost of £455,000.  It took three months to get that information from the Minister. What I want the Minister to tell me now is whether the figure that appeared in the <i>Evening Herald</i> two weeks ago of £900,000 for the purchase of buses in the past 12 months was correct or not.  If we are to continue purchasing these buses from the Leyland Company, the Leyland Leopard and the Worldmaster, why should they not be brought in here in a knocked-condition to be assembled?</P>

      <P>The Minister has not answered the question.  He has only half answered the question.  He said the bodies were brought in, glass fibre and so on.  I am talking about the <Col N="290" /> actual chassis.  The Minister gave us no information about that.  Is it a fact that they were brought in, ready to go without needing anything to be done to them?  Believe it or not, I can give credit to the Minister and CIE in one respect.  The Minister's area manager invited me and some other people last Monday to see some new coaches at Waterford railway station.  They were magnificent and I was delighted to hear they were built entirely in Inchicore. This is what I want to know. If they are still able to build five coaches in Inchicore, why is the Minister bringing in these buses with the coachwork almost finished?  These men only screw it together.  Could the Minister not make a recommendation to CIE, as he has told us he is responsible for CIE, that in future the designers and the fine coachbuilders at Inchicore be given a chance of building the bodies for the buses entirely in the works?</P>

      <P>It appears from the Minister's statement on this section that CIE intend to modernise their bus fleet and everybody agrees that is a good policy, even though it may be very costly.  We should have first-class buses are not constructed in this country.  It is a reflection on Irish industrial development that we must import these buses in a knocked-down condition.  The Minister should again consult the Board of CIE with a view to getting these buses constructed <i>in toto</i> here.  Otherwise, it is a reflection, as it suggests we cannot do that work.  I am sure there are men capable of building these buses here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with modernising the bus fleet but I want to know from the Minister, if this section is approved, will we have an opportunity of discussing the purchase of these buses in the House subsequently, or will we be told by the Minister that he has no function in the matter?

      <P>The section reads:</P>
      <P>The Board shall not incur any expenditure that is properly chargeable to capital unless it is satisfied that the expenditure is essential for the efficient operation of its undertaking or that the project in relation to which it is proposed to incur the expenditure will be remunerative to the Board.</P>
      <P>This has been amended by amendment No. 6 to this extent:</P>
      <P>... after &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or to enable it to carry out the general duty imposed on it by subsection (1) of section 7 of the Act of 1958&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Herein is contained, I submit, the fundamental philosophy which has motivated every action of the Government towards CIE.  The sole yardstick, as far as I can judge, the Government ever applied to the operation of CIE is one of economic profitability.  This is where we in the Labour Party disagree with the Government's attitude towards public transport.  It is not good enough that CIE should be regarded in the same light as that in which one would regard a private company operating in a commercial fashion with the principal motive of acquiring as much profit as it can for its owners and shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE is the property of the nation and its first function is to serve the nation by providing a transport system. <Col N="294" /> If that can be done economically, well and good.  If it can be done through the medium of trying to balance the budget, well and good.  But, if we are to sacrifice the public good purely for the sake of being able to say we have narrowed the gap so far as deficit is concerned, while, at the same time, depriving the people of transport, that is no good whatsoever to the people. Not alone that but it is in direct conflict with all progressive thought in the matter of transport and in the matter of public services.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very fond of referring to trends abroad in the world and to what is happening in other countries. Very often many of these references on his part have no relevance whatsoever to this country.  The sectors of our economy, to use the abominable modern phrase now universally accepted, which compare with those of other countries are few and far between.  We have a very different proposition here from what they have across the water, on the continent, or elsewhere.  Leaving that aside for the moment, there is no country in the world in which it has been found possible to make transport pay, to my knowledge anyway, and we can hardly be expected to do it here.  Inherent in this section, however, is the proposition that the Board must so operate that every act it does must be governed by the question of cost and the public good is not mentioned at all except in a general, meaningless way in a reference to previous Acts.  When I refer to the public good, I refer to the possibility, for instance, that there may come to the Board of Córas Iompair Éireann at some time in the future, perhaps with a change of Minister, perhaps with a change of administrators in CIE, the notion that the people of Dublin deserve justice in the matter of fares.  It must eventually dawn upon some Minister for Transport&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The people of this city are long overdue a fair deal in this matter.  I shall not push it further than that, except to say that it would be wrong for us in the Labour Party to let the section go without a protest against it, because, at some stage, the Minister, or some of his aides, will be sufficiently active to discover that we have no such <Col N="296" /> intention.  We will watch this Bill and every act of the Minister to ensure that we express, in so far as we are allowed to do so, the views of the Labour Party and the views of the ordinary people who have to put up with a great deal from CIE.</P>

Am I to assume that in particular areas where transport does not pay services will be withdrawn, as they were withdrawn in the Schull-Goleen area?  We are asked here to provide money to the tune of £2 millions to subsidise CIE. That £2 millions will be drawn from the people of the country as a whole. Everyone is asked to pay his or her share of taxation to meet the CIE demands on the Exchequer, but, in some section, where the Minister indicates that a loss is shown on the operation of CIE services, those services will be withdrawn.  I am not now dealing with rail services.  They have been dealt with here in great detail already. I am dealing with bus services.

In fact, it is not so at all.  The Long Title is &ldquo;to make further provision in relation to transport&rdquo;.  Part of the further provision is apparently contained in section 3, apart from the amendment, which I shall deal with particularly. Apart from the amendment, which has, apparently, been accepted, two points arise on the section.  One is whether certain expenditure is, first of all, chargeable to capital or whether it is essential for the efficient operation of the undertaking and, the second, whether the project in relation to which it is proposed to incur the expenditure is remunerative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of being remunerative, amendments have been mentioned calling for the institution of a system of reduced morning and evening fares for persons going to or returning from their places of employment. Surely that arises from the matter of remuneration?  It is well known that both Aer Lingus and Aerlínte offer seats at very reduced rates to certain special passengers. Those passengers may not take up the seats unless there are no other occupants for them.  In other words, Aer Lingus and Aerlínte believe it to be remunerative to carry certain people at one-tenth of the ordinary charge if certain conditions prevail. Is that the sort of thing CIE would ever bring under consideration, that they might have empty buses at certain non-peak hours and it might <Col N="299" /> be possible for them to get passengers at reduced rates&mdash;people going to or from their work?  Surely that would come under the heading of whether or not the expenditure is remunerative?</P>
    <P>The second matter that arises on this&mdash;possibly it could be dealt with by way of question&mdash;is whether expenditure chargeable to capital is required for the efficient operation of the undertaking.  Surely, on that, it would be possible for Deputies to make inquiries as to what the expenditure is likely to be in amount and how far it will be remunerative and whether it is required for the efficient running of the undertaking?</P>
    <P>I did not know until I heard it from Deputies that certain buses are so constructed that there is no room in them for prams and for the carriages used for the conveyance of small children.  Surely that is a matter that should be inquired into?  Would it not help the efficiency of the undertaking that places be provided in buses for prams and a baby carriages? Would not one be entitled to query whether capital expenditure on a bus without such accommodation for children was a proper capital charge and whether it would assist the efficiency of the undertaking?</P>
    <P>I hold these things are open to examination.  Even though an amendment has been ruled out of order asking that a system of reduced morning and evening fares for persons going to or from work be instituted, it seems to be quite open, after this section is passed in its restricted form, to query what public services CIE might be asked to run for special people at special hours and, secondly, whether or not they should be asked to see their buses will give the accommodation that might be required for children in thickly populated areas.</P>
    <P>In any event, the whole situation has changed as between this Bill and the 1950 Act, and even since the 1958 Act. Up to 1958 there was the pretence, maintained by the Minister's refusal to answer questions, that CIE was going to meet its obligations without any subvention from the taxpayer.  We <Col N="300" /> have abandoned all that.  CIE is now carrying on what amounts to a social welfare service.  It is no longer an economic transport undertaking.  It is dependent on the taxpayer.  By this very big enlargement of the restricted Transports Acts up to this, I suggest Deputies have an enlarged area of inquiry as to what CIE is doing under social welfare conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section, as amended, imposes an obligation on the Board to consider the encouragement of national economic development.  Therefore, it seems proper to us in Fine Gael to allow the House to consider a number of aspects of public transport and the manner in which they affect economic development.  One of the greatest problems affecting about 300,000 people who want to avail of the facilities offered by CIE is the lack of facilities provided for those people. I am concerned particularly with people within a radius of two or three miles of Dublin city centre and taking a radius of about five miles.  There is a wheel around Dublin city about two miles in width in which people find it extremely difficult to board buses going to or from their work. This is keeping many working people late for their daily employment and is thus having a grave effect on the economic development of Dublin. CIE and the Minister have consistently refused to tackle this matter and give it serious consideration.  The continued growth of Dublin, with consequential extension of routes of up to eight miles from the city centre, has meant that people who reside halfway on those routes find it extremely difficult to board buses.  Indeed, the extension of the 5-day week and the increase in the number of people commencing work daily at 9 a.m. and completing work at 5.30 p.m. will multiply that difficulty in the years immediately ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to us in Fine Gael and to all Dublin Deputies that CIE has failed entirely to consider this problem and to attempt to solve it.  It will have to acquire additional vehicles for its transport fleet if this difficulty is to be overcome.  Even though that may mean there will be a large number of <Col N="301" /> vehicles lying idle for the remainder of the day, if we are to move with the times and meet the needs of these people, we will have to accept the additional capital liability, particularly when we have increased the peak and valley periods.  That is what we are doing by allowing the extension of uniform hours of working from 9 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>The difficulty we have in giving powers like this to CIE is that CIE may interpret them in an extremely narrow sense.  It is because it has done so that the transport facilities the people have a right to expect are not being provided.  It is important that the difficulties people experience in relation to public transport should be voiced in this House so that the Board will appreciate how they are failing in the duty which we, as legislators, have imposed on them.</P>
    <P>It seems most undesirable that we should be taking away work from the Dublin coachbuilders.  There is a long and honourable tradition of coachbuilding in Dublin.  We have been among some of the best coachbuilders in the world.  The coachbuilding works at Spa Road has built up its own tradition over its half-century of experience. I do not believe it is beyond the capacity of the engineers, coachbuilders and designers of Dublin to devise some means of producing reasonably cheap, safe and efficient coach work.  I do not at all accept the Minister's contention that it is necessary to import so many of these vehicles in an almost completed state. There are many ways in which coaches and buses can be built and there is no necessity for this country to follow slavishly whatever practice may exist elsewhere.  We ought to endeavour to use our own equipment and our own talents.  This is part of the duty which the Board should try to discharge under their obligation to encourage national economic development.</P>
    <P>The question of the facilities which are to be offered to the people who want to travel by CIE also comes within the general description of national economic development.  It is surely a part of national economic development that we should try to <Col N="302" /> extend public transport services to all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan has referred to the practice which apparently has been accepted as being respectable in air transport of offering cheaper fares at off periods.  To some extent, this principle has been accepted in Dublin by having a cheaper rate of a twopenny trip during the valley periods. It would appear to be equally arguable that CIE ought to have cheaper facilities for all persons offering during valley periods, but, if CIE think that is going too far, we feel that certainly CIE should have cheaper fares or no fares at all for old age pensioners who would travel during the valley periods.  This would not be imposing any additional strain on CIE finances because, as things are at the moment, the cost of public transport is so great that it discourages and prevents old people from travelling at all.</P>

When the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was in the House, he ruled discussion out of order on the amendment put forward about reduced morning and evening fares for persons going to or returning from their places of employment.

      <P>A good thing cannot be repeated too often and, if repetition embarrasses the Minister, then he will either have to suffer or give up the portfolio. I do not think transport would suffer if he did hand it in tomorrow. It would become more efficient.  We accept the pattern of general economic development when we extend public services to all sections of the community and, if we accept that as a valid principle, as we do here, then the provision of transport for all sections of the community falls within the ambit of the obligation which lies on the Board.  If this House is indicating that this obligation must be carried out in a generous way and if the Board do not carry it out in a generous way, it will be the Minister, and the Minister alone, who prevents CIE from carrying out the wishes of this House and the Minister will have to accept responsibility for that and will have to submit to continued questions and criticisms by Deputies if he is the person who continually holds back the Board from carrying out the wishes of the people.</P>

      <P>Could this section be interpreted later on by the Board as precluding them from providing services which they would deem uneconomic?  For instance, the Board <Col N="304" /> may say that under section 3 of this Bill, they are not allowed to invest capital in providing a service which, in their opinion, would not show a profit.  We know from our experience of the 1958 Act the type of interpretation that CIE may be likely to give to sections of this Bill, so we must be very cautious in our approach in this House.  Could CIE use this section in reply to representations that may be made?  If I or interested parties in west Cork were to make representations to the Board subsequent to this section becoming law for resumption of a bus service which existed up to a short time ago on the Schull-Goleen route, could CIE say that under section 3 of the Transport Bill, 1964, it was precluded from providing capital towards that service, that the Act specifically precluded it from doing so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have criticised the Minister for Transport and Power on a number of occasions.  At the same time, I have a certain admiration for him.  I felt that even though his statements might have been unfounded, the Minister believed in his statements.  I was surprised that in his reply to assertions made by me on the Second Reading of this Bill the Minister was untruthful.  I will not say that he was deliberately untruthful, because I feel that he was not, but I must say that so far as this particular route is concerned, which is of great significance to the part of the country from which I come, and to which the Minister addressed himself on Second Reading, he indicated a weekly loss of £12.  That figure is far in excess of the figure I gave in this House and which I and my colleagues got officially from CIE.  We were told that the loss on this route was up to £8 weekly.  It is the general belief that the loss was not even £8 weekly.  When the Minister came to reply in the House he used the figure £12 weekly. I am not saying that the Minister intended to be untruthful but I wonder did CIE, in order to support his argument against providing a service on this route, deliberately inflate the figure and hand the Minister his brief setting down a figure of £12 weekly.  If so, they are not a company <Col N="305" /> which could command our respect if, in support of their attitude in the withdrawal of the services on this route, they told the Minister a deliberate untruth and thereby led the Minister into making an untruthful statement in this House, a statement which is contrary to the official information which the three members of the Dáil from Cork South-West got officially from CIE.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to review this matter.  I should like, in particular, him to answer the question I posed at the outset as to whether or not anything contained in section 3 of this Bill could be used subsequently by CIE as an argument against providing a service which in its opinion may not be economic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the character of the Dublin bus services, I have already dealt with that in detail on the Second Stage of the Bill.  I pointed out that congestion in the Dublin bus services relates to a number of factors.  If Deputies will read the Pacemaker Report, Volume 2, they will see an analysis of the time lag for buses passing during peak hours at various points in Dublin at different hours in the day.  They will note that, although it is true that the present changes in the use of the roads in Dublin have improved the position, if the number of buses was very largely increased during peak hours, it might not have any effect in regard to solving the position of people waiting for buses.  I said that, and I also pointed out that CIE is now engaging in the process of reorganising its Dublin bus services.  It is establishing a traffic control centre in O'Connell Street and decentralising traffic inspectors, putting in more time clocks to control the movements of buses and generally undertaking a reorganisation of the service.  Naturally when traffic rules in regard to one-way streets are altered, the whole pattern of bus services has to be re-examined and CIE has this question of congestion constantly in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question that was raised was about bus fares.  It would be quite impracticable to offer reduced <Col N="306" /> fares to workers going to and from their place of employment and to identify them would be difficult.  Where this practice has been tried out, the position now is they are trying to get rid of it.  It is far better to establish a sound economy and to have such a level of wages that people can afford to travel to work by bus or in whatever vehicle is appropriate.</P>
    <P>I do not need to give again the figures in relation to increased bus fares, increased social service levels, the increase in the cost of living and the increase in workers' earnings over the past five or six years.  If Deputies go back to a previous Estimate speech, they will find the relationship of these various things to one another and which have a very human significance. It can be said in general that the prosperity of the people is growing and that to try to arrange special fares for special sections is not the best way to do it; the way to do it is to have bus services as efficient as possible, to provide fares for school children and to provide valley fares at particular times. That seems to be the simplest way of dealing with the matter in general.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy raised the question of the Goleen and Schull bus services. I am afraid it would be quite impossible if we were to have continuous debates on the existence or closing of every individual bus service in the country.  You could take up the whole time of the House if you had questions like that discussed.  It is my responsibility and I am prepared to take full responsibility to see that CIE which is now subsidised by the State relates social needs to economic services in a proper manner.  I am not going to judge the issue by individual isolated complaints which are made.  I have to judge the issue as a whole, of how far the rest of the people can be asked to pay a tax in order to support any bus service.  This is a question of watching a general trend, seeing whether complaints multiply, whether there is a great volume of complaint in a particular area.  It is my job to exercise a general supervision in that matter.  I take full responsibility in this House for any deficiencies in the <Col N="307" /> services of CIE which are the result of my failing to hold a general supervisory position over the provision of services by CIE.</P>
    <P>Having said that, there obviously must be some limit to the number of bus services provided.  It is quite obvious that CIE could double its services all over the country and you could find one or two or three people going into a bus and the bill before this House would be absolutely enormous. I and my Department have studied the report of CIE on this matter and in relation to the provincial road passenger services, of which there are 234, two-thirds yield an annual revenue of less than £5,000 and account for only 15 per cent of the total revenue in this section.  Of this figure, 73 services are wholly profitable, nine are marginally profitable and the remaining 152 are unprofitable. Generally the short distance services are the least profitable.</P>
    <P>Taking it large and wide, if that statement is studied, it will be seen that the social need with regard to the provincial bus services is not being ignored.  I do not think the existence or the non-existence of a particular country bus service can be looked at in isolation from the general pattern or from the volume of private transport which is constantly growing.  I do not believe the bus services are second-class. Taking it large and wide again, the pattern of bus services in the cities and the country is fairly satisfactory in so far as we can compare it with other countries.  I have examined map routes of buses in other countries; I have examined the bus structure in rural areas of Scotland; and I have had talks with the head of the Highland Bus Company in order to get some comparative idea of the extent to which social need is satisfied.  I believe it is satisfied fairly well by the present bus service.  In so far as my responsibility in this House is concerned, as I said before, if I started to get a great many complaints from people and on examining these complaints found that the social needs were not being provided for adequately, I would have to <Col N="308" /> see CIE and discuss the matter.  That seems to me to be a reasonable statement.</P>
    <P>There is one further point.  I note that there is now a definite cleavage of opinion between Deputies of the Labour Party and of Fine Gael.  The members of Fine Gael are very much alarmed at the total provision of capital and subsidies to the tune of £17 million, whereas Deputy Dunne implied that even though we are providing £2 million a year, CIE, and I as Minister supervising this expenditure, still have the idea that CIE should pay its way.  I do not see how CIE can pay its way if it is subsidised to the tune of £2 million but I know that £2 million is a considerable impost on the taxpayer, and I should like very much when any proposals for great reductions in the fares are made by Deputies that they would vote for the increased money involved.  As I indicated, we can examine the level of the subsidies later.  It is impossible to make an absolute comparison of subsidies for transport services, but so far as we can get an approximate comparison we find that the subsidy afforded to CIE comes within the higher echelons of subsidies to transport companies in Europe.  In other words, by any method of comparison, it is a fairly high subsidy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that he takes full responsibility in this House for CIE but the test of responsibility is the capacity to be questioned and to give satisfactory answers.  The Minister has had that responsibility for years and the way he has evaded it is by getting the aid of the Chair and the House to base its rulings on the phrase &ldquo;day-to-day administration is to be excluded&rdquo;.  If the Minister will answer questions for the future, very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tells us that CIE has to be made remunerative.  This Bill is a confession that it cannot be made remunerative.  There is at least £2 million lacking in what would be necessary to make it remunerative.  The Minister has failed to answer Deputy Murphy's very particular question as to whether it will be possible hereafter <Col N="309" /> for the Minister to say that a service is not remunerative.  I think it is quite clear that in the future the Minister will not be able to say that a service is not remunerative.  It is not he that will say whether it is remunerative or not but the Board of CIE.  The Bill says that the Board shall not incur expenditure properly chargeable to capital unless it is satisfied that it is essential to efficient operation or that the project will be remunerative to the Board.</P>
    <P>That means that we are putting this whole question outside the control of the House.  Whenever a question is raised, the ruling of the Chair will be that the Minister has no function in the matter.  The Chair will rule under this section that the Board must be satisfied that the expenditure is essential to efficient operation or that the project will be remunerative.  How does the Minister propose to get between the Board and this House? He has evaded responsibility all along the line and this section provides him with a better opportunity than ever to evade responsibility still further.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not answered my question on section 3.  I must confess that I was under a complete misapprehension as far as the proposal to close the Schull-Goleen section is concerned.  I will never have an opportunity of saying this again and for that reason I propose to address myself briefly to it.  I understood that it was CIE closed this bus route but I now interpret the Minister as saying that it was he closed it.</P>

      <P>You said you took full responsibility for it.  So far as the Minister is concerned, there is no social need for this bus service to Goleen.  It does not earn a profit.  But it would be difficult for it to be profitable because no parish in Ireland has suffered more from emigration.  Within the past ten years, more than 600 people left that parish for England and even more will leave if things go <Col N="310" /> on as they are.  It is completely out of place for the national transport body of this country to remove this bus service from the most extreme parish in this country.  As a Dáil representative for the area and as a person living within a few miles of Goleen, I want to protest vehemently against the Minister's attitude in this matter.</P>
      <P>On the Second Stage of the Bill, I appealed to the Minister to review the position and I told him on that occasion that it was not constitutionally right to deny to these people services that are provided from the national funds.  They are as much entitled to retain this service as are any of the people living on the 152 other mainly unprofitable routes the Minister mentioned here.  He said that there were 152 other mainly unprofitable routes. Why should Goleen be picked out and the other 73 left in?  If one were to judge impartially, it would be all right to say that we cannot continue to pay a subsidy to CIE and that so we must wipe out the unprofitable routes but a large number of these are to be retained. That is what this Bill is for.</P>
      <P>If CIE were a paying concern, there would be no need for the Board to come along here and ask for a subvention amounting to £33 million as between 1958 and 1968.  As things are going, they may have to increase on that.  I am making the case that it is not constitutional for CIE to withdraw a service from a parish such as Goleen which has enjoyed that service up to the present.  At the same time, the people of that parish must contribute their share of that £2 million annually, plus the million pounds being written off under this Bill.  I am appealing to the Minister to address himself to the question of the closure of the bus service to the parish of Goleen.  It may be a short route and it may not be used extensively but, from every point of view, the parish of Goleen is entitled to have its bus service restored.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Coughlan.  The Minister has belittled the House.  We come in here as responsible representatives of our constituents. We come in here to pass a vote of £2 million a year for CIE.  Of course the Minister considers that £75,000 is only small beer.  We come here to ask him to break his silence. He is like a fortress there.  He will not allow us to ask any questions about anything.  This is a very serious matter. If Deputies are to be stopped from asking Ministers questions about companies for which they are responsible or in which the Ministers are share-holders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If you bear with me a little while, I shall explain.  We had the example some time ago of a company in which a Minister was a big shareholder and practically had a responsibility, and nobody could ask a question about it in the House.  Terrible things were happening inside that company, so much so that a brave servant of that company had to sacrifice himself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that this has nothing to do with the section?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It has something to do with this section, which reads:</P>
      <P>The Board shall not incur any expenditure that is properly chargeable to capital unless it is satisfied that the expenditure is essential for the efficient operation of its undertaking or that the project in relation to which it is proposed to incur the expenditure will be remunerative to the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can never find out anything about that and, that being so, the same thing can happen.  This is the most serious thing that has happened since I came into this House ten years ago.  The <Col N="313" /> Minister is standing over that.  I make no accusations against the officials in Kingsbridge.  However, it is possible for the same thing to happen there as happened in respect of the company I have mentioned.  It should not be expected that some brave public servant will have to sacrifice himself, lose his job, in order to let the people outside know what is happening.</P>
    <P>We do not intend to ask questions about small matters of day-to-day administration but we are entitled to ask questions about the expenditure of £900,000.  We are entitled to ask questions as to whether a bus service is paying or not when we know the Minister has the information.  The Minister will get his Bill more quickly than he ever thought if he will say he is prepared for the future to meet Deputies by answering reasonable Parliamentary Questions in relation to the running of CIE.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he would listen to representations on bus services, and so on.  I want to put before him the case of a bus service in the suburbs of Dublin city.  I might say, in passing, in regard to his reference to CIE delivering the goods as well as any bus service in any other country, that may be, but I have seen with alarm down through the years the growing queues for buses in my constituency and in every other constituency in Dublin.  I am sure it is a matter of concern to the Minister and CIE officials.  I can remember the days of the trams and, while I do not necessarily want to see the trams back again, I never saw in those days queues 30 or 40 yards long at 5.30 in the evening in the centre of the city as I see every evening now.</P>

      <P>This is a capital expenditure section.  It is worth remarking that the control of public expenditure, capital or revenue, is a fundamental function of every democratic Parliament.  The Minister is bringing the institutions of parliamentary representation and parliamentary government into complete contempt and disrespect <Col N="315" /> by reason of the policy which he is adopting in regard to these matters raised here this afternoon.  It is a very serious development and a very grave reflection on the Minister's respect for the fundamental principles of democracy that he condones the action of CIE in refusing fully to account to the public for their stewardship through this Parliament and through him.

It seems to me completely wrong for Deputies to come into the House and speak as Deputy Byrne has spoken about the Minister for Transport and Power showing complete contempt for Parliament.  The fact is that Parliament has laid down the way in which we are to treat not only CIE but other State bodies.</P>

      <P>It appears it has been deemed that under section 3 one may suggest that the House is entitled to obtain details of any expenditure.  It will be remembered that the argument was not confined merely to capital expenditure. As I said already, I was somewhat doubtful whether that was in order, but, as it has been allowed, I was endeavouring to answer the general case that has been made and to suggest that Deputies who are trying <Col N="317" /> to make this case are not on the right lines, in my opinion.  I shall support them on the general principle and there might be many people, perhaps including the Minister&mdash;I do not know: I am speaking personally and I have not discussed it with him, but knowing the Minister I feel he might be concerned about this problem&mdash;who will be concerned for this principle. But the manner in which it is being approached here is, I suggest with due deference to the Deputies who have spoken, merely wasting time.</P>
      <P>Surely what is involved is the general principle applying to all State companies, and if we want to deal with this, what we should be devoting ourselves to is the principle of providing them with Parliamentary control and at the same time allowing these bodies to operate as commercial organisations rather than Civil Service organisations. There are many ideas I could put forward on this subject but I do not propose to do so now.  I suggest that this is a general problem which is becoming more and more acute in all countries, not only in this country, and to get up and attack the Minister as to why he is trying to do this is merely wasting the time of the House.</P>

Was it the power of the Press or the fact that he knew he was coming in here this afternoon? <Col N="321" /> Why could he not give it to me originally with the ordinary decency and courtesy&mdash;I give them credit for it&mdash; shown by other Ministers on the Fianna Fáil benches; when one puts down a Parliamentary Question, they reply to it.  Why does this Minister not do that? How are we to know what is happening? I am not talking about the amendments which were ruled out of order. I am on the section.  How are we to know?  How will we know in future?</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words on the section.  I understand it is the section that is before the House.  This section appears to me to be a simple declaration, a very desirable thing in a Bill of this nature, to ensure that a body which is receiving a subsidy does not expend that subsidy and its own resources beyond a certain limit.  This is the type of section one would expect in any Bill of this kind.  The company will get a large amount of money annually and it would obviously be undesirable that any undertaking, whether CIE or any other, should embark on any speculative development. It is from that point of view, I think, that a section such as this must be imported into a Bill of this character. There is on the other hand a drafting difficulty in providing that the moneys are devoted only to the purposes for which they are in fact voted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> It seems to me that, taking the amendment which, I understand, has already been accepted in relation to this section, and embodying it in the section, we are left with a net statement which will not have very much operative effect.  It can be effective only in this way: whatever body controls State expenditure&mdash;ultimately, I suppose, the Comptroller and Auditor General&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Does this House not delegate powers of interpretation quite frequently in a large number of spheres?  This is essentially a direction to the Board and, in actual fact, it can have very little operative effect because of the difficulty of distinguishing between capital expenditure, which should not be incurred, and expenditure <Col N="324" /> which might technically be called capital expenditure which may be necessarily incurred for the purposes of the undertaking, and quite legitimately so.  I am putting this to the House as an inherent difficulty in drafting a section of this nature and I am attempting to bring the matter back to a discussion of the fundamentals in the section.  I do not think the provisions of this section are suitable for raising the matters the Deputies opposite are raising.  I do not think they properly arise on this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies opposite are seeking to make political capital and propaganda out of this.  The reason they are doing it is this.  I am still waiting for an Opposition Deputy to have sufficient responsibility to accede to my request to read the statements I made at very considerable length and with great care in volume 191, columns 909 to 915 and volume 207, columns 1518 to 1522, in which I explained my attitude and the attitude of the Government to the delegation of authority to the State companies under my supervision. Not one Deputy in the Opposition has had even the decency to examine what I said and to engage in an intelligent, and even, if you like, a destructive discussion, paragraph by paragraph.</P>
      <P>This is a most complex subject.  It is a subject discussed in every Parliament in every democratic country in the world.  Our Government and this House have made very specific decisions.  This House, in the case of CIE in previous legislation passed by the Coalition Government, has very definitely delegated authority to CIE in regard to the carrying out of its obligations.  Do I need to repeat the clause in the 1950 Act which makes it quite clear that CIE is not even bound to provide me with information about its day-to-day administration?  Deputy McGilligan, in connection with a report to the Seanad, has already made it quite clear that you could not have efficiency if there were day-to-day interference by way of Parliamentary Question with the operation of State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, if the House wants to listen to the whole story all over again, I will give it.  I do not care how many hours it will take.  I feel very keenly my responsibilities about that. Emotionally, I would like to treble my staff and add hundreds of people to the staffs of all the State companies and answer all the day-to-day questions. I would like to feel I could have myself at any one moment a complete and absolute grasp of the situation.  No such thing takes place in <Col N="326" /> any country in the world.  Even in the socialist administrations in Northern Europe, no Minister interferes with the day-to-day operations of State companies. It would be my emotional inclination to agree to the whole of this, but it has been decided for a long time in many cases that it is impossible to get commercial efficiency if there is excessive and undue political pressure, which eventually leads to interference with staff and to unnecessary and enormous subsidies by the taxpayer to support State companies, whose directors are unable to carry out their day-to-day activities because of constant Parliamentary interference. This matter has been discussed in exactly the same way in the Labour administrations in Sweden and Denmark. It is not something out of which we can make political capital as people are trying to do here.  I have made two very carefully propounded statements and not one Deputy in the Opposition has had the decency to read and criticise them.  Apparently, I have to start all over again to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>In order to show the ridiculous character of the opposition by Deputy Lynch to all this business of CIE, I took occasion to go through all the speeches on the Estimates, the speeches I made in regard to the report of CIE when the closing of the lines was being considered and the remarks I made when a private Bill was introduced by Deputy Browne and Deputy McQuillan recently.  I do not know whether the House wants me to give a list of all the information I gave of a character sufficiently detailed to enable the House fully to understand the operation of CIE?  There are pages and pages of information.</P>
    <P>I made it perfectly clear at the time that under the 1958 Act CIE was made responsible by this House for closing uneconomic branch lines and that, according to the 1958 Act, in strict truth, I could sit here in the Dáil and reply to absolutely no observations whatever made by the Opposition or any Deputies.  In fact, as an illustration I gave to the House a list of all the lines which were being closed and detailed information of the <Col N="327" /> character of the substitute services.  I gave information by illustration of the number of passengers entraining at certain terminals to show the light character of the traffic.  I gave detailed information as to the nature of the grants from the Minister for Local Government to provide for the improvement of certain roads affected by the closing of lines.  I gave full information on questions arising from changes in the transport of beet.  I gave information on the proportion of goods carried on the West Cork Railway on behalf of the industries in west Cork before the closing of the railway line as a comparison with the total tonnage of goods carried for those industries.  I gave a great deal of information.  I have here four pages of notes.  On each page there are about ten or 12 items of information I gave.</P>
    <P>I made it clear that when CIE was going through some very drastic change in its organisation, it would be my duty to provide information to the House that would satisfy them as to the nature of that change.  I did so. There was very full information provided in regard to the circumstances in which certain railway lines and stations were being closed.  I also made it clear that under the relative legislation, it would be quite impossible for me in the ordinary way to reply to questions which involved a fragmented analysis of every section of CIE, that it would simply result in political pressure being exercised by every Deputy or every public representative to extend or maintain a service in one area at the expense of the general efficiency of the system, and I said that, in Pacemaker, the House would find a complete analysis of the CIE position, with very definite detailed figures of the bus services that were losing, the bus services that were paying, figures of analysis for income and expenditure for various sectors of the line, which they could see from a study made at a certain period.</P>
    <P>I gave in my Second Reading speech a full statement with regard to the losses of CIE over various periods.  In the <Col N="328" /> annual report of CIE, the loss or the profits for the main sectors of the company are indicated.  The amount of capital expenditure under main heads is included, including the expenditure on buses in each year.  There is a wealth of information provided in this kind of way which should make it possible for any Deputy to understand how CIE is operating, the kind of service it is providing for the public, and I do not think I have in any way refused to give information of a necessary kind on this matter.</P>
    <P>Take the question of the Goleen-Schull bus service.  The question of that service does not really relate to this Bill at all.  Deputy Murphy says that I was misinformed in regard to the cost of it.  The information I was given was that the loss to the Board was £10. 14s. a week, excluding overheads, and it was £12, including overheads. I am prepared to believe that CIE tell me the truth.  I have full trust and confidence in the Board.  That is what I was told.  I was also told by them that it was cheaper to provide the average of two persons per journey with a car apiece than to run the service.  That is not the point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that you withdrew the service and were misinformed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that if I started to inquire about the cost of every bus service, the receipts and expenditure for every bus service, it would completely destroy the independence of CIE.  It would completely destroy the principle of delegating authority to State companies to carry on and to operate efficiently.  The same thing would apply to any other State company.  One could ask the ESB to give detailed expenditure in regard to the replacement of generators or transmitter apparatus.  It is contrary to the whole principle of operating State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, I am not trying to shelter behind that because I make it quite clear that I am generally responsible for the supervision of these companies, and if the companies do not operate efficiently or if there are <Col N="329" /> widespread complaints and I am not able to put them right, then I am responsible before this House and the House can take whatever political action they wish.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I need to go into it in very great detail but I have already explained that we have a system of dealing with complaints that come to us in the Department.  Deputies write quite frequently.  If they are very minor complaints, we send them to the State company concerned and ask them to reply direct.  Complaints that look as though they may have a serious character are sent by us to the company concerned and we ask for a copy of their reply to the person.  We maintain files of these complaints, which, I am glad to say, are very few, to make quite sure that they are not repetitive and we take the very greatest care to ensure that, in our view, they are providing proper services.  For example, if we get particularly any complaints in relation to agricultural services&mdash;sometimes there are complaints in regard to the operation of the CIE lorry fleet in relation to cattle marts&mdash;we take very great care to have these complaints fully investigated and if the person who makes the complaint is still aggrieved, we ask them to see the CIE area manager about it.</P>
    <P>Then another thing arises in this connection, that is, the decentralisation of responsibility in CIE and the appointment of area managers ensures a relationship between the public and CIE which is very excellent and very far-reaching in character.  I have never yet had any complaint from any person that he was improperly received by an area manager or any of the officials under him in CIE.  It means that the public are acquainted with the character of the CIE service.  It means that the public can make complaints when there are deficiencies in the service or when the service is inefficient, on a basis that was not possible before. That is one of the best ways of dealing with the inefficiencies that can arise in a great company.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the House knows all this already.  The character of the questions answered by my predecessors <Col N="330" /> was exactly the same.  There has not been any change in this general refusal to answer questions relating to day-to-day administration and, incidentally, one of my predecessors, the late respected Deputy Norton, when speaking about CIE, expressed the hope that it would pay as a result of the fresh injection of capital.  There was nothing new in that as compared with what I said during the passage of the 1958 Act.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Deputies want me to go into it any further.  If they do, perhaps I should re-read the two lengthy statements I made in detail so that they will fully understand the position, but it is quite impossible for me to diminish general acceptance of the principle of delegation of authority to State companies.  I simply am not able to do it and the information I give in the Dáil on the occasion of an Estimate is, in the circumstances, very full indeed.  I do my best to satisfy Deputies at the time of an Estimate by giving information which perhaps might normally not be permitted by the Chair in order that everyone can have a full discussion. Unfortunately, there was one occasion on which I was limited to about one and a half hours and I had another three or four pages of notes but the debate lasted so long that I was unable to give replies to very detailed matters.</P>
    <P>I like to take a flexible attitude towards this in so far as it is possible but, nevertheless, as I have said, I simply cannot allow the tradition to start whereby information on fragmented sectors of State companies would be perpetually asked for which would inevitably end their independence and result in political pressure of the worst kind being perpetually exercised and get us away from the entire principle of having State companies here.</P>
    <P>May I say that we are very lucky in our State companies?  Not only in this company, but in my supervision of other State companies, I find the boards which run them are composed of first-class men and the officers and staffs are of the very highest calibre. This would be a completely different <Col N="331" /> debate if we were discussing a company which was suspect by everybody, in which the Board and the high executives were suspect in regard to their honesty, their decency or fundamental efficiency.  If we had a debate of that kind on a company, then everything I said could be answered by saying: &ldquo;We do not trust this company. We do not believe the men are running it properly.  We do not believe they are honest.  We do not believe they are decent men&rdquo;.  That would nullify the whole character of what I have said already.  We have a very fine tradition in connection with the operation of State companies which makes it all the more possible to delegate authority in the way I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I have tried to explain it as best I can.  I hope the House will understand it and I hope, before we have another discussion on this subject, Deputies will be kind enough to read what was a more carefully reasoned case than I am now making, the quotations from which I have already given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This long speech is a complete evasion of what has been discussed on section 3.  The Minister has dragged in this whole matter of State companies and intervention by this House in the day-to-day business of these companies.  Nobody is demanding that right at the moment.  I myself set the example with regard to the Electricity Supply Board many years ago but then there was a different conception of what day-to-day administration covered.  It is only in these recent years, when the Minister has evaded questions properly addressed to him, not on day-to-day administration, that this House has got to understand the great difficulty this Minister is raising in connection with the running of these State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody wants to poke into day-to-day administration matters but questions were asked about a week ago with regard to the purchase by CIE of nearly £1 million worth of lorries and the Minister did not answer. The answer was dragged from him eventually after a colleague had answered a similar type of question about the <Col N="332" /> purchase price of certain powerful aeroplanes but the Minister's statement was that it was a matter of day-to-day administration.  It is because of that bad example which he gave that Deputies are quite concerned. There has not been very much trouble with regard to other members of the Government and other State companies. The Minister has brought this on his own head by the extension of the area of day-to-day administration. Because there is a phrase in an old Act excluding day-to-day administration, the Chair has naturally ruled that questions relating to such matters cannot be asked.</P>
    <P>Take this amendment which I have down:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in section 16 of the Act of 1950 the Board shall furnish to the Minister such information relating to its activities as may from time to time be required to enable the Minister on request to keep members of either House of the Oireachtas informed as to its said activities.</P>
    <P>That was ruled out of order because of the narrow restriction imposed in earlier Acts.  Deputies should understand that they may not discuss an amendment which asks the Minister to get from the Board such information as might be required to keep members of either House of the Oireachtas aware of their activities.  The field has been narrowed to that.  Other boards have been properly managed by other Ministers who have faced up to their responsibilities and they have not narrowed the question down to day-to-day administration.  It is not easy to draw the line between what is a day-to-day matter of administration and what is an important matter, but surely the question of £1 million worth of rolling stock could not be called a day-to-day matter?  But the Minister thought that it was and the Chair agreed.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera came into this debate late and his remarks have at least helped to clarify what is at issue, although possibly not in the way he wanted to.  Deputy Murphy asked if he wanted to raise the question of the Goleen to Schull service, would <Col N="333" /> he be told that he would not be given a reply because it is a day-to-day matter of administration.  Suppose a matter of capital expenditure is involved and I want to inquire about some railway line between two points.  Remember the House is being requested to pass a Bill which contains the phrase that the Board &ldquo;shall not incur expenditure that is properly chargeable to capital unless it is satisfied that the expenditure is essential for the efficient operation of its undertaking and, secondly, is satisfied that the project in relation to which it is proposed to incur the expenditure will be remunerative to the Board&rdquo;.  Suppose there were something which the Board decided to count as capital expenditure, but to which there might be another side and if a question is asked about it, hereafter the Minister's easy answer is: &ldquo;I have no function; the Board are satisfied that it is capital expenditure&rdquo;. If I am interpreting this wrongly, I should like to be corrected.</P>
    <P>Then we go to the second part.  If the Board are looking for certain capital moneys and if I ask if this is likely to be remunerative, the Minister will tell me: &ldquo;I have no function.&rdquo;  The Board tell him that it will be remunerative and that is the beginning and the end of the matter. Surely that is not what this House should be asked to do?  When Deputy de Valera was speaking I said that if the section were drafted in a slightly different way, it would be all right. Supposing it were put in this way: &ldquo;unless the expenditure was essential&rdquo;&mdash;that does not say that the Board are the judges&mdash;and suppose that it also read &ldquo;unless the project will be remunerative to the Board&rdquo; and left it open, then it could be the subject of questions here.  There may be matters which should properly be brought before the House and we do not want to be faced with the statement that as they are matters of day-to-day administration, they cannot be answered, or that the Board are satisfied and that would be the beginning and end of the whole thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astonished at the ingenuousness of the Minister <Col N="334" /> talking as a politician to other politicians, as we all are, and taking the extraordinary line that people are putting a point of view forward for political purposes.  Of course we are.  This is a political assembly and that is our function in life.  It is just as if a doctor at a medical meeting were accused, after reading a paper on a subject of interest to the other doctors, of putting forward a point of view for medical reasons.  There is no harm in putting forward points of view for political purposes.  I have heard this from other Ministers and it seems to me to be a very silly attitude.</P>
      <P>On this section, Deputy Colley made a very important point when he interjected &ldquo;It is the House that makes the law&rdquo;.  He was defending the Minister and of course he is correct.  The Minister is hedged in and restricted by laws made here and it is for that reason we have to be particularly careful that we do not tie ourselves by sections of this kind passed apparently with our consent and that we do not deny ourselves a right which we believe we have with regard to the ordinary running of State companies.  At some later time Deputy Colley can tell us &ldquo;In section 3 of the Bill which you passed in 1964, you gave this Minister power&rdquo;, and queries can be stopped in that way.  It is for that reason that the Opposition are anxious that this question should be seriously considered at this stage when we can change the law and make it more in accordance with our wishes. The Minister must bear with the worries of the Opposition in this regard.</P>
      <P>The point made by Deputy McGilligan is of course most important and valid.  We are saying: &ldquo;You may spend your money under two conditions, that it will be remunerative and essential&rdquo;, and then we wash our hands of any responsibility thereafter and of any power thereafter to question whether in fact they have obeyed the law which we are passing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a socialist and I have a particular vested interest in the activities of these State companies and that they should operate successfully, be <Col N="335" /> respected by the public and be efficient.  It is quite wrong to call this a socialist organisation, because it is a State capitalist organisation; it is publicly-owned but not publicly-controlled, and that is the very important difference.  The greater the extension of public control which we can inject into legislation of this kind, the more I would like it, and to the extent to which other Deputies want it, I would certainly support them.  The issue is not black and white.  This is a very complicated question and there cannot be day-to-day investigation into whether a train is late into Kingsbridge or whether it took a train longer to get from one point to another, or into any of these trivialities.</P>
    <P>There cannot be questions on that kind of thing, but, at the same time, there must be some access to guiding policies at a particularly difficult period for the transport companies of the world, the transition from steam to oil, from rail to road and the problems created for the public by the Board's decisions which create some conflict of opinion between public representatives and the company.  We should have some form of access to the activities which determine the decisions of the company from time to time.  The Taoiseach has accepted that there is need for some controlling body and he has thrown it on the Opposition to make suggestions in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is validity in many of the objections put forward by the Opposition and there is a responsibility on the Minister to meet the views of the Opposition.  The fact that so much animosity has been created in recent years could be due to the fact that the new manager of CIE appears to be an autocrat, or perhaps to the fact that he is facing a period of acute difficulty, but, whatever the cause, the fact remains that there is serious suspicion in the minds of most of us about the apparently autocratic way in which many decisions are taken from time to time by this company and the little power we have over the final outcome of those decisions.</P>
    <P>I will go with the Minister in saying <Col N="336" /> that as far as the ordinary member of the public is concerned in his daily relations with CIE, there is good relationship.  The ordinary public have a right to go to the company and inquire about various matters and they get reasonably courteous and efficient service.  That has been my personal experience.  However, as far as public representatives are concerned, we have had a record of bad public relations with this company.  My personal experience has been that we cannot get near the controller of this company to ask him any questions.  That has not been our experience in regard to any other Minister in any of the Governments we have had.  We have always had access to a Minister to discuss matters with him, even if he did nothing about it.</P>
    <P>Over recent years, there has been disharmony between this company and public representatives and the Minister must be conscious of that.  He must be conscious of the fact that there are a number of semi-State companies in the State which are all subject to the same worry, inquiries and uncertainties. Yet they are free from the same sort of misrepresentation, if you like, or dissatisfaction which we have in relation to CIE.  I think it is about time the Minister accepted that fact, the fact that there is something seriously wrong with the public relations of CIE <i>vis-à-vis</i> the members of this House.</P>
    <P>We should have the right to question the decisions of CIE to run its affairs strictly on the ground of their remunerative quality or not.  We disagree with the general approach which has become more noticeable in recent years in regard to the House, that if a particular service does not pay, it will not be made available to the public.  That question arises under this section, the question of the social need as opposed to the economic viability of any particular service.  That has been at the bottom of most of the dissatisfaction which has been aroused over the years in all of us.  If we accept this section, then we are agreeing to cut ourselves off for all future time from any access to the making of a case or any effort to persuade the controlling Board of <Col N="337" /> CIE that we do not agree with any policy decision they may have taken.</P>
    <P>A transport service should be run primarily as a social service.  Where you have a transport service with a society such as ours, with a big rural hinterland and a widely scattered population, if you are going to serve the social needs of the people, you will have to run a largely unremunerative service.  It is running in complete conflict with the social principles of such a society to curtail and restrict services to the rural population simply because they do not pay.  There is an important basic principle enshrined in this section of the Bill and I believe it will be wrong if we give the Minister full power to carry on with the policy which has developed rapidly in recent years and which has created great dissatisfaction throughout the country.</P>
    <P>That policy is completely contrary to the principle that if people live in rural areas, they are entitled to the basic services, to the Post Office service, to the telephone service, to an ambulance service, to water and sewerage supplies.  Transport is an absolute need for people living in the rural areas and it would be a very wrong principle if the Minister were able to incorporate in this legislation that the service will be supplied only where it pays.  The fact that the service is not used to such an extent as would make it pay has nothing to do with what I believe to be the correct social principle of helping people to live in the areas in which they wish to live, to help a predominantly rural society to maintain its characteristic organisation.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong if we forced people to leave rural Ireland by insisting on running a purely economic transport system.  It would be just the same as if a person had his telephone removed because he did not use it enough; if a Post Office service were cut off because he did not receive enough letters; or if a water supply were cut off because a person did not leave taps running all the time.  The whole thing is completely inconsistent and illogical.</P>
    <P>It would be most undesirable if the Minister were to get the full powers <Col N="338" /> he is seeking here.  I would ask him to give serious consideration to the possibility of achieving a closer link between public representatives and this company, in order, if for no other reason, to save himself the embarrassment to which he is so frequently subjected in this House as a result of the fact that he is tied by provisions of various sections of Acts, as referred to by Deputy Colley, where he simply cannot reply or says himself he cannot reply to questions put to him by Deputies in the legitimate course of carrying out their jobs as politicians.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne has made a rather logically conceived statement on all this.  He raises some of the fundamental issues.  CIE is not operating at a profit and I wish Deputies would read the second volume of Pacemaker in which they will see the very large number of road freight, rail freight, railway and bus services that are not paying.  They have been losing money and will continue to lose money.  The social services given by CIE in the form of losing services are fully indicated in Pacemaker and I gave them in my Second Reading speech.  Deputies should know from reading my speech and that report that there is no need for them to have anxiety when they consider asking questions on the day-to-day details of individual bus services.  They know from reading Pacemaker the general trend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>They will know from the Pacemaker report the general balance of profitable and losing services of CIE and I am prepared on every Estimate to inform the House as to whether there has been any change in the general policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE is now subsidised deliberately. No longer is it being asked to pay its way.  Deputy Dr. Browne may disagree with me but I consider the subsidy of £2 million in relation to its revenue, to its expenditure, to its capital or to the general economic position <Col N="339" /> of the country, to be sufficient and I am afraid that, in the course of the next five years, I shall not be in a position, by yielding to political pressures in regard to individual bus services, to encourage CIE to increase its losses or its deficit through the provision of more and more services of an uneconomic character.</P>
    <P>I take full responsibility for that statement.  If the members of the Opposition would prefer to have a six months to six months approach to this question and to have questions answered in the House in a general climate of talk which would, in fact, erode the £2 million subsidy very quickly and which would give rise to all sorts of political pressures whereby the £2 million could very easily become £4 million, the Government are entirely against that, and the Opposition can have recourse at a general election to throwing us out, if they can, for that or for any other reason. However, this Bill clearly indicates that it is a five-year measure and therefore within those five years&mdash;I am speaking without any regard to any emergency or special difficulties that may arise&mdash;that £2 million must provide the difference between expenditure and receipts.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure is sanctioned in my Department and there are discussions with the Board of CIE at official level and I have discussions with the Chairman of CIE when they come to us for capital.  We examine the requirements in a general way.  We see how their request for capital relates to the total amount of capital being spent.  We see how the capital being invested relates to the general progress of the company.  In view of the fact that, particularly in this Bill, the subsidy includes the sinking fund and interest advanced from the Capital Fund, at the end of the year CIE provides the House and the public with a full account of their capital expenditure giving it in sectionalised details as to how much was spent on buses, on wagons, and so forth.  They give the profit and losses on the main sectors of the Company's operations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> On the occasion of the Estimate and having regard to all the correspondence that goes on between Estimates, it is possible for me to estimate the volume of complaints on the service and to gather from discussions in the House what the problems are.  There is no question, in my view, of my preventing full discussion on the operations of CIE during the Estimate debate.  If any responsible member of the House feels that any State company is not operating properly, he can ask to have the company's report discussed as the CIE report was discussed because of the protest over the closing of the railways.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne put his finger on one thing.  I think the fact that there has been so much discussion on CIE and that there are no detailed questions asked of me about the cost of different sectors of the ESB rural electrification, of the cost of providing current in Cahirciveen as compared with Monaghan, is due to the very widespread changes which have taken place in the organisation of CIE.</P>
    <P>This House enabled CIE reorganisation to take place.  Over 1,600 people have left the service of CIE.  People have been moved around.  There have been widespread changes and, as Deputy Dr. Browne says, this is a conservative country and it causes agitation. Then, of course, the major agitation that has taken place in relation to questions not being answered is of the closing of railway lines.  We could have a controversy that could last right up to 10.30 to-night on the closing of railway lines.  I claimed the substitute services that were offered were satisfactory and I have had very few complaints.  It is not true that if you look at the whole network of the CIE services, including the rail and bus services, that there has been any noticeable contraction in the past five years.  An odd bus service might have been stopped here or stopped there but generally there has been no major change in the scope of the service.</P>
    <P>I disagree with many Deputies here and I am quite prepared to back CIE in regard to their policy of having closed minor branch lines.  I take full <Col N="341" /> responsibility for it.  I could at any time have amended the 1958 Act as an act of emergency if I felt they were abusing the freedom they were given by this House.  I did not do so.  I made that clear to the House and made myself responsible for the general supervision of CIE in regard to the closing of railway lines.</P>
    <P>I have been perfectly honest about that.  I have not sheltered behind the Act passed by this House which gives them the sole decision in regard to closing of railway lines, because I have admitted that at any time I could have asked for the suspension of that Act, if I so desired.  Therefore, no one can accuse me of sheltering behind the 1958 Act which gives CIE those powers.  Most of the controversy that has arisen has been caused by the closing of these railway lines. I maintain that in remote rural areas, to avoid double handling of goods and to provide people with as many stopping places as possible, a bus service is much more suitable.  Most of the controversy on CIE has arisen from that fact.  I also believe with CIE that rail services should be fast long-haul services of passengers and goods and I am prepared to take the criticism of those members who disagree with that policy.</P>
    <P>I should mention that Dr. Andrews and his staff received numerous deputations at the time when railway lines were being closed, and particularly during the period of the secondary closings.</P>

      <P>I stand on what is in the Reports of this House and I shall leave it at that.  I quite understand <Col N="342" /> Deputies disagreeing with me.  I do not want to feel antagonistic about this.  I believe that in all the statements I have made in reply to questions and on Estimates, I have gone far beyond the strict conception of not answering on day-to-day matters.  I have made very elaborate statements on the Bill, both in the opening and closing speeches on the Second Reading.  If Deputies read those statements, they could hardly say that I refused to give proper information to enable them to deal with the various sections of this Bill.</P>
      <P>This is a very controversial matter and I should like to answer many more questions than I do answer.  I have gone into the whole matter and I am satisfied with the manner in which we are now doing it, in a sort of pragmatic way in which much information is provided during Estimate debates and on Bills, and I do not think members of the Opposition have failed to gain the basic information they require to enable them to deal with this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might as well say that the ESB produce an annuual report and that you can get anything there, but there are a number of questions arising on important points of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I want to make is that the Minister is so much under criticism in this House because of the very specific promises that were given when the 1958 Act was passed as to the procedure to be adopted when it was proposed to close down branch lines.  This was referred to by Deputy Lynch at column 1796 of the Official Report of 20th May of this year. There was an amendment tabled that there should be consultation with the local authorities concerned and with the trade unions, and the present Taoiseach, who was then piloting the Bill, said that, of course, they would get two months notice and, of course, they would see these people in deputations. The purpose of the requirement to give two months notice was to provide a statutory period during which the inevitable representations could be entertained.  We know that despite that very specific and clear promise, branch lines were closed down without giving local representatives a chance to make their case and it is because of that breach of confidence that there is so much agitation about this matter.  Coming back to section 3, does the Minister think it proper to fortify himself against other questions in the future by the phrasing of section 3 ?  If there is a dispute as to whether or not certain moneys are properly regarded as capital moneys and the Minister is asked a question about that, he is empowered to say, if this legislation goes through as it is: &ldquo;It is only the Board who have to be satisfied about that.  I have nothing to do with it.&rdquo;  He might even say: &ldquo;I do not think myself it is capital money but it is not my business.&rdquo;  Also, <Col N="344" /> if he is asked whether certain expenditure will be remunerative, he is again entitled to say: &ldquo;It is not my business.&rdquo;  If Deputy M. P. Murphy comes along, when a complaint arises in a part of his constituency, will the Minister say: &ldquo;The Board tell me that is not going to be remunerative and that is the end of it&rdquo;?  I do not think that is proper and I think it is particularly improper at a time when we are moving from the idea of an economic concern to what amounts to a social service.</P>
    <P>Many people feel, and I partly agree with them, that the railways cannot be ruled by the standard whether their capital is going to be remunerated or not; that there is a necessity to keep certain branch lines open for social purposes, whether they are remunerative or not.  The Minister is coming in here at a time when the Board have closed down a number of stations and when the situation for the Board&mdash;not for the community&mdash;has been considerably eased and the Minister wants to fortify himself by this section so that no question can be put to him as to whether moneys are properly expended or not.  The Minister's easy answer is to say: &ldquo;It is not any of my business.&rdquo;  Am I right in that interpretation?</P>

He listed the type of information he has given in the House. He posed the question: Surely I am not supposed to answer about a particular bus service which operates today or which is likely to operate tomorrow and give particulars of timetables and services?  It never happened in this House that the Minister was asked such a question.  He was never asked about time schedules.  That was a ridiculous assertion on the part of the Minister.  It looked as if he were trying to imply that questions of that nature were asked in this House.</P>

      <P>And various other questions on important issues were ruled out of order.  A question was raised here by me this evening, and later taken up by Deputy McGilligan, in relation to this section providing the Minister with a cover where future questions are concerned.  So far as representations are concerned, the Minister can hide behind this section in future and tell whoever is seeking information that, unless a particular service is likely to be remunerative, CIE cannot provide it because section 3 precludes them from doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went into detail on a particular service which was the subject matter of discussion here earlier this evening.  He said that the net cost of that service, according to the information supplied to him, was £10 14s weekly and he added for good measure that the overhead charges were £1 6s.  I should like to remind the Minister that his case was necessary to provide a sum equivalent to approximately 15/- per head of the population to subsidise CIE.  Add a subvention of £2 millions with a writeoff of £1 million liabilities incurred previously by CIE and the net capital charge will be more than 15/- per head.  The particular service I was speaking about would not, even on the Minister's inflated figures, measure up to 15/- per head of the population to be serviced.  Therefore, what we are asking here is 15/- per head of the population to enable CIE to continue its operations and, at the same time, we are withdrawing an existing bus service, which, on the Minister's own figures, even if they were correct, would mean that the subsidy would not be more than 9/- or 10/- per head and would, in fact, be less.  Surely, on that basis alone, the Minister must review his decision.  He informed us earlier that it was a decision of his to withdraw that service.  I hope now <Col N="347" /> that the Minister will restore this service.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dr. Browne pointed out, it would be just as easy for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to say: &ldquo;We are not getting enough remuneration from the services we provide in your parish.  We think we should get more and we are now going to withdraw the postal service because it is not remunerative.  People are not writing enough letters.  The returns from stamps, telegrams and telephones are not sufficient.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced the question of the social need for services.  This is a social service.  Nevertheless, he has withdrawn this social service completely from one parish.  I know the Minister has difficulties where CIE is concerned because the Board created a bad public image.  Instead of currying favour with the business community and the travelling public, they have gone out of their way to alienate the affections of the people and to cut the people adrift.  We heard Deputy McGilligan quoting a passage this evening from a statement made by the Taoiseach in 1958.  He was Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time.  He spoke about the deliberations which would be bound to take place between local bodies and CIE when proposals to close a particular transport route arose.  We know how that promise of the Taoiseach's was implemented.  Deputies of this House, members of the county council, members of the county committee of agriculture and other public bodies in Cork were completely ignored and were given no opportunity of any kind to meet the Board of CIE to discuss matters with them.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of that. The Board treated any representations made with gross contempt.  It is regrettable that the Board responsible for our public transport should have that dictatorial outlook.  That is an attitude Irish people will not tolerate.  The Minister must get it into his head that Irish people do not accept dictation and will not accept a dictatorial attitude on the part of the Board of CIE. <Col N="348" /> Surely the people who asked that a deputation be received by the Board were sufficiently representative of Cork to be granted that opportunity?  In my opinion, they were more than representative enough to be heard by that autocratic body, the Board of CIE. Had the Board adopted a reasonable attitude and met the representatives with some amicable arrangement, the position today might be very different and the arrangement might have resulted not only in conveniencing the general public but also in financing CIE.</P>
    <P>Of course, all CIE has to do when faced with deficits is to come along to the Government and ask for a further measure of assistance from this House.  All other companies must stand on their own feet.  Deputy Dockrell is a big business man here in Dublin.  If he were to adopt the attitude adopted by CIE, if he were to refuse to meet his patrons, his business would not continue very long.  Deputy Dockrell is, of course, a wise man.  He, and other business men like him, would lose money if customers ceased to present themselves.  In that set of circumstances, he could not ask to be subsidised from public funds.  But it is all right for CIE to do that.  They do not have to watch closely their bookkeeping and ensure a profitable and fair return because they can come along here and we will give them a subsidy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne made it quite clear that the Labour Party believe in subsidising public transport.  We agree it is impossible to provide transport in uneconomic areas and remote and isolated districts on a remunerative basis.  But we ask something in return. We ask for civility and courtesy.  We ask those responsible in CIE to meet local deputations with a view to agreeing on the establishment of the most suitable type of transport service for the particular area.  CIE will not agree to meet any local deputations.  They have, as I said, created a very bad public image.  In 1958 it was stated that the measure then before the House would, when it became law, see an end to CIE troubles five years later.  That is <Col N="349" /> what we were told.  By the end of five years CIE would be standing on its own feet and the Irish taxpayer would no longer be asked to subsidise it. Some of us did not accept that at the time because we considered it too farfetched.  I agree that a Board who felt in 1958 that in the relatively short period of five years, CIE would be able to stand on its own feet could not be deemed to be competent.  Yet, the same Board are continuing now.</P>
    <P>I want to get a clear definition from the Minister on section 3 what this particular phrase means.  When we discussed the 1958 Act, we were told that the sections were passed and that the Dáil gave CIE this authority.  I am not one anxious to give authority to CIE lightly because of the attitude adopted towards us.  This House is right in questioning every comma in this measure.  We have to be cautious when dealing with a body such as CIE. I regret very much to have to comment so adversely on our public transport body.  The Minister has not helped himself by the attitude he has adopted to Deputies seeking legitimate information on matters of national and local importance.  He has told the House on innumerable occasions he is not prepared to give information to the Deputies seeking it.</P>
    <P>I said on Second Reading that the Board of CIE should be reconstituted. In 1958 this Board asked for five years to put everything right.  They got that blank cheque, and they failed.  That being so, I maintain we should look around and see if we could get other people with brains to deal with our transport problems.  The Minister apparently feels that within the confines of this State, there are only a limited number of people capable of dealing with our transport problems, and that limited number seems to be confined to the Board of CIE.  I do not agree that CIE constitute a monopoly of brains as far as transport is concerned. I do not think it is out of place to refer to the many statements made by the Chairman of CIE in relation to transport problems.  He said in 1961 that his mind was in a state of flux in regard to transport problems.  He admitted on a number <Col N="350" /> of occasions that, as far as transport problems were concerned, he felt rather at a difficulty in dealing with them.  He admitted his incapacity for dealing with complex transport problems. Without any reflection on the personnel of the Board, they have had their chance.</P>

      <P>That is the Minister's attitude.  That is why we want £11 million more in the current five years to subsidise the Board.  The Minister is adopting an arrogant attitude, even though I believe he feels at the bottom of his heart that the arguments by the Opposition are entirely correct.  Yet he will not give in.  He is prepared to allow this Board to travel along the road they have travelled over the years and continue to provide a costly and inefficient transport service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine the record of CIE since we gave it all this authority.  Not alone has it lost money&mdash;its indebtedness is higher than ever&mdash;but it has closed miles and miles of railway.  It has closed some 700 miles of railway. Now it is turning its attention to road transport and commencing to close routes which it tells us are not economic. Surely a Board with that outlook on transport problems in this relatively small country are not fit to remain in office?  The answer to this transport problem is to wipe out the present Board.  They had their chance and <Col N="351" /> failed in their undertaking.  I believe another Board could be found who would address themselves to our transport problems much more efficiently as far as the common good is concerned.</P>

      <P>It is the Board will decide, not the House.  Section 3 clearly states that it is the Board who will decide whether it is capital expenditure or not.  Is it not likely the Minister will make such a reply if a supplementary question is put to him? We have had plenty of experience of that.  Is it not likely he will say that section 3 of this Act, approved by the Dáil, gives the Board that authority? This House gives the Board that authority and they are doing nothing more and nothing less than exercising the authority given by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel, as has been pointed out by a number of Deputies, that this section is a very dangerous one, having regard to the history of CIE and particularly having regard to the Minister's statement a few minutes ago that he will <Col N="353" /> not reconstitute the Board.  Personally, I feel that we should divide the House on this issue and put on record our opposition to this dictatorial line which the Minister has taken.  He has again and again been assured by Deputies here and by the House generally that we are all in favour of providing a transport service and we are prepared to dip into our pockets to subsidise that service, but, in return, we expect efficiency and courtesy and do not want this dictatorial attitude of wiping out transport in some part of the country without consulting anybody. We do not want a dictatorial attitude. The Irish people are not prepared to accept a dictatorial attitude.  Having regard to all the facts, the House should divide on this section.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that Deputies did not read his statement. I was in the House all the time the Minister was speaking and the Minister knows that.  I have a good memory and I will remember what the Minister said all the years of my life. Even at this hour, the Minister should say to us that he will be prepared to meet Deputies if they ask him questions, not about day-to-day administration <Col N="357" /> but questions relating, say, to sums of £50,000 or £100,000, or what was the annual take in regard to a service or in relation to something we know is in his office, which the Pacemaker Report tells us is in his office.  The Minister should not be fooling the people and getting it into the national papers that the Deputies did not read the Pacemaker Report.  I got a copy of the report in the Library.  I asked how many copies were printed and the Minister would not tell me.  I asked him if there had even been a dozen printed and the Minister would not say.  I believe that if there had been more than one dozen printed, the Minister would have said so.  This is an important document and the Minister gets about 12 copies and puts one in the Library of the Dáil, and that is supposed to be publicising it.  It is the Minister's way of making it a secret document and adding to his policy of not telling anybody in this House what is happening, how moneys are being spent or how much is being spent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want to appear to be insensitive to the Minister's feelings but he has opened up in this section the question of his duty and functions <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Board regarding questions of expenditure. He has indicated that this section strengthens his position and I gather that the degree of strengthening is only so that he can require discussion, examination and consultation.  He has said that he is the person responsible for seeing that anything done is done properly.  If that is so, does it not follow from the Minister's claim here that he is being put in a stronger position by this section, that hereafter he can, with a completely clear conscience, answer the questions of Deputies with regard to matters arising from this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered a great many questions in this House.  We can debate this matter <Col N="361" /> all night and not get any further.  It is entirely a question of interpretation. Is the Goleen-Schull bus route in which Deputy Murphy is so deeply interested a question of day-to-day administration? This is a very complex question and Deputies are entitled to discuss it but the trouble is that we never seem to get to the end of it. Much of the discussion in political circles has been based on historical considerations, particularly with regard to the early days of the United States when the operations of the railways were subject to political interference.</P>
      <P>The idea mooted here is that we should give fragmentary information from day to day on every day the Dáil sits, that we should give a detailed, constantly repeated review of the operations of a vast service such as that of CIE with an expenditure of about £22 million a year and that we should be constantly holding up the Board about the closing of this or that service or the number of buses run on a particular route.  If we do, then we will destroy the efficiency of the Board. That has generally been accepted over the whole of Northern Europe where the ordinary democracies have accepted this general view.  Everybody worries about these things because of the fact that these companies have achieved great power to expend vast amounts of capital and people are worried over the extent to which they should continue to receive this freedom. We look at the matter absolutely pragmatically and we think the State companies have operated very efficiently over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we had a multiplicity of questions, to such an extent that it revealed a general unrest over the operations of the Board, the situation might change. I could have an inquiry into the operations of CIE but these things have not happened in the past.  A great deal of this controversy here this evening is again due to the tremendous objections there have been to the closing of railway lines.  I am sorry that Deputy Murphy has left the House because I could tell him to look at the debate on the CIE report in which the closing <Col N="362" /> of the West Cork railway was discussed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>My conscience is quite clear that I have given all the information necessary to enable the House to consider the question of whether there was anything wrong, or undesirable, or contrary to the interests of the public in the closing of these railways.  If Deputies disagree with me, the result is that we have disagreement in the House about the matter, but I gave all the relevant information at that time.</P>
      <P>Now, the major part of the lines to be closed have been closed and I will not curtail the freedom or independence of CIE by asking how much it cost to run the line from Mallow to Cork or what the receipts and expenditure are this year compared with last year.  If I did that, it would end the independence of CIE.  I have done my best to explain all these points to Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has attempted to give the best explanation he could to the House but I also think that he has attempted to oversimplify the matter.  The whole trouble here is that if one accepts that there should be no question in this House about the closing down of a railway line or bus route covering ten miles, then there should be no question about the closing down of one which covers 100 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We on this side of the House do not feel that immense sums of money should be passed through the Minister to a group of people who, when they receive that money, claim that they have no responsibility to this House for explaining how it is spent.  I have great sympathy with the Minister because I feel he is in an invidious position.  He is trying to defend something that is very hard to defend.  I would ask him in his own interests to try to appreciate the fact that we believe there should be parliamentary control over the public transport system.  We believe that if we think <Col N="363" /> money has been wrongly spent, we have the right to ask why it was spent in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made many lengthy interventions, all with the object of evading the real question.  Would he forget for the moment about day-to-day administration? Let us take it that matters of day-to-day administration are excluded. Let us also think of a situation in which capital moneys are required and there is no question of these being for capital expenditure.  There are certain safeguards looked for with regard to capital moneys.  The Board must be of the opinion that they are necessary for the efficient operation of the undertaking and also that the project for which they are needed will be remunerative to the Board.</P>
      <P>Who is to judge on these two points in section 3 as to whether the expenditure is required for the efficient operation of the undertaking or whether the project will be remunerative to the Board?  The Minister has nothing to say to that under this section.  Remember that day-to-day administration is out of it and that there is no question about these being capital moneys.  The decision has now to be taken as to how the capital moneys advanced are to be spent and the decision has to be taken as to whether the project is to be remunerative to the Board.  The Minister, under this section, has nothing to say to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am building section 3 into section 4 which we are now discussing.  The Minister claims that he is being put in a stronger position than ever before.  There is now no question of day-to-day administration and there is no question about the money being for capital expenditure. There are two points to be decided, whether the money is for the efficient operation of the undertaking and whether the project will be remunerative to the Board.  On that the Minister has nothing to say.  If he tells me <Col N="364" /> he has, I will gladly move an amendment on Report Stage to put in the Minister instead of the Board&mdash;&ldquo;but cannot expend these moneys unless the Minister is satisfied&rdquo;.  He can always exclude day-to-day expenditure.  We do not want to bring that in for the time being.  However, the two pivotal questions are not for the Minister's decision but for the Board's decision.</P>

      <P>The Minister, when explaining the section to us, said he would consult with the Board in regard to the outlay of the capital moneys, that is, £6 million.  What the Minister did not say was, if the Board of CIE consulted with the Minister in regard to, say, the purchase of helicopters or something like that and the Minister said to them: &ldquo;I do not agree with this&rdquo; would the Board be said by the Minister?  I should like the Minister to answer that.  Has the Minister any power to control this Board?  I do not think he has.</P>

      <P>I thought I had already made this clear.  Capital must be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance on my recommendation and I have to be satisfied that the programme of capital financing is generally satisfactory. There would be discussions at official level and I would have discussions with the Chairman and, if necessary, with the Board.  We would look at this list of suggested capital expenditure items and if we were satisfied that in general CIE was operating on a sound basis and looking after that part of the service which is remunerative and, at the same time, supplying essential social services, I would then say to the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;I approve of the issue of capital to CIE&rdquo;, and when the capital was issued to CIE, they would then proceed to spend it.</P>

      <P>The most successful man in that operation was the salesman. We should get his name and address and invite him over here to start a school of salesmanship.  This is a very serious business because there is reference here to the advance from time to time to the Board &ldquo;of such sums not exceeding in the aggregate £6 million&rdquo;.  One would think it was buttons.  There is a crowd of faceless men in Kingsbridge, as far as we are concerned, and the way this Bill is going, they have no responsibility to the House.  It appears the Minister must be the fall guy if anything goes wrong.  At the same time, no member of this House, none of the elected representatives of the Irish people, can ask the Minister here what is being done with the £6 million.  This has nothing to do with day-to-day expenditure or with small bus lines.  There is reference here to £6 million and we would not be doing our duty as public representatives if we did not seek a definite statement from the Minister as to how he stood about this.</P>

I put it down again last week and he answered it yesterday.  It was only a little matter of £445,000.  These buses were 36 feet long, six feet over the maximum allowed for any vehicle travelling on Irish roads.  These are things this House should know.  I was told about them and I was not sure whether it was right or not.  I went to the responsible Minister, the Minister who says he is responsible, and he would not tell me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody in the Minister's Department woke up about ten days afterwards and wrote me a letter.  I have a strong objection to that.  I asked the question so that the Minister would answer it here and so that the Irish people would know.  I did not want a letter sent to me.  This is an old trick of the Minister's.  He tells us about the Pacemaker Report. Only 12 copies of it were printed.  The Minister will come in and say as he said yesterday: &ldquo;You will find it in this year's report of CIE.&rdquo;  This year's CIE report has not yet been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> It is not available to anybody in this House.</P>
    <P>I wanted the information I was seeking for this debate and for the Estimate. We are entitled to ask these questions and entitled to get answers. We are now dealing with two sections since 3.30 p.m. but the Minister would have had the Bill three hours ago if he had followed the example of his colleagues and answered the Parliamentary Questions.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that he can prevent, or object to, CIE taking a certain line of big capital expenditure.  We would not expect him to bother with small items which would be merely the day-to-day business that he is always talking about, but when it comes to a big change in policy or a new and expensive step by CIE, I want to know from the Minister, if such a step is being taken and the Deputies become aware of it and want to know if it is a fact, will the Minister answer that question?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not, but that is what he constantly says.  He had the audacity to say in the House to-day that he had answered every question I had asked him on the Second Stage of this Bill.  I had the Dáil Debates in front of me and I had to protest that he was not answering the questions I had put to him, although he had a fortnight, between the time I spoke and when he replied to the debate, to enable him to get the information.  I have no doubt his officials supplied it to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be far more unreasonable because I am dealing with an unreasonable Minister who never showed reason in regard to anything asked on this side of the House or on his own side of the House in regard to his Department.  He brushed everybody aside.  I am still asking if Deputies ask Parliamentary Questions <Col N="371" /> regarding an important step that CIE might be about to take involving big capital expenditure, possibly up to £6 million, would the Minister answer them.  Are we entitled to know?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made it clear to the Deputy that he could have a list of capital expenditure and I want to make absolutely clear that agitation in this House will not stop any State company under my supervision from carrying out any programme during the year, if I approve of it.  Agitation here will not influence any State company under my supervision as regards the carrying out of its annual programme, the general character of which has been debated here and which has been made perfectly clear to the public.  The House has no power to interrupt programmes of that kind.  I shall be responsible for any ill results that come and, on the next occasion when the Estimates come before the House, I shall be answerable for any mistakes made by the company in general.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There is going to be delegation of full authority to State companies.  The Government stand by that and the Deputy may object to it, but that is the fact.  There will be full delegation with relevance to the Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This is something we should be very careful about.  We have had these experts from CIE advising Ministers and advising this Minister before and he came here with their recommendations and forced them upon the House.  These recommendations were to be carried out in spite of the fact that even from his own benches he was told he was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> He was wrong, and he was proved wrong.  Time proved him wrong.  And these experts can be wrong again.</P>
    <P>I do not want to clog up the wheels of CIE.  I do not want to see any more railway lines dug up.  When we are asked, however, to give our assent here to handing the Minister a sum of £18 million over a period of years we have a right to say something about the expenditure of this sum.  We have a right to say in what circumstances we will vote this money.  We have the right at any time to come into this House and oppose or support any matter.  I pointed out earlier the danger of not being allowed to do that.</P>
    <P>There was a public company of which another Minister was practically in charge.  No Parliamentary Questions were allowed.  They were all brushed aside.  Grave mistakes were made by that company.  It is now in liquidation. A few Parliamentary Questions might have saved that company.  The Minister wants to put CIE into an impregnable position.  They will get this money.  They can take a chance.  They can go in for large capital expenditure. If they lose, what about it?  Who cares? Nobody can ask questions.  Write off the losses.  If the Board of CIE knew that, if they made blunders, they just could not go blundering on because they would be brought to book in the Parliament of the country, that would save the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister that he should give all power to these people.  This is the Parliament of Ireland.  We were sent here by the people of Ireland as custodians of the public weal.  The people of Ireland are our masters and we should be the masters of any public company we set up. When I say &ldquo;we,&rdquo; I mean this entire Assembly.  I have given the Minister about five chances on this.  I ask him once more will he give us an undertaking&mdash;he need only say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and I will take a chance; I will take his word for it&mdash;that, if Deputies ask questions relating to CIE, or to any State companies and these questions are in respect of very large sums of money and large expenditure, those questions will be answered?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister also give us an undertaking to explain to us what the <Col N="373" /> difference is when I put down a question about the price of a fleet of buses and he refuses to tell me, while another Deputy, on the same day, asks the price of three or four very high priced aeroplanes, running into £2 or £3 millions, and the Minister answers the question.  In the past four years Deputy after Deputy has asked questions about CIE and the Minister has just brushed them aside.  I have my latest addition here:</P>
    <P>Dear Deputy,</P>
    <P>I regret I had to disallow two questions addressed by you to the Minister for Transport and Power&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put this case to the Minister.  The Minister has stated that he is quite prepared to answer any questions listing the capital expenditure of the Board.  A case has been put to him by Deputy T. Lynch with regard to the purchase of buses.  A question was asked about that purchase and I understand it was not answered.  I understand also from Deputy Lynch's remark that the cost involved was of the order of £400,000 or £450,000 and that the buses at the time exceeded the legal length for such vehicles.  I think the regulations in that respect were altered so as to provide for a variation in order to bring the buses within them.</P>
      <P>The question I want to put to the Minister arises out of that.  Assume for a moment there is agreement between the Minister and the Board that a certain number of buses will be purchased as part of a capital programme of the Board.  I take it without question that if the Minister gives sanction for the purchase of buses, he would intend that the buses being purchased would comply in all respects with the law of this land, and if it came to the Minister's notice before the buses were purchased that in fact they were not going to comply with road traffic regulations, there should be some power in the Minister to stop that transaction and there should be some power in the House to raise that kind of question with the Minister, to bring it to his attention and to insist as far as possible that the Minister take action in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what is at issue arising out of the matter raised by Deputy Lynch. I should like to know what is the Minister's attitude there.  Apparently, his attitude within the past fortnight was that he had no function in that <Col N="376" /> matter and that he was not going to reply to the question.  I want to know when this Bill goes through, when this section goes through, will the Minister's attitude be the same.  It is a question of capital expenditure.  It is a question of agreement between himself and the Board.  Surely it is not sufficient for the Minister to say: &ldquo;Once I have given my consent and given the money, there is nothing more for me to do and I am not going to put up with agitation by Deputies on this.&rdquo;  As far as I and other Deputies on these benches are concerned, the Minister will put up with agitation unless he is prepared to meet this House fairly and squarely and give us the fullest information on all of these questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is making the case that he provides reasonable information on all questions of a basic and fundamental nature which do not impinge on the day-to-day operations and practice.  That is not the case. Deputy Lynch has given numerous examples of questions to which it was not possible to obtain a reply.  I have had similar experience.  On at least two occasions, I have tabled a question to inquire as to the profit earned by CIE on the operation of the Dublin city services.  That basic fundamental information, without which one cannot appraise the functions of CIE, has been withheld from me and from this House.  The Chairman of CIE has admitted to me that that information is available.  That is a preposterous state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is contempt for Parliament?  Surely the public are entitled to this basic fundamental information, without which no one can evaluate the service rendered by CIE? The citizens of Dublin have a chip on <Col N="377" /> their shoulders.  They believe CIE are making extravagant profits on the Dublin city services.  Surely, if for no other reason than to disillusion us if we are wrong, it would be in the Minister's interest that we be provided with that information, not for one year but for every year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a perfect example.  I was trying to think of one.  Periodically, we have had these reviews of CIE.  In the Pacemaker Report, it was clearly indicated that the surplus on the Dublin bus service was £380,000 and that the loss on the Dublin suburban railway service was £160,000.  It was clearly indicated, therefore, that the total surplus on Dublin transport, taken as a whole, was £220,000.  It was clearly indicated that a very considerable proportion of the total overhead expenditure of CIE was attributable to work and employment in Dublin.  It was clearly indicated that the actual surplus on the city bus account was equivalent to .37 of a 1d per journey.  If you work out what it would cost for 12 journeys a week, it would not amount to a frightening sum of money.  All that information was given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>For one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not likely to change very much.  There is not going to be any extreme or violent change in the profitability of the Dublin bus services.  The idea of cross-subsidisation within CIE is entirely permissible. I do not intend to encourage agitation as between cross-subsidisation from one service to another by suggesting to CIE they should sectionalise their accounts in the way suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter of controversy.  The Deputy has his point of view.  He is entitled to it.  There are other intelligent people who might argue with the Deputy.  I am not prepared to say that I am standing here as a person who is so inevitably right that I am certain the Deputy is absolutely wrong.  It is a controversial matter.  It is different in the case of different State companies.  There are some State Companies where very <Col N="378" /> sectionalised accounts might have no adverse affect and it is just my view, supported by the Government, that I do not want to have, every year and every month, discussions in the Dáil by way of questions that involve the principle of attacking the cross-subsidisation of accounts as between the different sections of CIE.</P>
    <P>The Deputy knows the total net profit of the Dublin transport service is nothing that could cause a scandal.  It is not excessive.  It amounts to .37 of 1d per journey.  We have had that discussion.  It is ended.  That review is being undertaken and, in my view, for the next four or five years, until we have another complete review of CIE, if we need one&mdash;we may not need one&mdash;it is unreasonable to ask CIE to sectionalise the accounts.  It is wrong in the interests of the public as a whole and such sectionalising is not conducive to efficient service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is completely begging the question.  This information is revealed in the Pacemaker Report, of which 12 copies were printed.  It is revealed in respect of the year to the 31st March, 1962, that there was a profit on the Dublin services of £380,000.  We are not here at this stage going to discuss Dublin city transport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  I am going on the point of principle.  This basic fundamental information has been available to the Minister and CIE year after year, and it is deliberately being withheld from this House.  That is gravely wrong.  That is a travesty of democracy.  It is true that in the year in question, 1962, it has been revealed that the profit was £380,000.  All the indications are that in several of the years prior to 1962 the profit on the Dublin city services was in the order of £1 million.  Since 31st March, 1962, there have been two increases in fares and, for all I know, the profit on Dublin city services for the year <Col N="379" /> ended 31st March, 1964, could have been £1 million.  For all this House knows, it could have been £10 million or there could have been a loss.  Whatever the result was, we should know what it was because it is basic fundamental information without which we cannot evaluate CIE.</P>

      <P>I want to speak on section 4.  I have put to the Minister a proposition.  Think in terms of something that is beyond day-to-day administration.  Think, also, in terms of some moneys which are clearly capital moneys and not to exceed £6 million in a particular period.  The Minister says he is getting great control here because he and the Minister for Finance must agree to expenditure of a capital nature.  Let me take up the position where these two points are clear: capital expenditure without a doubt and not day-to-day administration. The Minister then, with the collaboration of his colleague, passes over a certain sum of money inside the £6 million to this Board.  It comes to the question of its expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have put to the Minister that under the section we have already passed&mdash; section 3&mdash;he has nothing to say to the two points that then arise for determination: (1)  Is the money required for the efficient operation of the undertaking; and (2) Will the project for which the expenditure is proposed be remunerative?  I have asked the Minister to agree with me that on <Col N="380" /> those two points he has nothing to say. Supposing he notifies the Board who are to expend the money of his view that the expenditure was not required for the efficient operation of the undertaking or that it was not going to be a remunerative project, I suggest the Minister can be rebuffed by the Board. The Board can simply tell him to take a jump at himself.  Am I right about that as the Bill goes?  I am not talking about what may happen behind the scenes&mdash;persuasive powers and all the rest of it.  I am taking the case where the Board are satisfied that the expenditure is properly required and will be remunerative.  Can the Minister interfere?  He says, of course, there can be consultation.  There is nothing about consultation in what we are passing.</P>
    <P>I am going to propose on Report Stage, when we come back to section 3, that the authority to be satisfied will not be the Board but will be the Minister, or the Minister after consultation with the Board.  As the matter stands at the moment, the Board can cock a snook at the Minister when he tries to interfere in these two points.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete subsection (5) and to substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Where an order is proposed to be made under this section, a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> This is the question of how the arrangements for a variation in the amount of the annual subsidy is to be debated in this House and, as the Deputy will see, I have conceded the principle which he put forward.  The only difference is that I understand that it is not appropriate for the Oireachtas to amend a Ministerial order.  That can only be done by me as Minister.  That is the only difference between my amendment and that of Deputy McGilligan.  Deputy McGilligan felt that there should be a more specific discussion in the House when we get to the end of the five-year period rather than the form suggested in the Bill.  I am quite prepared to agree to that, that there be a specific discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between the two amendments.  I tried to have it as &ldquo;the draft shall be open to amendment&rdquo;.  The Minister does not say anything about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, we are back again to the old situation.  Parliamentary procedure here has developed two lines of approach to these orders.  One is the type of order that is made and becomes operative unless it is negatived and the other is the type of order that is put into the House and does not come into operation until it is approved.</P>
      <P>In connection with both types of order there is a further distinction, that Ministers have got into the habit of coming into the House with orders and saying.  &ldquo;Take it or leave it.  We propose to do such and such a thing and if you do not like that, then we will just not do anything.&rdquo;  Whereas, I want to have a full discussion and have leave to amend an order.  That is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important order under section 6.  We have to deal with the annual grant and the annual grant is generally to be £2 million a year and that £2 million is to be the expenditure year after year for five years and then, by part of a section, that amount may be varied but the variation is only <Col N="383" /> to take effect if it is approved by the House.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to come in here with a draft order saying: &ldquo;Instead of paying £2 million in one year, we are to pay £3 million,&rdquo; and I will agree to pay £2½ million and I want to amend to that point, but, if the Minister's proposal is carried, he can come in with an order saying: &ldquo;Change the £2 million to £3 million and, if you do not like that, we will not change it at all.&rdquo;  Why should we have that position?  If the House is to have cognisance of an order at all and to be allowed to approve or reject, surely it ought to be allowed to amend?  There are plenty of precedents. The State Guarantees Act, 1954, has a section which deals with a draft order.  The Social Welfare Act of 1952 has the same and the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, the same.  I think it is essential that we should retain control and be able to amend draft orders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I find myself compelled to support Deputy McGilligan on this matter.  If this House has any function, it must be to amend, where it thinks fit, either legislation or draft orders.  To say that this House will deny itself that right in legislation is to say that we deny our rights to represent the people and that we are denying the right to the people to amend any draft order put before the House by a Minister, an order drafted by the Civil Service and by the draftsmen who are now telling the Minister that we have no right to amend or qualify any draft order the Minister may put before the House.  We know well what the attitude would be&mdash;&ldquo;You must take this draft order or I will accuse you of denying to CIE £2 million and its employees will have you to thank if they do not get a pay cheque next week&rdquo;.  That is the type of thing that is put before the House when you try to put an argument in a democratic manner. It is time that this House recognised its own rights and if it means that we have to take up the matter of not having any right to qualify Ministerial draft orders elsewhere, we will certainly do it.</P>
      <P>We certainly do not accept the Minister's amendment.  Deputy McGilligan is accepted as one of the leading parliamentarians in this country and in this century, and the House should be guided by what he suggests.  His amendment is a very worthy one. The Minister has accepted it in principle and it may well be that he would like to go all the way with Deputy McGilligan.</P>

      <P>If the House should decide, by refusing to agree to this motion, to suggest an alternative sum, it would be up to the Minister of the day to decide whether he would submit a new draft order for that sum or the alternative would be a Government crisis, the defeat of the Government in the House on an important <Col N="386" /> matter.  The Deputy knows that just as well as I do and there is no question of there not being a democratic procedure if an order is defeated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This section grants a subsidy of £2 million to CIE each year for the next five years.  I want to know why this sum of £2 million has been arrived at.  Who is to say that £2 million is sufficient to subsidise CIE? Who is to say that it is not too much? I should be grateful if the Minister would enlighten us on that point and tell us what contribution to the CIE pool he expects the Dublin city services to provide.  Is this sum of £2 million based on a scientific calculation?  I suspect it is based on some sort of a forecast for the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If so, does that forecast provide for a cross-subsidy, to use the Minister's term, from the Dublin city passenger services to CIE in the order of £250,000, £500,000, or a £1 million, or does it presuppose a loss on the Dublin city services?  These are points we ought to know in order to assess the merits of this provision.  If the sum of £2 million anticipates a cross-subsidy of the amounts I have mentioned from the Dublin city services, I want to protest.  In this Bill we are bringing in a new principle for the first time, the principle that transport has to be subsidised. It is a radical turn about in <Col N="389" /> our transport policy to admit that a State subsidy is necessary.</P>
    <P>If we admit that principle, we must be consistent and logical in our application of it and we must cast aside the basis upon which transport policy has been founded for the past number of years.  It was wrong from the start to expect the Dublin city services to contribute a large subsidy to the operations of CIE.  It is going to be much more grievously wrong in the future because of this new principle of subsidy. It was wrong in the past because the people who are creating this subsidy, the Dublin workers, are being badly treated by CIE for the reason they are being provided with inadequate services for which they have to pay outrageously high prices.</P>
    <P>As a Dublin Deputy, I feel somewhat guilty.  I have listened here to Deputies from rural parts fighting their corner and making their case strongly for various rural services.  I feel that Dublin Deputies on all sides of the House have failed adequately to impress upon the Minister what a damn bad service the people of Dublin are getting from CIE, how unfairly and inequitably they are being treated.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to avail of this section to make a protracted speech on the operations of CIE in Dublin.  The Minister knows my views on that matter.  I have previously indicated the inadequacies in considerable detail &mdash;the lack of shelters, the outrageously high fares, the manner in which the stages are fiddled by CIE to ensure that people who are taking the most commonly availed of services will pay the maximum fare.</P>
    <P>The Dublin workers from the dormitory housing estates, from Ballyfermot, Cabra and Coolock, people of very modest incomes, have to travel to their work and home again at a cost of from 30/- to £2 a week.  They are the people who are creating this pool of profit from which we are to expect CIE to draw.  The Minister has the audacity to defend that practice as a legitimate device, to defend this cross-subsidy, as he calls it, and to quote statistics of mileage rates and profit per journey.  The people who are using the CIE Dublin city services <Col N="390" /> are people living on modest means. Some of them are badly off.  There are young girls in housing schemes travelling considerable distances and paying 10d bus fares to get to their work for which their remuneration is £4 or £4 5s per week.  Thirty shillings per week taken out of that modest wage packet is a very considerable sum.</P>
    <P>The burden of CIE fares is creating hardship for some parents, particularly for parents of large families whose children have to travel a distance to school.  The concession fare provided for schoolchildren, as the Minister is aware, is only available to children going to school in the morning and coming back in the evening.  It is not available for travelling at lunch time.  Rural Deputies are not aware of the way of life of our Dublin people who have to travel considerable distances and whose children have to travel distances to school.  Parents may be making considerable sacrifices to send their children to a secondary school and this added burden of transport fares is the last straw that makes their goal unattainable.</P>
    <P>I want to protest against the situation and I shall protest at every opportunity which presents itself, no matter how angry the Minister becomes. The Minister says he does not intend to leave the door open to agitators to exploit a situation such as this.  The use of that very phrase illustrates very clearly what contempt the Minister has for Parliament.  In making these complaints, we are availing of our democratic right to discharge our duty as legislators.</P>
    <P>I spoke here a few moments ago about the profit on the Dublin services and on the refusal of CIE to disclose what profit was being made over the years.  The Minister condones that. He admits they have that figure.  That fundamental piece of information is available to the directors of CIE, is probably available to the Minister, but is withheld from the public and from their representatives.  That is an appalling state of affairs that would not be condoned in any Parliament where the basic principles of democracy are respected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> The harsh glare of publicity is the best safeguard to ensure the fair and efficient operation of our State companies, including CIE.  The accounts furnished by CIE do not give anything like adequate information to those of us who wish to appraise the workings of that company.  However, I do not propose to become involved in that.  I merely wish to avail of this opportunity to inquire from the Minister, who has decided that £2 million is the subsidy which CIE will require per year for each of the coming five years, if this sum is based on a scientifically calculated budget.  If so, what contribution is going into that budget from the operation of the Dublin city services? Is it £500,000?  Is it £1 million?  Whatever it is, we should know.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to take into account the basic considerations of equity, to consider that these Dublin workers who are contributing very handsomely to the CIE pool are a section of the community who are most savagely taxed by our taxation code of indirect taxes, together with PAYE, a system of tax applied to wage and salary earners, the only section of the community who have no way out of the tax net.  It is, in these circumstances, quite wrong and unjust to expect them to pay an added tax every time they make a journey on a CIE bus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not know the history of subsidies to CIE since 1958?  Does he not remember the many statements he made, even since 1958 and as late as 1963, that he has retracted in the course of the Second Reading debate?  Does he not realise he has made at least five public statements since 1958, the last one in 1963, to the effect that he did not <Col N="392" /> believe in subsidising transport, that he would get rid of that system from our legislation, that there was no justification for spending public funds on subsidising transport.  Is the Minister not making changed statements on transport since he was appointed to his office?  I shall agree he did not anticipate as late as 1963, less than 12 months ago to be exact, that he would, in the summer of 1964, be asking the Dáil to approve of a sum of £2 million annually for CIE for five years.</P>
      <P>We give the £2 million to CIE and, as we have already mentioned in the House several times, we are unlikely to get any more information as to how this money is to be expended.  Supposing a number of services are withdrawn. Even though the Minister has indicated in the course of the Second Reading that it is unlikely that services will be withdrawn, all the Minister's statements are suspect.  When the Minister put forward a case proposing the closure of the West Cork, West Clare and Tramore railway lines, he made it quite clear that until 31st March, 1964, there would be no question of closing any further lines, that the closure of those lines would be sufficient to balance CIE finances, that there would be no need to make any further changes and that people who were fearful lest their transport system would be withdrawn need have no fear.  Within a few months of the Minister making that statement, there was notification of further closures.  A number of lines were closed within a matter of months.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is not careful, I shall go back even further to remind the Minister of statements he has made.  I have gone back only as far as the 1958 Transport Act. I wish to quote subsection (1) of this section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> Subject to subsection (2) of this section, the Minister shall in the financial year of the Board beginning on the 1st day of April, 1964, and in each subsequent financial year of the Board make to the Board, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, a grant of two million pounds.</P>
    <P>This clearly indicates there will be no change until 1969, until which time the flat rate of £2 million a year is being given.  Supposing services which are deemed to be uneconomical are withdrawn in a number of areas.  I am not speaking now of rail services; I am speaking of rail and bus services generally. The Minister has now commenced to remove the bus services and possibly he may remove other bus services&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with all that before.  The Deputy is merely repeating himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister need not feel irritated because time and again he has irritated Deputies on this side of the House who were trying to get information from him.  Naturally, we are very slow to pass any section of the Bill without the closest examination.  We know what happened when we tried to get information before.  Did the Minister not tell us that in 1958 the House passed the Transport Act which gave CIE power to do this and that and that we were not entitled to get information.  He said CIE were acting in accordance with powers they got from the House. That being so, having regard to the treatment we got from the Minister and from CIE, we must be very diligent in our examination of every word and line of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) of the section gives CIE £2 million per year.  We asked, as did the previous speaker, Deputy Byrne, how that figure was reached. At the time of the closure of the railways <Col N="394" /> I have mentioned, it was implied in the Minister's statement that there was a likelihood that CIE would break even, when they would be rid of these uneconomic lines.  At that time, they had a good year.  I think the deficit was not much more than £250,000.  It jumped in the next year to, I think, more than £1,700,000.  That was a big jump, despite the fact that the Minister had wiped out a number of lines.</P>
    <P>I feel that the State as a whole must contribute this money.  No areas are excluded from the obligation to contribute, although areas are excluded from the right of participation in the services provided.  Removal of a service from an area does not remove the obligation from the people there to continue subsidising CIE.  I am making the case that if, as is not unlikely, in 1966 or 1967, the Minister decides to close the 750 miles of railway which he states are uneconomic and if he decides to close the bus services which he earlier mentioned as being entirely uneconomic, and if he gets back to the opinions he held up to 1963 that CIE should not be subsidised, how would this section work?  Whether the Minister likes it or not&mdash;unless there is new legislation&mdash;this legislation gives CIE a flat sum of £2 million per year.</P>
    <P>It is not true that CIE are in the most favourable position as a public company.  I have frequently mentioned the obligations of CIE and my belief in their right to subsidisation to provide services in uneconomic districts. Possibly we would not have the discussions we have had on this Bill were it not for the attitude adopted by the Minister and CIE.</P>
    <P>If CIE decides, after getting this £2 million to close ten uneconomic routes or any routes it declares to be uneconomic, what will happen?  The subsidy will continue.  The people affected by the closure of the routes will get no satisfaction from CIE. There is no question of their being told in advance of the proposal to close the transport service.  On the 1958 Act, the Taoiseach said that two months notice would be given of the withdrawal of rail services and it was generally assumed that the same would <Col N="395" /> apply to bus services.  We then found that the two months notice, although given, was of no avail to the affected areas because the Minister and the Board refused to meet or discuss closures with any responsible authorities locally.</P>
    <P>I now find no notice is given to an area when a bus service is withdrawn: the notice does not apply to road transport.  The first an area affected knows about services being withdrawn is when they find buses no longer passing through their district.  From past experience, that is likely to arise. In the light of experience since 1958, it is most likely to arise and still the subsidy will continue.</P>
    <P>I see in this Bill that the Minister is getting something similar to what he got before but we did not have the experience in 1958 we now have.  He is getting, or endeavouring to get, a blank cheque from the House for £2 million annually for CIE and approval for wiping out some liabilities which already exist and also approval for amending the figure, if he so wishes, in years to come.  In return, he has told the House that he is not prepared to answer any questions that may arise on this matter.  He has already indicated that he feels he has given too much information to the House about CIE affairs.</P>

      <P>We cannot <Col N="396" /> repeat too often that the Minister's record in answering questions tabled here is not good.  I am not speaking of small items.  Earlier, Deputy McGilligan told us that when he tried to get information on a transaction running into more than £1 million, he was told that as it was a day-to-day transaction of the Board, he was not entitled to the information.</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay the House unduly but at the same time I am in no great hurry to facilitate the Minister.  I think his attitude here this evening has changed. In the earlier part of the day, I felt obliged&mdash;and I thought it was warranted&mdash;to pay him some compliments. Even though his remarks were incorrect and unsoundly based, I gave him credit for being sincere.  I withdraw that now.  The Minister has grown rather arrogant, if I may use that term.  He is impatient.  He is trying to ignore the House.  That is the attitude adopted not only by the Minister but also by the Government.  That is the attitude adopted by the Board of CIE in relation to many matters.  The attitude is: &ldquo;Give us the money&rdquo;, followed by a refusal to give the representatives of the people here information to which they are lawfully entitled.</P>
      <P>I want to know from the Minister now, if services are withdrawn from a district, what will happen?  Will the people get advance notice?  Will they get any assurances?  It is proposed to give CIE £2 millions annually for a certain period.  I do not see anything in the section to suggest that the Board of CIE will meet people affected by the withdrawal of either road or rail services in order to discuss their problems.</P>

As Deputy Colley knows, section 6 is one of the most important sections in the Bill, because under subsection (1), £2 millions annually <Col N="397" /> will be handed over to CIE.

      <P>We were told in 1958 by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the present Taoiseach, that, if the 1958 Bill were passed, there were sufficient brains on the Board of CIE to develop our transport in such manner as to make it capable of standing on its own feet in a period of five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all have liked to see that prophecy fulfilled. Unfortunately, it was not fulfilled, and that is why we are addressing ourselves now to these questions. The main theme in relation to the 1958 Bill was that, given the Bill, in five years, the likelihood was that CIE would be able to stand on its own feet.  The then Minister, in his opening statement, said that, if the Bill were approved by the House, the anticipation was that CIE would be able to break even in five years.  The plea was to give them unfettered power and authority, to leave them to <Col N="398" /> themselves, not to bother them with questions here, and, in five years, everything would be all right.  I am sure the Minister will admit he believed that statement because he has committed himself on several occasions in his argument that transport should not be subsidised.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party believe in subsidisation of transport.  We are not against giving the money but we believe that the money should be used to the best advantage.  We believe, too, that members of the Oireachtas are entitled to know how the moneys they vote are employed, whether they are gainfully employed or otherwise.  We feel that CIE is not utilising these voted moneys to the best advantage. We feel they are too dictatorial.  We believe they should be more approachable. We believe they should treat their potential customers with civility and consideration.  Instead of that, CIE alienate people by their dictatorial attitude.  Now, whether or not the CIE balance sheet balances at the end of the financial year, it will have £2 millions to cover any deficit.  If all private companies adopted the attitude CIE adopts, I wonder what the state of our economy would be.</P>
      <P>We heard earlier today about two Dublin Deputies who asked the Board of CIE to discuss a particular matter relating to Dublin.  The Board would not trouble to meet them.  The Minister should have a word with the Board. He has refused my request to reconstitute the Board.  He has told us in a very arrogant manner that he has no intention of reconstituting the Board. He firmly believes they are as good as any board that might replace them. He must tell them, however, to be more courteous and more civil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it does arise, but I shall not continue on that line.  It is regrettable that we should have to comment adversely on our public transport system.  The criticisms <Col N="399" /> offered by this side of the House have been constructive criticisms.  We should not be honouring the trust reposed in us if we did not point out deficiencies, in the hope that notice will be taken of them and they will be rectified.  We hope that in the not too distant future there will be a different approach by the Board to the public generally.  If that happens, there is bound to be an improvement in the Board's finances and the result of that will be a reduction in the subsidy they require.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Byrne and my Fine Gael colleagues representing Dublin in asking the Minister to state what contribution will be made towards the finances of CIE by the Dublin city services over the next five years during which the Minister proposes to make this sum of £2 millions available annually to CIE.  On the Second Stage, the Minister said this figure had been assessed by the experts of CIE as being the probable loss which will be suffered over the next five years.  In arriving at that figure, some estimate must have been made of the contribution from the Dublin city services.  As these are one of the principal revenue earners of CIE, we think detailed particulars should be given of the receipts from the Dublin city services.  The figures in the 1962 and 1963 reports show that the Dublin city services produced two-thirds of the road passenger revenue of CIE, much more than the total rail services of CIE.  Yet the Minister persistently refuses to give us figures showing the breakdown of the principal revenue earner of CIE.  We do not think that is good enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, this section deals with a grant of £2 millions, based, we assume, on some facts.  We want to know what the facts are.  We are entitled to get them before we <Col N="400" /> either approve or disapprove of this section.  The Minister refuses to give them.  He weighed down the postman this morning sending around a 30-page document giving details of the operation of his Department and the activities his Department superintends. There is not one figure in that document to show what the revenue is from the Dublin city services.  We are given figures for the net losses but there is no breakdown at all to show what contributed to those losses and what contributed to profits.  There is no breakdown of road passenger services to show how much is earned on the Dublin city services and how much elsewhere.  We are entitled to make that point and submit it as a reason why the Minister should give us the information for which we ask.</P>
      <P>From the figures which CIE invariably give us after the Estimate is discussed&mdash;therefore, they are of little moment by the time the Estimate comes round the following year&mdash;we know that per mile travelled, CIE make more on the Dublin city bus services than on the provincial services. The figure in the 1963 report indicates that on the Dublin city services, there was a profit of 3/1¾ per passenger mile.</P>

      <P>Based on an estimate of the revenue and losses of CIE over the years.  I know this is far above the intelligence and ability of the backbenchers of Fianna Fáil, but we assume the Minister has some understanding of the fact that there must be an assessment of the profit and loss on all sections of CIE.  We are entitled to know that, before we give a blanket £2 million to CIE in any year.  In the course of his Second Reading speech the Minister presumed to give figures about the Dublin bus routes.  As we <Col N="401" /> know, CIE has given misleading figures before.  Selected figures have been given.  CIE has engaged in special pleading before and has not told the full truth.  We cannot accept any figures the Minister and CIE give us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Until such time as the Minister names, terminus by terminus, each route supposed to be making a profit or loss, we cannot accept figures from CIE.  The Minister gave this House to understand, and CIE gave the country to understand a couple of years ago, that the Dublin suburban train services were losing a colossal amount of money.  This fiction is still being recited.  The Minister said that of the 1,400 miles of railway track in this country, something like half were making a profit.  He presumed to distinguish between profitability and marginal profitability.  Frankly, I think we have reached the stage where we do not intend to make a profit for wealthy elements in the community, or for the Government, on any particular tracks.  That should not be the test. If it is marginally profitable, it ought to be entirely acceptable.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that 700 of the 1,400 miles were paying a profit. He said it did not call for any great intelligence to know that those tracks were situated in the most densely populated part of the country, the eastern seaboard, in particular.  Is there a part of the country more densely populated than the Dublin suburbs? What part of the whole rail system is more likely to pay than the part which, according to the Minister, is situated in the part of the country most densely populated?  Yet what did CIE do?  It loaded those few miles of track with the capital expenditure and maintenance of Amiens Street, Kingsbridge and Westland Row stations, serving the length and breadth of the country.  All this was loaded on to the Dublin surburban services so as to give false figures.  CIE has not given a breakdown of those figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can we act responsibly in accepting the blanket estimates given when the Minister and CIE persistently refuse to give us the breakdown to <Col N="402" /> which we are entitled for the Dublin services?  If they do pretend to give any breakdown, it is based on figures which, on the Minister's admission, cannot be accepted because of the principle he sets out as being incapable of contradiction&mdash;the principle that a railway line will pay as long as it is situated in an area with a high density of population.</P>
    <P>These matters are fundamental. If the Minister is not prepared to give us this detailed information, if not on this occasion, then on some other occasion, we Dublin Deputies cannot accept that the Dublin services should still continue to help run the services in the rest of the country. The only figure which we know is of any value is now two years old. It was given for a year which was not a particularly good one in transport finances.  We are entitled to get the figures for 1963-64.  The Minister has not given them in this 30-page document he circulated for our guidance, although I have not found any fact in it of any assistance in discussing either this Bill or the Estimate for his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have plenty of time.  I have no objection to replying but it would not be of much use to give any figures because the figures of CIE are no longer trusted.  If Deputies do not accept them, there is not much use at this stage going into figures to any great extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition say they believe the figures of CIE are faked, so there is not much use giving them.  The question of this subsidy is arranged in this way.  Taking into account all the factors which are reasonably foreseeable, CIE estimate the deficit that will arise on their combined operations, including the securing of loans on capital advances from the Exchequer, over each of the next five years.  These have formed the basis, taking one year with another, <Col N="403" /> of the average annual subsidy needed to break even.  The projection does envisage a contribution from the Dublin bus services of the present proportion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give the House the detailed breakdown of the figures for the next five years.  I have already indicated to Deputy Byrne the figure indicated in Pacemaker.  I have told him it represents .37 of a penny per passenger journey, which he does not believe.  I have already told him that amounts to some 4d per week for 12 journeys for the average passenger and that I did not consider it excessive. I have already told him &mdash; the repetition in this debate is fantastic &mdash;that, if you relate the loss on the Dublin rail services to the profit on the Dublin bus services, the total surplus in relation to the total revenue and expenditure of CIE could not constitute an excessive cross-subsidisation. But the Deputy does not believe the figures.  I have already said all these things.  Now, I shall say to Deputy Ryan that even though he does not believe the figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Deputy's pardon, Deputy Ryan said it.  Deputy Ryan has not read Pacemaker, apparently.  He has not realised in connection with the Dublin rail services, when I said there was a loss of £160,000, assuming that the rest of the service was closed down, under the new calculation headquarters costs and administration of CIE, and everything that would relate to a great deal of the headquarters expenditure, are allocated to the different sectors of CIE operations throughout the country in a proportionate manner.  In saying that the Dublin rail services lose, CIE has not fraudulently put on other expenditure, including a whole lot of headquarters costs which do not really apply.  Perhaps that would satisfy the House in regard to that?  The reason <Col N="404" /> the Dublin rail services are losing is the same as that in connection with many other commuter services, which have two very high peaks in the morning and evening.  Unless there are unusual conditions where people are travelling constantly during the day in enormous numbers a short haul service of that kind is never a paying proposition and there are endless commuter services that lose money. Some of the more favourable kind of services make money.  That is why the Dublin suburban railway service loses money and I do not think the net surplus of the whole system is anything that Deputy Byrne need be worried about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave full details to the Deputy of the plans of CIE to try to improve the service, in relation to the congestion of traffic in the centre of the city, which is the main cause of the complaints, that people have to queue at certain times of the day.  I explained that at great length.  I indicated the plans to the House in my Second Reading speech.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy asked me some questions about the position in relation to the closing of services.  Yes, it is a fact that CIE has the power to close bus services without any notice of a statutory kind as provided in the 1958 Act in relation to the closing of railway services.  That is a fact. Deputy Murphy is correct.  Again, the whole question of the maintenance of a bus service network throughout the country is something which can be discussed on the Estimate, something for which I am responsible and which cannot be judged by action taken in regard to small individual services; it should be judged by the general character of the services offered by CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> In regard to railway services, CIE, under the 1958 Act, still has the power to close a railway service without there being any recourse to the House and without my having to give my consent.  That clause in the 1958 Act still stands.</P>

      <P>I should add that if the Deputies read the text of my speech on the Second Reading they will find the Government clearly desire and intend to maintain the major arterial railways of this country and the lines that are left, where there might be some concentration or reorganisation, are very small in number. Deputies have only to look at the map and to note the existing railway system to realise that the lines that could be closed are not extensive in character. The Government have agreed to maintain the major arterial railway service. I think I have answered all the questions on this point.</P>

      <P>There is another point.  The Minister will appreciate that it was not written into the Act of 1958 that CIE should meet deputations.  The then Minister mentioned that it was superfluous to have a provision such as that in the Bill because he felt there would be no difficulty whatever, that there would be too much notice given, that CIE would meet all the interested parties.</P>

      <P>If you will excuse me.  The Minister will appreciate that CIE dishonoured the assurance given to the House and which was responsible to a large extent for the passage of that measure without the opposition that it would have got were it not for that assurance.  That assurance facilitated the smooth passage of the measure through the House. We were told subsequently that what <Col N="406" /> the Minister said in the course of the discussion had nothing to do with the Bill, that what was in the Bill was what CIE had to do.  CIE dishonoured the assurance given by the then Minister, the present Taoiseach.  That assurance was given in no uncertain terms. It has been quoted time and again in debates in this House on public transport.</P>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister whether the Minister or the Government took any disciplinary action, if that would be the correct term, in relation to the dishonouring of the assurance given by the responsible Minister to the House.  The dishonouring of that assurance led to a world of trouble.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has taken umbrage because I am challenging figures.  We will leave the millions aside for the moment.  If I understood the Minister correctly he said the average contribution by Dublin passengers was .37 of 1d per trip and that on the basis of an average passenger travelling 12 times a week the person would be contributing about 8d a week towards the general profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Twelve times .37d. obviously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Minister and myself are not <i>ad idem</i> on this. If I multiply .37 by 12, I get 4.44.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is roughly 4½d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not very like 8d, which is what I understood the Minister to say before.  If the Minister said 4.44 that is all right, but that is not what I thought he said earlier.  In any event, if we accept even the Minister's figure, the figure ought to be much nearer 8d or 9d if the Minister now says 4½d on the basis of 12 journeys. The ordinary working person in Dublin who uses public transport for going to and from work will in the course of a week make 24 journeys, taking even six days of the week during which he may travel to and from town.  If he comes home for lunch <Col N="407" /> the average contribution will be about 8d or 9d.  In many cases, not only the breadwinner of the family, but other members of the household&mdash; children going to school&mdash;will also have to pay a considerable amount in bus fares and in any household far distant from the centre of town this means a colossal imposition on the family.  Of course, the person who travels a longer distance to the more remote suburbs pays more per mile than his fellow citizen nearer to the centre of the city is paying.  A person contributing 2d or 3d per journey to and from work is paying 8d per day towards the general profit of CIE.  We do not think that that is a fair imposition to continue on the working people of Dublin and we make no apology here or anywhere else for saying so and for saying that we cannot accept the Minister's figures.  There are details that we want and which we are entitled to get.  Just as members of any company or of any concern or society who are contributing towards the expense of it are entitled to get it, we are entitled to get this detailed information and until such time as we get it we cannot accept the Minister's figures and he cannot blame us.</P>

      <P>There is no use in arguing this question.  If the surplus on the Dublin bus service is eliminated then either the general subsidy goes up, the taxpayer has to pay more money or some other people down in West Cork&mdash;Deputy Murphy's area &mdash;will have to pay extra fare.  You can go on arguing this <i>ad infinitum.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that a reasonable element of cross-subsidisation in regard to the Dublin service is quite acceptable having regard to the enormous expenditure by CIE in the Dublin area, not only on the bus services, but the general headquarters.  I grant that this is an arguable matter but I am prepared to leave the present situation as it is. I also indicated earlier&mdash;we seem to have endless repetition&mdash;that if Deputies study the increase in bus fares over the past four or five years, the increase in the earnings of workers, <Col N="408" /> and the increase in social welfare levels, they will find that the increased bus fares bear some relation.  I have not got the figures with me, but if Deputies work it out, they will find they bear some relation, so that it cannot be said that the increases are pressing hard on the people in Dublin.</P>

      <P>With regard to the policy of closing lines and curtailing bus services, and where such services have been terminated, has the Minister any power to reconsider the reopening of such lines or services where it can be proved that their closure was to the disadvantage of the community from a social, business and economic point of view?  If CIE takes a decision to close a railway line or terminate a bus service is that final and irrevocable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I already dealt with that matter but possibly not quite in the form in which the Deputy has put it. I admitted that during the operation of the 1958 Act and up to the present Bill I would have the power to amend the Act whereby CIE can close lines without recourse to the Minister but I did not do it because I was satisfied with the general manner in which CIE was acting, and that is perfectly true now.  If I had felt that the policy was having serious effects, I would have gone to the Government to say that there must be an emergency amendment of the Act with regard to certain powers.  The Board of CIE have my confidence; if I felt they no longer had my confidence, I could request their resignations.  So far as I am aware from all the information made available to me, the substitute services provided are satisfactory and I have <Col N="409" /> heard a great deal of praise of the substitute services in certain areas.  I believe the general policy of CIE in regard to the closing of railways was intelligent and in line with what was done in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is that a decision to close a line was implemented by CIE with indecent haste. There was a particular line running from Waterford to Tramore which was the subject of great controversy in this House, in Waterford city and Tramore generally and in south Tipperary and Waterford.  CIE knocked down bridges and tore up railway lines within a matter of hours after a decision had been made in this House to close the line.  That does not give me the impression that there is any hope of reconsidering the reopening of such services when CIE is permitted to act in such a manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The question has been asked of the Minister over the past five or six hours whether or not he has any function in the closing of a railway line and the Minister has been talking about trends in transport in Great Britain and other countries and has probably spoken about trends in transport legislation.  The Minister is well aware that in Great Britain, despite the powers which Dr. Beeching appears to have, he has not the last word in the matter of closing railway lines.  It will be recollected that within the past 18 months, Dr. Beeching made certain proposals for the closing of railway stations and lines in Great Britain but many of these were vetoed by the Minister of Transport, Mr. Marples. He has the power to veto proposals for closing railway lines and stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know whether the Minister has ever considered taking such a power to himself by way of legislation.  After all, he is the custodian of the public welfare in this. As far as the Board of CIE are concerned, whilst they may be charged with acting in accordance with the general interest of the people, they also had the superhuman task of making CIE break even within a period of five years.  There has to be a balance <Col N="410" /> between making a service as economic as it can be made and the public welfare in the matter of transport.  In Britain, the Minister is the arbitrator, so to speak, in that.</P>
    <P>On the section, the Minister will forgive me if I ask him will £2 million be sufficient or will it be eaten up by operating costs?  In deciding on an annual grant of £2 million, does the Minister think it will be sufficient to pay for the redundancy that will undoubtedly come about, in view of his statement regarding the building of buses?  I am not convinced that it will be enough.  There will, of necessity, be increases in wages during the next five years and it appears that this sum will not be adequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy, we have left in the clause in the 1958 Act which gives power to CIE to close branch lines where the Board consider them to be uneconomic. We have not changed that clause and the section of the Act remains.  Secondly, I hope the subsidy will be sufficient.  It has been carefully calculated and it includes an element of redundancy compensation measured against economies effected.  It is also based on the assumption that there will be increases in wages in the next five years, consonant with the growth in national productivity on the basis of what we hope will be an intelligent calculation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest to the Government that they should alter the Act.  One can look at it quite objectively and one can see that no railway line would ever be closed, if the views of local representatives were to be entertained.  There were 528 miles of railways closed down before the 1958 Act ever came into operation. Since then, 620 miles of railway have been closed down, and the main protests <Col N="411" /> against this action in almost every case were made by people who never used the railway lines and never intended to use them.  I did not consider there was any point in changing the terms of the 1958 Act for the reason that I approved of what happened between 1958 and 1964.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question posed by Deputy Treacy, who asked whether, once an order had been made to close a route, it could be revoked, we all know that when an order is made to close a railway line, it cannot be revoked because the rails are taken up immediately; but so far as a bus route is concerned, it does not entail any capital cost to revoke the order and reopen the route.  Do I understand that the Minister will not revoke any decision made by CIE to close a bus route or that CIE will not reconsider the reopening of a closed route? If that is so, then it is useless to make representations to CIE because the decision will not be changed, and the Minister will not interfere.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should consider applications for the reopening of bus routes that have been closed.  I agree that CIE acted with indecent haste in taking up railway lines, but so far as the bus routes are concerned, there is no expenditure involved, and I am surprised that the Minister and CIE are not prepared to consider the reopening of bus routes which have been closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already dealt with this matter at immense length.  I have made it clear that I would like to review the whole question of CIE services as a whole over a period of time and in a limited way from year to year, but a transport service could not be operated efficiently if a Minister could stop bus services from closing or if the pressure of views of public representatives could alter a decision of the Board.  You cannot run a transport service in that manner.  I like to look at the general situation as a whole.  There is nothing to stop CIE reopening a bus service which has been closed, if circumstances change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard nothing here today <Col N="412" /> during the whole of this debate but criticism of the closing of one country bus service.  None of the Deputies who have spoken has given credit to CIE for the splendid work they have done in reorganising the bus services throughout the country.  There have been no complaints in the areas where the services have been reorganised as a result of intensive market research carried out by CIE.  All day there has been nothing but complaints about the closing of the Schull-Goleen service. Whenever a bus service is changed, somebody is going to suffer.  You may benefit four people and two people may be aggrieved.  I prefer to regard the question in general rather than have CIE administration interfered with week after week and month after month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it would not be undue interference with the Board of CIE on the part of the Minister if he had the right to approve or disapprove of the discontinuance of a bus service or the closing down of a railway line?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the suggestion is hopeless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion is not hopeless.  Some hundreds of miles of railway line have been taken up over the past five years.  The Minister has shown that he is able to take criticism and that he is able to resist the pressure of big deputations.  The Minister has responsibility for the provision of transport services and for seeing that CIE provides such services.  These are services that have been enjoyed by people over a long number of years. It is not possible that every single railway line or bus route will in itself be an economic venture for CIE, but, as far as we are concerned, we regard it as the function of CIE to provide a public transport service.  It is a serious matter for Waterford and Tramore, or for Schull and Goleen, or for County Monaghan when a railway service is discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why does the Minister, who has been quoting to us trends of transport all over the world, including Great Britain, not give himself the power to approve or disapprove what appears to <Col N="413" /> be drastic action to the people affected by the closing down of a railway line or the discontinuance of a bus service?  He has said that he would not do that because of what is tantamount to his fear of pressure from the public and of criticism by the Dáil.  Every Minister is subject to that. Whether they are Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, they have at times to resist criticism and the pressure of deputations. We agree that the Minister should not engage in undue interference in the day-to-day administration of CIE, or even in minor policy decisions, but it is no minor policy decision when a railway line that has been running between Waterford and Tramore for years is scrapped by what now appears to be an anonymous body, an anonymous body not responsible to anybody.</P>
    <P>If John Doe is sacked from CIE, we do not expect the Minister to defend the action of CIE in sacking him.  If CIE want to change the colour of the cushions in their carriages, we do not want the Minister to defend that action here, but when 25 miles of railway track which have been used for years and have been giving good service are taken up, it is a serious matter.  With all due respect to those who are on the board of CIE, particularly their Chairman, and having regard to their ability as experts in transport, I do not think it should be left merely to their decision.  The Minister should have some function in this and should not appear to be&mdash; I do not say he is&mdash;hiding behind the Board of CIE.</P>

      <P>The Minister will not admit it was the greatest mistake he ever made, and he has made many. This was not a railway that was not used.  It was used by 550,000 people in the last year of its existence, seven miles of railway with no intermediate stations and involving very little expenditure. The figures we got at that time from the Minister were not the correct figures.  The whole business was done with indecent haste.  The Minister has been asked a question now by Deputy Treacy and Deputy Corish and he will not face up to it. He cannot face up to being the protector of the people of Ireland, to being their representative in Dáil Éireann. We had a faceless man again.  We do not know who made out this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should it be left to the decision of a group of men in Dublin that a public amenity railway down the country is to be destroyed?  This public amenity from the city I represent to Tramore was destroyed.  It was a great loss to the ordinary working class people, to their wives and children. They do not travel on the miserable bus service with which the Minister replaced it.  The Minister gave an undertaking here and his predecessor gave an undertaking when the 1958 Act was going through that any service they would destroy&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;destroy&rdquo; deliberately &mdash; they would replace with an equal service. The Minister knows he has not done that.  I want to lay at the door of the faceless men in Kingsbridge the disgraceful vandalism they carried out there.  They went into the station house in Tramore and smashed the public convenience.  This was not done by juvenile delinquents.  It was smashed up by CIE.  At great public expense, they made a bus terminus and there was no public convenience there.  Then they said to the town commissioners in Tramore that it was their business to provide that.  They <Col N="415" /> wanted to have it charged to the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I warned this House when we were trying to reach the Minister that if they destroyed this railway, the Irish taxpayers would be mulcted in large sums of money out of the Road Fund. We were told the Tramore railway was losing £3,000 or so a year.  A sum of £52,000 has been spent already in Road Fund grants to make up for the depredation of the Minister for Transport and Power.  I know in the Minister's county there is £75,000 a year. That is a figure alone but it does show how the taxpayer is being mulcted in other ways.  It is not true that the Minister had to suffer any pressure about the railways.  He refused to receive a deputation.  I think in the end the Corkmen overpowered him and, when it came to Youghal railway, he received a deputation.</P>

In my opinion, the officers there were in outer space as far as the Tramore railway was concerned.  I have been putting down questions to the Minister as to what was the profit or loss on the bus service to Tramore, and he refused to answer me.  I know from the Pacemaker Report that he has that figure but he refuses to give it.  He is losing far more on the bus service to Tramore than the railway company was losing.  If he had been influenced by the local people who knew their business, it could have been made pay in a year.  We were very reasonable about that.  We put that proposition to the people in Kingsbridge, that some of the old policies of the Tramore railway should be continued for one year and if it did not pay, they could dig up the railway.  They closed it the following Saturday and paid men overtime on Monday to dig it up in the rain.  Every time I get an opportunity I shall keep on saying that to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I take it that amendment No. 15 is for the purpose of bringing road employees within the ambit of the redundancy compensation provision and that is the object of the amendments in the names of Deputy Byrne and myself. The Bill, as submitted by the Minister, would allow compensation for employees of CIE who lose their employment or who are disturbed by reason of any withdrawal of transport services by rail or inland waterways or having substituted diesel for steam traction or of the making of an order under section 9 of the Act of 1958 in relation to a specified level-crossing.</P>

    <P>What we seek to do here is to have these redundancy provisions applicable to CIE employees engaged on road services.

We are also aware of the great difficulty which may yet arise with the introduction of the one-man buses.  Men who entered into employment in CIE with a reasonable expectation of remaining as conductors for 30 or 40 years may find themselves withdrawn from a particular service because it is converted to one-man bus operation and being asked to move to an entirely different part of the country <Col N="419" /> for the purpose of taking up alternative employment.</P>
    <P>A case which has come to my notice in the last few years concerns a man from County Leitrim transferred to Dublin.  While in Leitrim, this man was fortunate enough to have a comfortable house and a garden for a rent of £12 per year.  That unfortunate man, since he moved to Dublin with his three children, has to pay £3 10s. for a one-room flat and he has no expectation of getting housing accommodation from Dublin Corporation within the next few years.  We are asked to believe he has not had his conditions of service worsened. Previously this man paid less than 5/-a week for his accommodation.  Now he is removed from his house and the garden in which he grew his vegetables, transported to Dublin where he has to pay £3 10s. and has no garden or facilities for growing his vegetables. That man has been seriously worsened in his employment.  He has been very seriously punished.  We believe it would not be unreasonable to provide that such an employee would have the right to elect for the compensation under this Bill or transfer to Dublin because, clearly, the hardship which is now imposed on him and the opportunities which he had in the past and has now forfeited amount to a serious worsening of the man's working conditions.</P>
    <P>Another problem we have in mind and which arises from the operation of one-man buses relates to men who for several years have been engaged as conductors on provincial bus services.  It is not unfair to say that work as a conductor on a provincial bus service with a limited number of stops is not comparable with work on a double-decker bus in Dublin where the demands on a man's stamina, energy and patience for several hours of the day can be really colossal. Whatever about the chances of a man who enters the conducting service in Dublin on double-decker buses when he is young maintaining sufficient vigour and stamina and thereby being able to operate on such a bus without undue hardship right through to his <Col N="420" /> pensionable age, it is an entirely different problem for a man who has operated on the relatively quiet provincial bus service and then finds himself transferred from that work and put on a double-decker bus in Dublin.</P>
    <P>This problem arises in particular for a number of men who for several years were working in Broadstone and whose duties in the summer months were on additional bus services put on during the tourist and holiday season. Their duties during the remainder of the year were to provide relief services for provincial buses, many of which would travel only part of the journey, then turn round, leaving one or two buses to complete the full journey.</P>
    <P>Several of these men were asked, on the introduction of one-man buses, to go on double-deck buses in Dublin. They were told they would have no right to elect out of this entirely different type of work or retire with a suitable pension.  It may well be that one would not want to leave this election open to all employees, to those who are still vigorous and those who could undertake the new duties without undue hardship.  It might be fair to say they should not be allowed the benefit of these compensation provisions but, in the case of a person of mature years, who has cast upon him an additional burden, serious consideration should be given to allowing such a person to avail of the redundancy provisions.  That is why we insert here after the sections which allow compensation to be paid to certain employees the words &ldquo;or by road&rdquo; or, if any reduction takes place in the services or personnel, compensation may be provided.  In case there is any doubt we spell out in greater detail &ldquo;or having withdrawn conductors from any omnibus service&rdquo;.  The purpose of that is to provide for one-man buses, to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is in a position to give any figures here&mdash;he may well have them but will not give them&mdash;but I understand there is an increasing number of heart conditions amongst bus employees. That is definitely so in the case of drivers.  Many men who enjoyed good <Col N="421" /> health on the Dublin tramway service find that, operating the double-deck buses, they have developed heart conditions at a relatively early age.  From my own experience of the Dublin tramway service, which was terminated, I think, twelve and fifteen years ago respectively, many of these men deteriorated in health when they went on the buses.  Men of fine physique and stamina, with pleasant personalities, when operating the trams, developed all kinds of physical complaints and became quite irritable as a result of operating buses.  In these circumstances I do not think it is unreasonable that, since we are providing compensation for certain employees, some choice should be given to these men who find themselves in their maturer years with the threat of dismissal hanging over them, without compensation, or else undertaking duties for which they are not suited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I made quite clear our reasons for excluding certain categories of workers from compensation on redundancy on the Second Stage.  It was made quite clear by the Taoiseach on the 1958 Transport Bill that the redundancy provisions were to be regarded as purely temporary. They were designed for a five-year period only.  They were put into the Bill in order to enable CIE to carry out its first programme of reorganisation quickly and to the satisfaction of the workers concerned. The rates of compensation by any standard, at home or abroad, were extremely generous, and the House knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We felt we should continue the redundancy and compensation provisions in so far as CIE are concerned by specifying the amounts on the same basis as the 1958 Act, with one or two minor changes but that, in connection with road services, in view of the general buoyant character of the road services of CIE, there should be no specific provision for compensation and CIE would negotiate with the trade unions whatever kind of agreement they could secure. That seems to me to be quite reasonable. CIE have an agreement with <Col N="422" /> the union in regard to the one-man buses and part of that agreement includes a section which stipulates that no man in regular employment will be required to transfer outside his depot area in consequence of the introduction of one-man bus operation. That is a specific answer to many of the observations of Deputy Ryan.  CIE cannot break that agreement with the union unless they negotiate changes of terms.  It is up to the union to deal with this matter.</P>

      <P>What the provision said was that, after expiry of the compensation provisions of the 1958 Transport Act on 31st March, 1964, no driver or conductor in regular employment, as defined in paragraph (1), will be disemployed in the road passenger section as a result of one-man bus operation, nor will such driver or conductor be required to transfer outside of his depot area or to work in any alternative post outside the road passenger section.  If new statutory compensation provisions are introduced after 31st March, 1964, they will apply to staff declared redundant in consequence of the further extension of one-man bus operation.  That is the position.  It is quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Why did we not provide that in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Government felt that the character of the employment in relation to road services was not the same as the character of the employment in relation to rail services.  Road services were tending to expand rather than contract. CIE are constantly taking on new conductors and drivers and the Government felt it should be possible for CIE to re-negotiate terms for severance payment and conditions of transfer.  It is a matter for CIE and the trade union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can readily appreciate the desirability of leaving all these <Col N="423" /> matters for negotiation between the company and the trade unions, but there are many problems which arise which just do not permit of things being left on that type of indefinite footing.  The Minister has put in obligatory statutory provisions here in relation to some employees.  I cannot understand why he should discriminate as between different types of employees. It would be much better, I think, to put them all in.  There are some anachronisms which do not readily appear.  I have dealt with the problem of the man who had been working for years on a provincial bus service operating out of Dublin, living in Dublin and based on the Broadstone Depot.  To transfer that man from a long route provincial bus service down to some Dublin garage, out of which double-deck buses operate from six in the morning until after midnight, is to change his occupation entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No such transfer has taken place.  The Deputy must be misinformed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be only too glad to discuss the matter with the men in the Broadstone.  I have some information, and I do not disbelieve them. If that has not taken place, then it must have been threatened.</P>
      <P>There are other problems.  Seniority rights may be jeopardised.  My information is that the Broadstone provincial bus depot has its own seniority list over the years.  The Dublin city bus services have a separate seniority list. Men leaving the Broadstone and going to the Dublin garages forfeit their right of seniority.  There are apparently all kinds of perquisites attached to seniority and it could be a serious reduction in a man's status to have such a change imposed on him.  My information is&mdash;if it is wrong, I shall be glad to have it corrected&mdash;that there are certain fringe benefits sometimes attached to the provincial bus services, particularly in relation to the summer tourist traffic, which obviously would not be available in the bustle and tumble of the daily services in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these are matters the men would <Col N="424" /> have a right to decide on.  I am forestalled to some extent by the fact that members of the Labour Party, some of whom are trade union officers, have tabled a Bill which to some extent incorporates the same idea.  This does not spell out in the same way as the rail provisions do all the benefits to be available for these workers.  We should not have the matter in doubt, as it would be even during trade union negotiations with CIE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear what the Minister has been trying to convey to the House.  We put down this amendment to try to ensure that those who may be rendered redundant will be looked after.  As far as I am aware, redundancy compensation ceased after 31st March this year for all but railway men.  Even in respect of the railway men, redundancy compensation is limited to a case of the withdrawal of a service or where dieselisation is introduced.  I am not quite clear from the Minister's reply on the position with regard to the redundancy compensation provision in respect of the operation of the one-man bus service. There was an agreement between CIE and the unions regarding this service, but two-thirds of the provincial routes have yet to go over to one-man operation.  I am not satisfied from what the Minister said, and from this section, that there is to be compensation for those who will be rendered redundant by reason of the introduction of one-man buses on the remaining two-thirds of the provincial routes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1958 Act had a section which provided that the Government would supply the money for schemes of redundancy compensation in respect of the CIE workers.  There is no such provision in this Bill.  I suppose it is safe to assume, therefore, that CIE, with the resources it has, is expected to pay compensation to the limited number defined in this section&mdash;the railwaymen rendered redundant by the closing of a service or the introduction of diesel trains.  There is no guarantee in this section either that there will be compensation for those engaged in the road passenger service and engaged in the maintenance of road transport.  There is no redundancy <Col N="425" /> compensation provision for the clerical workers in road transport.  There is no mention of the redundancy that might arise out of a scheme of reorganisation other than what is set out in the Bill. No redundancy compensation is provided for any changes that may be made in workshops by reason of the introduction of work study and all the other new methods being employed not alone in CIE but in other places as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister said these were matters to be negotiated by the trade unions with CIE.  I have a copy of the agreement made between the trade unions and CIE during the dispute in connection with the one-man buses.  I am not satisfied from it, and from the Minister's remarks, that this agreement will be applied to the type of worker I have mentioned.  The 1958 Act includes compensation provisions for many types of workers.  For that reason, this amendment was tabled by members of the Labour Party to ensure that all those rendered redundant will be compensated in some measure.</P>
    <P>CIE never seem to have regard to compensation.  They seem to be very indifferent with regard to those who suffer domestic upset.  I have known many cases of people who worked in a railway station that was closed being told they could go to some town 25 miles away where there would be a job for them.  That may be all right for CIE, but for the man rendered redundant, it is not so easy to resettle his family in a place 20 or 25 miles away. May I give the Minister an example of two men near New Ross town in a district where the railway was closed completely?  They sought redundancy compensation but were told they were not entitled to it because <Col N="426" /> there was an offer of employment with CIE in Waterford city.  I am sure the Waterford Deputies know the position with regard to housing in Waterford city.  I am sure it is hard enough for Waterford people to get houses, but I do not think anybody from the rural area of Wexford seeking a house in Waterford would be welcomed by the Corporation or the city manager.</P>
    <P>There have been scores of cases like this all over the country.  Those who cannot live 25 miles from their work because they cannot get a house discover they must give up their job altogether.  They should be compensated in some way.  I do not suggest we should give them a pension on which they might live for the rest of their lives.  Such men have been deprived of a job in which they have been for the past 20 years, perhaps. It is difficult for them to take up some other job.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that compensation provisions agreed between CIE and the unions are pretty good.  I will not say they are excellent, but in respect of the limited number of compensation provisions made, they appear to be generous.  However, there are many cases of redundancy that have not been dealt with at all.  It is for that reason we think the Minister should include in the Bill some provision which will require the Board of CIE to compensate workers who have been rendered redundant by reason of the policy operated by the Board of CIE.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
