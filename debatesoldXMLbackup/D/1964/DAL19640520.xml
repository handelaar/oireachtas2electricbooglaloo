      <P>asked the Taoiseach if there have been any recent developments concerning the application of Ireland to adhere to the European Economic Community, or if any approaches to the Commission are contemplated on behalf of this country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.</P>
      <P>Arrangements made in November last with the Commission of the European Economic Community provide for discussions, as required, on matters of mutual interest.  As I have already informed the House, a discussion at official level took place on 13th March.</P>
      <P>Our Mission in Brussels is, of course, in constant touch with Community activities.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Deputy has in mind by a separate treaty.  If he is thinking in terms of a trade agreement, I think any discussions of that kind would fall to be considered after the conclusion of the GATT negotiations which are due to start in the summer.</P>

      <P>The total number of persons on the Live Register on the 9th May, 1964 was 51,368.  The percentage unemployed is calculated by relating the number of currently insured persons on the live register, excluding those in agriculture, fishing and private domestic service, to the estimated corresponding currently insured population.

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>) asked the Minister for Health if he will give a list of health authorities (a) employing one county surgeon and (b) where there is a combined position of physician-obstetrician.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the reference in the question to &ldquo;one county surgeon&rdquo; is to those health authority areas in which the surgical services in the County Hospital are provided by a county surgeon without, normally, the assistance of doctors above the rank of Registrar.  There are 18 such areas, viz.  Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laoighis, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon, <Col N="1645" /> Sligo, Tipperary (NR), Tipperary (SR), Waterford, Westmeath and Wexford.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, I should explain that a combined post, designated physician-obstetrician, does not exist in the local health services.  The position is that normally a county physician, or a medical officer of a district hospital which has maternity accommodation, provides, as part of his duties, medical and obstetrical care and treatment for patients in the county hospital or the district hospital concerned.  In certain health authority areas, however, there are special posts of obstetrician-gynaecologist. These areas are Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, which cover the city and county, and the counties of Galway, Donegal and Sligo/Leitrim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that during the past three years there has been a surplus of from 150 to 250 beds vacant at St. Stephen's Hospital, Sarsfield's Court, Cork; that last week out of a total of 480 beds 221 were occupied and 259 were vacant; that the estimate of the manager four years ago was that each vacant bed was costing seven guineas per week in overheads of which 50 per cent was borne by the ratepayers of Cork; that this represents roughly £600 a week on the rates; and that repeated requests have been made to his Department over the past three years by the Cork Health Authority for permission to move patients out of crowded hospitals and institutions in the city to St. Stephen's without avail; and what steps he intends taking in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that there have been vacant beds during the last three years in this institution, built by my Department under the powers conferred by the Tuberculosis (Establishment of Sanatoria) Act, 1945, and presented, without charge, to the local authority, the figures quoted by the Deputy in the opening parts of his question distort the situation.  Thus, the bed complement of the institution is 469, and not 480 as stated by the <Col N="1646" /> Deputy, although its capacity was increased temporarily some years ago during a period of pressure by placing beds in a recreation centre.  Further, it appears to be the intention of the Deputy to have it implied that there were 250 vacant beds in the institution for substantial periods in the last three years.  This was not so.  It is only in recent weeks that the patient population fell to 221.</P>
      <P>I understand that a figure of seven guineas a week as the cost of a vacant bed in the institution was supplied to the Deputy by the Acting Manager in reply to a question put by the Deputy at a meeting.  There was no scientific basis for this figure and I am satisfied that it was not then a correct estimate and is not now.  Consequently, I cannot accept the Deputy's contention that vacant beds are costing Cork ratepayers £600 a week.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to state that &ldquo;repeated requests have been made to his Department over the past three years by the Cork Health Authority for permission to move patients out of crowded hospitals and institutions in the city to St. Stephen's&rdquo;.  At the end of June, 1962, the health authority submitted to my Department recommendations from the manager which included one that surplus accommodation at St. Stephen's be used in the best way possible to relieve overcrowding in St. Finbarr's and in the Mental Hospital.  Early in August, 1962, my Department asked for clarification of these recommendations and the only definite proposals received, in January, 1963, were to transfer 150 female chronic patients from the Mental Hospital to Sarsfield's Court.  As these patients were accommodated in a separate unit in the Mental Hospital and as it was the intention to demolish the accommodation in which they were housed, I do not see how the transfer could afford relief to the overcrowded conditions in the remainder of the Mental Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A majority report of a Committee set up by the health authority to consider the overall situation of the use of health authority premises in the Cork area to the best advantage of the Cork people recommended the transfer to <Col N="1647" /> Sarsfield's Court of the Orthopaedic Hospital at Gurranebraher and the use of the latter premises as a modern psychiatric hospital.  I have told the health authority on a number of occasions, in October, November and March last, that I favoured this proposal and have indicated that I am prepared to provide a grant for any necessary adaptations.  I am awaiting the decision of the health authority on that suggestion.</P>
    <P>The Deputy must surely realise that the co-operation of the health authority in this suggestion will secure the most effective use of the vacant accommodation in the Regional Sanatorium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell the House what figure could be substituted for the seven guineas mentioned in the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>The provision of a new dispensary to serve the Clashmore dispensary district is primarily a matter for the Waterford Health Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago my Department approved of the proposed purchase of a site at Clashmore for a new dispensary building but progress was at first delayed pending a review by the health authority of the boundaries of dispensary districts in the area.  The authority later decided to postpone this review and to proceed with the new dispensary at Clashmore.  Since then, I understand that some delay has been experienced in completing the <Col N="1648" /> legal formalities for the acquisition of the site but it is expected that these formalities will soon be completed.  As it is intended to plan the new building in accordance with a standard design recommended by the Department, there should be no undue delay in completing the planning and inviting tenders for the work.</P>

The contract for the building of the residence has been advertised by the local authority on two occasions but I understand that, due to difficulty experienced on each occasion in arranging adequate surety for the due performance of the contract, it was not possible to complete the contract formalities for carrying out the work.  I am informed, however, that the health authority propose to advertise the contract again very soon.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that Derrynasagart forms part of the Board's Ballyvourney rural area which was developed under the Rural Electrification Scheme in 1958-59.  Practically all the householders in this area have already had an opportunity of obtaining connection to the electricity supply but some did not accept supply because of special service charges or other reasons <Col N="1655" /> personal to the householders.  As I have stated in reply to previous questions, the Board is re-canvassing the whole country on an area basis under the revised rural scheme in order to give those houses still unconnected the best possible terms for supply.  It is expected that Ballyvourney rural area will be re-canvassed in about two years' time and that those who accept terms will be connected before the end of 1966.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if all pilots trained in this country can have their licences validated in Great Britain if they can prove adequate knowledge of Parts I and II of aviation law; and if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Current British practice is not to validate pilot licences issued by other authorities except in special circumstances.  The holder of an Irish professional pilot's licence who wished to fly British registered aircraft would normally be required to obtain the appropriate British licence.  Each case is considered on its merits but in general the British authorities allow the holder of an Irish pilot's licence to dispense with a number of these examinations and tests, depending on his experience, qualifications and training background.  Certain of the tests are, however, obligatory, incuding Aviation Law Flight Rules and Procedures, which corresponds to Part I of our Aviation Law examination.</P>
      <P>There is no international agreement on the extent to which countries will validate, or give licences in exchange for, foreign licences but the European Civil Aviation Conference of which Ireland and Great Britain are members is considering whether there could be agreement amongst the members that the holder of an Airline Transport Pilot's licence when applying for the corresponding foreign licence should be exempted from ground examinations, it being recognised that in most cases an examination in local aviation regulations would be required.</P>

      <P>The British authorities do not discriminate against our pilots as such.  They apply the same rules to Irish pilots as they do to those of other countries.  Our standards are sufficiently high and, apart from learning the regulations, all our pilots should be accepted.  I have not yet had any complaints about our pilots getting employment in Britain.

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that the Kildare portion of the Cork-Dublin <Col N="1666" /> road has now been signposted by wooden crosses marking the scenes of fatalities by car accidents; if he is aware of the period within which these marked fatalities occurred; and if he will introduce a general speed limit of 55 mph for a trial period on the main Cork-Dublin road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that temporary white wooden crosses have ben erected to mark the sites of fatal accidents on all roads in County Kildare and that these have been provided by a local road safety committee in connection with a recent road safety week.  While my Department is not responsible for this particular campaign, I understand that the accidents concerned are those in respect of which local information is available and that in general they took place during the past 15 years. With regard to the third part of the Deputy's question, I would point out that the regulations necessary to impose the &ldquo;general&rdquo; speed limit referred to could not be made by me save on the application of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or of the road authorities concerned.  The Deputy will appreciate that as the Cork-Dublin road varies greatly in standard from place to place the imposition of a uniform speed limit over its entire length might not be desirable.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government when he intends to implement the Dublin town plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Planning Scheme which was made by Dublin Corporation in 1957 will be superseded by the development plan which the Corporation will be required to make under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  It will be the duty of the planning authority to take the necessary steps for securing the objectives which are contained in the development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the question I asked the Minister.  I asked about the implementation of the new Dublin town plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he envisages much change in the centre of Dublin city because of the implementation of the new town plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a matter for Dublin Corporation to decide on planning objectives for the centre of Dublin when they are making their development plan for the city in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  It would be premature for me to attempt to forecast in detail the possible effects of the plan on the central city area.  I may say, however, that the Act requires any such plan to contain certain specific provisions such as the re-development of obsolete portions of the area and the improvement of conditions governing traffic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this not indicate that Dublin Corporation are being unfairly discriminated against inasmuch as tenants of rural cottages do get the benefit of subsidy when they are purchasing whereas I am under the impression the Corporation have been informed that they cannot bring in a purchase scheme because, if they do, they will not get the benefits that now accrue by way of subsidy?  Is this not discrimination and is it not unfair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of urban authorities have made tenant purchase schemes despite the fact that this subsidy is not available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give any reason for this discrimination against the urban authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1668" />
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of discrimination against the urban authorities. It is considered necessary that urban authorities should retain control of a number of these houses which they erect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not correct that the encouragement to rural persons is for the purpose of keeping them all in the country and to prevent them from coming up to Dublin?  Is that not the answer we got before?  When you get a cheap house in the country you stay in it and do not come up to Dublin and crowd us out further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall keep the the Deputy in Dublin, anyway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The adult dependant's allowance is 37/6d. not 32/6d.  This is payable to a male old age, contributory, pensioner only if he is living with or wholly or mainly maintaining his <Col N="1676" /> wife.  If neither of these conditions is fulfilled the allowance is not payable. The allowance is an integral part of the pension and, accordingly, is payable to the pensioner and not to the adult dependant.  However, I am making regulations which will empower me to pay the allowance to the adult dependant where the circumstances so warrant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations have not been drafted yet but there must be some good reason why the allowance should be paid direct to the wife rather than to the husband because it is an integral part of the contributory old age pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but I think the Minister said if the husband were, in fact, supporting his wife, the amount would be payable.  In this case the husband and wife are living apart, and have been for many years.  If the husband formally notifies the Minister of his desire that the 37/6d. should be paid to his wife as his support of her, would that fulfil the condition?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Land Commission's investigations regarding this estate, referred to in my reply to the Deputy's previous question on 9th ultimo, will be completed shortly and that an early decision will be reached in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is at least two months since I first put down this question.  As the Minister is aware, this particular farm has already been purchased by a German.  The full particulars are before the Minister's authority and by the Minister's evasive answers here on the past few occasions the people of Lackaroe in North Tipperary are being blinded while foreigners are buying Tipperary land.</P>

      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy has alleged.  The Deputy <Col N="1679" /> had one question here in regard to this matter, as far as I am aware, and he got a reply that due to pressure of resale work in the district, the Land Commission had not completed their investigations into this estate.  That was the position.  I understand that their investigations are now practically completed and that they expect to be in a position to give a decision on the matter at a very early date.  That is my information.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1964&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The principal purpose of the Finance Bill is to implement the Budget proposals in legislative form and in that way to provide the revenue necessary to meet the year's expenditure.  This year the Finance Bill is comparatively short and there is little in it which was not mentioned in the Financial Statement.  I shall refer specifically to the additional items later; none of them is of a contentious nature.  The explanatory memorandum, which was circulated with the text of the Bill, described the purpose of the various sections individually and it is hardly necessary for me to repeat this information in detail. The Bill is essentially a Committee Stage Bill and I shall, of course, be glad to explain any points of detail on that Stage.  I will now deal broadly with the effects of each part of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is only one matter dealt with in Part I which was not mentioned in the Budget speech.  Section 12 enables interest to be paid without deduction of tax on securities issued by the air companies.  This provision, and the provision in section 32, are being made to facilitate the air companies in raising some of their capital requirements from non-Government sources. Similar provisions already apply to borrowing by the Electricity Supply Board, Córas Iompair Éireann, Bord na Móna and local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1701" /> As regards the other sections in Part I, the first section imposes income tax and surtax for the current year at the same rates as were in force last year and sections 2 to 11 carry into effect certain of the budget proposals.  The proposed reliefs comprise a new form of income tax age allowance, relief for small incomes and exemption from income tax of the business of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. The other measures deal with tax avoidance, tax simplification, taxation of foreign profits of companies and recovery of tax arrears.</P>
    <P>Five of the nine sections in Part II relate to the budget increases in the rates of duty on beer, imported spirits, hydrocarbon oils and tobacco.  It is proposed not to extend the increased duty on imported spirits to Northern Ireland whiskey; section 15 provides the necessary relief.  Sections 18 to 21, inclusive, deal with matters which were not mentioned in the budget speech. These comprise revision of the rates of duty for firearm certificates, exemption from road tax for snow-clearing vehicles and provisions in relation to proceedings for hydrocarbon oil offences.  A Financial Resolution will be necessary in connection with the firearm certificate duty which, as the explanatory memorandum pointed out, follows an enactment of the Firearms Act, 1964.</P>
    <P>Part III contains only one section. This is designed to exempt from death duties Government and other securities on the surrender of a life-interest in a trust.  Such securities would not have been liable had the trust been terminated by the death of the lifetenant.</P>
    <P>Part IV contains some measures to simplify stamp duty which were foreshadowed in the Budget speech.  Certain duties, which yield an insignificant amount of revenue, are being abolished and the composition arrangement for payment of stamp duty which the Revenue Commissioners are empowered to operate under section 45 of the Finance Act, 1963, is being extended.</P>
    <P>Part V contains four corporation profits tax proposals, all of which <Col N="1702" /> were referred to in the budget speech. They deal with the carrying-forward of losses, the application of corporation profits tax to private unlimited companies, the raising of the deduction allowable in respect of directors' remuneration and the assessment and collection of corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with miscellaneous items.  The usual provisions regarding the Capital Services Redemption Account are contained in section 29; section 32, as I mentioned already, extends to securities issued by the air companies the tax concessions given to non-resident holders of certain Irish government securities. Section 33 deals with repeals.  The content of sections 30 and 31 was adverted to in the budget speech. Section 30 retains for bacon curers the benefit of exports tax relief which might otherwise have been lost as a result of the now compulsory marketing arrangements.  Section 31 provides for the collection of the amount of tax not in dispute when an assessment is under appeal.</P>
    <P>The two remaining sections in the Bill and the Schedules do not call for specific comment.  As I have mentioned, I shall be glad to deal with any points of detail on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, this is the Bill that gives legislative implementation to the Budget. The views we have expressed, and the views I have expressed on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, are already on record, but there are some points which it is necessary to repeat.  Before doing that, however, there are a few details I want to mention, not so much for the purpose of getting an explanation from the Minister now, but because it might be of advantage to him to have notice of them before Committee Stage.  As he said, this is a Committee Stage Bill as regards details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I read the Bill several times, I do not understand the exact significance of the change in the allowances from unearned income which is brought in under section 2.  A more <Col N="1703" /> elaborate explanation than is included in the paragraph dealing with it in the explanatory memorandum might be desirable.  As I understand it, whether I understand it correctly or not, a person gets the combination of the two allowances up to £500 and if one allowance falls short of that amount he gets the other.  He can make the first calculation on an allowance of £100 on one side and £400 on the other, or exactly as it works out.  I should like it to be clear beyond question that the full amount of the £500 limit can be made up between different allowances.</P>
    <P>I have never been quite clear as to what benefit was expected in relation to the centralisation of tax collection in the hands of one collector general. That is a matter on which we might get some information.</P>
    <P>There is also in the Bill a section which deals with firearm certificates and firearm licences.  I do not understand whether there is, in fact, any change from the existing law in that respect.  I am a bit puzzled to know why, when we have the imposition of a firearms duty in the Finance Bill, there has not been a financial resolution on which to base the section.  I understood that every charge made in a Finance Bill had to be based on a financial resolution.  It would be interesting to know why that was not required in this Act, under the Standing Order.</P>
    <P>In its detailed provisions the Bill also gives very wide powers of interrogation to Revenue under section 19.  While I understand and appreciate the necessity for wide powers in relation to the investigation of smuggling offences, at the same time it seems to me that the powers given in this section are drastic, to say the least of it.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the manner in which section 22 has been introduced, and the manner in which Revenue quickly appreciated the problem when it was brought to their notice under the Finance Act, 1951.  I also appreciate the manner in which the Minister dealt with it so expeditiously. <Col N="1704" /> It is quite clear that the section is now brought in to legislate for what I believe was intended by successive Ministers for Finance when they were introducing national loans and saying that national loans would not be subject to any taxation if in the hands of non-Irish residents.  Once the point was brought to attention that the 1951 Act had been framed in a way that was rather wider than was anticipated, it was dealt with very speedily.  It is only right that that should be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>There is very considerable unrest in the country because of the fact that in this Bill, and in his Budget statement, the Minister has not taken any account of the decreasing value of money so far as income tax allowances are concerned. People hoped and expected that the tax which would be collected out of the wage increases would be offset to some degree by an enlargement of the personal and marriage allowances. As I said during the Budget debate, there has been considerable dissatisfaction because the principle has not been accepted that it costs two people twice as much to live as one, and that the marriage allowance for tax purposes is not twice the single allowance.  Even if the Minister was not in a position to go the whole way in increasing the marriage allowance this year, it would have been worthwhile making some move in that direction in acknowledgement of the principle involved.</P>
    <P>There is also very great anxiety about the manner in which the scope of the tax net has been widened to bring the man who produces broiler chickens in under the Schedule D assessment instead of the Schedule B assessment.  That has caused very considerable anxiety in many parts of the country and particularly, I understand, in the Monaghan-Cavan area.  I am afraid it is perhaps only the thin end of the wedge and that there is the danger that it may pass on to people producing pigs in any intensive fashion. Certainly that was not the intention when the original Act was being framed.</P>
    <P>It is particularly unfortunate in relation to the broiler chickens because <Col N="1705" /> in that industry you have a type of house that has a very short life and yet I understand that depreciation, with the charges under Schedule D, is limited to two per cent, that is to say, putting the life of the house at 50 years.  Ten years would be a much more realistic figure, and perhaps a maximum figure, for the building used for chicken rearing.  I am told that from eight to ten years is the basis upon which the ordinary person frames his estimates.  It is wrong that they should be taxed under Schedule D at all but if they are it is absolutely monstrous that depreciation should be permitted only at a rate of two per cent, equivalent to, and appropriate perhaps, much more for the solid type of industrial building that is usually envisaged.</P>
    <P>I understand that it is alleged that Revenue have no discretion at all in relation to that and that they are completely caught by the Act which provides that a two per cent building depreciation should be allowed. Frankly, I have never quite been able to discover the basis of reasoning under which market gardens were assessed in the same way, but that type of assessment has gone on for a long time.  Because to some extent this is a new sector in agriculture, it is something that should be amended.</P>
    <P>I also understand that there is a new outlook in relation to the road taxation of certain vehicles used for road construction.  That is something which will require amendment.  The position is that machines used on the road are not liable to pay tax to the Road Fund but the machine that takes the drill or the compressor into the quarry where the road material is raised is so liable although it is only used for going from one quarry to another.  It seems to me that that is wrong and I hope on the Committee Stage to be able to persuade the Minister by means of an amendment to change it and go back to the practice we had.</P>
    <P>I should like also an assurance from him at the same time that whatever the law may be at present in relation to the broiler chicken industry there <Col N="1706" /> will not be any question of going back retrospectively to earlier years because people genuinely did not believe they were liable for assessment under Schedule D under the existing law, if they are so liable, and it would thus seem to be wrong for the matter to be taken up retrospectively now.</P>
    <P>The Bill, although it does not mention the tax in so many words, is, of course, a general taxation Bill and, therefore, it would be appropriate to say a word on the turnover tax in relation to it.  Everybody is finding that the administration of the tax is costing more than was anticipated.  It may be costing the Minister very little, from his own revenue point of view, to administer the tax but that is because he has passed off the job on to the business community.  There should be some system of discount to offset the additional charge which the business community have to provide. Only the other day I came across certain information regarding turnover taxes on the Continent in the European Economic Community.  I want to mention this for the purpose of showing that what we said at that time was right and the information that was given by the Minister was wrong.  He contradicted us flatly when we said then that on the Continent turnover taxes for the most part exempted basic foods.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to Belgium, for example, where they have a multistage cumulative tax on all transactions up to but not beyond the retail level, is that basic foods and most services are exempted, The position in France, where they have the added value tax, is that basic food products are exempted. In Germany where they have a multistage cumulative tax, basic necessities are either exempted or are charged at a lower rate.  In Italy they have a multi-stage cumulative tax with many modifications and few exemptions.  I do not know the position in relation to Luxembourg but in the Netherlands there are many exemptions.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it would have been quite in accord with the European pattern for the Minister to have done what he was asked to do in relation to that tax, <Col N="1707" /> to exempt the essential foodstuffs.  It is also unfortunate that the House was misled, if you like, in relation to the practice on the Continent and that there was not some authoritative document available at that time, but there is, of course, the great difficulty in dealing with Continental taxation that one is not only dealing with a system foreign to our way of taxation but, in addition to that, books on it in English are not very readily available.</P>
    <P>I also found it interesting to discover that the taxes on capital, in so far as death duties are concerned, in the Community are very much lower than here. With the exception of Great Britain, no country appears to have the type of death duty taxation we have.  I appreciate that ours is changed from the British model and that we have a top rate of 40 per cent compared with the British 80 per cent, but, even so, the difference between our rates and the rates of the Continent is very striking. In Belgium, where the beneficiary is a child, the rate rises from 1¼ per cent at the bottom to a maximum of 14 per cent.  That is where the beneficiary is a child and that is the type of case we would naturally like to have here.</P>
    <P>There is a much higher rate where property is given to someone who is not a relative.  In France, between 1956 and 1960, the tax levied on the total value of the estate of a deceased person was at a maximum of five per cent.  I think that has been varied since 1960 and now the position is that relatives get a different rate.  It runs ultimately up to 15 per cent on both bequests and <i>inter vivos</i> gifts.</P>
    <P>In Germany, again where a child is concerned, the rate rises from two per cent up to 15 per cent.  In Italy, it is more like our pattern, rising to 35 per cent in the highest cases.  I am not quite clear what the position is in relation to Luxembourg.  It probably follows the pattern of the other Benelux countries but I am unable to say. In the Netherlands, again in the case of a child beneficiary, the rate rises from three per cent up to a maximum of 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>Those figures show that the pattern <Col N="1708" /> we have here in relation to death duties is more penal than those of the six members of the European Economic Community.  I appreciate that because of special circumstances here, we must give consideration to the position in Britain under the double taxation agreement, that a person coming in here must not merely become resident or domiciled here but must in addition transfer into Irish securities of some sort if duty is to be avoided or imposed at the lower rate.</P>
    <P>One of the indications is that it would be worth while as a means of attracting additional capital if we follow the pattern on the Continent rather than that of Great Britain.  The Minister has in section 15 of this Bill abrogated the idea that used to be held strongly that it was not possible to make a differentiated tax in that respect.  If it can be done in relation to Scotch whisky, it can equally be done in relation to death duties and should be done for the purpose of attracting more capital.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself implements the Budget. It is the legislative enactment which puts up the price of beer.  It is the legislative enactment responsible for the increase in customs duty on whisky.  Apart from any other aspect, I may say in that respect that it is not at all certain, and is not considered at all certain in the trade, that that is likely to be of benefit in the long run. I agree it may be of short term benefit to the trade and, of course, to the revenue.  However, it is utterly impossible to reconcile the increase in the customs duty over the excise duty here with our application to GATT or with our anxiety to level out for adherence to the EEC in 1970 or, indeed, with the dismantling of tariffs which is being dealt with already in two instalments.</P>
    <P>The Bill also is the legislation that imposes the additional tax on petrol and on diesel oil.  Somebody said here in the Budget debate that the duty on petrol had been increased during the time we were in office.  Of course it was, but at that time Governmental policy was to try to push as much traffic as possible on to the railways and it was in keeping with that policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1709" /> This increase comes on top of that, so that it is entirely irrelevant to refer to it in this respect.  The cost of distribution will be felt everywhere and such a tax is bound to have its effect in increasing the cost of living.  Virtually all heavy goods are now carried in diesel lorries.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had wanted to deal with the matter from a pleasure point of view he could easily have exempted heavy hydrocarbon oil.  If he had done so, it would not have had the effect of adding to the cost of distribution and, therefore, to the cost of living.  Apart from that, this increase will put a very distinct brake on productivity and will mean that business people, manufacturers, will find it hard to keep their costs down and to compete in the export market.  The Bill follows a bad Budget, and because it is an implementation of a bad Budget, it follows also that it is a bad Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow the line taken by Deputy Sweetman, particularly in its brevity and in not endeavouring to open a general Budget debate on this Finance Bill because I do not think it would serve any useful purpose to reiterate our attitude towards the various measures in the Budget and to the criticisms we have of the Government's administration over the past 12 months or five years. Therefore I do not intend to repeat my own Budget speech or to repeat the comments and opinions I had to offer then.  It would only lead to a refutation of these opinions by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I find it necessary to restate our stand on certain of the Budget proposals introduced here a couple of months ago and to reiterate our opposition to the measure which introduced the turnover tax last year.  We still think it is deplorable that this tax should include a tax on food and medicines.  I do not know the source from which Deputy Sweetman quoted but he did indicate to the House that in countries which we were told have a turnover tax, certain food items and other necessaries of life are excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister introduced this tax last year, a tax on everything purchased. <Col N="1710" /> He has had experience of its working for a year and a half and his officials have had time to sit back and see how it operates.  After even a cursory exmination of its operation over the past 15 months, the Minister must now conclude that there is no justification for taxing essential foodstuffs.  We are told that to exempt foodstuffs would mean that the tax would have to be much more than 2½ per cent but I think there is no moral justification for a tax on food and I should be interested to hear from the Minister what countries operate a turnover tax on foodstuffs, medicines and other articles regarded as essential if people are to have minimum comforts.</P>
    <P>This turnover tax was introduced as a permanent method of gaining revenue and, as somebody said, it is a sure-fire way of getting money.  Whilst having regard to the responsibility of the Government for the economy of the country, we ought also to be concerned with the moral question of whether we should tax bread, meat, butter or clothing.  We have been told in recent years that we will have to conform to certain standards in other countries, to their industrial practices, to their ideas of agriculture, and we are being told that we will have to adjust ourselves to the methods employed in other countries, particularly the six countries that are now members of EEC.  I suggest that we ought to have a look at their taxation methods as well.  I would also suggest that the system under which we work, with an emphasis on indirect taxation, is entirely different from the pattern of taxation in other countries in Europe and is different from the percentage of indirect taxation in Britain.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party deplore the emphasis on indirect taxation.  It is stated Government policy to increase indirect taxation and to reduce direct taxation.  That is contrary to social justice and does not get the proper results.  There should be an attempt to reverse engines and to bring up direct as against indirect taxation on the same pattern as obtains in many countries in western Europe at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister was good enough, in <Col N="1711" /> his reply to the Budget debate, to refer to the capital gains tax suggested by me and he said that we would not get a lot of money out of it.  I do not know if he could give, when replying to the debate on this Bill, an estimate of what he might get, because I do not think we can afford to cast aside any source of tax revenue as long as it brings in any money.  All these small things add up and the revenue from a capital gains tax would mean assistance for some section of the community.  If it did, it would be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Earlier today we were told that the increase in the tax on snuff would bring in £10,000.  It was referred to as merely £10,000 but obviously the Minister wants that money.  I suggest that he should consider taxing money which, at the present time, has little or no tax whatever on it.  I cannot pretend to be an expert on capital gains tax but I know that it operates successfully in Britain.  I may be told that there is not sufficient wealth in this country to warrant the imposition of such a tax but I believe there is moral justification for it and that if it brought in only £5, it would be well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his reply to the Budget debate, also dealt with social welfare and with the criticism by the Labour Party that not enough money was given for social welfare.  He went on to show that from 1954 to 1957 and from 1948 to 1951, there were certain increases but that they were not at all comparable with the increases given in the past five years.</P>
    <P>As far as the amount of the increases is concerned, one might say the Minister is correct but there are other factors to be considered in relation to social welfare.  There is the cost of living and, from 1948 to 1957, the subsidisation of foodstuffs.  There is also the point I made on the Budget that at that time more was spent on social welfare as a percentage of tax revenue.  I went on to say then that as far as the past five or six years are concerned there has been a gradual decline in social welfare payments as a percentage of tax revenue.  I believe, <Col N="1712" /> therefore, that when people are prone to talk of the national cake, they are inclined to forget that social welfare recipients are not getting their fair share.  They were getting a bigger share from 1954 to 1957, a bigger share in 1948.</P>
    <P>That is the net point I wish to make. I shall concede anything else the Minister for Social Welfare or the Minister for Finance says on this question.  When you talk about the amounts, you must relate them to the cost of living and to other things, as I have been pointing out.  The big test in this matter is that while we all agree social welfare recipients are now getting more than they were getting, their share of the national cake has been getting smaller during the past five years.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister, in his speech today, dealt with the question of tax, particularly on tobacco. Last year many people accepted his statement that tobacco, and incidentally drink, could not be taxed because taxation on them had more or less reached saturation point.  Would the Minister in his reply now tell us what change has come about in the past 12 months that has induced the Government to fall back on those old sources of revenue?  There was an implication in the Minister's Budget Statement that this tax was designed to ensure that people would either cut down or give up smoking.  At the moment we do not know whether this tax on tobacco is a deterrent or a revenue tax.  There must be an explanation for the Government's change of feet on the question of tobacco and drinking.  Last year we were given to understand that these forms of taxation had reached saturation point.</P>
    <P>My main purpose in contributing&mdash;I shall be very brief&mdash;was to raise the question of income tax on co-operative societies.  In the 1963 Budget, the traditional exemption of co-operative societies from income tax was brought to an end but the exemption was continued for agricultural and for fishery co-operatives.  This was in order to ensure that the non-genuine co-operative <Col N="1713" /> societies would not receive this income tax advantage.  I do not believe this is the real cure.  The real cure&mdash;and this is not a matter at all for the Minister for Finance but for the whole Government&mdash;is an amendment of the law so that these non-genuine co-operatives will be cut out.</P>
    <P>At the present time the income tax exemption applies to those societies engaged in agriculture and fisheries. In 1957, the Minister for Industry and Commerce set up the Committee on Co-operative Societies.  For seven or eight years, that committee rather disappeared from view, did not seem to be taking any action.  Then, last summer, there was a report which contained certain recommendations.  I suggest these recommendations should be considered for the purpose, particularly, of offering exemption from income tax for the purpose of encouraging the growth of co-operative societies.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote part of this report of the Committee on Co-operative Societies.  At page 41, it states:</P>
    <P>The present position is satisfactory in so far as genuine co-operatives are concerned.  There is, however, a probability of abuse by societies which, though holding themselves out as co-operatives, do not observe true co-operative principles in their activities.  This situation could lead to the withdrawal of the tax privilege from all societies, including the genuine co-ops.  The arrangements which we recommend for restricting the use of the term &ldquo;co-operative&rdquo; to genuine co-operative societies would provide a means of eliminating these tax abuses.  While having regard to the recommendations in the Fifth Report of the Commission on Income Taxation and to the intentions of the Government as indicated in the Second White Paper on Direct Taxation laid before the Oireachtas in April, 1963, and in the Financial Statement of the Minister for Finance when introducing the Budget, 1963, we feel generally that the current tax exemption should be preserved for genuine co-operative societies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1714" /> Most of us are in general agreement that there should be encouragement of genuine co-operative societies.  Those engaged in agriculture and fisheries are being encouraged as far as income tax is concerned and I should like to appeal to the Minister to include genuine industrial co-operative societies, because, as far as I know, such societies have not got any income tax exemption at the moment.</P>
    <P>I know there are not very many industrial co-operative societies in the country&mdash;I suppose not more than half a dozen&mdash;but if the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce are satisfied these industrial co-operative societies are genuine, they should apply the tax exemptions to them.  I have a case before me&mdash;I do not intend to give the name&mdash;of a co-operative society which was established four or five years ago.  One could call it a genuine co-operative society.  It employs 18 people, has a management committee of 12 people who are equivalent to a board of directors but who are unpaid.  The society engage in all types of co-operative work and do good social work.  It is a genuine, non-profit making concern as far as the individuals are concerned.</P>
    <P>I believe such an effort should be encouraged by inclusion in the income tax exemption now applied to agricultural and fishery co-operatives. The Minister may not be in a position to comment on it now but I would ask him between now and Committee Stage to see how he could include this type of society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points I should like to raise on the Bill which, possibly, the Minister might prefer to deal with on Committee Stage.  I do so in order to give him an opportunity to consider any suggestions I might see fit to make.  If the Minister gives me a reply it will, perhaps, give me an opportunity to deal more fully with the matter on Committee Stage</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> No. 77, there is a reference to the net income from abroad.  It is indicated there that the gross national <Col N="1715" /> production in 1960 benefited to the extent of £34 million from the inflow of capital from different sources&mdash;remittances, external investments, and so on.  It goes on to state that, by 1970, it is anticipated that this inflow will be reduced by half.  That means that the gross national production will benefit to the extent of £16 million at that period as against £30 million today.</P>
    <P>It strikes me that with a heavy adverse trade balance of somewhere in the neighbourhood of £110 million, it will be necessary to endeavour to replace in some way that reduction in the inflow of liquid money into this State.  The Minister will probably reply that the economy is supposed to be expanding to such a vast extent that that will entirely offset any difficulties that may accrue from this problem. Again, I come back to the fact that, with this huge adverse trade balance, for a country such as this which is practically bereft of raw material so that we have to import so many raw materials for the servicing of our industries and the continuation of employment here, it is a matter that must be given the gravest consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman has dealt with this point to a lesser degree already.  I refer to the imposition of estate duty here.  Before I go any further, I want to say that, to my mind, the imposition of estate duty is one of the most compelling factors in a reduction of employment. Take a well established industry&mdash;even a farm, for that matter. The principal dies and there is this imposition of death duties which, to all intents and purposes, is a capital levy.  It embarrasses financially the business firm or whatever the undertaking may be which, very often, is being divided among several members of the same family.  To that extent, it creates a situation that is not desirable from any angle of employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to consider seriously, in regard to the figures he gave me the other day, whether the State as a whole, in its financial structure, is or is not benefiting from these impositions.  Deputy Sweetman gave a brief <i>résumé</i> of the position with regard to estate duty within the EEC countries. <Col N="1716" /> We are assured by the Taoiseach that we shall be a member of the EEC by 1970.  I do not accept that.  However, suppose the Taoiseach is correct and that we have become a member by that time.  We shall then have to try to bring ourselves in some way into alignment with the other member countries. Our financial structure and our tax system are based entirely on the British system.</P>
    <P>The yield of death duties, according to a reply the Minister gave me to a question the other day, sets out the figures for the past three years.  In 1962, the amount collected from death duties was practically £2½ million.  In 1963, the amount was just under £3 million and in 1964 the amount was just over £3 million.  I tried to get from the Minister the cost of collecting this tax but he was unable to give me the information.  I can appreciate that situation.  He gave me a rough figure of £105,000 a year.  It probably costs a great deal more than that.  The Minister could not break it down absolutely and completely.</P>
    <P>To come back to our inflow of capital from overseas investments, and so on, which the Minister says will be cut by half, I submit that if we take a courageous step and we wipe out to a large extent the imposition of death duties, it will be to the immense benefit of our economy.  Estate duties are something which we have inherited from the British tax system and adhered to with an undying devotion. Every time I mention this matter in this House, I am told that, because of the reciprocal arrangements which we have with the United Kingdom and with other countries, it is impossible for us to do anything about it.  Have we not a different percentage rate of income tax from that of the United Kingdom?  Is there not a reciprocal agreement which is working well, without any difficulties?</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not prepared to go the whole way and to abolish the estate duties, then if he will greatly reduce this tax, he will get an inflow of capital from abroad which will offset the £16 million which his Government anticipate, according to this document, they will lose within <Col N="1717" /> the next ten years.  Not only will he get that inflow but we shall have a stupendous inflow of capital into this country which could rise even as high as £100 million of hot money and which would be invested here.</P>
    <P>It is further stated that if there is an abolition of death duties and if people bring money in here from another country, it means that the outside individual's rights are being filchea brought the actual money into the country and invested it here to the extent to which I believe they would, then all the Government's problems with regard to capital investment, social expansion, and so on, would be solved overnight.  It is a matter that is worth considering.  The Minister should take his courage in his hands and do something about it.  I am raising it now in order to give the Minister and those who advise him a chance to consider it well.  Those who advise the Minister are naturally conservative.  It is their job to be conservative and to safeguard the finances of the country. Fundamentally, the point is that we want the Minister to get as much capital as possible into our country.</P>
    <P>We are a country whose economy is expanding and is bound to expand.  If our economy does not expand and does not get the opportunity to expand, then we shall not be able to check the two critical ills that exist in this country, namely, unemployment and emigration.  I do not care what Ministers may say when they come into this House about our economic situation improving and that, by 1970, emigration, and so on, will be cured.  I do not accept that.  I am an elected Parliamentary representative who knows what is going on.  These are views expressed to the Minister by his economic advisers who read balances of payments, economic trends, and so on.  Even if they offer that advice, I personally find it hard to appreciate how they can do so because there are so many disquieting features in our economy today.</P>
    <P>In the 1963 Budget, the Minister introduced a system whereby it was mandatory on whoever are responsible for banks to issue to the Revenue <Col N="1718" /> authorities, on request, particulars of the finances held by any client in the banks.  That was a revolutionary step of which many people disapproved.  In the bureaucratic age into which we are moving, when the State is supposed to do everything and the private individual's rights are being filched from him, I suppose that we have to accept it.  Maybe we are moving to the left: I do not know.  Can the Minister give this House any indication of the benefits that accrued from that step? Did he collect a lot of extra taxation? Was it worthwhile creating a situation whereby financial secrets held by the banks to whom the client entrusts his money and the individual concerned are being divulged?  Did the State get sufficient revenue in return?</P>
    <P>Before finishing on that subject, I want to tell the Minister of a case, several cases in fact, that came to my notice at the same time the other day in my capacity as a public representative. Three or four persons were written to, to the effect that they were not disclosing their full incomes.  The agent or person acting for them endeavoured to find out from the income tax official what particular section of their income they were not disclosing.  The inspector said he could not divulge that, that it was a secret matter.  He would not let the agent know what they were supposed to be concealing in the way of moneys legally due to the State under laws passed here.  Eventually, the people concerned, not knowing what the income tax official had mind, asked if it had anything to do with banking.  The guarded reply they got was that if they went along something on those lines, it would be all right.</P>
    <P>I mention that to show how utterly farcical the situation is.  If private individuals, or those acting for them, must disclose to these officials their private affairs if the State is questioning anything, why should the State be so cautious in return and the official not be able to tell them what the particular items are?  It seems absolutely farcical that the State should have power on the one side to seek all information and the private individual none whatever and cannot even be <Col N="1719" /> told what charge the State is making against him.  Perhaps the Minister would consider these matters and try to clarify the position in regard to our tax laws which are complicated and I believe in many cases, wanting in justice.</P>
    <P>The turnover tax, I gather, is now operating fully and to the satisfaction of the Government, though perhaps not in regard to the return they expected in view of the Budget we were presented with the other day, the financial provisions of which we are now discussing.  As Deputy Barry reminds me, the turnover tax income exceeds their expectations by £3 million and yet they are &ldquo;in the red&rdquo; and had to come along and blister the backs of the people.  Possibly they felt safe in doing so after their recent victories in two by-elections.  Many big businesses are concerned and are collecting the tax for the Government whose officials have nothing to do but rake in the money.  Has the Minister given due consideration to this in remission of income tax expenses to the firms concerned in respect of the staffs necessary? Some firms have had to employ considerable staff to do the book-keeping necessary to collect for the Minister the money payable under the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider the three points I have raised.  If he can reply on the Second Stage, I shall be happy to hear him because it will place me in a stronger position to discuss the matter on Committee Stage. If the Minister can give a full and clear answer, if his officials can advise him in that respect, it might considerably shorten the Committee Stage discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the Government are to be blamed for everything.  All kinds of promises are made by those not in office and those who cannot hope to be able to fulfil the promises but the peculiar position is that those who promise us heaven on earth can offer no alternative to the Government's method of raising the necessary finances.  Members have advocated doubling pensions, even <Col N="1720" /> doubling salaries in some cases, and, generally speaking, colossal increases which would run into scores of millions of pounds but they have not stated the source from which they will obtain the revenue.  It is hard for people with commonsense to accept these suggestions. If these people are prepared to come in and place concrete proposals before the House regarding the methods by which they will raise the necessary money, many members would carefully consider such proposals. But that has not happened and until it does, my mind will not change.</P>
      <P>It appears that we have now reached the position in which only the rich man is to be considered.  The Opposition have decided to defend him against everybody else.  It is stated here that the Government have power to look into the financial position of various rich people.  But is it not true that for the past 30 years the Government have had power to look into the financial position of the poor people?  If a man applies for the dole or the old age pension; if a widow applies for a pension, are the Government not in a position to inquire into their means? Why should there be any clique in the happy position that the Government are not able to inquire into their means?  That would not be right or fair.</P>
      <P>It is a shocking travesty of justice that people should stand up here and take up the attitude that it is wrong to inquire into the rich man's means. Nobody has stood up and said it is wrong to inquire into the poor man's means.  Let nobody be foolish enough to believe that the people outside do not see through this joke: you can examine the means of the applicant for the dole, or the old age pension but you cannot inquire into the means of the billionaire.  What kind of Government or what kind of law would we have if that were the position?  It would be completely wrong.  It is well past time that inquiries should be made into the means of some of these people because they have been getting away with murder, as we know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister publicly on his efforts to catch up with them and to bring into the State's coffers <Col N="1721" /> the millions of pounds of which the State has been defrauded over the years.  A poor man in my area applies for the dole and an official investigates his case thoroughly but in the case of a big shopkeeper there should be no inquiries at all.  Do they think it is in Tibet or on Mount Athos we are living?  It is time we had a change.</P>
    <P>A great hullabaloo has been made about the turnover tax.  That has been going for the past 12 months and is continued here today.  Where are we to get the revenue we require otherwise? Is it to be the position that the only person who must pay for the running of the country is the person who drinks, the person who smokes and the person who drives a car?  It is an absurdity that that position should obtain in any country.  The man who drinks, the man who smokes and the man who drives a car are probably very foolish people.  I do not see any reason why the country should be run at their expense.  The people who do not drive, smoke or run a car are saving money and making the best livelihood.  I see nothing wrong with the turnover tax and most people in this country see very little wrong with it.  The people in general, independently of whether they smoke, drink, drive cars or do any other foolish things, should bear equally the expenses of running the State.  That applies also in any other State.</P>
    <P>I suppose too many people smoke, drink, and run cars, and if we could get rid of these people we could probably get rid of a lot of trouble in the country, but apparently it has not occurred to anybody so far either to penalise these people or to get rid of them and it would seem that to penalise them or to get rid of them would create an extraordinary problem. If such people did not exist, if nobody drank, if nobody smoked, if nobody ran a car, if nobody bought petrol, the country would still have to go on.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should look at the running of the country from that point of view.  There is no use trying to operate a country on the basis of the people who do what others consider to be foolish things. <Col N="1722" /> The Minister removed the tax on dancing.  The tax on betting and such things has been reduced.  Why tax three categories of persons in the community as distinct from all the others?  It is only fair that all members of the community should pay their fair share towards the running of the country.  I make no apology to anybody for supporting the turnover tax because it was the first fair tax that was introduced in this country for a long time and it should have been introduced 20 years ago instead of last year.</P>
    <P>A good deal of propaganda is made about the poverty-stricken position of our country to-day.  A few minutes ago I left a man who went to the United States as a child and who has returned.  His attitude appears to be that we are even ahead of the United States.</P>
    <P>I do not know where this alleged poverty exists.  I have to travel 200 miles to Dublin from my home.  I do not see any poverty across the country. There are certain diseases existing at the moment.  A great campaign is being waged against cancer.  There was a similar campaign a few years ago against TB.  A campaign against the worst disease of all&mdash;downright laziness&mdash;is overdue.</P>

      <P>One of the big bogies confronting us is that there are more people who are well off than there ever were before.  A man becomes rich, not because he spends money but because he saves money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1723" /> The millionaire is a millionaire simply because he saves money.  I do not know about the Minister for Finance. The extraordinary thing is that we are reaching a position in this country where too much money is held by too few people.  There are certain rich people who, because they are rich, succeed in becoming richer.</P>
    <P>It is very important at this stage that the Minister should take steps to redistribute these riches.  If I have any grouse with the Minister, it is on the question of the distribution of social welfare benefits.  The Minister could have gone a good deal further in that respect.  I believe he would have got the unanimous support of the House for an increase in social welfare benefits.  I realise that in order to increase the benefits, the Minister must get the necessary money, but I honestly believe that the House would have supported him in such a proposal. I suggest that in the very near future the Minister should take steps to bring the ordinary social welfare payments up to the standards which are accepted across the Border, in a part of a country which is regarded as anathema by many of us, but, nevertheless, where they have decided to look after the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The rich are capable of looking after themselves.  I suggest to the Minister that his main objective should be to look after the poor in this country.  The rich will get on quite well on their own.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a useful discussion on some points raised by various Deputies and I should like briefly to refer to some of these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, Deputy Sweetman raised a point about section 2.  He said he did not understand exactly how section 2 would apply.  Before this year there was a provision for those living practically entirely on unearned income, people who have investments and people to whom we sometimes refer as living on fixed incomes.  In the past, they got a certain amount of relief where the income was up to £600 per <Col N="1724" /> year but, where the income was above £600 per year, the relief was shaded off again and they reached the stage where they got no relief.  That created a certain amount of dissatisfaction amongst those slightly over £600.  This year we have changed it and section 2 now provides that in the case of a person who has investment income or unearned income, the first £600 income from unearned sources of that kind will qualify for the age allowance, no matter what his total income may be.</P>
    <P>We go further than that, however. In the past, if he had earned income as well up to a certain amount he got no relief.  Now he gets the relief up to the £2,000 limit as if the £600 income from unearned sources were part of the £2,000.  That means that, if he has £600 unearned income and £1,400 from earned income, he gets a fourth relief on that, as if it were all earned income.  If his earned income goes over the £2,000 total, he does not, of course, get any more relief.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman also asked about the Firearms Act.  The reason a Financial Resolution will be necessary is that some new licences are brought in under the Firearms Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>A Financial Resolution will be necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be necessary.  I mentioned in my speech that it will be necessary to bring in a Financial Resolution.  Deputy Sweetman also drew attention to section 19 where there are certain penalties and restrictions on those who are using untaxed diesel when they should really be using taxed diesel.  There is always a certain amount of trouble in collecting duty where certain users are entitled to use the same article free of duty on occasion and the only excuse I can make for the severity of the section is the difficulty of administering a duty of this kind.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman also said that, because of the decreasing value of money, we should have considered giving greater reliefs on the income tax side.  That just was not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to broiler chickens, this is a matter of interpretation of the <Col N="1725" /> law.  As Deputies are aware, the Revenue Commissioners have the law and they interpret it as they think correct.  In their interpretation in relation to this matter, they decided that the rearing of broilers was not an agricultural occupation.  I think we must agree with that because we know it is possible to rear broilers without any land at all or, in fact, without being even near land; broilers can be raised in the middle of the city.  The Revenue Commissioners must interpret the law as they see fit.  If the Dáil thinks a change should be made, then the law will have to be amended.</P>
    <P>Another point Deputy Sweetman made was that the depreciation allowed in relation to buildings used for this broiler business is too low.  It is two per cent and Deputy Sweetman thinks it should be ten per cent.  Again, if the Dáil decides that Deputy Sweetman is right in that, we will have to change the law.</P>
    <P>Certain vehicles are exempt from road tax.  I think I did not quite get the Deputy's point and I mean to read his speech before the Committee Stage.  I am not sure whether he was referring to the clause exempting certain snow-clearing machines from road tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  We have now had experience of the administration of the turnover tax.  Deputy Sweetman says he thinks it is costing more than anticipated.  He did not refer to the Exchequer cost but he did refer to the cost on traders.  I must say any trader I have met recently seems to have modified his ideas a bit about the turnover tax.  They were very hostile to it in the beginning.  Any I have <Col N="1726" /> met lately tell me it is working smoothly on the whole and they have no complaint with regard to any great expense.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that I do not believe I can be quoted as saying that the turnover tax in Europe applied generally to food. I said it applied in some cases.  Having looked the matter up, I find it applies fully, or almost fully, or partially in a number of countries.  The two countries I did quote several times were Norway and Sweden.  I did say on many occasions that we were adopting the tax as applied in these two countries as our model.  In those countries, the tax applies to every sale. Certain exemptions are made.  We have also made exemptions.  There may be some slight difference as between ourselves and these two countries, but it is of no consequence.  In general, the tax applies at the same level all round. In both countries they started at about two per cent or 2½ per cent.  As Deputy Corish raised the matter in particular, I should like to remind him that in both countries it was a Socialist Government who brought in the tax and it is a Socialist Government who are still in favour of it.  At the moment the tax in Norway is ten per cent and in Sweden it is six per cent.  It applies fully to food as well as everything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman said that, on looking up this matter, he came across other bits of information, including information on death duties.  He quoted various countries in which death duties are lower than they are here.  I accept the Deputy's figures naturally but I should like to say that, in all probability, you have in many of these countries a capital tax of some sort.  I do not say in all, but I think a number have a capital tax.  In this country and in Britain, with one exception which I shall mention later when I come to deal with a point made by Deputy Corish, the only capital tax is death duties.  It is quite hefty in Britain; it is not quite so hefty here.  Now, we take capital duty off only once in a lifetime and it is therefore <Col N="1727" /> higher than if one were taking a smaller percentage of capital every year in the same way as income tax and surtax is taken.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Sweetman, if I got his point correctly, with regard to the increased customs duty on spirits coming into this country.  If GATT is applied generally all over the world, including this country, then we may not have power to impose a revenue tax at a higher level for customs than for exise.  The Deputy is probably right there but we can only wait and see what we will do about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish, in speaking about the turnover tax, said that, when we were bringing in the tax last year, we had come to the conclusion that a tax on drink and tobacco would be ineffective and he wants to know now why we have changed our minds about it this year.  There are two reasons. My own observation from studying the imposition of a tax on drink or tobacco is that when you put a tax on, it usually reduces the consumption, but after six months, or so, the consumption, as a rule, comes back to what it was, and you then have a yield from the tax.  That means that to put a tax on drink or tobacco two years in succession would have a very bad effect from the Revenue point of view. You would get less than you would get if you did not put it on at all. That is the first reason.</P>
    <P>Secondly, for a couple of years, we were, if you like, considering a turnover tax on all retail sales.  We knew that after the first year, a turnover tax would bring in a considerable amount of revenue in a full year, which could not be got, no matter how far you went in taxing drink and tobacco. The turnover tax is now in operation, and we expect it will bring in £14 million this year.  It is rather futile, to say the least, for any Party to talk about abolishing that tax.  So far as I can see, it would be impossible to replace it with any other tax, and to talk about doing away with it is, therefore, not realistic politics at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to talk about increasing it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot guarantee that <Col N="1728" /> some Government may not at some time increase it.</P>
      <P>(<i>Interruptions.</i>)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that no Minister for Finance will ever say that any particular tax is at its highest level. He knows that practically every year some tax must be put on, and he realises that consideration must be given to the best source from which to get taxation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish talked about a capital gains tax.  I cannot say that I have investigated it minutely and thoroughly, but from the investigations I have made, and what I have learned from those who advise me, I think the possibility of having a capital gains tax in this country is very small.  In England the matter of a capital gains tax was discussed, and eventually it was imposed in a very limited way.  A capital gains tax on gains made on disposal of certain assets was imposed but with some exceptions, only in respect of gains made within six months of acquisition of the assets.  Obviously what they had in mind was the big take-overs and matters of that kind, in which a person knows there will be a take-over in a certain industry, buys shares, and when the take-over is announced, gets a big increase in the shares and sells them again.  That is why they had the six months provision. I think that is the only form of capital gains tax they have in England</P>
      <P>What form could it take here?  No Deputy would suggest we should put a tax on ordinary industrial gains or industrial shares.  If a group come in here and start a factory and, after a few years, the shares begin to increase in value&mdash;as they will if the industry is a success&mdash;we must keep in mind that if it is not a success, they will lose their money.  Therefore, they are entitled to a certain amount if they succeed, because they took a chance.  I do not think we should discourage people from putting money into industry by saying we will have a capital gains tax. That would be a very foolish thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Stock Exchange, there are no opportunities here, if you like, for a person to make big money on the Stock Exchange.  The Stock Exchange is a comparatively tame <Col N="1729" /> business here.  There would not be much object in putting on a capital gains tax, because some margin must be left to the person who invests on the Stock Exchange.  He may lose or gain and, therefore, he must have a margin.  As Minister for Finance, I am very anxious, from the point of view of the economy of the country, that the Stock Exchange should do well. We want people to come here and invest money, and they will not do that unless the Stock Exchange is fairly lively.</P>
    <P>The only thing left then is the land. There may be a case&mdash;and I dare say there is a case&mdash;for taxing people who buy land near a town and get a big increase for it after a few years.  Perhaps they buy the land because they know its value will increase.  There might not be much in that, but I admit there may be a case for a capital gains tax in that respect.  The whole idea of a capital gains tax would have to be approached from the point of view of equity rather than of getting money out of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish also spoke about the social welfare recipients.  I dealt with that matter in detail in my Budget speech and I do not want to go back over it again.  It may be true, as Deputy Corish says, that the social welfare recipients are getting less of the national cake, as he put it, than in 1956-57.  On the other hand, as I pointed out before, from 1954 to 1957, the increases the old age pensioners got amounted to 12 per cent, and the cost of living went up during those years by nine per cent, so the net increase to the old age pensioners was very small&mdash;about three per cent.  In our time the increases the old age pensioners got amounted to 56 per cent, and the cost of living went up by 20 per cent, so the net gain in recent years is far more than it was at that time.  However, I do not want to go back over that controversy, and I shall leave it at that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish talked about income tax as it applies to co-operatives.  I remember when I was Minister for Agriculture this was being pushed by the business people, who said it was <Col N="1730" /> ridiculous that co-operatives should be free of income tax while they had to pay it.  Indeed, when I was Minister for Agriculture, I had to meet those people at times and argue with them that the co-operatives were not interfering with the business people to any great extent.  Anyway, they co-operated in the business and, therefore, in my opinion, they were entitled to be free from income tax.</P>
    <P>What happened then, and what brought this to a head, was that the Income Tax Commission set up by Deputy Sweetman considered this, amongst other matters, and recommended that the profits of a co-operative company should be subject to income tax, except in certain cases. The certain cases were principally agricultural cases.  They had agricultural production societies&mdash;they would be creameries and so on&mdash;they had marts and they also had societies which were set up under the Provident Societies Act for educational or philanthropic purposes.  I believe they were exempt in any case so they did not need to be included in the legislation. Therefore, we included the agricultural co-operatives and also the fishery co-operatives which would naturally go with them.  We did stick practically to the recommendation of the Income Tax Commission.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether we should reconsider this matter.  I take it the Commission gave it very full consideration and it would be necessary to get an outside body to consider it again if we thought it was necessary to have it reconsidered.</P>

      <P>I should not like to express an opinion on it.  It would be rather an expert job to examine it.  If the Deputy will write to me, I shall have it examined.  Deputy Esmonde talked about death duties.  I know from his speeches here before that he has a great belief about what we would derive from a lowering of the death duties or the abolition of the death duties.  He has a great belief in the economic advantage of doing such a thing.  First of all, he asked a question about the amount we collect each year and the cost, and he had some doubt whether I gave him the true figures with regard to the cost.  If the Deputy looks at the total collected by the Revenue Commissioners and the total cost he will see that the figure I gave him in this case is not very far out.  I have not the same belief as Deputy Esmonde in this case because some few years ago we brought the top rate down considerably&mdash;it was 53 per cent and we brought it down to 40 per cent&mdash;and I remember saying at that time, when I brought that proposition before the Dáil, that I wanted to see what good effect it would have, would it mean that people with money would come over here and invest money so that they would get the benefit of our death duties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not yet.  Deputy Esmonde also spoke about our balance of payments difficulties between this and 1970 as outlined in our <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> He thought they would be considerably eased if we took off the death duties and induced people in with their money.  I do not think it is <Col N="1732" /> necessary or that we need go that far. I pointed it out on the Budget that we are in a position to meet any deficit there may be in 1970.  It was, as a matter of fact, also dealt with in the White Paper, paragraph 74 or 75. The Deputy also spoke about some person whose bank, in obedience to an order from the Revenue Commissioners, had given a return of this man's income from deposits in the bank and the Deputy said the man had asked the inspector to give him a copy but the inspector had not done so.  The man has a very simple remedy because, after all, if he goes to the bank I am sure the bank will give it to him just as they gave it to the inspector. The final point which Deputy Esmonde made was about the expense of keeping accounts for income tax.  Of course, all expenses are allowed for income tax, including these.</P>
      <P>Deputy Leneghan was quite right in regard to the point he made that if we choose to claim the right, and every Government have claimed the right, to examine the means of an applicant for an old age pension&mdash;and our officials go to a great lot of trouble to find out an applicant's means before recommending him for a pension, whether partial or full&mdash;he could not see why we should not have the same right to examine the means of a person who has a bank deposit to see whether he should pay income tax or not.  In fact, there is a better case for looking into the means of a person who should be an income taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Leneghan also said, and I cannot agree with him, that if I had proposed to give more to the old age pensioners, widows and so on, I would have had the unanimous backing of the House.  I would agree with that all right; I would have had the unanimous backing of the House, but Deputy Leneghan knows I would not have had unanimous backing for getting the money.  That is where the difficulty arises.  I cannot propose to give an increase to anybody unless I know where I am to get the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for payment of annual subsidy to Coras Iompair Éireann, to empower the Minister for Finance to advance moneys to the Board for capital purposes, and to make further provision for payment of redundancy compensation to railway employees whose services are dispensed with, or whose conditions are worsened because of transfer, in certain specified circumstances. The Bill also provides for writing off advances totalling £1 million made to the Board by the Minister for Finance under section 13 of the Transport Act, 1963.  Other matters dealt with in the Bill relate to entry to the clerical grades of CIE, the development of property by the Board, as well as some other matters of a minor nature.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the Bill itself and future transport policy, I propose to review briefly the results of CIE over the past five years, the reorganisation period envisaged in the Transport Act, 1958.  As Deputies are aware, the 1958 Act required the Board to break even by 31st March, 1964, and provided for payment to the Board in the financial years 1959-60 to 1963-64, inclusive, of an annual grant of £1 million.  This annual grant was increased to £1.175 million by the Great Northern Railway Act, 1958, which provided for the transfer to CIE as from 1st October, 1958, without capital liability, of the GNR undertaking within the State.  The Act also wrote off liabilities of CIE totalling £16.6 million, representing a saving of interest of some £600,000 per annum.  To help CIE in their efforts to reduce losses during the reorganisation period, common carrier and other statutory obligations which had restricted their commercial adaptability were removed by the 1958 legislation and the Board were given complete commercial freedom in the fixing of rates and fares.  The Board were also given full discretion in the termination of uneconomic rail services. Provision was also made in the 1958 legislation for recoupment by the Exchequer of the cost of redundancy compensation in respect of redundancy arising during the reorganisation period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first two years of the Board's operation under the new charter granted to it by the Transport Act, 1958, hopes were high that the Board could become a viable undertaking within five years.  By 1959/60 the Board's loss had been reduced to £709,000 and in the following year, it was down to £246,000, as compared with £1,950,000 in 1958/59.  Unfortunately, however, this progress received a sharp set-back in 1961/62 when the <Col N="1737" /> Board's loss jumped to £1,696,000, due mainly to the impact of the eighth round increase in salaries and wages and associated improvements in working conditions, which represented a 20 per cent increase in the CIE wages and saleries Bill which the Board were unable to recover except to a partial extent by increased rates and fares.  In 1962/63 there was a gap of more than £1 million between the additional labour costs and the counteracting fares and rates increase and the Board's net loss increased still further to £1,760,000.  The most recent estimate for 1963/64 shows a net loss of £1,618,000.  This shows a very marked improvement over 1962/63 when account is taken of the additional net cost to the Board in 1963/64 of the ninth round increase in salaries and wages, estimated at £236,000 in the last three months of the year, and of the net cost of the May, 1963, bus strike which amounted to £342,000.</P>
    <P>Over the five year period, the Board's losses totalled £6,029,000 as against the aggregate subsidy of £5,875,000 provided for in the Transport Act, 1958.  The difference of £154,000 was met by borrowing from the Exchequer and is part of the £1 million being written off in this Bill. The Board have not succeeded, despite far reaching reorganisation and modernisation, in achieving the target of breaking even by 31st March, 1964, and for reasons I will deal with later the target can now be seen to be unrealisable in Irish conditions.  Over the five years the Board's expenditure on additions to capital assets, excluding hotels, was £5.2 million.  Interest on capital and sinking fund are, of course, included in the losses of the Board.</P>
    <P>The preponderating element in the results over the five years is, of course, the railway.  The operating deficit on the railway which amounted to £1,247,000 in 1958/59 fell to £854,000 in 1959/60 and to £477,000 in 1960/61, but rose again to £1,362,000 in 1962/63 and fell to an estimated £772,000 in 1963/64.  Total operating deficit on the railway over the five years was £5,058,000 compared with a total CIE loss of £6,029,000 but the total loss <Col N="1738" /> included financial charges of over £4 m, of which no element is included in the deficit on railway working.</P>
    <P>The Road Passenger Department, of which Dublin city services contribute 64 per cent of the revenue continues to be profitable.  The working surplus, before charging sinking fund for capital redemption and interest on capital amounted to £266,000 in 1963/4 as compared with £480,000 in 1962/63, with £511,000 in the preceding year and £764,000 in 1960/61 and surpluses of a similar order in preceding years. The steep decline in 1963/64 was due to the May, 1963, bus strike, the net cost of which, as I have already indicated, was £342,000, but with the continued growth of private transport it is possible that road passenger services may not in future be as profitable as in the past.  Road freight transport has shown a marginal profit over the past few years but in 1963/64 it had an operating loss of about £80,000.  The working surplus on hotels and catering has been well maintained since 1958/59.  In 1963/64 the working surplus, before charging sinking fund or interest on capital, amounted to about £53,000 compared with £44,000 in 1958/59.  In December, 1961, a subsidiary company, Óstlanna Iompair Éireann Teo., was formed to operate the Board's hotels and catering service.  In May, 1960, the operation of CIE barges on the Grand Canal was discontinued and the working loss on canals fell from £79,000 in 1959/60 to £51,000 in 1960/61 as a result.  In 1963/64 the working loss was about £39,000.  Vessels, docks, and so on, continue to show losses which amounted in 1963/64 to an estimated £29,000.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from the foregoing that the losses of CIE are accounted for almost entirely by the losses on the railways.  The railway system continues to be the main problem of public transport with which the Government have to deal.</P>
    <P>The Beddy Committee envisaged the reduction of the CIE railway system to a main line one consisting of approximately 850 miles, to which must be added 63 miles of the former GNR Dublin-Belfast line, but the Transport Act, 1958, left full discretion <Col N="1739" /> to the Board in the matter of the termination of uneconomic rail services and in the provision of substitute services, if any.  The new Board adopted the policy of substituting road services for any rail services closed down.</P>
    <P>Between 1st October, 1958, and 31st March, 1964, the Board closed 621 route miles of railway line, which together with other reductions and alterations reduced the railway system to about 1,460 route miles.  A number of lines have also been closed by CIE to passenger traffic and are now used for freight only or for freight and excursions.  In addition, 218 stations and halts were closed by the Board during the reorganisation period compared with the closure of some 317 stations and halts envisaged by the Beddy Committee.  A number of other stations have been partially closed.</P>
    <P>Before closing a branch line, CIE carry out a detailed analysis of the cost of operation and revenue of rail services on the branch and of substitute road services, and where there is no prospect of economic operation of the branch and where a &ldquo;betterment&rdquo; in net receipts would accrue by substituting road for rail transport, it is decided to close the branch.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the lines closed, even though they represented 29 per cent of the whole railway system, carried no more than 5 per cent of the total railway traffic and that the revenue derived from the closed lines and stations had not amounted to more than 6 per cent of total railway revenue.  CIE have informed me that only 35 additional buses and 52 lorries, together with 57 extra lorries during peak periods were required to provide adequate and satisfactory substitute services.</P>
    <P>The 57 extra lorries required for peak periods are supplied as far as possible from the general CIE fleet and where a sufficient number is not available the gap is bridged by hired hauliers.  The financial betterment to CIE from these closures amounted to about £700,000 per annum.  If these lines and stations were still in operation <Col N="1740" /> the losses would be heavier by at least £700,000 and this loss would grow with increasing costs.</P>
    <P>The Beddy Committee referred to the low CIE utilisation of rail passenger and rail freight capacity in camparison with other Western European countries and felt that it was a matter of urgent necessity to improve rail utilisation.  Between 1958/59 and 1962/63, the number of rail cars and carriages decreased by 27 per cent and the number of seats by 26 per cent. The tonnage capacity of rail freight vehicles declined by 16 per cent during the same period.  As the volume of passenger and freight traffic has been maintained, these reductions represent a significant improvement in the utilisation of rolling stock, though because of our conditions it is still below European average.  Over the same period, the number of diesel locomotives increased from 139 to 210, while steam locomotives, of which there were 347 in use in 1957/58, have been eliminated from normal working.  All railway services are now operated by diesel power.</P>
    <P>As the reorganisation of the railway was the main aim of the 1958 Act and as the losses of CIE are attributable to the railway, a closer look at railway working is worthwhile.  The amalgamation with the Board of the part of the GNR system in the State on the 1st October, 1958, following the closure of the secondary cross-border GNR services, makes-detailed comparisons difficult.  Generally, the pattern is that rail passenger traffic has been well maintained; there has been a decline from 11.7m. in 1958/59 to 9.8m. in 1963/64 in the numbers of passengers carried, in part due to the withdrawal of passenger services on a number of lines, the attenuation of the Dublin surburban services and the recent bad summers.</P>
    <P>The passenger/mileage figure, which is the true index of traffic over the same period, has despite the closures, shown a slight increase from 326m. in 1958/59 to 331m. in 1963/64.  Rail passenger traffic would probably have shown a decline but for the vigorous development of excursion traffic by CIE, including the introduction of day trips at single fares, the expansion of <Col N="1741" /> organised excursions and educational trips and mystery tours.</P>
    <P>The tonnage of rail freight, excluding livestock, has also been well maintained.  Ton mileage for freight of 187m. in 1958/59 has increased to 221m. in 1963/64, or by 18 per cent. There has been a steep decline in the numbers of livestock carried by rail over the years.  The number carried in 1963/64 by rail was 379,000 compared with 536,000 in 1958/59.  Carryings of livestock by CIE road services over the same period, however, have increased from 214,000 in 1958/59 to 320,000 in 1963/64, an increase of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>I should state here quite unequivocally that I have at repeated intervals pressed the Board of CIE to improve their publicity and advertising, both in order to get more business and make known to the public the tremendous campaign of reorganisation and the closer liaison with the public effected through sales market research staff. Along with this, I have asked the Board to consider reducing rail fares by the maximum possible.</P>
    <P>In fact, the basic fares are comparable with those elsewhere.  I am bound to believe the Board when they say they have thoroughly investigated this question and that the present range of cheap fares, excursion fares, special train journey fares, children's fares and rambler ticket rates represent the maximum they can effect without markedly increasing the deficit.  Note is taken of the response to well-advertised special trains and the reluctance of the public to use train services which I can only hope will diminish with time.</P>
    <P>The results of railway operations over the five years continue to show the same trends as in previous years which were noted and commented on in the Beddy Report of 1957. Despite improvements in utilisation of equipment, and even some advance in the volume of business, the railway is unable to recoup increased costs in competition with road transport.  While the Board have been unable to combat these trends with complete success the position would have been much worse <Col N="1742" /> but for their efforts in many directions. Apart from the saving of £700,000 per annum from terminating uneconomic rail services, the Board have shown considerable commercial drive, with results on passenger and freight traffic already noted.</P>
    <P>The management structure has been overhauled and decentralised and there has been a notable increase in efficiency and consequently in the public image of CIE.  There have been many improvements in service such as better rolling stock, more comfortable buses, and improved passenger facilities at stations which are themselves now brighter and cleaner than ever before. The mechanisation of freight traffic has speeded up delivery and the Board claim that 85 per cent of freight traffic is now delivered within 24 hours.  It has been estimated that were it not for the reorganisation carried out by the Board, including the closing of uneconomic lines, further dieselisation since 1958 and improvements in productivity, the Board's total loss would now be more than £3 million per annum.</P>
    <P>The experience over the five years has demonstrated in a practical way that the hopes of breaking even are unrealisable.  The prospects have, however, been examined in a detailed scientific way in an exhaustive study made by CIE.  The objectives of the study&mdash;now known as &ldquo;Pacemaker&rdquo;&mdash; included a review of the salient features of CIE, their place in the national market for transport, their activities, finances, commercial policies, engineering services and industrial relations.  The two more important parts of the Pacemaker report are devoted to an analysis of the profitability of the various sections of CIE and an examination of possible alternative systems of providing public transport.  Copies of the report were placed in the Dáil Library some weeks ago and at the same time CIE undertook to make copies of the report available to the trade unions and, on request to other interested parties.</P>
    <P>In order to carry out this study, CIE had to devise an economic model and to assemble statistical data on a scale and of a complexity that was not <Col N="1743" /> available for previous studies of the subject.  For this purpose numerous surveys were undertaken and an electronic computer system and manual methods were used to manipulate and classify the source of material relating to physical quantities and type of traffic, vehicles and man-power.  Traffic flows were established for a base year and the cost of transport was calculated for different combinations of rail and road systems.  In establishing traffic flows, a high degree of accuracy was achieved by suitably devised sampling methods.</P>
    <P>I propose to give some details from the Pacemaker report for the benefit of Deputies who may not have had an opportunity of reading it.</P>

      <P>In the analysis of the profitability of the railway, road passenger, and road freight sections of CIE many difficulties arose in allocating costs and revenue and the results cannot, therefore, be regarded as precise, but they are valuable even if they are only indicative of the actual situation.  The following sections were considered separately: Railway; Dublin city bus services; provincial city bus services; provincial road passenger services, (other than city services); and road freight operation.  Full information is given on the methods by which the profitability or otherwise of different sectors are calculated and of the basis of calculation leading to the determination of uneconomic lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a summary of some of the major features of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealing with the railway, the report indicates that the six largest stations account for more than half the revenue and 110 stations account for 14 per cent of the revenue.  A total of 410 miles of railway is wholly profitable, 300 miles are marginally profitable and the balance of 750 miles is unprofitable.  In other words, about half of the railway mileage is wholly unprofitable and the remainder is approximately breaking even.  It cannot be assumed from this that the closure of 750 miles of unprofitable track would bring about a break-even situation.  While the closure of branch lines does not generally mean loss of <Col N="1746" /> traffic, the closure of certain unprofitable secondary lines could, depending on the extent to which they act as feeders to the main system, have a serious effect on the remainder of the system.  The discontinuance of services on all of this 750 miles would in fact reduce the railway to an unworkable unit.  A further important fact revealed is that ten major traffics account for 70 per cent of rail freight tonnage and 50 per cent of rail freight revenue and are accounted for by as few as 20 firms, which means that rail freight transport is in an extremely vulnerable position.</P>
    <P>Analysis shows that the cost of running the Dublin suburban passenger rail services, as far as costs can be segregated, is substantially greater than revenue.  It is estimated that if the Dublin suburban passenger rail services were operated in isolation, that is, without other rail services to share track and other common costs, an operating loss of £505,000 per annum would be incurred.  By contrast, the Dublin city bus services have overall profitability and CIE estimate that they contributed a cross-subsidy of £380,000 to the remainder of the undertaking in the year 1961-62, which represented an average cross-subsidy per passenger of 0.37 pence or 8.2 per cent of the average fare paid.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the bus services, the report pointed out that of the total of 79 Dublin city bus services operated by the board, seven services earn one-third of the total revenue and 18 services earn only two per cent of the total revenue.  As many as 35 services operate at a loss; eight are marginally profitable while 36 services show a profit.  Generally, the services which operate with low frequency or over short distances are the least profitable.  As few as 21 services account for about 80 per cent of the profits.  There is, therefore, substantial cross-averaging within the Dublin city services.  Of the 24 provincial city bus services operated, three account for 42 per cent of the revenue while half of the services account for only 16 per cent of the revenue.  Thirteen are operated at a loss and five are marginally profitable. The profitable services are, however, <Col N="1747" /> sufficiently viable to enable the provincial city services as a whole to be regarded as breaking even but no more.</P>
    <P>Provincial road passenger services to the number of 234 are operated by the Board and of these almost two-thirds earn an annual revenue of less than £5,000 per annum and account for only 15 per cent of the total revenue in this section.  Ninety-one per cent of all the provincial road passenger services earn only 57 per cent of the total revenue.  Seventy-three services are wholly profitable, nine are marginally profitable and the remaining 152 services are unprofitable. Generally, the short distance services are the least profitable.  The provincial road passenger services as a whole are only marginally profitable in that they contribute only one per cent to overheads and other unallocated costs against a required four per cent to break even.</P>
    <P>There are 141 road freight depots and of these almost threequarters give rise to only ten per cent of the total road freight revenue.  The seven largest depots account for 51 per cent of the revenue.  Road freight falls into four divisions, namely, railhead services; scheduled services; livestock services; and other services.  Railhead services are very unprofitable, revenue being over 40 per cent short of the level necessary to break even. Scheduled services are also unprofitable, revenue being about 20 per cent short of the break-even level.  Livestock services are not fully profitable and make a contribution of 14 per cent towards overheads and other costs which cannot be allocated against a required 30 per cent to break even. Other services are also not fully profitable and contribute 23 per cent towards overheads and other unallocated costs against a required 30 per cent break-even level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Road freight services combined are not fully profitable in that they contribute 11 per cent towards overheads and other unallocated costs against a required 26 per cent to break even.</P>
      <P>As I have already mentioned, various alternative systems of providing public transport are examined in the report ranging from the present system through a number of different combinations of rail and road to an all-road system.  The report shows the operating costs for each system and the additional capital requirements for a change-over to another system.  The conclusions to be drawn are, in effect, that no public transport system incorporating a railway can pay its way; that there is no real alternative to the present system of public transport other than a planned complete change-over to road transport; but that the capital cost of the changeover would be such as to rule it out as a practical proposition.</P>
      <P>In considering the future legislative provisions for CIE after the expiry of the relevant provisions of the Transport Act, 1958, the Government had in the first place to consider the position of the railway.  The experience over the five year reorganisation period and the Pacemaker study disposed finally of the hope that either the railway or the undertaking as a whole would be put on a self-supporting basis.  Moreover the findings of the Pacemaker study showed that while a complete changeover to road transport could possibly yield a public transport system which would carry on without operating losses the enormous capital required and the very heavy staff redundancy would be such as to outweigh the advantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government had also to consider the value of the railway system <Col N="1749" /> to the country.  It represents a vast national investment and offers advantages many of which could not be provided by road transport.  This is particularly the case for tourist traffic and for peak traffics of various kinds. The Government have decided, therefore, after very full and careful consideration, to preserve the railway system, subject to such further concentration and reorganisation as may prove practicable and desirable, and to provide a fixed annual subsidy with the aid of which the Board should be expected to break even.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the Pacemaker study showed that of the present railway system of about 1,460 miles, 410 miles are fully profitable, 300 miles marginally profitable, and 750 miles wholly unprofitable.  The closure of secondary lines and branch lines which make any significant contribution to the main line system would further reduce the profitability of the profitable sector and, therefore, substantial further reduction of the system could well increase the total loss. While it is expected that some further concentration will be found desirable and practicable it is probable that we have come near the minimum practicable railway system, beyond which further reduction would increase the loss.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps digress for a moment to analyse the fundamental reasons why a railway system cannot be operated profitably in our circumstances. Of course it is a fact that railways in most other countries also show losses of varying amounts but there are special difficulties for a railway in Ireland.  The main item of expenditure on a railway is the high cost of providing and maintaining fixed capital overheads.  The cost of maintaining the railway line, stations, signal equipment, rolling stock etc. is very largely fixed and is influenced very little by the volume of traffic.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have a relatively sparse population and the main centres of population and industry are near the coast, particularly the east coast, and the country does not, therefore, yield the density of traffic in either passengers or freight which <Col N="1750" /> could provide a reasonably high level of utilisation of the equipment and staff.  Our present mileage of railway line represents 51 miles per 100,000 population, as compared with an average in 1962 of 39 miles for 12 representative European countries.</P>
    <P>A further factor is that, principally because of the double handling involved, the railway is most effective and most economic for longer distances. We have no railway journey in this country which could be described as long by any international standards.  Further handicaps are the absence of large homogenous traffics such as coal or ore, which are particularly suited to railways, and of the long distance transit traffic which is a feature of much continental railway operation.</P>
    <P>I have made a considerable study of European railway finances.  In the systems where expenditure, including interest on capital, is equated either absolutely or approximately to revenue there are always factors operating which do not exist here, such as the high density of population or the existence of great ore deposits in an area where road facilities are lacking or heavy transit traffic or a population concentrated in towns and large villages.</P>
    <P>The fixed subsidy of £2 million per annum, which will be subject to alteration in the light of circumstances at the end of five years, has been calculated after careful examination of estimates supplied by CIE.  It represents what the Government consider to be a realistic estimate of the minimum subsidy with which CIE can get by, on the basis of continued effective management, increased efficiency and productivity and careful husbanding of resources.  When this Bill becomes law, I shall direct the Board to make a further tremendous sustained effort to secure and retain traffic and to reduce costs, in the hope that the Bill's subsidy provisions be over-adequate. The Board accept that the subsidy is not a permitted loss but an estimated covering of a deficit.</P>
    <P>The House will realise that while the Government have decided to preserve the railway, the subsidy is heavy <Col N="1751" /> by European standards particularly if European war pensions and capital amortisation are eliminated from the deficits of European railways.  It amounts to about ten per cent of last year's total revenue from all sources and almost 25 per cent of rail revenue alone.</P>
    <P>State financial aid for industry takes the form of capital grants of different types, and the payment of very large direct subsidies to cover the difference between the annual current expenditure and receipts of a particular concern or group of producers is mainly confined to the agricultural field and related to exports.  In the case of transport there is a huge investment in private transport and a great amplitude of vehicles in relation to national income.  A subsidy is only justified because an arterial railway system is essential under conditions likely to prevail for a considerable period.  I have an objection to current operating subsidies as they tend to cause slackness and I trust that the Board and staff will continue to improve the efficiency of the system.</P>
    <P>The successive Governments examining the affairs of the public transport service have always tried to frame legislation based on the hope that the entire system might pay its way even if its capital was largely unremunerated. The Second Reading speeches attending all the CIE legislalation clearly indicate this.  Until Pacemaker was published, CIE in common with a great many other railways had not devised a system of cost computation which could truly present an objective picture of railway and road transport economics.  The CIE report together with some other similiar reports represent advancement and pioneering in a relatively new field.</P>
    <P>The country's size permitting of only 160 miles arterial rail links with Dublin, without ore traffic or transit business, is small enough to cause heavy deficits and yet large enough to warrant the preservation of the main railroad arterial system under prevailing conditions.  An operating subsidy under these circumstances is <Col N="1752" /> inevitable.  Once this decision is made, then some assurance of continued operation is desirable.  The arrangements in this Bill ensure that there is no running down of the main arterial system but on the contrary the maintenance and improvement of the system. The decision has been made that a railway is essential in this country even at a heavy cost to the taxpayer. No private operator would take on the obligation&mdash;that is certain.</P>
    <P>It is for the management of CIE, the staff and the public to justify this subsidy to ensure that there is no catastrophic fall in revenue in the next decade or thereafter which would demand a further examination of the position.  A subsidy of ten per cent of total rail and road services revenue is very large indeed by European standards; a subsidy of almost 25 per cent of railway revenue is enormous; being nearly twice the European average.</P>
    <P>If the hopes of every Minister in charge of CIE, whenever a new Bill was provided, that the system would pay have been dashed in the past it is to be sincerely hoped that this very large subsidy will be sufficient and that the subsidy payable after 1969 will be proportionally less, if at all possible, as the country grows in prosperity.</P>
    <P>I should point out that my predecessor, Deputy Lemass, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, was realistic in his comments on the Second Reading of the 1958 Bill.  In some four of five references to the economic position of the railway his general view can be summed up in the following statement which I quote from volume 167, column 1598, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>It cannot be expected that any reorganisation measures or release from financial obligations such as I have mentioned could enable the board of CIE to achieve solvency immediately.  Indeed, the Bill envisages that the board will not have reached that situation for five years. I know that at the present time there are few railway systems in the world which are not losing money and that in expecting the board of CIE to <Col N="1753" /> achieve solvency it may be said that we are asking them to do something that other railway executives are not able to do even under more favourable circumstances.</P>
    <P>That may be true, but we must not allow the experience of other countries to lead us into slovenly thinking or relaxation of effort to improve the position of CIE.  We have to decide policy in this matter solely in relation to our own circumstances and it is obviously necessary that we should try to put our public transport undertaking on a solvent basis and so relieve the general taxpayer of the necessity of subsidising it by annual subvention. Those who are concerned to secure the preservation of the railway system of the country must be conscious of the fact that the support of public opinion for that effort will be available only where there is evidence that the system is being worked in an economical and efficient manner and that the prospect of recurring losses will be reduced.</P>
    <P>In his reply to the debate, the then Minister was again extremely realistic in his approach and at no time predicted a definite position whereby CIE would be self-sufficient.  At the period when CIE appeared to be extinguishing their deficit, I spoke conservatively and made it clear that there would be no easy passage for CIE.  Deputies will derive no comfort from the researches into what was said in 1949 or 1955.  In 1949, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking on the Second Stage of the Transport Bill, 1949, said, as reported in volume 118 column 69, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>In recommending this Bill to the House, I should like again to explain that it does not in itself purport to provide an immediate solution for the transport difficulties with which we have been beset for so many years.  I recommend it, however, as an appreciable advance on the road towards a final solution.  The Bill establishes the machinery and the organisation which, in capable hands and properly used, should bring <Col N="1754" /> efficiency and prosperity to our transport system.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by our national transport system.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suggest that these statements were made irresponsibly. As I have indicated the modern computered analysis of costs had not then been undertaken.</P>
      <P>The Members of the House are entitled to ask what will happen if there is a very marked deterioration in the position.  My answer is that the Government have made certain assumptions as with all future planning. These are that:</P>
      <P>(1)  It is hoped that the Board, supported by the entire staff, will induce more efficiency and retain existing traffics.</P>
      <P>(2)  It is hoped that the railway will gain traffic from the growth in the general economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  There is recognition of the fact that the huge staff of CIE will and should receive increases of remuneration <Col N="1755" /> applicable to the whole economy and that future increases as a result of the advice of the National Industrial Economic Council will be based on national productivity growth on a basis clearly set forth by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>(4)  No doubt the staff and management will recognise the special characteristics of the railway finances, the dependence on 20 important customers and on courteous punctual service.</P>
    <P>(5)  It is to be hoped that the staff while securing better remuneration as the nation advances will recognise the need for examining any changes in work procedures whose effect would be to jeopardise the whole future of the railway.  A subsidy of ten per cent on the revenue is at a level which the public can reluctantly accept.</P>
    <P>The moral of this is obvious.  The Government have given a new lease of life to the railway section of CIE. The Board and staff must meet the challenge presented to them.  The public might also recognise that a public transport system is essential but that it cannot be starved of traffic. There are many private companies who have not even yet permitted CIE to calculate package deal comparisons. They might now reconsider their present attitude.</P>
    <P>I should also make it clear that by any European standard and in relation to our national income the total provision of CIE bus, lorry and rail services is adequate and in many areas lavish in quantity, as instanced in the number of seats as distinct from standing room available in the cities.</P>
    <P>No doubt there will be changes in the future, the rail and road services will be tailored by need, but the proportion of losing services is complete proof that CIE do not under-estimate the need as compared with the economics of service.</P>
    <P>As it is now established that CIE cannot pay their way, the provision of finance by means of public stock issues is no longer appropriate.  Provision <Col N="1756" /> is made in the Bill for the issue of capital requirements from the Exchequer.  These issues are interest-bearing but the subsidy takes account of the need to pay interest to the Exchequer and provide for sinking funds on the sums advanced.  Apart from book-keeping considerations, it is desirable that the subsidy voted for the purpose should reflect the true revenue loss of the undertaking.  The £6 million capital borrowing provided for is an overall estimate of the sums required for approximately five years. The issues for actual expenditure each year will have to be considered on their merits and no firm estimate of the period for which the £6 million will be adequate can now be given with any certainty.  Further capital requirements will necessitate further legislation. The Government's intention is that sufficient capital must be provided to enable the railway to be maintained in efficient operation while avoiding expenditure of an uneconomic kind which may not be strictly essential. The Board are directed, therefore, to confine capital expenditure to essential works or to remunerative projects.</P>
    <P>The position of the CIE staff under the new provisions of course merits explanation.  CIE are the largest employer of labour in the country. Total staff at 31st March, 1964, is estimated at 20,148, of whom 10,947 were railway employees, 6,402 road passenger employees, 2,675 road freight employees and 124 canal employees. Salaries and wages in the year 1963-64 amounted to £13.4 million and account for 62 per cent of the operating expenditure and 64 per cent of operating revenue.  In addition, CIE contributions to their various pension schemes in that year amounted to £643,000, to which must be added the Board's contribution of £238,000 under the Social Welfare Acts, making a total contribution of £881,000.  The cost of the Board's welfare scheme, which is in the region of £94,000, is additional to the foregoing.  CIE as a whole, therefore, and the railway in particular, provide a livelihood for many thousands of families and this fact as well as the dry economic statistics and the services rendered to the community must be taken into account <Col N="1757" /> in any consideration of our transport problem.</P>
    <P>The Beddy Report of 1957 foresaw that a reorganisation of the undertaking on the lines recommended would involve very considerable staff redundancy. The Report considered that in determining the staff necessary for the efficient operation of the undertaking a suitable balance should be preserved between younger and older men. During the debate on the Transport Bill, 1958, the Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, appealed to the unions to relax the &ldquo;first in, first out&rdquo; rule so as to enable the staff reductions to be carried out on an ordered basis which would not impair efficiency.  Provision was made in the 1958 Bill for the extension of railway redundancy compensation to cover redundancy arising out of the general reorganisation of the undertaking over the five year period provided for and the cost of the redundancy arising therefrom was made a charge on the Exchequer.  These special provisions were intended to facilitate the once and for all major reduction in staff which was expected to be necessary if the planned reorganisation was to be carried through effectively and in the expectation that this reorganisation would enable CIE to achieve solvency.</P>
    <P>Up to 31st March, 1964, 1,768 CIE employees were retired on redundancy compensation.  Of these, 1,696 received annual sums and 72 short-service employees received gratuities.  In addition, 829 employees received lump sum compensation for worsening of their conditions of service.  The cost to date amounts to some £1.8 million but payments will continue on a reducing basis for many years and the ultimate aggregate cost is estimated at over £7 million.  The net reduction in staff from 22,051 in October, 1958, to 20,148 at 31st March, 1964, amounted to 1,903.  This figure was made up of a reduction of 1,861 in rail staff, 310 in canal staff and 136 in road passenger staff, offset by an increase of 404 in road freight staff.  When account is taken of normal wastage, which in an undertaking such as CIE would average about three per cent per annum, or a <Col N="1758" /> total of 3,000 in five years, the size of this reduction of 1,903, which was secured only by retiring 1,768 employees on compensation at a cost of over £7 million to the Exchequer, is disappointing.</P>
    <P>While it is obvious that gross wastage cannot be fully utilised to effect ordered staff reductions arising out of planned reorganisation, it does seem that normal wastage should have facilitated staff reduction to a greater extent.  In the five years from 1953 to 1958, CIE staff, excluding the Hotels Department, was reduced by normal wastage and without resort to statutory redundancy compensation from 20,050 to 19,032, a net reduction of 1,018, including a reduction of 1,271 in rail grades.</P>
    <P>Analysis of the statistics of staff retired on compensation shows that 51 per cent were over 60 years while a further 18 per cent were over 50.  The high level of railway compensation which is based not only on pay but also on other emoluments which, following the findings of the Standing Arbitrator, include overtime, travel concessions, gratuities, car allowances, out-of-pocket expenses etc., is in general more attractive than normal retirement pensions for older men. Staff redundancy has been effected by CIE on a planned basis in consultation with the trade unions, with whom they have to agree the extent to which redundancy will be met by transfer, planned wastage and retirement with compensation, respectively.  As the figures I have quoted reveal, there has been a strong tendency for older men to seek retirement on compensation in advance of normal retiring age.  The result has been that much of the redundancy has been at the expense of normal wastage, which would have come about in due course, or of transfer with lump sum compensation.  For this reason and because older men qualify for a higher level of compensation, the cost to the Exchequer has been very much higher than was ever anticipated.  The total cost of over £7 million represents an average cost per redundant of approximately £4,000.</P>
    <P>The extension of railway redundancy compensation effected under the <Col N="1759" /> Transport Act, 1958, and the placing of the cost on the Exchequer were, as I have already stated, wholly exceptional measures to facilitate the rapid and major reorganisation then foreseen. It was not intended that these provisions would be maintained after the period of reorganisation.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, when speaking on the Transport Bill, 1958, was crystal clear in his declaration that the same type of redundancy terms would not be perpetuated.  Leaving aside the heavy cost, these measures have achieved to a large extent their main objective&mdash;that of enabling CIE to undertake certain major reorganisation schemes for which they could not otherwise have expected to receive full trade union co-operation.</P>
    <P>Redundancy compensation provisions have been a feature of Irish railway legislation since 1924 and prior to the Transport Act, 1958, the cost fell on the railway companies.  Compensation is at a very generous level.  Staff with more than five years' service are entitled to compensation pension for life, which is reduced by a quarter at 65 years.  Provision is made for added years and a man with 30 years' service may retire with a pension of two-thirds of his retiring emoluments, which, as I have indicated, may in many cases include much more than pay.</P>
    <P>This level of compensation is not, to my knowledge equalled anywhere in the world.  Under the arrangements for compensation of British railway staff retired on redundancy arising out of the implementation of the Beeching proposals, the dismissed employee receives a lump sum payment amounting to two-thirds of the standard weekly rate for each year of service plus a weekly resettlement payment, while unemployed, at two-thirds of the standard weekly rate, less unemployment benefit at a single man's rate.  The resettlement period over which this weekly payment may be made varies with the length of service and is subject to a maximum of 52 weeks.</P>
    <P>Under these arrangements a man with 45 years' service, earning £10 8s. Od. per week, would receive a lump sum of £312 and weekly payments, while <Col N="1760" /> unemployed, which over the maximum resettlement period of 52 weeks would amount to £211, giving him a total of £523.  It has been proposed that, in addition to the foregoing, redundant men of 60 years of age and over, with at least 30 years' service, should on expiry of the resettlement period continue to receive half the standard weekly pay, less unemployment benefit, until they find work or reach 65 years of age.</P>
    <P>The provision of compulsory compensation by legislation and the generous level of compensation was a recognition of the special problem of a public service which was seen to be contracting and whose permanent staff, having regard to their location and specialised training, would, particularly in former years, have had great difficulty in securing reasonably paid employment elsewhere.  Entitlement to these statutory compensation provisions came to be regarded as part of the conditions of employment of railway staff and helped to secure and retain the services of good staff.  Though no further major reduction in the railway system is now foreseen and though prospects of alternative employment are better than they were, the Government consider that statutory redundancy compensation provisions similar to those which existed prior to the 1958 Act should be retained.  There is no justification, however, for the payment of the cost by the Exchequer but the cost of possible future redundancy has been taken into account in settling the level of subsidy.  Compensation for redundancy arising out of the automation of level crossings, which is analogous to the closing of railway services, and which was first provided for in the 1958 Act, is retained.</P>
    <P>The Government do not consider that statutory redundancy compensation provisions are either necessary or desirable to cover redundancy arising out of contingencies other than those provided for in the Bill.  The extension of redundancy compensation in 1958 to facilitate the reorganisation of the whole undertaking was a temporary and exceptional measure to meet exceptional circumstances which have now passed.  The special drawbacks <Col N="1761" /> of railway employment arising out of the possibility of contraction of the system do not apply throughout the undertaking.  Many sectors are more likely to expand than contract and many workers, especially tradesmen, could easily secure good alternative well paid employment.  No special measures are necessary, therefore, to protect their position other than the existing legislative provision under which CIE are obliged to settle the conditions of service of their staff in consultation with the trade unions.</P>
    <P>In so far as CIE wish to implement measures to secure greater efficiency or productivity and which would affect the level of employment in particular departments they will no doubt negotiate, as hitherto, with the trade unions in order to settle how any redundancy arising would be dealt with.  The cost of any redundancy compensation or severance pay which might be agreed would, of course, be a proper charge against the savings to be secured from the increased productivity.</P>
    <P>The remaining matters in the Bill are of minor importance.  CIE are being enabled to use modern selection methods in recruiting clerical staff but the principles of open competition and competence in Irish are being retained. The Board are being empowered to be represented by officials at certain meetings rather than by directors as required by the somewhat obsolete legislation governing the affairs of the Irish Railway Clearing House and the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company.  Provision is made for retention by CIE staff transferred to Óstlanna Iompair Éireann Teo., the new hotel subsidiary, of compensation rights to which they may be entitled. Section 10 deals with the position of a person who may have been dismissed on redundancy, later re-employed, and after a period again dismissed.  The section also clarifies the position regarding abatement of redundancy compensation.  Section 11 enables the Board to develop land or property not required for their own purposes. Deputies will have noticed that this Bill does not touch on road transport legislation.  There are aspects of road transport legislation and, indeed other <Col N="1762" /> matters, but of a minor character, affecting the affairs of CIE, which call for review.  Further investigation and examination are, however, necessary before a decision can be reached as to the extent and character of such further amending legislation as may be necessary.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, may I repeat the main points outlined in my speech? First, it has been established that CIE have no prospect of paying their way. Secondly, a changeover from rail to road would not solve the financial problem nor provide for certain purposes services as good as the railway. The Government have, therefore, decided to preserve the railway system subject to such further concentration and reorganisation as may be found practicable and desirable.  The Bill provides for a fixed subsidy, with the aid of which CIE must break even, for advances to meet capital expenditure which is either essential or remunerative. Borrowings of £1 million from the Exchequer are being written off.  Statutory railway redundancy compensation provisions are retained to meet the redundancy arising out of railway closures, on the same lines as before the reorganisation period provided for in the 1958 Act, and the cost will as formerly fall on CIE. Redundancy arising out of other contingencies such as economies or other improvements in efficiency will be a matter for negotiation between CIE and the trade unions.  In general, the position in regard to redundancy compensation reverts to the pre-1958 position.</P>
    <P>As I think I have demonstrated, there is no facile solution to our transport problem.  A similar problem exists in most other countries where the continued rapid increase in private transport for both passengers and goods multiplies difficulties for public transport and particularly for the railways.  The financial provisions of this Bill are necessary if a satisfactory public transport system is to be maintained.  I am convinced that the Board's abbreviated but highly informative report circulated to the Oireachtas and summarising the reorganisation effected in the five years reflects credit on the entire staff even <Col N="1763" /> though this achievement was marked by some unfortunate strikes.  I am certain that but for the progress made I would have been confronted with a requirement for a totally inadmissible subvention and that some alternative drastic change in the public transport system would be inevitable. I recommend the Bill to the Dáil, if not with pleasure, at least with the confidence that no better solution exists at this time.  Success in justification of the Bill lies squarely with the Board and the staff.</P>

      <P>This is a most shameful oration to the Dáil delivered by a shameless person.  The Minister says there is no facile solution for the problems of transport in this country. Since the Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, put his clumsy hands on the transport system of this country in 1933, we have had nothing but a series of speeches breathing confidence that, after the arrangements made by the Legislature, we would get an efficient system, a system that would cater for the needs of the community, a system that would give us a cheap service and one adequate for all our needs.  Here we are, in 1964, finding out now that all that was so much nonsense and discovering that there is now recognition for the first time that the transport system cannot be met by the legislative proposals since 1933, or even by the present one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expressed my view on this the other night; this represents to me the most expensive wake I have ever been asked to attend.  We are now repealing, and repealing with a good deal of public expense, the transport legislation of 1933 and, more particularly, the transport legislation of 1958 and the Minister has nothing to offer us <Col N="1764" /> except to say that this is in common with all countries, and this, that, and the other.  He has not told us when he realised that the transport situation here was different from or equal to the difficulties experienced by transport associations in other countries.  He does not give us any date for that.  He says it was realised.  I wonder when.</P>
    <P>I turn now to some of the detail&mdash; details, of course, will have to be threshed out on the Committee Stage&mdash; that he gives us here at page 8 of the typescript, with which he has been good enough to supply us.  He says that &ldquo;While the Board has been unable to combat these trends with complete success&rdquo;&mdash;that is the greatest understatement of the year; they have been proved to be completely incompetent under the Minister's management; I do not intend to compromise or criticise the Board except under the Minister's mismanagement.  It is wrong to say that the trends have been met with complete success, the Minister says, and he goes on to add that &ldquo;the position would have been much worse but for their efforts in many directions&rdquo;. Later he says that, if it were not for the reorganisation carried out by the Board, including the closing of uneconomic lines, further dieselisation and improvements in productivity, the Board's total loss would now be over £3 million per annum instead of merely the £750,000 that he expects it to be. I think the answer to a question today shows the deficit for the year to be about £1,500,000.  This speech was probably written before that question was replied to.  We are told that a good deal of the Minister's speech depends on the report.  Asked when that was given to us, it was said to have been some weeks ago.</P>

I never saw it until my colleague brought it to me <Col N="1765" /> now.  There were two big volumes in the Library on 9th March.  We are here now, late in May, and the Minister has a speech prepared for him by civil servants, a speech founded on that report which we had no chance of secing.   I cannot, therefore, comment on the Pacemaker Report because I have not had time to read it.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about this report being a detailed scientific criticism made in a detailed scientific way as a result of an exhaustive study and he found a good deal of the matter to which he has treated us on that report. He says copies were delivered to trade unions or, on request, to other parties. We might, I think, have been favoured with a copy of the report specially directed to us.  I certainly did not see it and I had no cognisance of it until this evening.  As a person who was at one time charged with responsibility for transport, I think I might have been made cognisant of it before tonight.</P>

In Dublin, we were under the illusion that the services in Dublin were paying for the rest of the country.

We have been given no information as to when it was realised that transport in this country could not be operated profitably.  The Minister said: &ldquo;The conclusions to be drawn are in effect that no public transport system incorporating a railway can pay its way&rdquo;.  That is what we are discovering in 1964, while in 1933 the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, <Col N="1770" /> told us that after the arrangements made by the Legislature we would have a system which would give an efficient and cheap transport service, which would cater for the needs of the community.</P>

    <P>I recommend the Bill to the Dáil, if not with pleasure, at least with the confidence that no better solution exists at this time.</P>
    <P>He said earlier that there is no facile solution to our transport problem.  His controller, the Taoiseach, had a facile solution in 1933 when he thought that transport in this country could be made to pay its way.  Now we are told that that has been recognised as farcical, and that there is no facile solution to our transport problem.</P>
    <P>On page 14 of his statement, the Minister entered on an analysis of &ldquo;the fundamental reasons why a railway system cannot be operated profitably in our circumstances.&rdquo;  I want to stop there.  When did the Minister make this analysis?  When did he come to the conclusion that &ldquo;a railway system cannot be operated profitably in our circumstances&rdquo;?  Was it months ago?  We were under the illusion that the railway company could meet its requirements under the 1958 Act and pay its way inside the five years ending last year.  Now we are told by the Minister that he is going &ldquo;to analyse the fundamental reasons why a railway system cannot be operated profitably in our circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that the cost of maintaining the railway line is very largely fixed and is influenced very little by the volume of traffic.  He goes on in paragraph 28 to say:</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have a relatively sparse population and the main centres of population and industry are near the coast, particularly the east coast, and the country does not therefore yield the density of traffic&mdash;</P>
    <P>Is that a thought which has occurred to the Minister in 1964?  Geographically, all these facts have been before <Col N="1771" /> the Minister.  We have a sparse population and it is mainly along the east coast and it is not scattered as in other countries.  The Minister tells us that in May, 1964.  This is a new thought to him.  He is developing this thought for the first time in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>He goes on:</P>
    <P>&mdash;and the country does not, therefore, yield the density of traffic in either passengers or freight which could provide a reasonably high level of utilisation of the equipment and staff.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 29, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>I have made a considerable study of European railway finances.  In the systems where expenditure, including interest on capital, is equated either absolutely or approximately to revenue there are always factors operating which do not exist here...</P>
    <P>Where did the Minister make this &ldquo;considerable study&rdquo;?  Did he go abroad to make it?  What was the date of his researches?  Did he give us any idea of what the result of these researches meant to this country? After all, the previous paragraph speaks of certain factors in the economy of the country which have been there for centuries but the Minister had to go abroad to make a considerable study of European railway finances, and then he speaks about the new situation.  The new situation&mdash;I do not think I am paraphrasing it in too hard a way&mdash;is that this is a complete give-in on the Railway Act, 1958. Up to the introduction of the transport legislation, we were led to believe that the whole transport situation could break evenly but now we are told that it requires a subsidy.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 30, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>The fixed subsidy of £2 million per annum&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is not in the legislation, by the way&mdash;</P>
    <P>which will be subject to alternation in the light of circumstances at the end of five years, has been calculated <Col N="1772" /> after careful examination of estimates supplied by CIE.</P>
    <P>We are now in the position that the system from which the Minister used to reel in admiration of all the great work being done by the Board responsible to him&mdash;Dr. Andrews and his people&mdash;and about whom the Minister used to talk with admiration and speak of the efforts being made and all their successes, has now to be subsidised. This outfit has now to be subsidised to the extent of £2 million a year over five years&mdash;it may not be spread over; it may be given in the first year&mdash;ten million pounds, plus £1 million in this year, plus capital development.  That is the result from all these people who are so expert and for whom the Minister has so much admiration and of whom he spoke in words of praise such as &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He tells us in this paragraph:</P>
    <P>When this Bill becomes law, I shall direct the Board&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Minister who tells us he cannot direct the Board to do anything&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to make a further tremendous sustained effort to secure and retain traffic and to reduce costs, in the hope that the Bill's subsidy provisions be over-adequate.</P>
    <P>What is the situation after all this tremendous success the Board of CIE, under his auspices, have achieved?  We are now to give them £11 million with further moneys for capital development and the Minister will direct the Board, although he has told us that he cannot direct them in anything to do with day-to-day administration, to make a further tremendous sustained effort.</P>
    <P>This is getting back to the nonsense which the Minister has talked in regard to this Board for so many years.  All their efforts are tremendous.  He wants to sustain their tremendous efforts and wants to hope that they will not require the £11 million subsidy which this Bill gives over a period not longer than five years.  The next paragraph, No. 31, says:</P>
    <P>... while the Government have decided to preserve the railway the subsidy is heavy by European <Col N="1773" /> standards particularly if European war pensions and capital amortisation are eliminated from the deficits of European railways.</P>
    <P>All this tremendous effort which the Minister's people have made, all these dynamic people, is now to be subsidised by a further £11 million.  The Minister confessed after his studies of the European situation that this has to be considered as heavy by European standards.  Does that mean that the people the Minister appointed to run CIE are inadequate, according to European standards because the odd circumstance has been developed which makes a greater subsidy required here than elsewhere?</P>
    <P>In paragraph 32, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>A subsidy is only justified because an arterial railway system is essential under conditions likely to prevail for a considerable period.</P>
    <P>When did he come to the conclusion that a railway system is essential? We never heard that when branch lines were being closed down or when stations were being closed.  Mark you, we were told that if there was to be any closure of branch lines or of stations, there would be a public inquiry.  The present Taoiseach told us at the time that we need not put down such an amendment because that was the intention, that if there was to be any closure of a branch line or station, there would be a public inquiry at which public representatives would be able to make their case.  Now the Minister tells us that an arterial railway system is essential.  That is not what we have been told over the years.  He has run away from his responsibilities and taken refuge behind the phrase &ldquo;day-to-day administration&rdquo;.  Everything, according to him, is a matter of day-to-day administration and the pledges given about public inquiries have been falsified.  The Minister now says that &ldquo;an arterial railway system is essential under conditions likely to prevail for a considerable period&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 33 which I read for the first time says:</P>
    <P>The successive Governments examining the affairs of the public transport service have always tried <Col N="1774" /> to frame legislation based on the hope that the entire system might pay its way even if its capital was largely unremunerated.</P>
    <P>Then we get a reference to the Pacemaker Report.  Apparently the Minister accepts that the view of successive Governments was that there was a hope that the system might pay its way even if &ldquo;capital was largely unremunerated&rdquo;.  That is a very smooth phrase to slide over the reality that a lot of capital has been lost on the railway system.</P>
    <P>I remember when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce, we cut out railway employees from the unemployment insurance code on the basis that their employment was so secure that if we took contributions from them, they would never get anything in return.  There is an entirely different situation now.  Capital has not been remunerated; capital has been lost.  I do not know how many families there must be whose ancestors left them railway stocks and shares which were regarded as being the nearest thing to Bank of England or Bank of Ireland securities and which would never go down but which have been lost completely. That is one side of the situation. In fact, in recent legislation, we have wiped off considerable amounts of capital.  People have been told they cannot look for a return any longer.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the employees' side. We are told the provisions of the Bill will ensure that not merely will there be no running down of the main arterial system but there will be the maintenance and improvement of the system.  That was written, of course, a fortnight ago, after considerable parts of the line had been written off.  People have been seeing branch lines and stations closed down, rolling stock broken up and station property sold, anything belonging to them in the way of real property dissipated and sold off to other people.  Whatever is left is what we are now dealing with as a system that has to be maintained and even improved.  I do not know how a system can be improved where branch lines have been closed down, and railway property sold.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 36, the Minister sincerely <Col N="1775" /> hopes that this very large subsidy will be sufficient.  We have heard that story so often before that we are inclined to be sarcastic about it.  On page 19, he quotes from the Official Report:</P>
    <P>In recommending this Bill to the House, I should like again to explain that it does not in itself purport to provide an immediate solution for the transport difficulties with which we have been beset for so many years.</P>
    <P>That was after his chief had told us there are no difficulties in providing an efficient transport system for the whole country.  The Minister goes on:</P>
    <P>I recommend it, however, as an appreciable advance on the road towards a final solution.  The Bill establishes the machinery and the organisation which, in capable hands and properly used, should bring efficiency and prosperity to our transport system.</P>
    <P>That was in 1949, if the Minister's statement is correct.  Let me repeat those phrases: &ldquo;appreciable advance&rdquo;, &ldquo;final solution&rdquo;, &ldquo;machinery and organisation which, in capable hands&rdquo;, &mdash;I suppose he suggests he has provided the capable hands&mdash;&ldquo;and properly used should bring efficiency and prosperity&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I was quoting the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Morrissey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>How often have we heard these phrases since?  I am sure the Minister thought he provided the capable hand to bring efficiency and prosperity to the transport system.  The Minister said at paragraph 38:</P>
      <P>The members of the House are entitled to ask what will happen if there is a very marked deterioration in the position.  My answer is that the Government have made certain assumptions as with all future planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> Then he goes on:</P>
    <P>(1)  It is hoped that the Board, supported by the entire staff, will induce more efficiency and retain existing traffics.</P>
    <P>(2)  It is hoped that the railway will gain traffic from the growth in the general economy.</P>
    <P>(3)  There is recognition of the fact that the huge staff of CIE will and should receive increases of remuneration...</P>
    <P>When I heard the Minister reading that, I began to wonder what stage of civilisation we are in.  Does the Minister believe our system will be operated by people who will not demand increases in wages whenever they are demanded by outside concerns?  The Minister need not have patted himself on the back in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to say in regard to future increases:</P>
    <P>....future increases as a result of the advice of the National Industrial Council will be based on national productivity growth on a basis clearly set forth by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In other words: &ldquo;We will give you what we have to give you and nothing more.&rdquo;  The Minister continues:</P>
    <P>(4)  No doubt the staff and management will recognise the special characteristics of the railway finances, the dependence on 20 important customers and on courteous punctual service.</P>
    <P>There is another admonitory finger wagged at the employees.  I quote again:</P>
    <P>(5)  It is to be hoped that the staff while securing better remuneration as the nation advances will recognise the need for examining any changes in work procedures whose effect would be to jeopardise the whole future of the railway...</P>
    <P>Of those five paragraphs, two are devoted to admonitions and three to hopes.  We are giving this subsidy of £11 million and the Minister can say he hopes the position will be better than it has been in the past five years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1777" /> In paragraph 44, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>The Beddy Report of 1957 foresaw that a reorganisation of the undertaking on the lines recommended would involve very considerable staff redundancy.</P>
    <P>Later in the paragraph, he says that these special provisions by way of compensation were intended to facilitate the once and for all major reduction in staff which was expected to be necessary.  In paragraph 45, this is summed up:</P>
    <P>Up to 31st March, 1964, 1,768 CIE employees were retired on redundancy compensation.</P>
    <P>He then gives details of the compensation to the various employees.  The Minister slides over what is recognised as a public scandal, that is, the pensions given to CIE employees and about which the Minister has been catechised here by Parliamentary Question, while all the time he has refused to give us any answer and hidden behind day-to-day organisation.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 47, the Minister says the extension of the railway redundancy compensation under the transport Act, 1958, and the placing of the cost on the Exchequer were wholly exceptional measures to facilitate the rapid and major reorganisation then foreseen and that it was not intended that these provisions would be maintained after the period of reorganisation. He goes on in paragraph 47 to say:</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the heavy cost, these measures have achieved to a large extent their main objectives&mdash;</P>
    <P>Remember, that this is a paragraph dealing with human beings, people about to be rendered redundant&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that of enabling CIE to undertake certain major reorganisation schemes for which they could not otherwise have expected to receive full trade Union co-operation.</P>
    <P>In other words: &ldquo;We have fooled the trade unions by our attitude towards a major reorganisation scheme.  Now that we have got over that, we hope any new surprises will not be too <Col N="1778" /> severe.&rdquo;  Whoever wrote the Minister's speech had no appreciation of human conditions.</P>
    <P>On page 25, paragraph 49, the Minister is made to say&mdash;I am sure he did not say this on his own, or if he did he is more out of touch than I ever believed him to have been with human affairs:</P>
    <P>The provision of compulsory compensation by legislation and the generous level of compensation was a recognition of the special problem of a public service which was seen to be contracting and whose permanent staff, having regard to their location and specialised training, would, particularly in former years, have had great difficulty in securing reasonably paid employment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister feel happy over these phrases, whether he wrote them or not, that the compensation provisions are generous in respect of the people to whom he refers and having regard to the fact that railway employment was regarded as completely secure?</P>
    <P>The Minister throws all that into the balance.  These are people who had specialised training, and special location, people in the works at Inchicore, many of whom had settled themselves and their families in a specialised location, such as the vicinity of Inchicore.  The Minister thinks that on account of their special location and their specialised training they may have difficulty in finding alternative employment elsewhere, but in spite of that, he concludes that they were generously treated.  Would the Minister go to any place where there is a railway yard and talk to the employees there, and mention the word &ldquo;generous&rdquo; to them in connection with the treatment they have received? He goes on then and excuses that by saying that no further major reduction in the railway system is now foreseen and that prospects of alternative employment are better than they were.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>He might stand them a small beer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is all &ldquo;small beer&rdquo; to the Minister.  Here <Col N="1779" /> is a person trained in a specialised service and if he does not see any prospect of immediate alternative employment, it means the quayside and the boat for him.  It means that he will be one of the 300,000 people who, within the next ten years, will have to export themselves to England, according to the Government's plans. The Minister thinks there is no further major reduction in the railway system now foreseeable and therefore he proposes to retain the redundancy provisions that operated prior to the 1958 Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister concludes by referring to some matters of minor importance and he goes on to say that CIE are being enabled to use modern selection methods in recruiting clerical staff.  He then goes on and repeats the main points in his speech and says:</P>
      <P>First, it has been established that CIE have no prospect of paying their way.</P>
      <P>Think of this as a conclusion after the reading of 29 pages of a Civil Service brief in May of 1964.  He says that it has been established that CIE have no prospect of paying their way.  The Minister has the nerve to put forward that as one of the conclusions to which his studies here, on the Continent and elsewhere have led him.</P>
      <P>His second conclusion is:</P>
      <P>A changeover from rail to road would not solve the financial problem nor provide for certain purposes services as good as the railway.</P>
      <P>And finally he says:</P>
      <P>As I think I have demonstrated, there is no facile solution to our transport problem.</P>
      <P>How long is it since we heard from the Minister, when he came from his various meetings with Dr. Andrews, that we were to get an efficient, satisfactory and adequate transport system? That was a promise and the promise was also made here that no branch line or station would be closed down without first having a public inquiry into the matter.  All those promises have been falsified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also says: <Col N="1780" /> I am convinced that the Board's abbreviated but highly informative report circulated to the Oireachtas and summarising the reorganisation effected in the five years reflects credit on the entire staff.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it does reflect credit on the staff.  I do not know in what circumstances the staff would take credit for this report but it reflects no credit on the Minister and gives us in this House every right to demand that every part of our railway system should be brought under review in this House by way of Parliamentary Question.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that he recommends the Bill to the Dáil, if not with pleasure, at least with the confidence that no better solution exists at this time.  He should recommend the Bill to the House with shame.  It is a confession of weakness.  The towel is now in the ring and all he has said over the years with regard to the transport system has been completely falsified.  He is now coming to the House with his cap in his hand, asking for more money for these dynamic people whom he appointed.  At a later stage, I propose to move that we bring back public transport under the control of this House so that we shall be able to have an examination of even the day to day administration that is required after the fiasco that has been made by those to whom the Minister gave unfettered control.  Is the Minister running away from his Parliamentary responsibility in regard to what is happening to our transport system.</P>
    <P>We propose to examine, not merely CIE, rail and bus, but all our transport services.  We propose to examine the airlines.  The Minister often talks about how various parts of our transport services are meeting their operational expenses.  We are not interested in these but we want to know how far they pay their way; are they able to buy the planes in which they carry passengers; if they are not able to do that, where do they get the money to buy them?  I want to examine also our shipping services.  We have a shipping line.  I do not know how many <Col N="1781" /> ships they have but very few of their vessels ever come to this country.  They are run at a loss and we are subsidising them.  We are told that they are engaged in carrying cargo but they are not engaged in carrying cargoes between natives of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Labour Party and the trade unions are concerned, we feel that while this Bill has many shortcomings to which I propose to refer briefly to-night, we welcome it for no other reason than that pointed out by the Minister in his introductory statement.  It marks the conversion of the Minister and his Government to a policy that we have been advocating down through the years.  The Minister at last admits that he believes the experience over the five years since the last Transport Bill finally disposes of the hope that either the railway, or the undertaking as a whole, can be put on a self-supporting basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He goes on to tell us that the Government have therefore decided to <Col N="1782" /> preserve the railway system, subject to further concentration and reorganisation as may prove practicable and desirable and to provide an annual subsidy.  It gives no pleasure to say to the Minister at this juncture: &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo;  I suppose we would be less than human if we did not invite the Minister to cast his mind back to the debate in this House during the passage of the 1958 Act, and, indeed, to previous Transport Bills as well.</P>
    <P>We always maintained that the transport system in this country could not be a viable economic unit and carry out the other duties imposed on it by the legislation aimed at providing an adequate transport service by rail and road.  We went for the conversion of the Minister.  The main regret we have in this regard is, having made that conversion and having denounced the Government's policy, that the provisions of the Bill fall very far short of what we would deem to be necessary to implement that policy.  We always said, particularly in 1958, that this break-even concept was unrealistic and unjustified.</P>
    <P>I remember when the present Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, introduced the Bill, the benches behind him were full and anybody who suggested to him that the system he was about to impose on the transport industry in this country was some kind of hysteric, was slightly mentally deranged.  Voices behind the Minister were cheering him home on it.  We would be less than human if we did not point out these sentences in the Minister's introductory statement, which is now apparently Government policy.  These are taken almost literally from the speeches made by Labour and trade union people down through the years on transport.</P>
    <P>To grasp the extent of the conversion, one has to study the attitude and the public statements of the Minister himself in this connection.  I should think that of all the members of the Cabinet, the Minister for Transport and Power must have been the hardest man to convince in this connection.  I have followed the Minister's statements on policy down through the <Col N="1783" /> years in relation to public transport, and particularly in relation to the desirability of State subvention for the industry.  I have made notes on some of his utterances.</P>
    <P>I invite Deputies to cast their minds back to 1960 when he was addressing the Dublin Society of Chartered Accountants.  He conveyed in no uncertain terms what he felt about it at that stage.  He said:</P>
    <P>There should be an end to public subsidies in any form whatsoever for surface internal transport.</P>
    <P>He doled out these words of wisdom to the Dublin Society of Chartered Accountants&mdash;that there should be an end to subsidy of any form for internal surface transport.  I am glad he has changed his mind in that connection. He went along, of course, to a sheltered gathering on 26th April, 1961.  It was a comhairle ceantair meeting of his own Party and he said he was going to insist that public transport would pay its way in this country without any subvention or subsidy from the Government.  He repeated this at intervals.  He only waited until the 6th April, 1962, to go to a meeting of Tuairim in Clonmel and he is quoted as saying there that CIE had to pay their way because the age of subsidies was rapidly passing away, that currently operated subsidies were deadly, breeding inefficiency and bolstered up out of out-moded techniques. We said, and we continue to say, during all these ramblings of the Minister, that that was a daft, unrealistic policy for public transport for any Government to have.</P>
    <P>At the meeting of the Institute of Transport in Dublin on 20th February, 1963, he informed these people, all of whom were engaged in transport and the majority of whom were engaged in public transport, that subsidies were not in any way justified <i>per se</i>.  He did not believe us of course.  As recently as the 21st June last year, when the transport legislation must have been actively engaging the brains of his advisers, when it must have been under <Col N="1784" /> active consideration and when CIE had all their chief executives writing reports on the matter, the Minister got up at the CIE wagon works in Limerick and said he was forecasting the unlikelihood of any general subsidy for CIE.  He repeated that subsidies breed inefficiency and indifference. I have quoted all that, just to show the extent of the conversion which the Minister has illustrated here today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall quote from the Minister's speech today:</P>
      <P>The experience over the five year reorganisation period and the Pacemaker study disposed finally of the hope that either the railway or the undertaking as a whole would be put on a self-supporting basis.  The Government have decided, therefore, after very full and careful consideration, to preserve the railway system subject to such further concentration and reorganisation as may prove practicable and desirable, and to provide a fixed annual subsidy with the aid of which the Board should be expected to break even.</P>
      <P>I do not blame the Minister for having seen the light.  I welcome his conversion.  Our only regret is that, having been converted to that extent, it is a pity he did not include provisions in the Bill which would enable the new Government policy to be carried out. At any rate, we have the Minister converted to the idea which we have been advocating, that the transport industry could not pay without a subsidy.  We welcome that and we congratulate him on the decision he has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come to the subsidy itself.  The terms of this Bill provide that there is to be a subsidy of £2 million per year for the next five years.  If the Minister feels that any board can carry on a programme such as he outlines here, and which we all hope they will be able to carry out on a subsidy of £2 million per year for the next five <Col N="1785" /> years, quite obviously he is living in cloud-cuckoo land.  Nobody outside of Grangegorman would suggest, at least on the basis of the figure he gave in reply to a question of mine here today&mdash;a loss for the financial year ending 31st March last of £1.6 million&mdash;that a subvention of £2 million per annum will meet the requirements of CIE.  We know that in this annual subsidy of £2 million the first charge CIE will have to meet is the sinking fund on their Transport Stock, which, in the year ending 31st March, 1963, amounted to £909,184.</P>
    <P>Therefore, one can immediately write off £1 million of the £2 million of annual subsidy as payment of interest and sinking fund on Transport Stock.  That leaves CIE with £1 million to meet their operating losses and their net deficit each year.  What about the situation at the end of five years?  I wonder has the Minister taken into account that inevitably money values will change between now and five years hence.  That has been the history of our system since pre-war days, and the Minister knows that the £1 million CIE will have available to meet the deficit this year will not be £1 million in real value in five years' time.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister taken into account that CIE inevitably will have to meet increased costs in the running of the railways and other undertakings?  He knows that well, and if he does not the Minister for Industry and Commerce can forecast for him that within two years, at the latest, CIE employees, in common with employees in other industries, will be demanding the tenth round increase in wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate here to refer to the proven inadequacy of the ninth round: that is a matter for another debate, for another Minister, but nobody will deny that within two years CIE will have to meet the tenth round as well as the general tendency prevailing in industry towards a shorter working week.  The trade unions will insist on having comparable conditions, comparable rates of wages and salaries, with outside industries.  As they have done in the past, they will succeed in securing them.  That will be again an added increase on CIE costs, again to <Col N="1786" /> come out of the net £1 million on which they are supposed to run the undertaking.</P>
    <P>Does anybody suggest that the pension scheme and sick pay arrangements in CIE should not be jacked up considerably to keep them in line with such schemes in other State and semi-State bodies?  The Minister may say that if all these things happen&mdash;I do not think he can deny they will&mdash; CIE can recover by increasing their charges, both for passengers and goods. I do not know whether it was the Minister who said&mdash;some Government spokesman did within the past year&mdash; that we had reached the stage where increased costs on CIE could no longer be put over on the public&mdash; that by increasing fares or tonnage rates there would be traffic losses at the other end.</P>
    <P>A further charge on the net £1 million CIE will have at their disposal is the provision in this Bill&mdash;a very hefty provision&mdash;that henceforth CIE will have to meet out of their own resources compensation payments to their employees.  As we all know, the 1958 Transport Act wisely provided that compensation arising out of redundancy in CIE could be recouped by the Exchequer.  This Bill says that is to end.</P>
    <P>From now on, all that will be a charge on CIE, to be paid out of their own resources.  To give some idea of the immensity of that obligation, it is well to show the cost of redundancy compensation since the passing of the 1958 Act and which was a charge on the Exchequer.  In 1958-59 the sum was £37,500, in 1959-60, £109,870, in 1960-61, £325,853, in 1961-62, £238,431, and in 1962-63, £311,500, making a total of £1,023,000, all paid by the Exchequer.  Henceforth any redundancy payments that will fall must be made out of the resources of CIE who will be dependent, in relation to their operating losses, on the subsidy of £2 million per year out of which, as I have already outlined, £1 million will have disappeared.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that Government policy is to preserve the railway system and that provision in the Bill ensures that there will be no running <Col N="1787" /> down of the main arterial system.  On the contrary, there will be maintenance and improvement of the system.  The decision has been made that a railway is essential in this country, even at heavy cost to the taxpayer.  The Minister says that no private operator would take on the obligation.  I suggest the Minister spoke with tongue in cheek when he committed himself to the policy we have been advocating for so long of keeping the railways.</P>
    <P>In section 3 of the Bill the Minister proposes to muzzle and hamstring the Board of CIE, who are expected to carry out Government policy in this respect.  We are told that the Board shall not incur any expenditure that is properly chargeable to capital unless they are satisfied the expenditure is essential for the efficient operation of their undertaking or unless it is to make a profit.  We all know that CIE in recent times have been embarking on a campaign to make railway travel more attractive.  They have embarked on schemes and have invested capital in new coaches, and a darn good job they have been making of it.  The public realise that and the Board are to be congratulated on their initiative and on the progress they are making.</P>
    <P>They are still making these new coaches for better, more comfortable, travel.  To my mind, if they are to carry out the obligations the Minister imposes on them in this Bill, they will have to stop doing that because the rail section of the organisation certainly cannot be described as making a profit at the moment: it cannot be described as a remunerative section of CIE. Therefore, I ask the Minister this question.  Is it not true that that section of the Bill will hamstring the Board in relation to that small aspect of the vast undertaking?</P>
    <P>Take the maintenance and the restoration of the permanent way&mdash; a vital factor in railway operations. To relay a whole section of line in a service that is not making a profit is unremunerative.  If I were a member of the Board of CIE and got this Bill, as an Act, handed into my hands I <Col N="1788" /> should feel that my Board was debarred from expending capital on the restoration and maintenance of long stretches of the permanent way because that happens to be a section of the organisation that is unremunerative.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Board cannot interpret the legislation in any way other than as a piece of legislation designed with a view to letting the railway run down. The Government may not be strong enough to say plainly: &ldquo;Eventually, we want to go over altogether to road transport&rdquo; but, by writing this into the Act, by restricting the Board in their capital expenditure, slowly but surely over the next five years, and the five years after that, the railways will be allowed to run down because of the restrictive clause here which will not permit the board of CIE to invest their capital in a manner which they feel might be done and should be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister is probably aware, as well, that while great advances have been made over the years regarding office accommodation and canteens for the staffs of CIE this restrictive section will prohibit the board of CIE from making any further advances for providing better office accommodation or canteens for the staff because that will be a capital investment which is unremunerative and which can be deemed to be nonessential. I sincerely ask the Minister to have another look at that section. I do not know what he intended when he put it in but I hope I have pointed out some of the dangers that lie in it and the interpretation that any diligent, intelligent member of the Board would be obliged by law to put on it and to operate it accordingly.  I do not think that there is any other State body so restricted or similarly restricted in relation to capital investment. Maybe there is, but I know none of them.  Certainly, up to now, CIE were never restricted in that regard.</P>
    <P>I feel it is an insult to the integrity and honesty of the Board of CIE and to the personnel of the Board that the Minister should so restrict them and lay down conditions as to the manner in which they shall invest capital, at the same time charging them with running <Col N="1789" /> the organisation efficiently.  If the Minister thinks the Board are inefficient or dishonest&mdash;I do not&mdash;he should sack them and put in some other Board.  If he has any regard for their honour and integrity, he should relieve them of that kind of shackle in a Transport Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to the provisions for compensation in the Bill, the trade unions are naturally worried because of a major departure in this regard. There is provision for the payment of compensation as a direct consequence of the Board having ceased to provide or having permanently reduced any transport service by rail or inland waterway or having substituted diesel for steam traction or of the making of an Order under section 9 in relation to a specified crossing.  In other words, the compensatory provision is maintained in respect of anybody who becomes redundant because there is a change-over from steam to diesel locomotion. The Minister points out at one stage of his speech that that operation is complete at the moment so the provision there is really not necessary but where the provision is necessary it is significantly omitted from the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is provision for compensation in the rail section under certain conditions. There is no provision at all, good, bad or indifferent, for anybody who becomes redundant if he happens to be employed in the road side of the CIE organisation.  I refer to the road passenger people&mdash;drivers and conductors&mdash;who have no coverage at all under this Bill for redundancy.  We know the difficulties that arose through the introduction of the one-man bus operation.  I understand that CIE intend to extend the one-man bus service and that, in fact, buses of that description are still being built in Inchicore.  If that is so, there is bound to be redundancy among busmen, but they are absolutely excluded in this Bill in relation to any compensation that might be paid to them because of their becoming redundant in that regard.  The Minister should have another look at that.  He should ensure that he will not run into trouble and that CIE will not run into trouble by <Col N="1790" /> the further implementation of the one-man bus without adequate compensatory provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Even in respect of rail staff, there is significantly omitted from this Bill a provision in the 1958 Act whereby anybody who became redundant because of reorganisation within CIE was entitled to compensation&mdash;introducing new methods, changing office routine, changing the accountancy system, changing administrative connections with their customers.  Under the 1958 Act, clerks and stationmasters who were declared redundant secured compensation because of that.  In this Act, that is left out.  The trade unions concerned found that particular provision of the 1958 Act very helpful indeed in so far as it enabled them, with enthusiasm, to co-operate with the management of CIE in relation to reorganisation within the different sections of the undertaking.  The management of CIE were in a position to come along and to say to the trade unions concerned: &ldquo;Look, we propose to reorganise this office and the net result will be that one, two, three of your people will be displaced from employment.&rdquo;  There was a provision in the 1958 Act that people displaced from employment in that connection should receive compensation.  That is omitted from this Bill and I hope the Minister is not so native as to think that the management of CIE can continue to get the co-operation of the trade unions in their reorganisation schemes when this vital provision is left out of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say&mdash;I think he suggested it in his introductory speech &mdash;that the period of reorganisation should be over now.  Perhaps, he is right but I should like to feel, and certainly so would the CIE trade unions, that the period of the organisation is not over and that further measures of improvement, and further improvement in the standard of service in the whole transport industry, can be brought about by new methods.  The union would certainly lean over backwards to co-operate in that regard provided the provisions that were written into the 1958 Act are rewritten into this.  If they are not, on the Minister's <Col N="1791" /> head be it, if the manager of CIE comes along tomorrow or next week and says: &ldquo;I can no longer get co-operation from the trade unions in relation to reorganisation.&rdquo;  I hope the Minister will wisely have another look at that.</P>
    <P>That is another matter in the Bill which requires comment, even on the Second Stage, because it represents a complete departure from transport legislation as we know it and as our predecessors knew it since 1924.  In all the transport legislation that has passed through this House since 1924, the provisions of the 1924 Railways Act have been repeated in regard to the method by which the clerical staff of the railway companies and the national transport concern are recruited.  It was laid down, year after year, that entry to the clerical staff was to be by open competitive examination. That was written in originally when we had private railway companies in 1924 because obviously there was prevalent abuse in the manner in which staffs were recruited&mdash;mainly through influence and patronage.  The 1924 Act wrote that off and subsequent Transport Acts up to and including the 1958 Act recognised the wisdom of the proper manner of recruitment.</P>
    <P>As far as I know, and I know something about it, it worked very well indeed.  At no stage can I remember any chairman, manager or board of CIE indicating in even the slightest way to the Transport Salaried Staffs Association&mdash;the trade union catering for that grade of officer of CIE&mdash;that there was something even remotely wrong with the system or that they were not getting good results from it. The first we knew of any concern with the manner of recruitment was when we read the Bill for the first time. I should like to know where the idea came from.</P>
    <P>Instead of the written, competitive, open examination the Minister proposes that the clerical staff of CIE may be recruited in any of four ways. The moment the Bill becomes law, of course, CIE will operate it and take their choice of four ways.  They can use any or all or two of these ways, <Col N="1792" /> according to the Bill.  They can do it by written examination or by oral examination or by interview&mdash;whatever that might be.  There is a fourth method which gives a blanket cover to CIE, &ldquo;by any other test or tests that the Board consider to be appropriate&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>All sorts of tests would fit into that.  I am not referring to the present Minister personally or to the present Government or to whoever might be in office or whoever the chairman of CIE might be in years to come but surely it is blatantly open to abuse of all sorts, that the clerical staff of CIE may be recruited under this Bill by any test the Board consider appropriate.  I do not think the present Minister would do it but it is conceivable there would be a villain of a Minister, or a chairman of CIE who would not have the standards of the present chairman, or some head-case of a manager or some political appointee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a moment.  Since 1924 this House has wisely insisted that the clerical staff of the transport undertaking of the country should be recruited by open competitive written examination and CIE have never complained to us about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps CIE have a crib in that regard, that we oblige them to hold a separate examination and that may be cumbersome and expensive as well.  If they want to get away from that I could understand it and if they said: &ldquo;We do not want to hold a separate examination for CIE clerks but to do as the ESB does&mdash;recruit our clerks on the basis of the results of the Leaving Certificate examination&rdquo;, I would not see anything wrong <Col N="1793" /> in that, if CIE feel the present system is cumbersome and said they would recruit from the Leaving Certificate examination but I certainly do not go along with the suggestion that they can recruit by written examination, oral examination or interview or any other test or tests that the Board consider to be appropriate.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will see the wisdom of taking out that stupid ridiculous section which is open to blatant and violent abuse, skulduggery, patronage and political favouritism of all sorts.  CIE, as I have said, have never appeared to have a grievance as far as the trade unions know.  We got no indication that they wanted to do anything new in that regard.</P>
      <P>Finally, I am sorry there is not some provision in the Bill for the pensioners in the conciliation grades.  The Minister has heard me often enough before, and other Deputies on both sides of the House, decrying the very low level of pensions of many people in various grades of CIE who are now retired, people who gave very long and faithful service to the transport industry and who are now on pensions as low as 6/-, 8/-, 12/-, 20/-, 25/-, and 30/- a week.  I had hoped that the Minister would have taken his courage in his hands when introducing the Transport Bill&mdash;there may not be another one for many years&mdash;and would have written in a section which would oblige CIE to pay reasonably decent pensions to these people who are now retired for some years and who gave long, faithful service.  There are not many of them left now.  It would have been a gesture of goodwill, involving very little expense, to pay these unfortunate people higher rates. Many of these people are living on the breadline, on starvation diet, after 40, 42 or 43 years' service with CIE, the Great Southern Railways, the Great Southern and Western Railway and their predecessors.  Perhaps between now and the remaining Stages of the Bill, the Minister would review the matter.  I can assure him that the people concerned would be very grateful if he would give further consideration to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister lived <Col N="1794" /> up to his usual form when moving the Second Reading of this Bill when he left five members of the Fine Gael Party who were on these benches with only one copy of his speech.  It was the form we have been used to in the past few years of consistent insolence and discourtesy to members of the House.  I welcome this Bill for one thing, that it gives us an opportunity of asking the Minister questions in the House and I intend to ask him some questions and will insist on his answering them.</P>
      <P>I have a whole library of letters from you, Sir, in regard to questions that were disallowed, informing me when I put down questions relative to CIE that it was not the Minister's function, that it was a matter of day to day administration.  The last question that I had proposed to ask the Minister was inspired by the fact that I had been informed that a large number of luxury buses had been purchased by CIE&mdash;Leyland Leopard&mdash;it does not matter what the names are.  I had been informed that these buses were 36 feet long.  The question was disallowed. I could not ascertain whether or not we had buses of that length.  I put down a Parliamentary Question to the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Local Government, asking him what was the legal maximum length and width of mechanically-propelled public service vehicles and the Minister told me that it was 36 feet.  In a supplementary question, I asked if the Minister could tell me how long this order in regard to 36 feet had been law and the Minister replied that this would have been indicated in the Road Traffic Act regulations, that is, the Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles Regulations of 1963 and that they became effective, so far as the Minister could remember, in October or November last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have one Minister who wants safety on the roads and another Minister who gets permission to put a bigger monster on the road&mdash;bigger and better, like the Barnum and Bailey Circus.  I had hoped that somebody would tell me if such buses would be allowed to cross the Border into Northern Ireland or if they would <Col N="1795" /> be too long under the regulations prescribed there, or if the Ulster Transport Authority would be allowed to use that type of bus.</P>
    <P>The Department of Transport and Power woke up and some time afterwards I got a letter from the Minister's Secretary saying that he was desired by Mr. Erskine Childers, T.D., Minister for Transport and Power, to refer to the recent question put down by me, which was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle, on the question of the number and description of the luxury road coaches recently purchased by CIE and that the Minister had asked him to send me the attached copy of a Press release dated 5th November, 1962, about the new Worldmaster coaches being introduced by CIE for their motor coach tours.</P>
    <P>The Minister had appealed to you, Sir, and had told you that this was a matter of day to day administration. You sent me a letter on 14th April saying that you regretted you had to disallow the question addressed by me to the Minister for Transport and Power regarding luxury road coaches recently purchased by CIE on the ground that the Minister had no function or responsibility in the matter.</P>
    <P>This little day to day business was merely the purchase of about 40 buses. God knows what they cost&mdash;perhaps £300,000 or £400,000.  Of course, the Minister probably had come around to thinking about £400,000 as a mere bagatelle having regard to the fact that he considers £75,000 only &ldquo;small beer&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When Deputies from all the Opposition Parties pleaded with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Lemass, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, now the Taoiseach, and pointed out to him that what they were about to do in the destruction of railways was not good policy, the 1958 Act was brought in by the Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, and in the course of the Second Reading debate, he implied that we were a little too meticulous about the Bill.  I was a little suspicious of him but he disarmed me and he disarmed the whole <Col N="1796" /> House.  I will quote from the famous volume of the Official Report&mdash;No. 167&mdash;which the Minister has quoted at such length in his speech.  He did not quote this little bit:</P>
    <P>In cases of decisions to close down a branch railway line, the Bill says two months' notice must be given.  I do not think we need write in there that during these two months the board will have to hear the deputation from the local council of the town losing the railway service or meet the representations of the trade unions who may have a point of view.  Of course, they will do it.  Indeed, the whole purpose of the requirement to give two months' notice was to provide a statutory period during which these inevitable representations could be entertained.  It is far better to let our knowledge of what will happen guide our judgment in this matter than to be seeking to write into the Bill a rigid statutory safeguard.</P>
    <P>I lost a lot of confidence in this House because I believed that and the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister's predecessor, just ran out on that.  It makes me very careful when I hear Fianna Fáil Ministers saying: &ldquo;Let that section go through.  That is quite all right.  I will not apply the letter of the law.  You need not put such and such a clause in.  That will be looked after&rdquo;.  It shows that we must approach this Bill with great care and must see to it that every comma in it is examined.</P>
    <P>My Party intend to put down amendments to this Bill and there will be questions regarding it.  We are forced to do this because of the Minister's conduct.  As I pointed out, the Minister refused to answer a question by me in regard to the purchase of these luxury buses for CIE.  The following week he answered a question&mdash;I challenged him on it&mdash;in regard to the purchase of airplanes for Aer Lingus. I can only take one thing from that&mdash; deliberate insolence and discourtesy by the Minister to a member of this House.  It is very important that the people should be able to approach their elected representatives to have <Col N="1797" /> them ask questions about what is being done with public money.  It is a defeat of our whole democratic process when we have insolent and discourteous Ministers refusing to answer these questions.</P>
    <P>The questions I have put to the Minister are not matters of ordinary day to day administration.  Over the past three or four years, I have asked him questions concerning the profit and loss account of the bus service between Waterford and Tramore.  The Minister replied that it was impossible to go into details and pick out the Tramore line.  I brought him in here on the adjournment and I bombarded him with more questions.  I asked him was this line a paying proposition, but he was unable to find that out.  Yet I heard him say in the House a few minutes ago that:</P>
    <P>234 provincial road passenger services are operated by the Board and of these almost two-thirds earn an annual revenue of less than £5,000 each per annum and account for only 15 per cent of the total revenue in this section.  91 per cent of all the provincial road passenger services earn only 57 per cent of the total revenue.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister not tell me that? How long is the House to put up with that kind of carry-on?  I want to see the railways continued.  I want to see CIE continued.  If it were possible for me to block this money going through and insist that the Minister be responsible for every £ whenever we ask him about it, I would do so.  I would ask Deputies not to vote for it.</P>
    <P>We have another famous <i>pronunciamento</i> in the Minister's speech.  This is the effect of the Pacemaker study. God knows how much it cost and if anybody will ever read it, even in the office of CIE.</P>
    <P>The Government had also to consider the value of the railway system to the country.  It represents a vast national investment and offers advantages many of which could not be provided by road transport.</P>
    <P>From all the benches on this side of the House, that was thundered at the <Col N="1798" /> Minister, but he would not listen to it. Now the Minister has to eat his own vomit and say that he and the Government were wrong.</P>

      <P>I am quoting the Minister's speech:</P>
      <P>The Government have decided, therefore, after very full and careful consideration, to preserve the railway system subject to such further concentration and reorganisation as may prove practicable and desirable and to provide a fixed annual subsidy with the aid of which the Board should be expected to break even.</P>
      <P>The Minister was not saying that when he came in to dig up one of the smallest railways in Ireland.  The Minister also referred to the railways that lost money.  He said there was no use maintaining railways that were carrying only a handful of passengers.  I agree with him.  When we came in and pointed out to him that for his trial break-up, he was going to break up a railway carrying an enormous number of people&mdash;the Waterford-Tramore line&mdash;sentence of death was passed on that railway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We tried to persuade him to stay his hand.  Representations were made to Kingsbridge, but Dr. Andrews refused to meet us.  In the early part of the campaign to wreck the Tramore railway, the Minister's officials at Kingsbridge said it was losing £3,000 a year and then they said it was losing £9,000 a year.  The word of the Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, was ratted on by these officials when the local authorities in Tramore asked for the figure of the number of people carried in the last years of its existence.  The Taoiseach said there would be full consultation.  There was no consultation at all because we could get no figures and no co-operation from the officials at Kingsbridge.  The <Col N="1799" /> Minister had his mind made up.  He admitted he took full responsibility for everything these men did.</P>
    <P>Then, when the damage was done, we discovered that the total fare paying passengers carried in the year ending 31st December, 1959, the last year of that railway's existence, numbered 551,900.  This was no ghost railway. This was a railway with full trains. This was a railway consistently butchered by the Minister's efficiency boys up in Kingsbridge.  They used to make fun of this railway, with its old-fashioned engines and old-fashioned carriages.  These old-fashioned engines and carriages could carry 2,000 people to Tramore in 20 minutes.  Then the pseudo-supermen came along and, just after the war, they said: &ldquo;We will do a right job on this railway.  We will dieselise it.&rdquo;  They were going to put new diesel engines on this seven mile railway.  The Minister told us diesel suited the long haul.  They dieselised. And that is another thing about which we will never know the cost.  We had two diesel engines and lovely steel coaches and they were able to go to Tramore in five minutes under the time taken by the old train.  They needed only an engine driver.  There was no fireman.  That was some saving.  But there was one snag.  The old system took 2,000 people out in 20 minutes and this wonderful new system took out 600 in 15 minutes.</P>

      <P>I will find it in the Minister's brief and I will show I can be in order on this.  The Minister had, of course, experts who went over the costings.  I have it here now at page 10.  I think the Minister has forgotten what he read only a couple of hours ago:</P>
      <P>While the closure of branch lines does not generally mean loss of traffic, the closure of certain unprofitable secondary lines could, depending on the extent to which they act as feeders to the main system, have a serious effect on the remainder of the system.  The discontinuance of services on all of this 750 miles would in fact reduce the railway to an unworkable unit.</P>
      <P>I think I am entitled to talk about this.  We all know, of course, what the £75,000 is now.  We are talking about £2 million here and we want to make sure, before this Bill passes, what will happen to this £2 million and how efficiently it will be used. I am trying to tell the House how inefficiently the Minister's Department has worked.  Here is where the experts come in.</P>

      <P>These wonderful experts did their job, according to the Minister.  When we went to the experts, however, we could not be told anything about the line.  They held out on us like the Minister holds out on us here when we ask questions.  In the debate on this railway line, the Minister assured the House that it was the intention of CIE to replace this service with an equally adequate service.  Let me repeat that: he gave a guarantee, an undertaking, or whatever you like to call it, that, when this railway line was closed, he would replace it with a service that would be equal and adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a letter here from the Tramore Town Commissioners.  When the Minister wrecked the railway, there were two public conveniences in the <Col N="1802" /> station.  The station now belongs to the Tramore Town Commissioners. They bought it.  The Minister's experts smashed up the two public conveniences in the station.  The Minister promised that the bus service would be equally as good as the rail service. A bus terminal was put up in Tramore alongside where the station used to be. The Tramore Town Commissioners have been in correspondence with the Area Manager of CIE.  I have a letter here:</P>
    <P Just="Right">9th March, 1964.</P>
    <P>Area Manager,</P>
    <P>CIE,</P>
    <P>Waterford.</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>At the last meeting of the Tramore Town Commissioners I was directed to bring your attention to the necessity for sanitary accommodation at the Bus Depot at Tramore.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P Just="Right">T. F. Casey,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Town Clerk.</P>
    <P>This is the reply from the office of the Area Manager, dated 20th March.  He must have sent up his letter by runner to CIE for instructions.  The railways must not have been working.</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>I have received your letter of 9th inst.  regarding the necessity for toilet accommodation at Tramore.</P>
    <P>I agree that toilet accommodation in the vicinity of the Bus Depot at Tramore would be an added amenity and to assist the Commissioners in this matter my Company would be prepared to offer a suitable site for the erection by the Commissioners of such accommodation.</P>
    <P>No doubt you will let me know in course if the Commissioners wish to take up this offer.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of carry-on to which people are treated by CIE.  The Minister promised he would give a service equally as good as the service that was there.  Now the Minister's official tells the Clerk of the Tramore Town Commissioners to erect the convenience <Col N="1803" /> themselves, and put it down to the ratepayers.  When we tried to dissuade the Minister from tearing up the railway line, we were told that there would be a kind of hidden taxation in the form of a railway road grant.  I pointed out that an enormous sum of money would have to be spent to allow a bus to go out there, and that bridges would have to be taken down, but we were told that everything would be all right.  I put down a question to the Minister for Local Government today asking the amount of railway road grants allotted to (a) Waterford County Borough and (b) to Waterford County Council in each year for the past three years.  He replied&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is not irrelevant. I want to talk now about the forgotten men, the old pensioners of CIE, the men who made the railways run, worked long hours, and brought the trains in in time.  I see many of the diesel monsters coming into the chill of Waterford station, ten, 15, or 20 minutes late.  It would be a matter to send away to Ripley if the trains came in late when they were run by those fine old servants of the company, whom the Minister has thrown out with pensions of 12/- a week.  The Minister deliberately avoided the storm of protests raised in the House about his commission on CIE pensions.  Those forgotten men deserve better from him and from this country.  When he is looking at their case, he should think in terms of &ldquo;small beer&rdquo; or perhaps the price of a few small whiskeys would put them on their feet.  There are not many of them.  I think there are only 1,049.  The Minister is very unfortunate in his public relations.  His public relations and the manner in which he treats this House can be described as putrid.</P>
      <P>Section 14 of the Bill says:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in section 89 of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Act, 1898, the Board, in exercise of its powers under that section, may nominate at any time, if it so thinks fit, persons who are not members of the Board as directors of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must make inquiries about that.  I am interested in this Fishguard-Rosslare route.  We can see what the Minister is doing now.  He intends <Col N="1806" /> bringing all the traffic through Dublin. God knows, it is bad enough with the existing congestion and even though the Minister may put up a new pier, you will have more people coming in. The trains will not be able to take them up to Holyhead; they will be standing in the trains from London. Then they will be thrown out on Dún Laoghaire Pier.  This is the usual type of idiocy in which we indulge here. The Minister may find that the situation will be as it is in Dublin where you cannot park a car or pass along the street.  There is another entrance port&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We will have to write to Ripley.  Believe it or not, the Minister for Transport and Power answered a question; he did not say it was the day-to-day routine.  The Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Act, 1898, guaranteed a passenger and goods service through Waterford for six days of the week. That was given away by the Government in 1933 and the then Minister's <Col N="1807" /> predecessor ran away from the Waterford Harbour Commissioner and gave him no support when British Railways decided to take the passenger service away.  The Government could have stood on that and could have made them stick to their agreement.  They had guaranteed it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not.  On page 7, the Minister says:</P>
      <P>At repeated intervals I pressed the Board of CIE to improve their publicity and advertising, both in order to get more business and make known to the public the tremendous campaign of reorganisation and the closer liaison with the public effected through sales market research staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not a word about public relations. Not a word about goodwill.  The people had an enormous amount of goodwill for CIE and the railways. The Minister has shot a lot of holes into that goodwill but there is still an <Col N="1808" /> enormous amount of it left.  It was sincerely felt by the people and despite the blackguarding they have got from the Minister's officials in CIE, and the Minister himself, that goodwill is still there and what remains should be nurtured.</P>
    <P>I have said here on several occasions that it is important that CIE should exist and that the railway lines should stay because if a group of Japanese, or Czechoslovakians or Germans&mdash; they would be the favoured people&mdash; came and said that they had a scheme which would employ 20,000 people who would be spread all over the country but that they would need a subsidy of £2 million a year, we would be delighted and we would go into the Lobbies and give it to them.  Of course we might have questions to ask about the money and what was to be done with it, but if they kept these men going, we would be satisfied.  However, if they started to take down parts of their factory or started to dismantle their plant and have strange ships ship it away we might become cagey.</P>
    <P>The Minister also says:</P>
    <P>We have no railway journey in this country which could be described as long by any international standards.  Further handicaps are the absence of large homogeneous traffics such as coal or ore, which are particularly suited to railways, and of long distance transit traffic which is a feature of much continental railway operation.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that a great number of monsters could be put off the roads so as to make the roads safer for people.  As regards much of the traffic that comes from the ports to the factories&mdash;and most of the ports I salesmen would only approach the people who have railway sidings in their factories&mdash;and most of the ports I know have railway sidings in them, too&mdash;the cargo could be put into the wagon and sent right on to the factory's siding.  There must have been much neglect of this or else CIE have out-priced themselves in this regard.</P>
    <P>As far as the monsters are concerned, it is no use talking about safety on the roads when CIE are putting <Col N="1809" /> bigger and longer monsters on the road every day.  On my way up yesterday, when I came to the part of the road where one can see for maybe a mile and a half ahead, there was nearly threequarters of a mile of vehicles in front of me.  We could not overtake because traffic was coming against us. We had to wait until we got as far as the autobahn at Kill to get through.</P>
    <P>Then I discovered there was a CIE monster on the road with a trailer and an immense piece of plant with a girder hanging over the side and a red rag on it.  That should not be sent on the road in any circumstances.  It should be put on to the railway line.</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced a new phrase.  He will go down in history as the man who introduced &ldquo;small beer&rdquo; as £75,000.  On page 21, paragraph 41 he says:</P>
    <P>No doubt there will be changes in future, the rail and road services will be tailored by need&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is a lovely word to apply to a railway line, to tailor it.</P>

I have often heard about the enormous overcrowding at Dún Laoghaire, with people standing up at night on the train and boat.  Here are wonderful steamers at Rosslare giving a fine service.  There is no need to look for sailing tickets.  A person can get on the train at Paddington and travel to Rosslare through Fishguard. When he gets to Rosslare, he is not suffocated trying to get through the customs with a thousand and one people trampling on him as at Dún Laoghaire.</P>

I want to hear him reply to these questions: Is he making a profit from the bus services between Waterford and Tramore, or is he making a loss?  How many passengers are being carried on it?  It has taken three years to find that out and it is only on an occasion like this that we have an opportunity of asking the Minister for this information.</P>
      <P>I am also asking him if he intends to stand on his own word or will he run out on it as regards the service between Waterford and Tramore? Will he make it as good a service as it was when the railway was there? Will he make any attempt to restore the public conveniences that were at the bus stop?  Will he make it his business to see that it will not be the ratepayers who will have to pay for this but CIE, who wrecked it?  Will he make it his business also to make up his mind that when Deputies from any part of the House ask him a Parliamentary Question as far as the running of CIE, or Bord na Móna, or Aer Lingus are concerned that he will answer these questions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is peculiar that members on the Government benches are not interested in this measure, or so it seems, as none of them has spoken on it.  As far as I am concerned, CIE have withdrawn the greater part of their services from west Cork in the past few years but it is still incumbent on me to speak on this measure because it asks us to provide £2 million annually from public funds over the next five years.  As well as that, we are wiping out another million pounds so it is going to cost the public funds £11 million in the next five years.  It is also true to assert that we may be called upon for further additional sums as were sought under the 1958 Bill.</P>
      <P>Although the railway services have been withdrawn from west Cork, we must still pay our portion of this £11 million to keep the service going in the remainder of the country.  The most striking passage I have seen in the Minister's speech is where the Minister says:</P>
      <P>The experience over the five years has demonstrated that the hopes of breaking even are unrealisable.  The prospects have, however, been examined in a detailed scientific way in an exhaustive study made by CIE.</P>
      <P>That is what the Minister for Transport and Power had to say on the 20th May, 1964, that the experience of the past five years has demonstrated that the hopes of breaking even are unrealisable.  Who thought they were going to be realisable, other than the Minister?  Everybody knew that they were not going to be realisable and that there was no justification for the assertions made during the debate on the closing of the west Cork line that CIE would break even in 1964.  The statements which the Minister made to that effect were without justification and, in my opinion, he was aware that they were untruthful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several quotations from the debates of 1958 and 1961 which indicate that the Minister believed in that doctrine in those years.  I am not one of those given to bringing documentary evidence to this House. Seldom do I arm myself with volumes <Col N="1815" /> of Dáil Debates or give quotations from statements made here years and years ago but I believe there must be a departure from that as far as this particular measure is concerned.  What have CIE achieved during the past six years, since the Transport Bill, 1958 was brought into this House, and since they got a free, unfettered hand to provide cheap, efficient transport in this country?  Let us see what they have done and how they have justified the confidence of the majority of the members of this House who gave them that unfettered power.  Let us look at what they have achieved.</P>
    <P>First and foremost, they closed 621 miles of railway since they got this power in 1958.  They closed 621 miles of railway and the Minister stands over that closure because he said it was a good thing for the country that such railway lines should be closed.  As well as that, he told the House that it was for the betterment of the country that the railway lines which were closed should be closed, and that railways were no longer necessary in present day conditions.</P>
    <P>Six hundred and twenty-one miles of railway represent a significant percentage of the total mileage of railway in this country.  The total mileage of railway is given as 2,081; so that, of that figure which existed in 1958, the Minister and CIE have succeeded in closing, to the present time, 621 miles. Have CIE done anything else since they got this power in 1958?  Have they done anything else of importance so far as the public are concerned? Indeed, they have.  They took from us £22 million of our money&mdash; £22 million has been poured into the finances of CIE since the Transport Bill was passed in 1958.  What has the Minister to say about this?</P>
    <P>When the present Taoiseach was introducing the Transport Bill, or the Berehaven Bill, which might be a better name for it, in 1958, along with guaranteeing CIE a subsidy of £1 million to help them to break even by 1963, the subsidy was further increased by £125,000 to £1,125,000.  He wrote off liabilities amounting to £16.6 million, so that since the Transport Act <Col N="1816" /> was introduced here in 1958 CIE have cost the taxpayers of this country £22 million.  We are asked here tonight to provide another £11 million.  Surely the time is at hand when we must take note of the day to day activities of CIE.  We must accept that the Minister has floundered badly so far as CIE are concerned, so far as public pronouncements in regard to CIE are concerned and, particularly, in so far as the infallibility which the CIE Board are supposed to have is concerned.  We were told they were men of great confidence and that if they got this unfettered power and were given five years everything would be all right so far as public transport was concerned.</P>
    <P>They got their money in 1958 without being answerable to this House for it.  It is my opinion, and I assert it as forcibly as I can, that they should not get the money in 1964 without answering to this House for it.  I shall not vote for money for CIE and have the Minister for Transport and Power come in here and say when he is asked a question: &ldquo;I shall not reply; this is entirely a matter for CIE and it is not relevant for me to answer such a question in the House or give the information.&rdquo;  It has been a matter for the Irish people to find £22 million in the past five years for CIE and it will be a further matter for them to find £11 million in the next five years.  I believe the least return that could be got for that money is that the Minister should explain how the £11 million will be expended.  CIE are not a private company utilising their own funds and every penny of public money should be accounted for in this House.  If we give the Minister the £11 million in the next five years I think we should have a section written into this Bill making it obligatory on the Minister to answer questions which Deputies put to him from time to time as the occasion demands.</P>
    <P>This business of semi-State bodies, and particularly the CIE Board, getting money out of the taxpayers' pockets and not being answerable to the elected representatives of the people must cease.  I cannot emphasise that strongly enough.  I firmly believe that the people <Col N="1817" /> who pay the money should be given an explanation as to how it is expended.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer but reference to which I cannot find at the moment. The Minister asks for the co-operation of the CIE Board, the staff and the public.  The public are asked to make a great united effort to help CIE&mdash; the public should all work together.  We know from past experience how the CIE Board treated the public, not only how they treated the public at large but how they treated the elected representatives of the public and representatives of this House who sought information from them.  We know, too, when the question arose of closing the lines, how CIE refused to receive deputations to discuss the closures.  We know the public relations system of CIE which I think is the worst one could find.</P>
    <P>Every business that is likely to succeed must have good public relations. If a private company were to have the same type of public relations as CIE have at the present time I have no doubt they would become bankrupt within a short period, but here is the difference between CIE and a private company.  It does not matter if a private company have bad public relations. If they lose money they go out of business but that does not apply to CIE.  If they lose money, all they have to do is go to the Minister for Transport and Power, say: &ldquo;I want more money&rdquo;, and have a Bill introduced in the Dáil.  That is the type of measure we have here tonight.</P>
    <P>One cannot speak strongly enough about the public relations system of this State-sponsored body.  There is no need for me to reiterate what happened about the closure of the railway lines in 1961; there is no need for me to emphasise again that the Board treated with the utmost contempt representations made to them to meet a deputation for a discussion on such matters.  The Minister is smiling and I shall digress a little because the Minister is consistent in his inconsistency as far as the Board of CIE are concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1818" /> Was not the Minister, up to a short time ago, a firm believer in closing railway lines because, he said, the country was a relatively small one in which the longest line is only 160 miles?  Was he not a firm believer in the philosophy that we could easily do without a railway system because it was such a costly amenity?  Did he not, during the debate on the closure of the railway lines in 1961, emphasise this again and again?  Having had the Minister emphasise the desirability of closing uneconomic railway lines, I am surprised to find in his statement today &mdash;it is a pity the Minister will not take time off to compare it with his statements in 1961&mdash;this passage:</P>
    <P>The closing of secondary lines and branch lines which make any significant contribution to the main line system would further reduce the profitability of the profitable sector and, therefore, a substantial further reduction of the system could well increase the total loss.</P>
    <P>Is it only now the Minister has found that out?  How often was it told to him during the 1961 debate?  Now it has dawned on him that when you close branch lines it affects the profitability of the main ones.</P>
    <P>In his speech today.  the Minister goes on to emphasise quite clearly that he does not propose to close down any further lines.  We must assume that the Minister is satisfied it was not good policy to close some of the lines already closed.  According to his statement, the west Cork line was closed because it was supposed to lose £59,000 annually, a figure never substantiated. How small is that, by comparison with the £2 million annually we now propose to contribute to keep the railways alive in other parts of the country.</P>

When the west Cork and the Tramore railways were closed down we were told there would be no further closures &mdash;that once they were wiped off the railway map CIE would be a paying proposition.  What a difference that <Col N="1819" /> was from statements we have now had. In 1961 we were told that no further lines would be closed, but within a year other railways were closed.  I feel sure it is quite possible that despite the Minister's statement today other lines may be closed as soon as the Minister's mind changes again.</P>

      <P>We have had even stronger statements on public transport from the Taoiseach.  In fact, I believe I have been wasting time on what the Minister has said: it was to quote some of the things the Taoiseach had to say on this subject that I brought this book in with me.  If the Taoiseach and the Minister were consistent, the Transport Bill we should have here tonight would be to abolish the railway system of this country completely.  That is the only logical interpretation of the many statements the Minister has made.  In his public utterances he has anticipated that within the next five years the railways will lose up to £6 million.  Now, let us see what the Taoiseach has to say about the railways.  I am afraid, Sir, you will have to bear with me for some time because the Taoiseach made several empty statements about the railways which I should like to quote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach was first speaking about west Cork.  In volume 186, column 599 of the Official Report for 16th February, 1961, the Taoiseach is reported as saying:</P>
      <P>Let me deal with this, as I regard it, important question as to whether the closing of the west Cork branch line is prejudicial to the economic development of the area; whether it is true, as Deputy Murphy suggested, that the railway is essential to the economic prospects of the area; or whether its economic development depends in the slightest degree on the preservation of the railway.  Since the CIE Board announced their intention to close the west Cork railway there have been three announcements of intention to establish important new industries in the west Cork area and, at the moment, there are proposals for four additional important industries in that area.</P>
      <P>He goes on to elaborate on that story, as if it needed elaboration:</P>
      <P>To my knowledge, it is true that in the past efforts to induce industrialists into that area were hampered because of an impression which industrialists had that, if they established industries in the area, they would be pressurised by the Government to use a form of transport there unsuitable to their business. The industrial development that is now taking place in west Cork is unprecedented in the history of that area.</P>
      <P>Then the Taoiseach asked:</P>
      <P>Is that not true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, is it not true that the Taoiseach believed in February, 1961, that it was a good thing for west Cork to have the railways closed down? Surely, on 20th May, 1964, if he were consistent, the Taoiseach would believe <Col N="1821" /> it would be a good thing for the country if every railway in it were closed down.  The railways are not paying, the Minister says, and he asks the people who were serviced by the nonpaying west Cork railway, now closed down, to help subsidise the other nonpaying railways for a few more years.</P>
    <P>However, we must dwell a little longer on the statement of the Taoiseach. He envisages in that statement, in no uncertain manner, a situation where, if you want industrial development in an area, you must immediately shut down the railways there.  Is not that clear from his statement?  He told us about the industries that commenced to flow into west Cork as soon as the industrialists concerned were satisfied the railway line was to close down.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the economic development of the area depends on the existence of the railway.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach continued:</P>
    <P>I have clearly shown that manufacturing industries have only begun to flow into that area since it was announced that the railway line would be closed.  The announcement of the closing of the railway was followed by a number of new proposals for industry in that area.</P>
    <P>In February, 1961, the Taoiseach was quite satisfied that the closing of the West Cork railway helped industry to flow in there.  He was not in such a good mood on the same day.  He did not like people to annoy him about the value of railways or about the subsidisation of railways.  The main theme of the earlier part of his speech was that it was a bad thing to subsidise railways.</P>
    <P>As reported at column 595 of the Official Report of 16th February, 1961, he said:</P>
    <P>I think I am entitled to assume from the terms of the trivial amendment moved by the Fine Gael Party, and the speech delivered in support of it by Deputy McGilligan, that, in fact, the Fine Gael Party, the principal Opposition Party in the House, have no serious complaint to make about transport policy as it is now being administered and have, <Col N="1822" /> indeed, no objection to the closing of branch lines so long as local politicians are given adequate opportunity of blowing off steam on deputations to the CIE Board.</P>
    <P>But the Taoiseach blew off a lot of steam in February, 1961.  As time goes on, we shall examine in retrospect what has happened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The steam is of a very different colour.  The Deputy really is misinterpreting the Taoiseach and I think the House realises it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said, as reported at Column 602:</P>
      <P>Looking on the whole picture, I think I can say without fear of contradiction by anybody who wants to base his statements on fact&mdash;</P>
      <P>The implication was that others were not basing their statement on fact&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that the economic prospects of West Cork are brighter now than ever they were in its history.  They are certainly far brighter now than they were before the decision to close the railway line was taken.</P>
      <P>He made several other lengthy references to West Cork and to what would accrue to the area once these railways were finished and dealt with. What has happened since?  Would Deputy Childers, as Minister for Transport and Power, like to know how the Taoiseach's prophecies are being realised, viewed today, 3½ years after they were made?</P>
