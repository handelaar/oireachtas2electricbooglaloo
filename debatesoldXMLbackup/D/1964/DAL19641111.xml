      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he has received a request from the local authority that he sanction the giving over of Roscrea Sanatorium, County Tipperary, which has been closed for tuberculosis cases, for adaptation for the treatment of mentally handicapped children; and, if so, at what date he received such request for sanction; and at what date he expects to sanction the proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I received a recommendation from Tipperary (NR) County Council dated 3rd June, 1964, that I should investigate the possibility of using the former Roscrea Sanatorium as a regional hospital for mentally handicapped children.  I was also informed by the local authority that they were considering a request from a local association that the buildings be handed over to the association for use as a school for mentally handicapped children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I informed the health authority on 31st July, 1964, that, in view of the continuing pressure for institutional accommodation for severe cases of mental handicap, I would be prepared to consider the use of the institution as a temporary measure to relieve hardship in such cases where it had not been possible to place severely handicapped children in one of the special institutions for such purposes.  It was <Col N="634" /> envisaged that the centre at Roscrea, if established, would not be a fully equipped mental handicap centre, at least not for the present, and that whatever arrangements are decided on now would be of a provisional nature and would be subject to review when the Commission of Inquiry on Mental Handicap will have made known its findings.  Because of this I considered that it would be preferable that the county council should operate this service.</P>
    <P>The county council did not agree with this suggestion and on 23rd September, 1964, submitted a proposal for the leasing of the institution to the local association at a nominal annual rent, on conditions to be worked out later, for use as a school for mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>Unlike their previous suggestion, the latest proposal of the county council would not relieve the position in the area with respect to severely mentally handicapped children, who represent a serious problem, and I have found it necessary, in considering the council's latest proposal, to examine the possibility of providing otherwise for this category of patient.  I hope it will be possible to complete this examination within the next few weeks, and I shall convey a decision to the council as soon as possible afterwards.</P>

May I put it to the Minister that the House and the country are entitled to know whether it is good business for Shipping Finance Corporation Limited, a subsidiary of the Industrial Credit Company, to lend money to a Dutch firm and to the Liberian Government? That money has been lent to the Liberian Government by a subterfuge and the Minister should disclose the whole facts to the House and the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The projection in question is one of a number at present being made by the Department of Finance in consultation with other Government Departments.  These projections, which cover all industries, are being prepared in accordance with the recommendation&mdash;accepted by the Government&mdash;of the National Industrial Economic Council that an annual review should be made of progress under the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  When the projections have been discussed with representatives of management and trade unions in each industry, a report incorporating the results will be furnished to the Council which, it is expected, will report to the Government early next year on what reorientation, if any, of policies it considers desirable to achieve the aims of the Second Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that as <Col N="638" /> these projections are subject to amendment in the light of the discussions I have mentioned, it would be undesirable to publish them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <P>The Kilmore, Ballincur and Kilboy areas were not included in the Kilmastulla drainage district which was constituted following a petition from local landowners under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925.  The drainage of these areas could now be undertaken by the Office of Public Works only as part of a comprehensive drainage scheme for the Kilmastulla catchment under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The catchment is noted for treatment in the drainage programme <Col N="639" /> but owing to present commitments and the extent of the drainage problem generally it is not possible at present to say when it will be reached.</P>

The present Act (the Companies Act, 1963) came into operation only on 1st April this year and it would be too soon yet to start thinking of general amending legislation. As I indicated in my speech on 27th October, I have received no complaints of substance about the conduct of take-over bids in this country.  If this situation should change, however, I would take steps to introduce any legislation that might be necessary in the public interest.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether British driving licences are recognised in this country as qualifying drivers to drive the various classes of private and passenger transport vehicles nominated in the licences concerned; and, if not, if he will ensure that in future such licences are recognised, in view of the fact that British licence holders have had to qualify by driving tests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with international usage, the recognition here of foreign domestic driving licences applies only in the case of visitors to this country and does not extend to persons ordinarily resident here.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to make any change at this stage whereby a driving licence granted to a person in another country would, in the event of his taking up residence here, exempt him from complying with the provisions applicable to the grant and holding of driving licences.  Any such change could only be contemplated in the light of international agreement for the reciprocal recognition of national driving licences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that many holders of driving licences have returned home, have not passed the driving test here and are now forced to supply the vehicle on testing, would the Minister consider accepting the British driving test particularly in regard to heavy vehicles?  These drivers have to supply their vehicles and one cannot at a moment's notice produce a ten-ton or a 15-ton lorry in order to pass a driving test.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the reply, I do not intend to make any change. In regard to people returning from England who hold British driving licences subsequent to having passed the test there, I should say that Britain does not accept licences held by people leaving this country to take up residence in Britain without doing the British test when they get there.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that the total estimated requirements of sugar for domestic consumption are 120,000 tons per annum or the product of 60,000 acres of sugar beet; that the total acreage of beet grown and delivered to the sugar factories last year was 88,000 giving approximately 176,000 tons of sugar or 56,000 tons over domestic requirements; and that the cost of this refined sugar ex-factory was approximately £58 per ton; and if he can now state the reasons for the importation from January to July this year of 37,989 tons of unrefined sugar costing £2,626,710 or approximately £69 per ton and 1,573 tons of refined sugar costing £115,706 or £73.11 per ton, as the cost of imported refined sugar is £15.11 per ton over the cost of refined sugar from Irish factories and as this transaction alone represents an extra expenditure of £400,000 over the cost of the same quantity produced at home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The total annual requirements of sugar for domestic consumption and for the export trade in sugar and sugar-containing goods are approximately 170,000 tons.  This figure may, however, vary somewhat from year to year mainly because of fluctuations in the volume of exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Production of refined sugar from the 1963 beet area of 88,000 acres amounted to 131,000 tons and the imports of sugar referred to by the Deputy were necessary in order to <Col N="650" /> meet the difference between this domestic production and total requirements.</P>
    <P>With regard to prices, the world price of sugar was abnormally high during much of the past two years and this situation is reflected in the relatively high cost of sugar imported in the period January-July, 1964.  On the other hand, sugar exported as such or in goods fetched a correspondingly high price.</P>
    <P>The world price of sugar has now fallen to about one-third of what it was a year ago and sugar could now be imported here at significantly less than the cost of home-produced beet sugar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that following the figure given to me here in 1963 there was a further import of 42,000 tons of sugar, that the total exports from this country, as given by him last week, were 51,000 tons, covering sugar and goods containing sugar, and that shows some 40,000 tons last year over what was exported and our domestic requirements? For the first six months of this year already, something like 40,000 tons have been imported.  I wonder for what purpose the stock is being built up?  Is it in prospect of a war?</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to this application, and to a similar joint works application relating to another stream in the same area, was set out in my Department's letter of 23rd October to the Deputy.  The case referred to in the Deputy's question, which was the subject of an application under the Land Project in 1958, proved to be a complicated one both <Col N="653" /> technically and legally, as did the other similar case I have mentioned.  Protracted investigations of the engineering and other aspects were necessary, and it was not, in fact, until within the past year that the investigations indicated that a workable scheme might be possible, subject to the position in regard to third parties presenting no insurmountable difficulties.  At this stage, it was ascertained that some riparian owners had not signed the application form, which was, accordingly, returned to the representative of the applicants on 10th April, 1964, with a request that he should obtain the required signatures.</P>
      <P>For one reason or another, this case has unavoidably dragged on for a very long time, and every effort will be made to bring it to finality as soon as the consent of all the riparian owners is received.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 to 36 together.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say that there has not, in fact, been any significant increase in crimes of violence in Dublin in recent years. Furthermore, the detection rate in such crimes is exceptionally high.  In the year ended 30th September last, out of 524 assaults reported to the police in Dublin 490 were detected, a detection rate of 93 per cent.  It is inevitable, perhaps, that if an old person is assaulted, the assault will be prominently featured in newspapers, while the subsequent arrest, if reported at all, will often get no comparable publicity. I am not criticising newspapers for this&mdash;I appreciate that they have to take account of the news-value of a story&mdash;but the problem is a real one for the police who often find that members of the public get the impression that crimes of violence on a wide scale are going undetected.  This is certainly not so.</P>
      <P>I have had a conference with the Garda authorities and I am satisfied that the police machine is functioning well.  By international standards, our crime rate is low and our detection rate high.  To achieve any very substantial improvement would require a huge addition to the police force which the taxpayer could not reasonably be asked to pay for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> Greater efficiency is constantly being sought, and I have asked the Garda authorities to concentrate particularly on seeking to improve patrols after 6 p.m.  Steps have already been taken on those lines.  As regards the merits of foot patrols or patrols by squad cars, the police attitude, which I think will commend itself to most people who study the problem, is that both foot patrols and car patrols have a legitimate place and complement each other.</P>
    <P>Apart from the efforts to improve patrols after 6 p.m. special measures have now been taken to strengthen the Central Detective Unit so as to increase its capacity to deal with particular kinds of crime such as robberies.</P>
    <P>In addition to these measures.  I believe that it may be possible to improve the facilities available to the police in the prevention and detection of crime and, as an immediate measure, I am considering the provision of walkie-talkie equipment for men on the beat.  As a longer-term project, I am having an examination made of the feasibility of setting up a proper forensic science laboratory to provide the police with scientific aids in the many fields not at present covered.</P>
    <P>I have, also, under active consideration the question whether the existing law unduly and unreasonably restricts the police in matters such as the arrest of suspects and searches of premises etc., and when my examination of the matter is complete I may be proposing certain changes in the law.</P>
    <P>I do not think the appointment of vigilantes is either necessary or desirable. The best way the public can assist is to take all reasonable precautions and to use the &ldquo;999&rdquo; telephone service when the need arises.</P>
    <P>I have referred primarily to crimes of violence.  What is loosely termed yandalism or rowdyism is often the work of young children and often involves no criminal offence at all.  When it does, the kind of offence is usually almost impossible for the police to prevent or detect.  The police are doing a good deal to help in the formation and running of boys' clubs and it is <Col N="656" /> on these lines that effective action can best be taken.</P>

      <P>May I refer the Deputy to the answers given on 4th June and 25th June to similar questions by Deputy Timmons.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the position is that the Dublin Corporation hope to provide a system of pedestrian-controlled traffic lights at all junctions on the route from the northern end of Grafton Street to the Parnell Monument.  These lights cannot, apparently, be installed before 1966 but in the meantime plans are well advanced for the installation of temporary lights at Nelson Pillar, and the junctions of Westmoreland Street/College Street and D'Olier Street/College Street.</P>
      <P>Continuous Garda control has been maintained at all these junctions up to 7 p.m. on weekdays, except Saturdays. A proposal by the Dublin Corporation to have this control extended, pending the erection of lights, has been examined and it has been decided that at two junctions, namely, O'Connell Street/Abbey Street, and at the south side of O'Connell Bridge, continuous control will be maintained until 8.30 p.m.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> I propose to begin this statement by giving the Dáil an account of the course of events since the announcement by the British Government of measures to cope with their balance of payments problem.  The account begins with the receipt by me of a message from the British Prime Minister, dated Sunday, October 25th, and which was received through the British Ambassador on the afternoon of that date.  This message incorporated the text of an announcement to be made the next day by the British Government. I met the British Ambassador on the next day, October 26th, and I expressed to him the Government's immediate and adverse reaction to the application to the products of this country of the 15 per cent surcharge upon industrial imports to Britain in contravention of our trade agreements and in disregard of its exceptionally severe effect on Irish trade.  On the same day I sent a personal message to the British Prime Minister reiterating these views and requesting immediate discussions.  I received a reply from the British Prime Minister on Friday, October 30th, proposing a meeting in London on Thursday, November 5th.</P>
    <P>Accompanied by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I went to London and met the British Prime Minister, who was accompanied by a number of his colleagues and advisers. At this meeting I expressed a very strong protest at the setting aside of our trade agreement rights.  I pointed out that the new British special charge affected Irish industry and Irish industrial exports much more seriously than the exports of other countries. It is probably not necessary to restate here the figures which support this assertion.  The British surcharge applies to 80 per cent of all Irish exports of the goods affected by it, and to 21 per cent of Ireland's total exports. This figure falls to be compared with five per cent in the case of other West European countries, whether in the European Economic Community or the European Free Trade Area, two and a half per cent in the case of Commonwealth countries and two and a half per cent in the case of the <Col N="661" /> United States of America.  The only country in the world whose export business is affected in any degree comparable to ours is Norway, and about ten per cent of all Norway's total export trade is caught by the surcharge.</P>
    <P>I pointed out, on the strength of these figures, that the apparent non-discriminatory application of the surcharge to British imports from all sources, and the expressed desire of the British Government to apply it in a non-discriminatory way, did not prevent it from having an effect on our case which, in practice, was highly discriminatory to our detriment.  Having regard to the fact that trade between Ireland and Britain yields a substantial and growing balance in Britain's favour and that restrictions on Irish trade are totally irrelevant to the British problem of protecting their gold and dollar reserves, I urged that the surcharge should not apply at all to Irish products.</P>
    <P>The British Ministers conceded that their action contravened our trade agreements and expressed their regret. They pleaded the gravity of the circumstances which forced this course on them.  They said they had found on taking office after their General Election that the British trade position was much worse than they had previously thought and that, because something had to be done urgently, they had chosen the temporary surcharge as the best method immediately available to them.  They pointed out they were already under considerable pressure about the surcharge from other countries as well as ourselves, including Commonwealth countries.  While not contesting that it would operate with exceptional severity in our case, they professed their inability to exempt Irish trade from its operations, which they claimed would greatly increase their difficulties with other countries, particularly countries of the Commonwealth and of the European Free Trade area.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussions I pointed out that because of our large sterling holdings we have a keen interest in the success of their efforts to protect their reserves and to avoid any <Col N="662" /> risk of the devalution of sterling.  I risk of the devaluation of sterling.  I said that, had we the opportunity of prior discussions, we would have been prepared to consider with them methods by which we could contribute to the easement of Britain's real problem&mdash;the problem of the strain on their gold and dollar reserves &mdash; and were still prepared to do this if the surcharge on our exports was removed. We suggested various alternatives to the import levy as it is now operated, but all these proposals encountered the difficulty of the British Government in making any breach in the general application of the surcharge.</P>
    <P>It was clear to me that the decision of the British Government on this point could not be shaken by any arguments or counter proposals which we put forward, although there were promises given to consider our special circumstances when changes became practicable.  The British Ministers reiterated the temporary nature of the charges and their intention to amend, reduce and eliminate them as soon as possible.  No date for their termination was however mentioned.</P>
    <P>I have expressed the view that any change in the incidence of the charges within the next six months does not seem likely.  When deciding on our measures to meet this situation it would be useful for us to have a definite period in mind.  At present we are proceeding on the assumption that we must provide for a minimum period of six months.  It is possible the charges will operate for a longer time, either at their present or a reduced rate, and we do not intend therefore to put any time limit on the application of the measures which are contemplated.</P>
    <P>We were much concerned with the longer term implications of the abrupt, unilateral termination of our trade agreement rights.  We realised that the confidence of industrial firms, which are planning to expand their operations and to set up new enterprises, in their continued right of access to the British market would be damaged.  This damage was, of course, done when the British announcement was made and full confidence is unlikely to be restored for some years.  Nevertheless, we considered <Col N="663" /> it desirable to try to minimise this damage to the greatest extent possible by seeking a commitment from the British Government to restore our full trade agreement rights immediately the special charges are ended.  They gave us the assurance we sought in this regard and agreed also to set it out in the official communiqué issued after our talks.  The reference in that communiqué to mutual willingness to explore the possibilities of a new trade agreement, to which I shall refer again, has the advantage of reinforcing this assurance.</P>
    <P>Irish industrialists and those planning to set up new industrial enterprises here can, I believe, proceed to do so in the confidence that, when this temporary difficulty is terminated, their trading position in the British market will be not less favourable than it was heretofore.  The Irish Government are, indeed, prepared to underwrite this assurance in any case where a firm may be hesitating about proceeding with its development plans until the British surcharge is ended.  There are many new industrial projects in the pipe-line and we want to keep them moving, because, collectively, they represent a very considerable expansion of Irish industrial activities.</P>
    <P>It was natural enough that some people in Ireland&mdash;and not only in Ireland&mdash;reacted to the British special charges by urging retaliation.  In this regard, the question which must be posed is: how would retaliation benefit this country?  On the reasonable assumption that, subject to the effect of the preferential rate where our tariffs operate, we buy only British goods which are obtainable cheaper or more conveniently in Britain than elsewhere, the imposition by us of special charges on British exports to Ireland as a retaliatory measure would force up the cost of industrial materials and equipment used in Ireland and cause prices here to rise generally&mdash;as I believe the special charges in Britain will cause prices to rise in that country if they are maintained for much longer than six months.  Our capacity to maintain exports to Britain or to increase exports to other countries would be reduced <Col N="664" /> and our position would be weakened and not strengthened.</P>
    <P>The only circumstance in which retaliatory action of this kind would make sense would be if it could lead to the possibility of a withdrawal of the British special charge on Irish products. I do not think it would have this result.  If the British Government were to exempt our products from these charges because we took retaliatory action they would be tempting all other countries to do the same.  There would, in my judgement, be no prospect of forcing the hands of the British Government in this way.  This situation would change, however, if Britain acted in a manner which was clearly discriminatory against us by granting any exemption from the charge to other countries and not to Ireland.  I consider that I got an assurance that the special circumstances of Irish trade &mdash;the exceptional damage done to us by the surcharge&mdash;will produce an easement of the position for us, whatever form that easement may take, as soon as any change in the scope or the rate of the British charges is decided on.</P>
    <P>Questions are being asked: what sense is there in agreements which are not kept?  or, what is the point of negotiating a new agreement in view of this recent experience?  There is no simple or convincing answer to these questions.  Asking them does not give us any useful guidance as to our future policy.  Until bilateral trade agreements can be substituted by international trading systems, world-wide or regional, they are the only foundation on which trade between states can be maintained and expanded.  Durable trade agreements between states provide for mutual advantages.  The only real assurance we can have that Britain can keep future trade agreements with us when her balance of payments problem has been put right is that it will be to her advantage to do so.</P>
    <P>Calculated on the basis of <i>per capita</i> consumption, we are Britain's best customer in the world.  Notwithstanding the small size of our home market, we are, in absolute terms, amongst the top ten of Britain's customers.  These facts may not be as fully appreciated <Col N="665" /> by the British public or in British Government circles as they should be. Britain cannot afford to ignore the Irish market or to continue to treat our trade interests in any cavalier fashion.  In circumstances where the growth or her own exports, in a climate of expanding world trade, is the only long-term solution of her economic difficulties, Irish trade is of real importance to her.  In these trade matters, we are not without some bargaining power so far as Britain is concerned.</P>
    <P>There is not now, and never has been, a policy of dependence on the British market, as some commentators have suggested.  If the bulk of our exports, whether agricultural or industrial, are consigned to Great Britain&mdash; as we know that they are&mdash;it is because it is there that they can be sold to our best advantage.  This is, in part, the result of geographical proximity and in part attributable to old-established trading contacts but it is mainly a consequence of the trade agreements which gave us in Britain the only tariff-free export market in the world for our products, with some preference&mdash;admittedly, a rapidly diminishing preference &mdash; over other suppliers outside the Commonwealth and, in the case of cattle and sheep, a special position in that market.</P>

      <P>This has always been a central aim of our economic policy.  Everything which can be done in this respect is worth doing and will be done so far as Government measures can bring it about.  If we could diversify our export outlets for our agricultural and industrial products it would be a great source of strength to our national economy.  But let us take a cold, hard look at the prospects. There is no reason why this should not be done in public because there <Col N="666" /> are in Britain and elsewhere people who could do it just as well for us as we could do it for ourselves.  There is no other comparable market in the world to which our goods can now secure tariff-free entry.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the United States and on the continent of Europe, they have to surmount tariffs which are sometimes even higher than the temporary British surcharges&mdash;and these are not temporary tariffs either.  These tariffs, it is true, do not make trade impossible for goods which, by reason of their design and quality, can command a price which incorporates the tariffs and the effectiveness of a tariff in keeping goods out of any country depends on the comparative price levels prevailing in that country.</P>
      <P>If the British special charges cause British internal prices to rise, as I believe they must, then, to that extent, they will become progressively less effective.  Our exporters, indeed, have been able to carry on an expanding external trade in industrial products with the Continent and with the United States notwithstanding the tariffs against them.  The only prospect of securing tariff-free entry to any worthwhile external market other than Britain is through membership of the European Economic Community.</P>
      <P>Deputies know that we did not make our application for membership of the European Economic Community conditional on the success of the British application as did Denmark and Norway. Notwithstanding some occasional derisory remarks from Fine Gael Deputies, I have never said we would proceed with our application only when Britain had secured membership. This does not mean that we are ignoring any realities but merely that we saw no sense in tying our hands unnecessarily in some future circumstances when the national interest might be helped by maintaining our freedom of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the British special charges were announced we considered whether the circumstances were such as to <Col N="667" /> warrant immediately reactivating our application for EEC membership.  It is our desire to obtain membership of the Common Market when it is feasible for us to undertake all that it involves. We see in membership of EEC the means of escaping from excessive dependence on the British market and from the danger that the bilateral agreements, under which our trade is now conducted, could be set aside or temporarily suspended as has happened in Britain.</P>
    <P>For a country of our size, whose bargaining power in bilateral trade negotiations can never be very great, the prospect of operating under the impartial and permanent rules of an international community has many attractions and particularly the attraction of immunity from abrupt and unilateral action to our detriment by another country in economic difficulty or embarking on a change of policy. Even if full membership of the Common Market is not immediately practicable we would be very interested in any arrangement with EEC which would reinforce our status as an applicant country and which would imply the willingness of the Community to complete the process of negotiation with us of a membership agreement without any delay when this course is desired by us.</P>
    <P>In our consideration of this matter, or, indeed, of any proposals for a fundamental change in our economic policy of this kind, we must have regard to the fact that the British surcharges are expressed to be temporary. We must also take note of the fact that there is a situation reported in relation to EEC which may raise some question as to its future development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, however, no answer to our immediate problem along the route into the Common Market.  The problem we are now discussing relates to the next six or 12 months and not to the longer term.  I have mentioned the intention to open negotiations for a new trade agreement <Col N="668" /> with Britain.  I have written to the British Prime Minister suggesting an early date for these discussions which, I think, should begin at Ministerial level.  There are some newspaper commentators who profess to know the form that these negotiations will take and even how they will finish.  It should be clear that the purpose of these negotiations will be to consider possibilities of expanding trade.  They will be of no interest to us unless they open up trade prospects for us in Britain which are wider than those which the existing agreements provide.</P>
      <P>It is our intention, and I think it will also be the intention of the British Government, to try to conclude an agreement which will be consistent with our desire to acquire, eventually, membership of the European Economic Community and, if possible, one which will facilitate our eventual adherence to the Treaty of Rome.  There is also the matter of membership of GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  We are not now a member although we have applied for membership. The only difficulty in negotiating membership of GATT for this country has arisen by reason of the need to reconcile our obligations as a member of the GATT with our obligations under the British Trade Agreements.</P>
      <P>We have had this aspect under discussion with the British Government and, indeed, a meeting of officials in connection with it was held as recently as last week.  This impediment to our GATT membership could be removed by the re-negotiation of the British Agreement.  The GATT is about to negotiate a world-wide reduction of trade barriers, the stated aim being to bring about a cut of 50 per cent in tariffs.  While heretofore we have enjoyed the benefit of the tariff reductions previously negotiated in the GATT, there is no assurance that we shall continue to do so.  In the light of our growing export trade, of our policy of diversifying our export outlets and our growing dependence on export trade, membership of the GATT will become a matter of increasing importance to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our consideration of all these <Col N="669" /> matters it is necessary to keep in mind that this country also has a balance of payments problem of some magnitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The deficit in our external payments on current accounts in this year may, perhaps, amount to around £40 million.  So long as this was in the main attributable to our economic expansion efforts and so long as we could visualise the continuing growth of our exports causing it to diminish in future years, it did not call for exceptional measures by us.  If our position should deteriorate, and particularly if unexpected difficulties anywhere should slow down the growth of our export trade we would have to do something about it.</P>
      <P>The Government have considered the measures for which this situation appears to call to facilitate the continued growth of industrial activity here and the expansion of exports on which the strength of our national economy depends.  We have based our decisions upon the information which has become available to us about the problems created for particular industries and for particular firms by reason of the British surcharge.  We realise, however, that our information may not be complete.  I have asked that no industrial firm should take any decision based on a pessimistic view of its prospects without first consulting the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I wish to repeat this advice.  The decisions we have made about the measures necessary to help Irish industries through this period of difficulty are of general application and we are prepared to look at the circumstances of any firm to which they do not appear to be fully appropriate and to revise them generally if, after consultation with industry, a general pattern of problems should emerge that would appear to require it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear, however, that the Government do not consider that they would be justified in asking our taxpayers to meet the cost of any proposals of support to an industry or to individual industrial concerns, unless <Col N="670" /> we were fully satisfied that it was doing everything within its own power to minimise its particular problem, either by way of greater efficiency, leading to a reduction of its costs, or by adjusting its export prices in relation to the British market, where this is possible, so as to result in the British importer of its goods meeting a part at least of the special charge, and by taking full advantage of any other market openings available to them or capable of being developed by them.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in the case of industries which have not yet set out to carry into effect the recommendations of the Committee on Industrial Organisation concerning it or of firms which are still standing apart from reorganisation measures affecting their industry, we will not hesitate to use the assistance we propose to make available as an instrument to bring about a change of attitude.  It is our intention, so far as we can ensure, that Irish industry will emerge from this period of difficulty stronger and more efficient in its component parts than it was before and better able to expand its exports in future years.  We have decided to make available to industries, which have been exporting their products to Britain, grants which will be called Market Development Grants of amounts up to 50 per cent of the additional burden which they have to carry, attributable to the British special charge.  These payments will be made at intervals, monthly or quarterly, and will be determined after examination of the circumstances of each case.  They will be administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>It is not possible, at this time, to say what the total cost of these Market Development Grants will amount to. That is why the Estimate before the Dáil is a token sum only.  We are asking the Dáil at this stage, to approve of the making of these payments in principle.  The grants proposed are related to the present British surcharge of 15 per cent.  They will be phased out as the surcharge is reduced and will cease with it.  The <Col N="671" /> method of calculating the grants in individual cases has not yet been worked out but it is to be assumed that it will include the production of customs receipts and trade documents by firms claiming it.</P>
    <P>In addition, in the case of new industries now in the process of establishment, or being planned, or of existing concerns arranging for the extension of their production, the scheme of adaptation grants will be extended to provide them with help to meet the cost of any redesigning of their products to fit them for alternative markets or to cover any exceptional problem arising for them in the British market or to help them to effect other changes in their production, which will enable them to expand the level of their activities.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to define these measures, at this stage, more precisely than I have done.  If any industrial firm wants to find out in a more precise way what they may mean in a particular case, they can do so by discussion in the Department of Industry and Commerce. I may say that I am satisfied that, because of the temporary nature of the British charges, any firm which reduces its prices to its British customers, with or without help from the Government, need not fear that action will be taken against it under the British anti-dumping legislation.</P>
    <P>We have decided that the general reduction in tariffs announced for January, 1965 will be deferred.  I do not wish this decision to be interpreted as meaning that any industrial concern, and particularly one which is not concerned with the British market, may relax its efforts to improve its efficiency, which the tariff conditions were mainly intended to enforce.  The deferment of this tariff cut does not imply a change of Government policy. There is no solution for any Irish industrial problem now or at any future time which will not call for constant attention to efficiency, to minimising costs through rising productivity and resort to all methods, such as specialisation and rationalisation, by which greater efficiency and lower costs can be achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> The present special scheme of adaptation loans and grants, which it was intended should expire on 31st March next, will be extended for a further year.  It is considered that most, if not all, of the proposals which would, in the normal way, have come forward under this scheme, would have been received by the date originally fixed but it is possible that some firms, which had not intended to avail of the scheme, may now feel obliged to recast their future production plans, and they will be facilitated by the extension of this adaptation grant scheme.</P>
    <P>The finances of Córas Tráchtála will be increased so as to enable a more intensive market development programme to be organised in countries other than Britain.  The Committee of the National Industrial Economic Council has been considering the measures, which might be taken by the Government, of a more long-term nature to encourage and facilitate a further expansion of industrial exports, and has just recently submitted its report and recommendations.  These recommendations relate mainly to our taxation arrangements and inducements. This report will be published during the course of the next week or so and when its recommendations have been considered by the Government our decisions regarding them will be made known.</P>
    <P>In the placing of contracts for supplies of goods and equipment by Government Departments, by local authorities and State-sponsored and financed bodies, an additional special preference will be granted for goods produced by Irish industries affected by the British surcharge for the duration of the surcharge.  This preference will not, we intend, be merely a percentage price calculation but will involve, wherever practicable, the closest working co-operation, between the buying Departments and State organisations and the Irish firms concerned in facilitating the arrangement of production and delivery programmes suitable to both and, if necessary, a modification of the design of equipment and supplies for the Departments to enable the fullest use to be made of Irish productive capacity.  We have <Col N="673" /> now in this country an important and expanding engineering industry and it is intended that the buying powers of State organisations will be used to assist the growth of this industry, not just as a temporary measure but as a permanent arrangement.  For the duration of the surcharge all these State organisations will be requested to minimise their purchases abroad, where purchases abroad are unavoidable, and to assist in this way in our balance of payments problem.</P>
    <P>It is intended to consult with major Irish wholesalers and retailers with a view to getting them to undertake the purchase and sale in greater quantities of Irish goods which are affected by the surcharge, and to help in this way to meet the exceptional problem of some Irish firms.  There may be a problem in respect of some of these goods for the production of which for export duty free import facilities for materials were allowed so as to prevent those goods being put on the Irish market to the detriment of similar goods made from Irish materials.  A solution to this problem is being sought.  Last week the Minister for Industry and Commerce arranged a meeting of representatives of trading organisations, trade unions, newspaper proprietors, Radio Éireann and other bodies which could help in organising a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  This conference is being resumed this week, when we hope plans for this campaign under competent professional direction will be finalised.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the right response to the difficulties created by the sudden application of this British surcharge to Irish industrial products was realised simultaneously by many Irish people, and that is for every individual to buy only Irish products during this period and to put off all avoidable purchases of imported goods. I am sure very many people have already taken personal decisions to this effect and the purpose of the campaign, which will we hope have the voluntary co-operation of all newspapers&mdash;some newspapers have already offered free space for the purpose of the campaign&mdash;and the co-operation <Col N="674" /> of other media of communication, will be to confirm all our people in these decisions and to sustain their faith as to their effectiveness for the duration of the British surcharge.</P>
    <P>I hope also that traders will co-operate in this campaign, not only by increasing their purchases from Irish producers but by minimising their stocks of materials and goods which must be imported.  The role of retail traders in this regard is vital, and their wholehearted co-operation is essential. These exhortations apply not only in regard to personal and domestic goods, clothing and household utensils and furnishings, and the like, but also to institutional requirements of all kinds and to the requirements of industrial and commercial concerns.  It is probable that we can by vigorous action now induce a new mode of thought about our personal obligations to our own nation in matters of this kind which will persist after this period of difficulty.</P>
    <P>It will be obvious to everyone that the country cannot carry during this period any further increase of labour costs.  I am sure that all serious and responsible trade union leaders understand and accept this and do not need exhortations or pressure from the Dáil to make the right response to the national needs at this time.  This remark applies not only in regard to costs which arise directly in the process of production but also to costs in the service occupations which indirectly affect the prices at which Irish commodities can be offered for sale on export markets.</P>
    <P>It is not enough that a few firms may be able to keep their costs at levels which will make effective competition possible but that the whole national economy should be geared to facilitate export trade expansion.  It would be entirely wrong to think that the only workers who are threatened by this situation are those directly employed in the industries concerned.  Unless our export trade is maintained, our whole national economy is in danger and every worker's employment is threatened.  If any attempt should be made to impose a further burden of <Col N="675" /> costs on the Irish economy at this time, it would without any doubt or question bring about a serious trade recession and widespread unemployment. Nobody could lightheartedly wish to inflict this danger on the country.</P>
    <P>I have asked for a period of industrial peace.  By this I mean specifically the avoidance or postponement of demands for changes in working conditions involving higher costs, even where it is considered that the industrial power to enforce these demands exists.  I am sure the vast majority of Irish workers will regard this as a reasonable contribution by them to help the country through this period of difficulty and to preserve the employment of many thousands of their fellow workers which might otherwise be in jeopardy.  The Irish economy was going ahead very strongly during this year until our recent troubles developed. It is essential that it should not lose its momentum.  I urge all industrial producers to strive by every means within their power to maintain, and, if possible, expand their production.</P>
    <P>I urge all firms which were planning extensions or new enterprises to go on with their plans.  I think I can assure them that the impediments to exports caused by the British surcharges will not last for very long.  I believe the British Government are serious in their intention to end them soon and that in any event world pressures will compel them to this course.</P>
    <P>I have given assurance of the Government's intentions to give practical help where it is required to all firms which face this problem in an energetic and competent manner.  I ask all workers whose security of employment and the maintenance of whose living standards are a basic purpose of our economic development policy to co-operate in every way to help these plans to work.  When we have got ourselves organised to continue our economic expansion in these most difficult, even if they are temporary, circumstances, we can feel that the effort we put into it will be of permanent benefit and that it will help us to accelerate our progress when the going gets easier again.</P>

      <P>The House will agree that the story we have just heard is a dismal tale.  There are some obscurities and ambiguities in it which, if we are all to contribute to the solution of the problems outlined by the Taoiseach, require to be clarified.  He mentioned the probable emergence of a £40 million deficit in our balance of payments this year.  I am not quite clear if, when arriving at that figure, he was making allowance for import of capital or payments on current account.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>However, a considerable part of that could be overtaken by imports of capital which might reduce it by as much as 50 per cent, and that is a very important consideration. I put it to the Taoiseach that this is a time when it is of peculiarly vital importance that the people should be informed of the truth as it is, neither exaggerating the magnitude of our problems nor minimising the character of the difficulties for which we have to find solutions.</P>
      <P>I shall begin this discussion by making what I think is a constructive suggestion to the Taoiseach, whereunder I believe fruitful negotiations might take place, if not at the level of himself and the British Prime Minister, then between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Chairman of the British Board of Trade.  It would not put Britain in any of the difficulties outlined by the Taoiseach which operated on them in declining to meet our request to honour the 1938/ 1948 Trade Agreements.</P>
      <P>A great many of our export industries are importing the bulk of their raw materials from Great Britain. Would it be unreasonable to say to the President of the Board of Trade that where 40 or 50 per cent of the cost of an Irish export to Great Britain consists of raw materials we have brought in from Great Britain, the 15 per cent surcharge ought not to apply to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphatically agree with the Taoiseach that the temptation to talk of retaliatory measures at the present <Col N="677" /> time is one which should be strictly avoided.  I agree with him that retaliatory measures can yield no advantage to us at the present time.  If they cannot, the less we talk about them, the better, because talk can often be as provocative as action.  At the same time, the Taoiseach would agree with me that we ought to impress on the British Government what can reasonably be expected of them and I submit to him that the suggestion I have now put before the Government is one which the President of the Board of Trade might be reasonably expected to entertain on behalf of the British Government with no prospect of corresponding claims from other sources which would embarrass the overall purpose the British Government has in mind.</P>
    <P>I think it is desirable to follow the Taoiseach when he recapitulated the events which led up to the imposition of this 15 per cent tariff.  I can very well remember&mdash;the Taoiseach cannot because he was not there&mdash;the course of the 1948 Trade Agreement when both the present British Prime Minister and the present Economic Secretary of State were involved, Mr. Wilson as President of the Board of Trade and Mr. Browne as Private Parliamentary Secretary to Sir Stafford Cripps, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  I remember, as Deputy McGilligan will remember, that we had a difference with the British Government about Article 1 of the 1938 Trade Agreement.  We maintained energetically the views of our predecessors, and the British Government said our predecessors were mistaken in their interpretation.</P>
    <P>The point at issue was whether Britain had the right to impose quantitative restrictions.  They admitted they had no right to impose tariffs.  We maintained that quantitative restrictions contravened the relevant article of the 1938 Agreement and they held it did not.  Eventually we arrived at a <i>modus vivendi</i>.  In the course of that contest, as we went through the meaning of Article 1, I remember the Chancellor of the Exchequer contending most energetically that the British <Col N="678" /> Government's interpretation was correct, and Mr. Costello, Mr. McGilligan and Mr. Morrissey maintaining most energetically that our predecessors in office were right in believing that Article 1 not only excluded tariffs but quantitative restrictions as well.</P>
    <P>Rather late in the morning, one of the British Ministers, not the Chancellor, said: &ldquo;Oh well, I am obliged to say that even if the conditions being pressed by Mr. McGilligan were valid&rdquo;&mdash;I still remember the phrase very well &mdash;&ldquo;we would be forced to plead the doctrine of <i>rebus sic stantibus&rdquo;;</i> and I remember the classical accent of Deputy McGilligan ringing down the table with this: &ldquo;I have been teaching students international law for ten or 15 years that <i>rebus sic stantibus</i> was the invention of a Russian Tzarist Government.  Here the doctrine to be followed is <i>pacta sunt servanda</i>&mdash;pacts must always be kept&rdquo;, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer said: &ldquo;Gentlemen, we are now adjourning for luncheon&rdquo;.  The negotiations went on for two or three day and we never saw hair or hide of the Minister who was in favour of <i>rebus sic stantibus</i> thereafter.</P>
    <P>I like to recall that in favour of a great British statesman, Sir Stafford Cripps, and I share the Taoiseach's view that his colleagues of the present time, the British Prime Minister and his Economic Secretary of State, if they are desirous of assuming the posture of their old master, Sir Stafford Cripps should forswear the doctrine of <i>rebus sic stantibus</i> which, so far as I know, has never before been pleaded by a British Government in recorded history in regard to an agreement to which they had set their name.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has told us that in the course of his discussions with the British Ministers no date was named for the termination of these special duties.  There seems to be a great deal of confusion about this.  I see a statement by the Danish Minister for External Affairs in today's paper that he has been informed that the duties will be lifted in six months.  I saw a statement in <i>The Guardian</i> of last Saturday that the British Government had informed the group of European <Col N="679" /> nations who are providing one billion dollars to assist in their balance of payments situation that it was intended that the duties would not last for more than 12 months.  I accept, of course, when the Taoiseach says that it is so, that he was informed that they were not in a position to fix any term, in which event I agree with the Taoiseach that we must prepare ourselves to face a possible period of 18 months or two years but it is not impossible that the duties may disappear at a very much earlier date.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Government, and I repeat this request, to tell the people the plain, unvarnished truth, for, if we do, then I think the problems that present themselves are not insurmountable; we can get over them; but let us not now unleash upon the country buckets of eyewash and whitewash. What, in the name of Providence, is the point in talking now about negotiating a new trade agreement? What prospect of relief of our present problems is contained in any such prospect of a new trade agreement? That sounds to me at this stage pure cod and the kind of cod that I apprehend will make the people say: &ldquo;Look, if this is the line of country they are taking to cover themselves over with whitewash and trying to cover us with eyewash, you cannot believe the gospel from their lips.  They are not serious.  They are simply trying to cover themselves up and why should anyone be breaking his back to try to help if, in fact, what we are being asked to engage in is a campaign to salvage the Fianna Fáil Party?&rdquo;  That would equally apply to the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party.  I do not think this is a time to try to salvage any of us.  If we put our minds to this problem we can avoid what could be a serious situation but it has to be done on the basis of absolute frankness and honesty with the people whose co-operation we are seeking.</P>
    <P>Let us face facts.  When the Fianna Fáil Government went to London and negotiated with the British Government they did not write out: &ldquo;This is what we want.  Put your name to it.&rdquo;  They <Col N="680" /> had to sit down and give and take. When we went over in 1948 we did not sit down and hand the British Government an ultimatum and say: &ldquo;This is what we demand.&rdquo;  We had to give in order to take.  When the present Taoiseach went over in 1960 he, I think, hoped to take with no give and the net result was that he came home with nothing in 1960.</P>
    <P>Be as clear as crystal of this&mdash;if you embark on the negotiation of a new trade agreement it is not going to be all take.  We are in no position and no other country is in a position to hand any ultimatum to the British Government and say: &ldquo;That is what we require you to sign.  Sign it.&rdquo;  It is going to be a sitting around the table, with Great Britain asking us for concessions and we telling Great Britain what we want and the reconcilement of those two things on a basis which will give neither side 100 per cent of what they want.</P>
    <P>I should like our Government to look carefully at the terms of the 1938 Agreement and of the 1948 Agreement and ask themselves what additions to that do we want and when they determine what those additions are to be to ask the further question: &ldquo;What are we likely to be asked to give?&rdquo; Because, if you read the 1938 Agreement plus the 1948 Agreement, if you read Article 1 of the 1938 Agreement as qualified by Article 4 (1) of the 1948 Agreement, which obliged the British to apply themselves diligently to the task of the removal of quantitative restrictions on imports of Irish industrial goods to Great Britain, if you read the conditions affecting the livestock industry of this country, I want our own Government to ask themselves very carefully what are the other things we want and, having determined what they are&mdash;and I am not clear in my mind what these other considerations are&mdash;I think our own Government ought to ask themselves what are the British likely to ask us because, mark you, the bird in the hand is worth a great many canaries in the bush and if the Agreement we had were put back on the basis of <i>pacta sunt servanda,</i> it <Col N="681" /> might be a great deal better than a new agreement in which it was contended hereafter that the principle of <i>rebus sic stantibus</i> was implicitly included.</P>
    <P>Let us look about the world as well as at our own personal economic relationship.  I am not old enough to remember actively the first World War.  I was only about 11 or 12 when it began but I still remember the thrill that went through Europe and the civilised world when the principle was first announced that it was incredible that you could war over a mere scrap of paper.  We have travelled a long way since then but the economic relations of the world have been radically altered and they can never be quite the same again since Great Britain found herself constrained to renounce her signature, not only to her trade agreements with us but with her partners in EFTA and elsewhere as well.  There is a new element introduced into the lives of us all that was not there before and a great fundamental principle which Professor McGilligan as he was, Deputy McGilligan as he is here, had consistently taught can never be taught again and that is a new world in which we have to live.  Let us not imagine that we can eliminate the consequences of being in that new world by making a new agreement and do not let us deceive our own people.  Do not let us mislead our own people that we have found some marvellous solution to all the problems that have come upon us by the resolution to negotiate a new trade agreement.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, then, in the course of his statement here today, called for a realistic appraisal, and in public&mdash;he said it is time to do it out openly&mdash;of our available alternative markets.  I feel now he is beginning to talk turkey. This is the sensible way to go about it.  Let us find out where we truly stand.  He then talked about the new trade agreement with Great Britain and about the European Economic Community, about the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  Maybe I am slow but I put it to the Deputies of this House that the Taoiseach's observations in regard to these topics were about as clear as mud.  I listened <Col N="682" /> closely, hopeful that there was going to be a realistic appraisal and I experienced nothing but fog, no attempt to face the true situation.</P>
    <P>We are going to approach the European Economic Community.  We are going to investigate the possibility of entering the European Economic Community even if Great Britain remains outside.  Let us remember that 70 per cent of our trade is with Great Britain.  The Taoiseach says that under the new trade agreement he proposes to investigate the possibility of further expansion of our markets in Great Britain.  In the next breath he is talking about entering the European Economic Community without Great Britain. Ireland in the European Economic Community without Great Britain means that a tariff wall must rise between us.  The Taoiseach's aim is that we should expand our trade with Great Britain, that we should copper-fasten the advantages we at present enjoy in the British market.  You cannot blow hot and cold.  Either he means one thing or the other.  He cannot mean both.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree that if there are trading opportunities unexploited abroad elsewhere we should spare no exertion to get them but does any Deputy really believe that successive Irish Governments have sat down with their hands folded not caring about any external market except the British market?  I remember the late Deputy William Norton going to Germany in 1955 or 1956.  There was not much praise by the Fianna Fáil Party at that time for such excursions but they were the best we knew how to do to stimulate interest in trade and develop markets abroad.  As Deputies well know, we built up in America a very large market for beef but it was for a special type of beef, manufacturing beef, and we have continued to extend that market to the limit of our capacity.</P>
    <P>Has any Government, inter-Party or Fianna Fáil, ever turned its back on available external markets other than the British market?  Not to my knowledge.  But it has repeatedly come up against the formidable difficulties, <Col N="683" /> to which reference has been made here by Deputy Cosgrave and others on many occasions, in that we find our trade in grotesque imbalance with European countries to whom we have been saying: &ldquo;You have a duty to exert yourself to restore the balance and to buy from Ireland something approximating what Ireland is buying from you,&rdquo; and we always get the soft answer but very little action.</P>
    <P>When the day comes to say we propose to cut down the trade to those countries we are faced with the fact that we are going to disemploy 10,000 of our people.</P>
    <P>The bulk of our imports from abroad are not brought in for fun.  It is all very well to talk about the gross imbalance in our trade with Europe.  It exists because we buy timber from Riga to build houses for the people.  It is all very well to say there is a gross imbalance between our trade and the trade with the Federal Republic.  You can correct that very quickly and substantially by prohibiting the import of cars from Germany but the reactions on our people will be far more significant than the reaction on the Federal Republic of Germany.</P>
    <P>If the bulk of our trade is with Great Britain, as it is, what the Taoiseach said here today is true: per capita we are the biggest importers they have in the world; in volume and value we are amongst her top ten customers. There is not another country in the world of which it is not true to say that we are almost the smallest customer she has.  We have power in the value of our trade in the British market and we should exploit that trade and develop it and we should seek trade in France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Holland and with all other European countries, anywhere else we can get it. However, this is the time to speak the truth to the people.  There is no use deceiving ourselves that we can go out tomorrow and get alternative markets that will absorb the great bulk of our existing industrial exports because they are not there to get.  Maybe over the next 20, 30 or 40 years the world will change and export opportunities will <Col N="684" /> open up for us but at the moment we are dealing with a situation which relates to the next 2 years.</P>
    <P>Here is where I think the Government is going wrong: the real danger of the present situation is that you will carry a sickening horror into the heart of working men up and down the country whose jobs are put in jeopardy. It is all very well for us here.  We are accustomed to dealing with these matters in a global way.  It is all very well for a manufacturer who employs 200, 300 or 600 people and who is accustomed to dealing with the ebb and flow of trade and the commercial problems that complicate the carrying on of industry.  The man we must think of in this short-term crisis&mdash;and it is a crisis for him&mdash;is the man who has been told that if there is not a solution found for the problem within the next few days he has to take a week's notice next Saturday.  We will fail and fail most shamefully if we cannot bring an assurance to those people now.</P>
    <P>I irritated the Taoiseach yesterday because he thought I was premature in certain things I said in the House.  Let me put this case.  I know a little factory in Castleblayney which employs only about 30 people.  Half of them have been given notice.  I know of another factory in Carrickmacross in similar circumstances.  The problem as it impinges on me as an individual, apart from my capacity as Leader of the Opposition, is that these people will come in to me and say: &ldquo;Mr. Dillon, what are you going to do for me?&rdquo; I am faced with the fact that here is a man with a wife and six children. He has a home.  He is haunted by the spectre of unemployment.  He says: &ldquo;I took the risk of coming home to a job. Now am I to be thrown on the scrap heap and told that in two years' time alternative employment will be found for me?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting the members of the Government are coldly indifferent to problems of this kind but I think they are making a desperate mistake if they do not say and say it in categorical terms to those engaged in export trade at the present time: &ldquo;Do not dismiss a man until at least you have come to <Col N="685" /> discuss it with us.  We think we can help you.&rdquo;  I know the Taoiseach did say this to manufacturers: &ldquo;Do not take any irrevocable step about your future programme without first consulting the Minister for Industry and Commerce.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If he has said it, well said, and let it be known he has the support of every Deputy in telling any manufacturer employing labour in this country to hold his hand and to say to everybody in his employment: &ldquo;Do not worry this side of Christmas and, between now and Christmas, I will have completed discussions with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and, if the prospects of his help are as good as I have reason to hope they are, then we need not worry about after Christmas either.&rdquo;  It will, however, make an immense difference if we can all say together to people whose jobs are in jeopardy that there is no need to worry at all this side of Christmas and, after Christmas, we will see our way more clearly, but we believe that we can find a way round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now it comes to asking ourselves what is the way round?  I heard the Taoiseach say today that he proposes to use whatever assistance the House authorises the Government to provide in this crisis as a lever to force on firms seeking assistance a prompt increase in efficiency, proof that they have themselves reduced their cost, that they had done all in their power to secure alternative markets, that they had conformed to the conditions prescribed by the CIO, or whatever it is called, and that, if they are not reorganising, <Col N="686" /> they are prepared to do so forthwith.  That is all I heard.</P>
    <P>I gather now that we are entitled to say that, on behalf of the Government, the Taoiseach adopts the statement, which the Minister for Industry and Commerce claims to have made, that no man should lose his job, certainly this side of Christmas, and that, in the long run, we have high hopes that no man need lose his job at all because, remember, the Taoiseach has not adopted the statement of the Minister for Transport and Power, who delivered <i>exordia</i> down the country on the obligations of trade unions in this present situation.  He has not adopted, as yet, the statements made by the Minister for Justice that now is the time for us all to thank God that Fianna Fáil have forged an instrument capable of increasing taxation greatly in order to raise the funds requisite to meet our present situation.</P>
    <P>I want to say quite deliberately, and I regard myself as one of the most conservative finance people in this House, that I believe the Government will make a fatal mistake if they try to avail of this temporary emergency for the purpose of raising vast additional taxation and thereunder throwing an increased burden of taxation on the people's backs.  Ordinarily I take the view of &ldquo;Pay as we go&rdquo; and I believe that only a fool needs must disrupt the whole economy in order to meet what we all hope will be a temporary emergency; and we have reason to hope that it will be a relatively short temporary crisis through which we can carry the country without vast increases in taxation, increases which, if once put on, will be very difficult to remove.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke of the Government being prepared to meet 50 per cent of the net burden on charges created on industry by the 15 per cent surcharge, and he called these &ldquo;Market Development Grants&rdquo;.  What exactly does he mean by 50 per cent of the net burden?  I am told that the 15 per cent British charges on the c.i.f. price of Irish goods entering Britain amounts to nearly 20 per cent when one has added on the transport <Col N="687" /> and other charges and discovered that the 15 per cent is to be levied on them. I have also heard, and this is good news and news that ought to be bruited abroad, of cases where British consignees have indicated to Irish manufacturers that, for the duration of this period, whatever it may be, they are prepared to carry half the charge because they want the goods.  That is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should tell us with greater precision, I think, what he means exactly by 50 per cent of the net burden of charges created because, mark you, over and above the 15 per cent on actual goods exported, unless the British Board of Trade is prepared to accept some such proposal as I have suggested in regard to the exemption of British raw materials in our exports, the net burden might amount to a great deal more than the actual impact of the 15 per cent levy.</P>
    <P>I want now to say something which I know is capable of misinterpretation but which nevertheless requires to be said.  Anyone can see clearly that an industry producing here for the home market and for the export market may now find itself in the embarrassing position of having left on its hands a considerable part of what it intended to export.  This crisis cannot be met solely by a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  By all means, let us all buy Irish.  By all means, if we want a carpet, let us buy a Youghal carpet rather than an Axminster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I am as familiar with the carpet trade as the Minister is.  I am not dealing in the kind of technicalities the Minister introduces. By all means, let us buy the Irish commodity in preference to foreign in relief of our balance of payments but, in doing so, let us realise <Col N="688" /> this fundamental fact.  That is not the real danger in which we stand.  The real danger in which we stand is that our manufacturers, having struggled into certain foreign markets, particularly in Great Britain, would be pushed out of them and lose their footing in these markets within this six months and, if they should, the struggle back will be just as great as, or even greater than, the initial entry was.  The whole of our purpose and energy should be concentrated on enabling those industries which have been exporting to foreign markets to maintain their place in those markets.  &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; may help in other directions to alleviate the impact on Irish exporting industries but it will not help to meet the situation I have outlined.</P>
      <P>I want to put this dilemma; possibly it is an extreme case, but it is possible. If you have an industry here exporting 10 per cent of its output, having spent sweat and blood in forcing its way into foreign markets with that 10 per cent and, by an intensive &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, you call back that ten per cent into the domestic market, that might be to the great relief of the individual Irish <i>entrepreneur</i> but it may well be to the great detriment of the national interest.  What I want to ensure is that the man who is producing 80 or 90 per cent for the domestic market and has at last embarked on the task of pushing out into external markets will not now be forced by external or internal pressures back into abandoning the blood and sweat and tears involved in battling his way into an export market.  I want to try to convey, not only to every employee but also to every employer, that it is possible and necessary to maintain the exports which are so vital to the survival of this country.</P>

    <P>There are two other matters on which I wish to dwell.  I have been trying to warn this House and the country for some time of the economic consequences of the inflationary policies pursued by the Government. Now the Taoiseach is announcing his apprehension not only in regard to the balance of payments.  Deputies must agree that this is a new tune for the <Col N="689" /> Taoiseach to sing.  He was telling us, prior to the Cork and Kildare by-elections, that the green light was on, the sky was the limit, everything was going swimmingly and there was no reason for any holding back.  Today, in the presence of extreme danger from outside we are told not only that these dangers are in existence but we have an acute balance of payments problem of our own with which to grapple. When are we going to be able to believe what an Irish Government says when it is constituted of Fianna Fáil Ministers?  Are we told the truth or are we told what suits the Party?  I think the evidence of the facts are that we will still be hearing on the eve of the Galway by-election&mdash;</P>

      <P>No.  There is a place for controversy and a place for co-operation. I charge the Taoiseach that he did not tell the truth, he did not tell the country the truth.  Not 12 months ago the Taoiseach was proclaiming to the country that the green light was on, full steam ahead.  Less than 12 months later, he is asking the country to believe that there is a balance of payments problem in Ireland almost as acute as that in Great Britain.  I want to warn Dáil Éireann that Great Britain, in comparison with us, is still a great wealthy industrial power.  True she is not as great and as wealthy as she was 50 years ago but in comparison with us her wealth is Lucullian and her resources inexhaustible.  Great Britain, for the first time in her history, has been forced by the balance of payments crisis that has come upon her, to adopt a course of conduct that she never followed before, to renege&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That may be the view of the Tánaiste and I can understand it, but there is a difference between that and the signing of a covenant between two people, each side accepting certain responsibilities.  The gold standard is a topic we need not discuss now.  The point I want to make is that the balance of payments problem confronting Great Britain has pushed her into conduct that she has followed for the first time in her history.  That course of conduct is not open to us if we suffer the situation to roll along until a balance of payments problem analogous to that of Great Britain confronts us.  That is something the Government should consider well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last point I want to make is one, I think, of some considerable importance.  We are all agreed that the problem is to keep our exports moving and to keep our costs low, to avoid inflationary pressures and if necessary, in view of the 15 per cent, to come to the aid of those exporting so that employment may be maintained and if possible expanded.  Now, we are all listening to talk about restrictive practices.  On a previous occasion I referred to the constant discussions on inflation and I ventured to ask the House&mdash;as I ventured to ask the Council of Europe&mdash;would somebody define inflation.  I got as many definitions in reply to that request as I met economists.  I must have met six economists in the corridors of the Council of Europe, each one of whom had his own special pet defination.  Again I met four in Dublin each one of whom had his particular definition.  I have mine but I venture to suggest to Dáil <Col N="691" /> Éireann that when you come to talk about restrictive practices this phrase means quite different things according to the person who employs it.  I wonder is the time not ripe when we should set up an independent inquiry to determine what are the restrictive practices of management and the unions, management and men, in our industries here.</P>
    <P>It may be that having precisely defined them, heard complaints and answers from both sides of industry, the trade unions complaining about restrictive practices of management and management complaining about restrictive practices of the trade unions, in some instances we may be unable to find an agreed definition, but we will find some areas of agreement that here is an instance of restrictive practices by management or by men.  We may not get agreed remedies for all of the acknowledged restrictive practices; some of them will be enshrined in ancient customs and privileges long held which people are slow to part with until pressure becomes far greater than it is today, but we will make certain headway and get to know our objective and be able to invite both sides to come together to try to find agreed solutions for some of the problems that may be making our difficulties at the present time greater than they should be.</P>
    <P>I do not acquit the present Government&mdash;and I do not regard it as any unreasonably controversial statement to make at present&mdash;of failing in foresight in regard to this whole business; I do not acquit them of a failure of sufficient foresight in not anticipating that something of this kind was certainly coming after the general election in Great Britain.  They themselves told us that the 1960 Trade Agreement provided for regular consultations. They showed little foresight in not having those consultations.</P>

I charge him with having failed in his duty and I charge the Government with having failed in their duty in anticipating and in not acting to bring home to the British Government the special discrimination which this 15 per cent levy operates to inflict on Ireland.  We have now further exacerbated our problems by the policy of the Government in increasing the cost of living and the cost of production far higher than they need ever have been.  I charge this Government with having initiated the spiral by their tax policy which has operated to increase costs in this country and which further complicates the difficulty the sudden impact of this circumstance has brought upon us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said before that I looked on the Taoiseach as a gambler.  I think the Taoiseach was gambling with the future of this country on two assumptions. He believed he held in his hand in the European Economic Community and in the Agreements of 1938 and 1948 four cards of a straight flush.  He drew upon the future and discovered he had got a club instead of a spade with which to proceed.  The rest of us will have to pay the stake that he ineptly lost.  He should have foreseen these dangers.  He should have foreseen the possibility of the European Economic Community presenting him with no bolt hole.  I think he should have known that the trends in the situation in Great Britain were a danger against which precautions needed to be taken.  I think that much of his bluff was founded on the conviction that it must come off.  The two main stays of it have collapsed.  I should like to re-examine the First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion, so called, in the light of the developments through which we are now passing.  I am glad to think in this country somebody else is planning for <Col N="693" /> the future.  If we had to depend on the Fianna Fáil <i>Programmes for Economic Expansion</i> in the situation in which we now find ourselves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think I can claim to have made certain constructive suggestions to the Taoiseach today.  I can reasonably claim to have thrown our influence emphatically behind the pledge of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the working men in the industries threatened that their jobs are safe until Christmas, and we believe we can make them safe for the foreseeable future.  That is the vital thing that needs to be done.  I have tried to clarify other issues.  But I have not foreborne from seeking to place blame which I believe the Taoiseach ought to bear. He is a bluffer and a gambler&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Neither the Taoiseach's bluff nor his gamble has come off.  But that is no reason why the whole country should go down the drain.  He has to bear his share of the blame. There is no doubt whatever that a very substantial share of the blame must fall on those who have not kept their agreements with this country.  In so far as blame is attributable to that reason, the Taoiseach is entitled to look to us all to help him through.  In so far as his own folly and his own political gamble have further intensified the country's problems, he is not entitled to expect any help from us, but, as far as the national interest needs it, he will get it whether he is entitled to it or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past 25 years we have been fortunate to have had free entry to the British market in respect of the industries we are now discussing.  One should not over-exaggerate or minimise the shock we got when we discovered that the trade agreements we have had with Britain over that period were broken.  Britain provided a relatively easy outlet for our goods, provided, of course, they were competitive with those of British producers.  This demonstrates how closely our two economies are bound together, I do not think we can get away from that fact.  We have had other examples in the past.  I think it could well be said that, if there is a boom in Britain, it overflows to this country; and, if there is a depression in Britain, that depression will have its effect on this country.  We have had both of those conditions over the past 15 years under the same British Government.</P>
      <P>Over the past year everybody realised Britain was in a difficult position in regard to her balance of trade. The new British Government decided to try to remedy that situation by imposing a surcharge of 15 per cent on imported industrial goods.  As the Taoiseach said, we feel the effect of this much more than any other country, and I suppose most countries in the world have been affected by it.  I was intrigued at the Taoiseach's remark that, if this Government had been consulted, he would have had certain suggestions to put before them.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach is in a position to tell us what these suggestions were.  The plain fact is that the trade agreement was broken by Great Britain and we can do nothing about it.  We can only hope for the time when we can have some method of copperfastening these agreements and where penalties may be imposed if an agreement is broken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody agrees, I think, that retaliation on our part would only make the position worse.  It is true that the surcharge is going to have an adverse effect on industry and employment here.  It is true also that we are one of the countries, if not the only country, that did not contribute to this difficulty which Britain has with regard <Col N="695" /> to her balance of trade.  Her trade with this country is, in fact, favourable to the extent of £30 million.</P>
    <P>I know it is no consolation but it should be pointed out that the British Government could have taken other measures to correct the situation.  For example, they could have increased the bank rate or restricted credit, or they could have decided to continue a policy of stop-go-stop.  That would also have had a very adverse effect on this country in respect of not only industry but of agriculture and of, what is so important for us at this time, the building industry.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this surcharge is going to cripple Irish industry.  I do not believe it is, as the Taoiseach described it, a body blow.  It is certainly not a knock-out blow.  In view of what the Taoiseach said in regard to the measures he proposes to take, I would prefer to describe it as a clip on the ear which, in the long run, may do Irish industry and the Irish economy a tremendous amount of good.  If it is to be described as a knock-out blow or a body blow, I submit that it is a reflection on the economy of the country and pinpoints the flaws and weaknesses in that economy.  We must admit there are weaknesses that can be corrected and could have been corrected over the past 15 or 20 years.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of our becoming members of EEC, the Minister for Industry and Commerce established Committees of Industrial Organisation. The reports of these Committees demonstrate forcibly, and in detail, how ill-equipped certain of our industries are and have been for a long time for free trade conditions.  These reports were published from about three years ago.  They urge that the Government and the industries concerned take certain measures to improve methods of production and marketing.  The Government, again on the recommendations of the CIO, agreed to do what these Committees had recommended but, unfortunately, in many respects, and in the case of a great many industries, Irish industry did not respond.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> Last week, I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what progress had been made with regard to availing of adaptation grants by one particular industry in which there were 15 units.  I was told that one had availed of the adaptation grant.  I read a report in the newspapers in the course of the past week to the effect that this industry was in consultation with the officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce: whether or not it is as a result of this 15 per cent surcharge, I do not know.  The Minister appeared to be depressed when he had to tell this House, in respect of one industry, that only one firm had availed of an offer that was made by him or by the Government.  I wonder what the situation is in respect of industry generally, if that is the situation as far as this one industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>It does not seem to me, from the out-of-date reports one gets from Foras Tionscal, that the adaptation grants are being freely availed of.  This may be a good clip in the ear for all Irish industries which are not prepared to avail of assistance and to show some initiative.  According to Foras Tionscal, last year, a total of 282 firms applied for these adaptation grants.  Industries vary in size and in the number of people they employ.  I am informed that there are 4,000 industries of one kind or another in this country.  They may range from ten employees up to 2,000 employees.  According to last year's report of Foras Tionscal, only 282 industries applied for adaptation grants.  What they embrace, as far as workers are concerned, I do not know. The Labour Party warned the Government at that time about it.</P>
    <P>We feel that many of those engaged in Irish industry were not prepared for entry into free trade, whether in EFTA, EEC or any other organisation.  I do not know our present prospects of becoming members of the EEC.  I should like to corroborate what the Leader of the Fine Gael Party said when he described the Taoiseach's remarks about GATT, EEC and another trade agreement with Great Britain as ambiguous.  He ought to be a little clearer and more specific about <Col N="697" /> our intentions.  On the one hand, he seemed to spurn the idea of any closer association with Great Britain and in another sentence, he said we would have a new trade agreement.  In yet another sentence, he said we should reactivate our application for membership of the EEC.  I have not the text of his speech but it may be that he said that the present might be the right time to get some form of association with EEC, apart from what Britain might do.  If I misinterpret the Taoiseach it is his own fault because he was pretty vague.</P>
    <P>To come back to the adaptation grants and the assistance generally offered to Irish industry, I do not think that some of these industries took the Taoiseach seriously when he said we were preparing for free trade.  They do not seem to appreciate&mdash;and I say this, bearing in mind the reservations we in the Labour Party have about the EEC &mdash;that if they became members of the EEC they would be open to severe competition in respect of many of their products and that there would be no special protection.</P>
    <P>Irish industry must have a sort of protection complex: I suppose one should not blame them for that.  Many of the industries have had protection in the past 30 or 35 years.  I suppose Irish Governments are to blame in that they left that protection with them.  It may be that many of the industries needed protection for 30 or 35 years but there are many industries which could have afforded to shed that protection gradually, as they have now been required to do over the past three or four years.  Therefore, they were, in fact, lulled into a false sense of security and were far too dependent on the home market.  It is only in recent years when people began to talk about free trade in association with Europe, that some of them sought to expand in order to export.</P>
    <P>The home market is limited.  We have a small population.  If we are to keep our people at home, they must be employed in industry.  The home market, in view of the fact that we have a <Col N="698" /> flight from the land, will never be sufficient to keep workers employed in Irish industry.  If industries still want to cater for a smaller population it means that, of necessity, their costs will be high.  The bigger the market the lower the costs.  Many of them do not seem to have appreciated that fact.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the facilities given to Irish industry.  They are listed in a publication from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  They are not ungenerous.  Today, the Taoiseach announced that in this present emergency, might I say, additional facilities and additional money will be provided in order that industry will expand and be in a position to export more.  I am not conversant with the type of aid given by Governments in other parts of the world to industry or developing industry, but I would describe the assistance given over the past 15 years by both Governments in this country as being not ungenerous.</P>
    <P>One is forced to ask the questions: are these moneys being applied in the right direction and are these advisory services, let us call them, being administered properly?  An excellent editorial appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> about a fortnight ago entitled &ldquo;Salesmen Wanted&rdquo;.  If we act in accordance with the advice given in that article, then we certainly can have a greater drive as far as the seeking of foreign markets is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not looking for anything from the newspapers.  The Taoiseach must agree that their editorials did not panic but were rather very level-headed.  One of the best I saw appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> about a fortnight ago in which the situation was put to the Irish people without any element of panic.  The Taoiseach seemed to show panic the first night he spoke but he might be excused as he got the body blow.</P>
    <P>If we are to expand, much more needs to be done to secure alternative markets.  For a long time to come, the British market will be our most important market.  Greater production is not an end in itself because without markets greater production will be useless. We have an adverse trade balance with practically every country, with the <Col N="699" /> exception of about three small states. I know that in respect of many of those, the trade balance is offset by tourism and by the inflow of capital.  The latter is peculiar to these years when we are trying to build up industry: that inflow of capital cannot be expected to last for long.</P>
    <P>Some firms have shown initiative, enterprise and energy in recent years and I trust that the Government will take into account the fact that at least some firms have said they themselves will bear the 15 per cent, provided it is temporary and does not last for a long time.  I am quite sure there will be other firms who will be able to do likewise. I think the Taoiseach gave an assurance that any financial assistance given will not be a blanket cover for all firms.  Unfortunately, we must help the laggards.  In his speech on the 15 per cent surcharges, while the Taoiseach did not say we welcomed them, he did state that they may have the effect of stirring up the laggards.  That is why I described these levies as &ldquo;a clip on the ear&rdquo; that may do Irish industries and the Irish economy good in the long run.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, the immediate problem of preserving markets and, above all, employment.  We cannot afford to lose the British markets that have been built up over years.  Efforts must be made to ensure that they will be retained and Irish workers retained in industries here.  I do not know the extent of the problem.  The Taoiseach wisely&mdash;I suppose&mdash;did not say either in money or in manpower what the 15 per cent will mean: perhaps it would be impossible or indiscreet for him to do so in present circumstances until each industry is examined and until it is ascertained what industries can carry this burden for the temporary period we trust is involved.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a matter mentioned by Deputy Dillon.  He did not make this inference but there is a common inference recently that workers are not playing their part.  The Taoiseach skated around this pretty well in his speech on 28th October; perhaps I should say it appeared that <Col N="700" /> he was doing so, but I agree with Deputy Dillon: I think the Taoiseach should gag the Minister for Transport and Power for a while.  This type of criticism is quite popular in recent times with certain people who seem to blame all the ills of industry and agriculture on the workers, and of course, the trade unions.</P>
    <P>In his speech on 28th October, the Taoiseach said that labour costs were five per cent higher in 1964 than in 1963 in this country.  That is a fact. Perhaps it was not the right place to do it but we, as politicians and a Party opposed to the policy of the Government, cannot help thinking that there was no reference to the reason for that, the turnover tax.  There was no reference to the cause of the higher wages and the inference all the time certainly is that this 12 per cent has dealt industry and the economy generally a particularly severe blow.</P>

      <P>It is not alone members of the Fianna Fáil Party or politicians; some sections outside the House believe that because the workers have obtained a better standard of living, the economy has suffered. Prices have increased but not entirely as a result of wage increases.  I do not think the Taoiseach will deny these figures.  The Consumer Price Index increased by six per cent between February and August, 1964 but only half of that increase can be attributed to the increase in wages.  The other half is attributable to Budget proposals affecting drink, tobacco and farm prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past few months, particularly since the National Wage Agreement, we have tried to bring home to people that the 12 per cent alone has not been responsible for a price increase. Coupled with the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="701" /> refuses to invoke the machinery that is there for him to control prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister had jams and soaps investigated but it is on the really essential things that the Minister should keep his eye.  He has not been strong enough in this matter at all.  In the present changed situation, there will be people wanting to recoup themselves from Irish consumers and that is a situation the Minister and the Government must watch.  I am not saying this tendency will be widespread but there will be some groups who, if they lose a fraction of the British market, will try to recoup themselves by jacking up prices to the Irish consumer.</P>
      <P>In his speech of 28th October, the Taoiseach mentioned that there was no increase in unit labour costs in 1964 as against 1963 in the US or in Britain, but the Taoiseach should realise, in trying to make comparisons between labour costs in Britain and in the US and this country, that wage increases occur at different times in different countries.  It is true that increased labour costs were reflected in the March quarter and particularly in the June half-year.  I think he said unit costs have gone up by five per cent but that will be a diminishing figure as the year goes on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Taoiseach was reported wrongly&mdash;I am sure he was not&mdash;but I am trying to demonstrate as best I can that the workers and the trade unions have not been responsible for the damage to the economy that many people allege they have caused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Wage Agreement is to obtain for two years and unit labour costs will be a diminishing quantity over the two years.  That should be appreciated.  Nobody wants more than <Col N="702" /> we do to see that national agreement remain in force as now interpreted by the trade unions.  The Taoiseach said unit labour costs in Britain and the US have not increased in 1964 but there may be a demand for an increase in Britain next month and in the United States in the following month. It is not proper to make comparisons between this country and any other country in that wage increases come at various times in the different countries.</P>
    <P>This sort of stupid remark by the Minister for Transport and Power alleging or inferring&mdash;he did not have to infer it because it was clear to everybody what he meant&mdash;that a certain section of the community was eating the fruit before it was grown is groundless.  I do not know how they can do that, but the Minister for Transport and Power means that as a slur on the activities of the trade union movement in recent times.  He should be gagged.  While he may know something about transport and power, I do not think he knows anything about the trade union movement.</P>

      <P>There is also the argument that productivity has not risen because the workers are not working as hard as they should.  The Taoiseach is shaking his head.  I think he comes from Inchicore.  He would be a bad Deputy if he did not understand their minds.  It should be pinpointed that productivity went up eight per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It went up by seven per cent in the first quarter of this year and, with the National Wage Agreement, it went up by nine per cent in the next quarter.  I do not know what it was for the September quarter or what it is likely to be for the December quarter.  There is no evidence that the workers are not giving of their best as far as productivity is concerned. I know there are many ignorant <Col N="703" /> people in the country who believe productivity depends on the worker alone.  All of us will have to insist publicly that greater productivity will come only from the joint effort of management and the workers.</P>
      <P>We all know for a fact that in recent years there has been closer contact between the employers' association and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions but I am afraid that is not sufficient.  This association will have to be brought on to the factory floor.  Most problems in industry are mutual problems, or they should be.  They should be the problems of the workers and the problems of the management.  Unfortunately the workers only see the employer on one or two issues, on wage issues or the question of hours of employment.  That is not sufficient.</P>
      <P>Workers are told they must work harder and produce more.  To put it simply and bluntly, I want to know why?  Everybody has a general idea as to what this 15 per cent surcharge is going to be.  Everybody believes it is going, in some way or another, to restrict imports into Britain and make her curtail employment.  That should be brought down to the factory floors in Castleblayney, Monaghan, Wexford and Dublin.  The workers and management have got to have this national problem applied to themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employers and management are too secretive about the affairs of their various industries and factories.  They do not need to be.  They should tell the workers everything about their industry, their profits, expenses and all their difficulties.  I believe only when the management gets the confidence of the workers and they both work in harmony&mdash;there is a feeling, whether we like it or not, between the worker and employer that he is the boss and I am only the worker&mdash;will we achieve success.  If we can get down to the factory floor through the trade union and employer associations and get the confidence of the workers, then, and only then, can we make Irish industry go.  There is a particular industry which I have in mind, and which the Taoiseach knows, and I am quite sure <Col N="704" /> if there were any sort of co-operation between the workers and management it would not have found itself in the awful difficulty it finds itself in at the present time.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the proposals mentioned by the Taoiseach entail in money.  He cannot say himself and I do not know what sacrifices should be made or by whom.  Some of these measures are going to be temporary but I want to warn the Taoiseach if this means extra taxation, I do not think it is good.  If this is temporary, as something to tide us over this difficult period, I want to say that in such cases where extra taxation is put on, it is very seldom that the Government or the Minister for Finance takes it off.</P>
    <P>If the sacrifices are to be made, I believe one section of the community alone should not be asked to make all the sacrifices.  If there is to be restraint in wage demands for 18 months, there ought to be restraint in profits.  If sacrifices are to be made, they must be made by both sides in industry.  The Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach today spoke about a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  Surely we could have been engaged in that sort of campaign a long time ago.</P>

      <P>If the climate had been, right this could have been done long ago.  I remember many occasions over the past 15 years I advocated a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  I suppose many other Deputies did, too, but nobody took any notice.  This may be the right thing in this acute emergency.  There seems to have been a feeling abroad over the past two or three years that one is not patriotic unless one buys foreign.  This was because people believed we would be going into the European Economic Community, that in another few years we would be buying Italian scarves and clothes and Swedish furniture and it did not matter any more.  I trust this attitude does not obtain now and that this emergency will induce us to buy Irish and to ensure that Irish workers are kept employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> The Taoiseach&mdash;I must say we did not get exact details of them &mdash; described the proposals the Government have in mind to meet this 15 per cent surcharge.  He said these measures are designed to promote industry, for the purpose of expanding exports, that the measures would be of general application and that each case would be more or less dealt with on its merits.  With regard to the subsidy&mdash;I do not know whether it should be described as that&mdash;or assistance which should be given to the various firms, the Taoiseach said he will not ask the Irish taxpayer to pay for firms who will not make the effort.</P>
    <P>Has the Taoiseach any proposals for the industries which will not make an effort?  Again, we asked that long ago with regard to preparation for entry into the EEC.  The State must take a firmer hand in the development of Irish industry.  The State should not interfere in those industries which are recognised as being progressive and go-ahead but something must be done about Irish industries which refuse to accept assistance, who allow their industry to deteriorate and their workers to emigrate either from the town or the country.  It is not good enough merely to offer assistance and then decide they did not take it.  I know it is a very difficult problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose I should have said <i>&ldquo;merci&rdquo;</i> to the Minister for Transport <Col N="706" /> and Power, particularly when referring to remarks of the Minister for Social Welfare who loves to boast of the fact that he is a philistine.  But it would appear that the Minister for Transport and Power would be most anxious to disown his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, in relation to the vandalism about to be wrought upon the houses in Fitzwilliam Street.  I take it also that he may even during this discussion disown the Minister for Social Welfare and go on record as not wishing to be associated with the remarks of the Minister for Social Welfare who regards those who are in favour of maintaining, as an example to future generations, the skill of 18th century craftsmen in this country and who want to preserve the richness of Irish architecture as being enemies of things Irish and of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>It seems to me an extraordinary degree of madness that a Minister of State is unable to justify the butchery of 18th century architecture on any other argument than that of damaging people by putting them in such company. That is the only explanation for the abuse of the Minister for Social Welfare.  I have seen from the reports that the Minister for Local Government resorted again yesterday, in reply to a question by Deputy Byrne, to passing the national buck.  He, in a manner reminiscent of Pontius Pilate, seems to wash his hands of all responsibility. That is the phrase I use advisedly, with a certain amount of reluctance, in view of the undue amount of unseemly accusations which have been thrown in public life over the past few months and which have been a matter of controversy elsewhere.</P>
    <P>One cannot find any apt description for the behaviour of the Minister for Local Government in this House yesterday.  He hastened to divest himself of all responsibility for the destruction of 18th century architecture in Fitzwilliam Street, Dublin.  He castigated Deputy Byrne for even hinting at the possibility that he might have been even remotely blameworthy for the destruction of the 18th century architecture <Col N="707" /> in Fitzwilliam Street.  He endeavoured to throw all the blame on to the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out last night, Dublin Corporation were told by their legal advisers that they were powerless in the matter of granting general permission for rebuilding Lower Fitzwilliam Street, that they had no function in the matter at all, that it was a Ministerial function and that even the Manager had no option but to grant permission.  Because of the condition of the buildings, it was a necessary prerequisite for the re-establishment of some buildings there to grant permission for re-development.  In that situation, I think it is irresponsible, unfair and contemptible for the Minister for Local Government to come into this House and try to pass the blame on to the Dublin Corporation. As a matter of fact, in law, they were utterly powerless in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power resorted to the same disreputable tactic in the course of his remarks on this Bill.  He said that the initial permission to rid Lower Fitzwilliam Street of these 16 houses from 18th century Dublin lay with the Dublin Corporation, although, again, he must know&mdash;certainly, if he does not know, he has been very badly advised&mdash;that Dublin Corporation were utterly powerless in the matter.  The Minister said that Dublin Corporation could, in any event, have added a rider that if it were possible to do so, an 18th century facade should be preserved on the building.  The Minister knows well that the ESB, even if the Corporation had power to do so, were under no obligation, good, bad or indifferent, to accept such a rider, if it were added. We have seen from their conduct that they never at any time had any real intention of preserving the buildings but rather they deliberately went about destroying them 20 or 30 years ago. It is suggested to Dáil Éireann and to the nation that if Dublin Corporation had pleaded with the ESB to maintain the Georgian facade they would have done so.  That is a puerile argument and is in keeping with the futile remarks of the Minister for Social <Col N="708" /> Welfare who endeavours to link up the opposition to the cultural revival of this nation with the efforts to maintain 18th century architectural excellence.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that Deputy Dunne and others have sought to dovetail this issue into one relating to the provision of housing for the working people of Dublin.  I do not think there is any connection.  It may be with an eye on the gallery that Deputy Dunne said that.  I do not think these houses are suitable for the type of people Deputy Dunne has in mind.  Dublin Corporation have shown that they intended well.  They did some work on Seán MacDermott Street and thereabouts, but these houses require to be well used if they are to look well.  I think they have a residential purpose but it is not the residential purpose Deputy Dunne indicated to this House.  Perhaps he had other residential purposes in mind.  Certainly there is a sufficient demand in Dublin at the present time for flat accommodation to ensure that if these houses were put on the market as residential flats, they would be so used.</P>

The reason I regret this has been linked with the housing of the less fortunate among us <Col N="709" /> is that it allows people to introduce all kinds of irrelevant arguments.</P>
      <P>This is an argument based on cultural and aesthetic values and I do not think anybody gains anything by relating it to housing needs in Dublin or elsewhere at the present time. Deputy Cummins said that if our craftsmen, engineers and architects were given the opportunity they could design houses and housing accommodation for our people in the 20th century which would be a cause of pride to posterity just as our 18th century architecture is a source of pride to us.  It seems valid for us to point out, in reply, that craftsmen have been given the opportunity, at the rate of 1,500 or 1,600 houses a year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With respect, I do not accept your ruling.  My remarks are on record.  I said at the beginning that what is wrong is that there are too many little people in big places who make their own rulings and try to suppress the wishes of the people. Apparently there is to be one law for vandalism&mdash;vandalism is to be respected because it is perpetrated by a semi-State body with the active connivance of the Government&mdash;but let anybody advance an argument against that vandalism and he is immediately ruled out of order.  It seems to me to be entirely unworthy conduct and is <Col N="710" /> symbolic of the moral illness from which we are suffering in this country and against which I should like to record my protest.  The big noises in the ESB are laughing at the ineffectiveness of public representatives.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy S. Dunne on introducing this Bill.  We all know at this moment that it is a futile protest &mdash;futile in so far as the preservation of Lower Fitzwilliam Street is concerned &mdash;but some day the people of Dublin and of Ireland will wake up to all the little dictators who are so anxious to quote chapter and verse and pass the buck from one to the other so long as they can prevent the will of the people being carried out.  If that awakening is carried out we will all owe the mover of this Bill our best thanks.</P>
      <P>I sincerely believe the sentiments expressed in the debate needed to be voiced so that at least it can be said of this day and age that there were those ready to protest even when the fight seemed to be hopeless.  So long as there are people ready in this country to protest against the slumbers of a Boland, or the jibes of a Blaney or the indifference of a Childers there is some hope for the Irish people who, in another day and age, gave to Dublin something it is proud today to show the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been so protracted that at this stage I do not propose to say more than a few words. Many arguments, sound and cogent, have been adduced in favour of Deputy S. Dunne's Bill, which I, of course, support.  I merely wish to express that support.  I feel it is incumbent on any Deputy who loves old Dublin to avail of this opportunity to record his protest against the vandalism of the ESB in razing these old houses which have been bequeathed to us by a gracious age, which have been admired by visitors to the country and which are an example of great beauty and a cause of great joy to many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not at all succeeded in convincing me, or, indeed, any unbiased listener, that there is any need whatever for the action being taken by the ESB.  It is a very sad <Col N="711" /> reflection on all of us that this eventuality should occur.  Bord Fáilte, the Arts Council and other influential and important bodies in our national life, have condemned the proposed action of the ESB.  One is tempted to remind the Minister that Bord Fáilte is his charge.  One is tempted to ask him if we are to have repeated in Lower Fitzwilliam Street the monstrosity constructed by Bord Fáilte on Baggot Street Bridge.  Is that the sort of modern architecture Deputy Cummins described when he suggested that we must allow the present generation to give expression to modern Irish culture?</P>
    <P>Is that the sort of monstrosity we want for Fitzwilliam Street?  Is the Minister persisting in his expressed intention to turn the blind eye to this action?  I do not believe the Minister has his heart in this proposal of the ESB.  I have spoken outside the Chamber to Fianna Fáil backbenchers who feel like I do, like Deputies Ryan and S. Dunne do, on this matter. Indeed, it is a sad reflection on Irish democracy that the Government should see fit to impose a Whip on the backbenchers in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The simple fact is that if the houses in Lower Fitzwilliam Street are in poor condition it is because of the butchery of the ESB who have torn the guts out of them in the past.  Those of us who have seen old cities in Britain and elsewhere realise that the Fitzwilliam Street houses are not beyond preserving. In other countries houses far more antiquated are being preserved for posterity.  The Minister himself has spoken of the obligation to preserve the solid hard core of Georgian Dublin from which he excludes Fitzwilliam Street.  Presumably he has in mind merely Merrion Square and no more. I am convinced that the Minister is being illogical in his approach.  If the Fitzwilliam Street houses cannot be preserved then none of Georgian Dublin can be preserved and we can resign ourselves to razing it to the ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a lot of Georgian houses in Dominick Street <Col N="712" /> that had to come down.  While I appreciate the sentiments of the Deputies who introduced this Bill dealing with the preservation of the architectural beauty of our city, nevertheless we must be practical. Very few houses live for ever.  There are no houses that can be kept standing permanently.  There were cases in Dublin where dangerous buildings, Georgian houses, fell down and killed people.  Sentiment may be all right but there must be a practical approach to matters of this kind.  We may be conservative and anxious to preserve tradition.  Most families, societies and nations cherish tradition but from a practical point of view it is impossible to preserve very old buildings.</P>
      <P>Our modern architecture is very good and modern architects have even surpassed some of the old architects. For an example of beauty in architecture one has only to go to Lower Gardiner Street.  Georgian houses were preserved in Gardiner Street at a cost of £1,000 per room to the ratepayers. They were let as tenement houses.  The rooms are so large that it is very expensive for the unfortunate people who got them to keep them properly. The houses have a bad appearance. Opposite to them there is a block of modern flats.  Any fair-minded person, no matter what his sentiments may be, comparing the Georgian houses and the modern flats would be compelled to vote for the modern structure having regard to its beauty and the comfort it represents for the occupants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB, a semi-State body, want to erect a modern structure.  They have stated that a number of the rooms in Lower Fitzwilliam Street are falling down, that the houses are in a state of decay internally.  It is necessary to be practical in matters of this kind.  It is all very well to weep for the decay of Georgian architecture.  We all pass away.  Nations have passed away. Governments have passed away.  There is a certain degree of physical decay taking place all the time.  Even a tree will fall eventually.  A beautiful tree may last for 300 years.  People may have a sentimental regard for such a <Col N="713" /> tree but nature has her own way of destroying it ultimately.  The same applies to old buildings.</P>
    <P>In a word, times change and we have to change with them.  If one changes with the times one is not doing too badly.  We must learn by experience. What was good enough one hundred years ago is not so good today.  Great advances have been made in building, as can be seen by the modern buildings in this city.</P>

      <P>Before my colleague, Deputy Burke, leaves, I want to express my regret that he has not joined with me so that the ESB could be put out where it should be, in County Dublin amongst our constituents, which might bring some of the money of which the ESB has control out to help the people in Santry, Blanchardstown, Lucan or Swords, who need such additions to the economy of their localities.</P>
      <P>There has been a very interesting discussion and I want to thank the Deputies who contributed towards the consideration of my Bill.  In having this matter openly debated here some service has been done to the cause of democracy in the first instance, to the principle that the Parliament of a nation is the supreme body in the nation, because for a long time people have been becoming apprehensive about this principle in this country and have been assuming that members of the Dáil accepted the situation wherein public officials or semi-public officials, full-time members of State boards or part-time members of State boards were the real policy-makers in the State, the real decision takers in the State, and that this situation was being allowed to develop without any voice of protest being raised in the Dáil against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had here over the past couple of weeks an exercise in protest and the effect it will have is a matter of conjecture.  It would appear to be an irreversible progression that when any Government or semi-Government body takes a decision, no matter how wrong it is proven to be, it just goes ahead with it.  Although the interest of the country and the interest of the citizens may be amply proven not to have been served by such a decision, the proposal invariably, in my experience, goes ahead, often to the detriment <Col N="715" /> of the economy and to the detriment of all concerned.</P>
    <P>I have not the slightest doubt that if these houses are demolished and replaced, within a few years people will walk down by the site and look at the gap in the prospect which extends from Holles Street right up along and say: &ldquo;Who ever permitted that to happen?  What authority was there when that line was broken and this modern construction put there in the middle?&rdquo;  People with some sensibility will ask themselves this question and, as times goes on, with the coming of enlightenment, with the development of appreciation of things aesthetic, more and more people will come to question this.  Up to now many hundreds if not, indeed, thousands in the country and in the city, particularly, have questioned it and are questioning it and are asking, as I have asked my colleagues from the county, why do the ESB not go outside the city?  Why are they insisting upon destroying an irreplaceable part of the Georgian era, the best Georgian houses in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I have asked that question of many people but have had no answer from any source.  The ESB have never said why they will not move out and no real reason has been given as to why this destruction should go on.  The fact is that it is purely a matter of pride on the part of the ESB who want at all costs to get their way, to show that they are the bosses and that the people who were elected to this House by the citizens are of little consequence in matters of this kind which concern, I understand, expenditure in the region of £3 million.</P>
    <P>I want to charge the ESB with conspiring to create a public impression that these houses are falling down from dry rot and decay.  This is a gross distortion of the facts and is completely untrue.  These houses have never been in the category of the houses in Dominick Street, Fenian Street, Summerhill, Gardiner Street or anywhere else in this city.  The speakers who have referred to Dominick Street, notably Deputy Timmons and my colleague <Col N="716" /> from County Dublin, do not advert to the fact that Dominick Street, Summerhill, and all these places I have mentioned, and many others as well, became slum tenements 100 years ago.  They were neglected to the last possible degree.</P>
    <P>There was absolutely nothing done with them in the nature of repairs by the slum landlords who owned them. They were occupied by, as I have said before, not scores or even hundreds of families but literally thousands of families, living one family to a room, many of them being average Irish families with a large number of children. Goodness knows, the children who had to live in such conditions did not get much of a chance in life because the housing conditions in the slum areas of Dublin, areas such as Dominick Street, Gardiner Street and Fenian Street, were comparable with the worst in the world, and the infant mortality in such conditions was one of the highest in the Europe of its day.</P>
    <P>All these houses which are loosely called Georgian could not be compared in any way with the houses in Fitzwilliam Street or in the area adjoining Fitzwilliam Street.  The Fitzwilliam Street houses, up to the time the ESB acquired them, could come under the heading of residential houses; in other words, they were occupied by a small number of families who were apparently of sufficient wealth to be able to maintain them in good condition so that they were not worn out, neglected and untended as the tenements were. There is no comparison.  People have tried to make this defence for the ESB, that there was no outcry because the Corporation knocked down the houses in Dominick Street.  The point was that the Corporation just got in ahead of time.  The houses in Dominick Street would have fallen anyway just as they fell in Fenian Street.  However, the Fitzwilliam Street houses show no signs of falling and, given proper attention, are perfectly capable of lasting for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell and I were invited on Friday morning last to see Georgian houses under reconstruction in this <Col N="717" /> city.  We went along and we saw an excellent job done not alone in one but in others.  These Georgian houses I speak of which we visited and inspected are in an area which was not one of the worst slum areas but certainly a tenement area.  We inquired of the builder and of the person who was developing the property what the cost was and we were told it was £4,000 to £4,500.  Sir Albert Richardson, when he came over at the request, I think, of the Georgian Society to give us information on the Fitzwilliam Street houses, said they could be restored, in his view, at £6,000 per house.  The ESB have said it would cost at least £17,000 per house and they were going to replace them at a cost considerably more than that.</P>
    <P>What I want to underline is the fact that the various estimates so far err on the side of exaggeration, and that is the position even in relation to Sir Albert Richardson, though he was the person who produced the keenest figure of all.  It has, in fact, been demonstrated to us that Georgian houses can be restored and put into a condition rendering them suitable for use as offices, as is the purpose in this instance, at a cost of from £4,000 to £4,500 per house.</P>
    <P>The ESB, pursuing their destructive way, are not alone concerned to wipe out this piece of Georgiana but they do not seem to be concerned either with the impact that the cost of the proposed building will have upon the charges which have to be met by consumers. Compliments have been paid time and time again to the ESB in this House on their provision of a national service.  The fact of the matter is the ESB has an absolute State monopoly. It has no competition of any kind. There are no standards against which the conduct of the ESB as a business organisation can be compared and a glance at their charges indicates that they are in many cases very, very high. Ordinary people who have to meet their accounts often find the greatest difficulty in doing so.  People who live most carefully in order to meet their financial commitments, people who are guilty of no extravagance whatsoever, <Col N="718" /> often have difficulty in meeting their ESB bills because the charges are so very, very high.  On the other hand, the ESB are not one bit loth to send someone with a clippers to cut off supplies when the unfortunate consumer finds himself in the situation of not being able to pay his ESB bill.</P>
    <P>If the ESB get away with the proposal to knock down these houses and build one of these modern cell blocks, for that is what they look like to me, these glass and concrete structures with about as much imagination as D Wing in Mountjoy, and almost equally depressing, what will the impact of the cost of that be upon the charges consumers will eventually have to pay, because, in the heel of the hunt, it is the consumers who will have to pay for all this?  Whether or not they like the idea of Georgian houses being demolished, they will have to pay for their demolition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Timmons referred to the late Sir Patrick Abercrombie at column 311 of the Official Report of 4th November. He said:</P>
    <P>The late Sir Patrick Abercrombie, the well-known town planning expert, made it clear there was no alternative to the construction of a new building.</P>
    <P>I am not disputing Deputy Timmons' quotation, but this is what Sir Patrick Abercrombie said in 1955 when he was, I understand, planning adviser to the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>At some stage in the not far distant future the entire street frontage must be reconstructed or rebuilt, and in his opinion it would be impossible to provide a new office building behind the existing frontages, based on his experience of the Adelphi Terrace, London.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that Sir Patrick expressed the same opinion about Carlton House Terrace, Regent's Park, etc., and the preservation of these and other notable streets in London has since been carried out, with modern offices and flats provided behind the old facade.  In other words, like many others of his profession, Sir Patrick was fallible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> Deputy Timmons seemed to accept him as the ultimate authority upon architecture.  The more I read of architecture the more forcibly it is borne in upon me that architects must be the most disunited body of professionals in existence.  They quarrel about practically any and every proposition. There are many and varied views even on the question of the preservation of Georgian houses in Dubliln.  On balance, so far as the layman can judge, it would appear that the best advice so far as Fitzwilliam Street is concerned came from Sir Albert Richardson, who seemed to me, looking at his qualifications and reading his history, and comparing that with the information available about others who were since consulted, the best authority upon whom to rely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not decrying Sir John Summerson's qualifications at all.  My information is that he is an architectural historian.  He is not a <Col N="720" /> practising architect.  He is curator of the Soane Museum.  Sir Albert Richardson is a professor of the Royal Academy.  He is professor of Architecture in London University.  He is an eminent historian and, very important in my view, a great lover of Dublin, a man who has been coming to Dublin and taking an interest in Dublin for over 60 years.  Sir John Summerson came for just a two-day visit as a tripper.  Sir Albert Richardson has been responsible for the preservation of some of the most important 18th century buildings in Britain, including city churches, Trinity House, the Assembly Rooms at Bath, as well as many modern buildings, such as the new offices of the <i>Financial Times.</i></P>
      <P>My opinion is that Sir Albert Richardson was easily the best authority to consult about the preservation of these houses.  He said they could be preserved at a cost of £6,000 apiece. Sir John Summerson, on the other hand, did not give any opinion as to whether or not they could be preserved. He said they were not worth preserving; they were just one damn house after another.  That was his view. He did not advert at all to the condition of the houses.  He said they were not worth preserving.  One can see in all this that the weight of expert opinion&mdash;if one can call it that&mdash;is undoubtedly on the side of the preservation of the houses.</P>
      <P>It is too late now to inquire and so I shall make this statement&mdash;in November, 1963, the City Architect and Town Planning Officer of this city recommended that the existing facade should be maintained.  Again in March of this year the view of the officials of the Corporation was that the facade should be preserved.  Yet the ESB apparently are still pressing on with this decision to destroy, which is based, in the opinion of one eminent citizen and with which I agree, on the questionable taste of a solitary Englishman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the Minister's contribution on this Bill, he expressed the fear that there was a grave danger that the core of Georgian Dublin is threatened&mdash;he did not say with destruction, but with disappearance.  He <Col N="721" /> suggested that if strong efforts were not made within the next 20 years, we might well see the end of the best of our squares.  This is a good beginning in that direction.  Others as well as myself have expressed the view that we feel the Minister is under pressure in this matter.  No rational man with any susceptibilities at all could possibly agree to this proposal.  I feel the Minister has been jockeyed by circumstances into a situation from which he cannot retreat.</P>
    <P>So far as the Minister for Local Government is concerned, all I can say is that he has displayed the usual boorish attitude you often find exhibited towards Dublin by people who come from distant parts of the country. It was mentioned by the Minister that it was believed that these houses were jerrybuilt.  I always thought that the expression &ldquo;jerrybuilt&rdquo; developed in the 1930's.  How are we to determine that houses which were built 160 years ago were jerrybuilt?  They were built in accordance with the crafts and trade practices of that time.  I understand from architects and engineers that to apply that description to these houses is ridiculous, that these houses are amongst the best of their kind to be found in these islands.</P>
    <P>The ESB made no effort to meet the suggestion of the Arts Council that the space behind a number of houses in Lower Mount Street be acquired and a new office block be erected on piers to provide parking space under ground, and that linked with the ESB block by bridges over East James' Street.  Deputy Clinton's contribution seemed to me to amount to the fact that architects never agree and do not seem to be able to agree.  Most of the opinions which have been expressed on this Bill were in favour of preserving the Georgian houses.  It was also obvious that the Government do not intend to respond to my appeal to make a free vote possible.  This is very regrettable.  Apart from this question of the Georgian houses at all, I expressed the hope at the end of my speech that we might be mature enough to at least decide some of these problems which do not endanger <Col N="722" /> the lives of Governments in a democratic way, by allowing Party members to vote the way they wish.  Apparently the Government Party have not yet reached that degree of maturity.  I suppose there is the argument that if you slacken the rein, the horse may run away again, perhaps in a more tricky situation.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by Deputy Clinton that these houses were dangerous. There was never at any time a statement from the Corporation or any architect that these houses were dangerous. They are perfectly safe and can be made capable of being tenanted if the will is there.  The will is not there, but the will is there to destroy them. This is the most unjustifiable act ever carried out in this city as far as houses and offices are concerned.  All the commonsense arguments, all the arguments in regard to traditionalism and decent conduct by public bodies, are in favour of the ESB taking themselves outside the city where they will have plenty of space and not be adding to the already chaotic traffic conditions which apply to their present situation and leaving the Georgian houses to stand as they are, leaving them available for what I consider to be a contribution towards the solution of the Dublin housing problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan and possibly others felt this was a matter which has not been helped by my advertence to the housing problem in Dublin.  I am not suggesting that, if these houses were taken over and reconstructed, they would make a large contribution towards solving the problem, but I am saying that it would be an earnest of the desire of everyone to take the pressure off the Corporation.  It might very well be that the rents in this area would be of such a nature that it would not be possible for large numbers to avail of them, but nonetheless it is within the knowledge of everyone associated with housing in this city that of the 9,000 people approximately who have applied to Dublin Corporation for houses, there are literally hundreds who would gladly pay an <Col N="723" /> economic rent for a flat in Fitzwilliam Street.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan adverted to the problem which arises when landladies or landlords will not accept families with children.  This of course is one of the unchristian, hateful and difficult side effects of any housing shortage anywhere. Leaving that aside, there are many hundreds of families, elderly and retired people, married couples or sisters and brothers, who could very well avail of flats in this area at a proper rent and who otherwise, if not provided for in this way, will fall back on Dublin Corporation. That is why I make the case that <Col N="724" /> these houses could be put in a condition suitable for being tenanted instead of being destroyed.</P>
    <P>Finally, this Bill is an effort to focus attention upon the insidious creeper-like growth of power in the hands of people who have assumed an attitude of disregard, if not indeed of contempt, for the people of Dublin, of Ireland and of Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that, in view of the recent steep rise in the cost of living, and in particular in the prices of essential foodstuffs, and in view of the resulting hardship inflicted on those in receipt of unemployment, sickness and disability benefits and social welfare benefits and assistance generally, the amounts payable in these benefits and assistance should be reviewed immediately with a view to granting equitable increases.</P>
      <P>This motion is in the names of members of the Labour Party and our reason for putting it down some months ago was the very steep increase in prices which apparently was being ignored by the Government.  No attempt was made to control prices. When questions were directed to the responsible Minister in this House, he made the excuse that there was no increase.  Then he said he was having spot checks carried out throughout the country.  Finally, he said that the increases which had taken place were justified.</P>
      <P>If trade unions want increases for their members, which are disputed, they must go before the Labour Court and make a case publicly.  Apparently it is now the policy of the Government that manufacturers or retailers are not required to do anything like that as far as prices are concerned: they can, at their whim, decide to increase prices. The resultant hardship on people on fixed incomes and those in receipt of the various benefits and assistance under the Department of Social Welfare is evident to anybody who wants to see it.</P>
      <P>As far as the administration of social welfare is concerned, I always have been and still am a great admirer of the way in which the Department handle that particular aspect of its activities.  While individual cases of hardship arise from time to time and things happen which just should not happen because of certain set regulations, or for other reasons, taken by and large the Department of Social Welfare administer the benefits or assistance they have to administer very well.  I include the Minister in this when I say that the people who administer this aspect of the Department's activities seem to be very humane and try to do everything possible to alleviate hardship.</P>
      <P>People who apply for social welfare benefit and particularly those who apply for social welfare assistance are in extreme hardship.  We should never lose sight of that fact.  It is the duty of everybody to do anything that can be done to ensure that those people will get at least enough to have a frugal living.  At the present time, can we say that that is so?</P>
      <P>For instance, can we say that the single man in this country who has been working all his life and who is unfortunate enough to fall ill can have a living on the amount of money he gets at the present time, 42/6d per week?  What is he expected to do with that?  Suppose he has a sister or a mother who is not old enough to draw the old age pension or a father who is unable to work or draw the old age pension and who has no income at all, is the single man expected to keep one or any or all of them on 42/6d per week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the social welfare laws were being framed I suppose they were framed to a special set of circumstances. For years, it has been quite <Col N="727" /> evident that the circumstances under which they were framed have altered very considerably but the Social Welfare Acts affecting them have not been altered.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister has an amendment down to our motion.  I am quite sure that the next evening we are discussing this matter, he will recount, as he has done so often before, the periods when a previous Government were in office and the amount of increase they gave or did not give.  I am quite sure he will recount the period the present Government have been in office and the amount of assistance or increases given over the period and that he will feel he is making a very good case for his Government.  No matter what case the Minister may make for his Government, he cannot take away from the fact that people on social welfare benefit and on social welfare assistance are not getting sufficient money on which to live in even frugal comfort. If the Minister wants to castigate those who went before him and to say they did not do certain things, he is entitled to say so but that does not help.</P>
    <P>In present circumstances, prices have been allowed to rise unbridled and social welfare benefits have not kept step with them.  Some time ago an Independent Deputy brought in a motion about increases that should be given in certain types of assistance administered by local authorities.  His suggestion was that the increases should be in some way tied to increases given to workers.  The Minister and the Government accepted that motion. There may be different points of view about why they did so, but it is a fact that the motion was accepted.  If the Minister and the Government want to be truthful they cannot say today: &ldquo;We think it is right that every time there is a 12 per cent increase in wages there should be consequent 12 per cent increase in incomes for those on disability benefit or, in this case, in disabled persons' allowances&rdquo; and say at the same time that those on unemployment benefit or assistance should get a niggardly increase.  That is the <Col N="728" /> only way I can describe the last increase given by the Department.</P>
    <P>Comparisons are odious and perhaps it is not a fair comparison, but we had a question here during the week following the publication in the newspapers of the views of somebody who thought the cost of living in Dublin was higher than in London or Belfast.  In today's <i>Evening Herald</i> we find that the amount of increases in social welfare benefit in Britain is higher than here and that the minimum amount which can be given to a single unemployed person in England will now be £4 per week.  Here we give £2 2s. 6d.  Yet the newspapers say the cost of living in Dublin is higher than in England.  A married man with a wife to support here gets £3 12s. 6d.  According to the <i>Herald</i> this evening, a married man supporting a wife in London will get £6 10s. and we are told the cost of living is higher here than in London, and I presume in other parts of England where it is at least as low as, if not lower than, it is in other parts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not say the comparison is fair: there are certain things affecting payments there which would not affect them here but however we look at it we must face the fact that those on assistance or benefit from the Department of Social Welfare in Ireland are not getting enough to live on.  If proof of that is required you can check with the local authorities throughout the country, who are responsible for home assistance, and find how many of those people have to get supplementary grants of home assistance to enable them just to exist.</P>
    <P>I am well aware, as is the Minister, that the ordinary decent working man or woman wants to avoid, if at all possible, asking for home assistance. They feel it is a kind of slur and that somebody afterwards may say they had to get home help, as it is called. Yet, a tremendous number of those on social benefits and practically every one on unemployment assistance are in receipt of one type or other of supplementary amount from the local authority or the health authority or whoever is responsible for these payments. <Col N="729" /> Perhaps it is unfair to castigate the Minister for this but I am quite sure he appreciates that it is the setup in the Department that I am trying to rectify.  He has an amendment down with which I do not agree: he could not expect me to agree and I hope the House will not agree.  Yet, I believe he will be prepared to say that something must be done and done quickly for those who are the responsibility of his Department.</P>
    <P>The whole question of social benefits seems to be tied up with the idea that what was right 20 years ago must still be right.  For instance, in the case of the non-contributory old age pension we find that those who have an income not exceeding £52 10s., slightly over £1 a week, are entitled to 35/- a week and the scale goes down from that.  If they have an income under £65 10s. they get 30/- per week up to £78 when they get 25/-; up to £104 15s. when they get £1; up to £117 15s. when they get 15/-; up to £130 15s. when they get 10/- and up to £143 15s. when they get 5/-.</P>
    <P>That is the 5/- the Minister introduced in his last Budget.  He may not remember, but at the time I pointed out that it was absolutely ridiculous to introduce this type of benefit because with present money values, 5/- is no use to anybody.  People would want to be in dire poverty before 5/- would be of any significance to them.  Even if they got it what could they do with it?  People who already have £3 per week are entitled to this extra 5/-.  I suggest the administration costs involved far outweigh the value of that payment.</P>
    <P>The whole non-contributory pension scheme suggests that there is no advertence to real values.  Persons with £117 15s. are entitled to 15/- while those with £130 15s. are entitled to 10/-, a case where there is a difference of £13 per year and there is a reduction of 5/- a week.  If the Minister takes the trouble&mdash;I know he is very busy&mdash;to try to analyse the basis on which those benefits are fixed he will realise immediately that they are ridiculous in relation to present values.  The amounts specified in them are very small and of little use to anybody.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> I am prepared to give, and on many occasions I have given, credit to the Government responsible for introducing contributory old age pension but the non-contributory old age pension scheme is, I think, ridiculous.  Even those who are entitled to the full amount of 35/- a week cannot be expected to live on it.  The Minister should remember that if somebody can qualify for 35/- a week and is expected to live on that sum in his own home, if it is necessary to move him into the local county home or the old folks' home run by the local authority, as far as I can discover, the very least amount required to keep him there is £3 10s. per week and frequently the figure is much higher than that.  Surely that example alone should prove to the Department that it is necessary to bring up the figure paid to non-contributory old age pensioners to something nearer to what will allow them a frugal existence.  They are not looking for anything wonderful but they are entitled to simple comforts in their own homes.</P>
    <P>I am very sure the Minister knows as well as I do that these are the circumstances which could surround those people and I feel he would do well if only he takes this excellent booklet, SW4, in which he will find there more evidence than I could give him in the one and a quarter hours which I will have left, le cúnamh Dé, when the debate is resumed in the Dáil next week, to make a case on this motion.  I believe the evidence in this booklet is such that the Minister, after he has considered and heard the arguments made in favour of this motion, must back it and realise that the time has come, not when the next Budget comes next April, but now, to give an increase to the people who are dependent on his Department for their existence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I could gather, listening to his speech, the Taoiseach listed eight or nine things which he said the Government had decided to do in order to offset the effects of the 15 per cent surcharge imposed by the British Government on exports from this country into Great Britain.  The first, and I suppose the most important and direct one, was the proposal that, in exporting industries, there should be a contribution of 50 per cent of the net additional burden of the surcharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put this question so that we may all have a clear mind on it.  I assume, from what the Taoiseach said, before he went to London, that he did not have much hope of the British Government taking off the 15 per cent surcharge, as far as this country was concerned.  Here is what one might call a device to beat the surcharge by the aid of a subsidy from the Irish Government.  Would the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the Taoiseach, be able to tell me whether or not after the discussions with the British Government, or after the request that the 15 per cent surcharge be taken off, as far as the Irish were concerned, the Irish Government intended to give this subsidy in order to beat the surcharge because it seems to me that this 50 per cent help to exporting Irish industries will beat it? That means our goods will still go into Great Britain.  If that is the case, could we have an assurance, if such can be given, that the British Government have no objection to this or will <Col N="732" /> there be a further retaliation by the British Government?  I do not know whether that hare should be raised or not, but that is something we may have to face.  In view of the fact that the Taoiseach seemed to think before he went to London that he could not get the 15 per cent surcharge off, there is a possibility he may have mentioned it to the British Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also said, in relation to this particular proposal, that each case would be examined on its merits and the subsidy would fade out as the surcharge fades out.  The Taoiseach said he got an assurance from the British Government of a review within a reasonable time.  He said he did not think it would occur within six months.  Deputy Dillon, from information which he has, said it would last only six months.  It should be abundantly clear that (1) this must apply to industries which can afford to take the 15 per cent surcharge, and, (2) it should be stressed that it is not in any way a permanent subsidy and that when the surcharge begins to fade, so also will the 50 per cent assistance that is being given in respect of the burden of the 15 per cent surcharge.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in his second proposal, said, in respect of new industries, or if industries are exporting goods, that these would be helped as far as the British market is concerned. There have been some fears not only about some of the industries which have been established here in relation to the present circumstances, but about industries that have been established here by foreign capital entirely, and I and members of my Party have thought that these were not permanent enough and that a situation like this might scare them into closing down or shifting to some other place.  For that reason, I suppose the second proposal of the Taoiseach should be supported, but, on the other hand, we should stress the necessity for the establishment of Irish industry by Irish people and with Irish money.</P>
    <P>That is not possible in respect of the general development because we have not that sort of money here but <Col N="733" /> I believe there should be greater emphasis on Irish industries by Irish people and with Irish money.  If private enterprise is not in a position to do that, then the State should do it.  This 15 per cent surcharge applies to industrial exports and industrial goods.  Processed foods are exempt.  We have done reasonably well in recent years in the development of processed foods and I and my Party are pleased by the work which Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann have done in that regard. That industry can be further developed here.  This is something which is not subject to the 15 per cent surcharge. We should further expand that particular development in view of the fact that we are still predominantly an agricultural country.  We should make much more use of this processing industry in exports, not alone to Great Britain, but to other countries as well.</P>
    <P>We all appreciate that the Taoiseach and the Government cannot hammer out details at this time.  It is just over a fortnight since we got this announcement of the 15 per cent surcharge.  The Taoiseach told us that information in regard to this 50 per cent subsidy can be got from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I wonder if in his reply he could give us a better idea as to what conditions might be laid down?  I think one of the conditions which should be set for any industry which is examined is that it should retain its workers.  When the Labour Party say that industry should retain its workers, we do not want these workers retained more or less as a charity.  It is not charity to retain workers in any industry because they are one of the most valuable assets in any industry.  We have had experience in recent years of a slowdown in the building industry and valuable operatives had to go to Great Britain to find employment.  Some of them came back but we know how difficult it is in certain areas to get masons, plasterers and plumbers.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach seems to be convinced, and the House seems to be convinced, this is a temporary measure. If there is a temporary layoff of workers, it will become permanent and <Col N="734" /> any industry which lays off workers in present circumstances will be doing a disservice, not alone to the workers, but to themselves and the industry. Therefore, I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce should in any of his negotiations with these industries that need to be helped stipulate as a condition that their employment record will be taken into consideration when a decision has to be arrived at in respect of this 50 per cent subsidy to meet the levy.</P>
    <P>It is welcome news for everybody, even though the circumstances have provoked a declaration from the Taoiseach, that the reduction of the extra ten per cent in our tariffs will not take place next January.  Industrialists in this country were becoming somewhat scared as this would be the third reduction in protection they had.  It will be welcome news to them, as it is to us, to know that at least that particular exercise in preparation for free trade will not be continued in January next.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also announced that the adaptation grants as well are to be extended for another year.  I think this brings him up to December, 1965 but I am not quite certain about that. In any case, irrespective of this situation, availability of the adaptation grants would have to be extended for another year in view of the fact, as I mentioned earlier, that a very small number of industries seem to have availed of them since they were first announced.  This whole situation may spur Irish industrialists to greater efforts and may bring about a realisation that a bigger effort must be made on all sides.</P>
    <P>I have already commented on the Taoiseach's other proposal, that more help be given to Córas Tráchtála.  I must confess I have heard more praise than blame for Córas Tráchtála.  This is the first example we have had of a State-sponsored export promoting body.  Perhaps it is because it is the first of its kind, and because industrialists are pleased and manufacturers are pleased to avail of its services, that it should be utilised to better advantage.  Córas Tráchtála should be an institution for which we would recruit salesmen.  In the main, I <Col N="735" /> suppose Córas Tráchtála consists of civil servants or semi-State servants.  It is apparent now there is a growing need to get new markets.  The efforts of Córas Tráchtála have been successful in the African countries and in other parts of the world to a small extent.  If we need one particular type of person in the country at the moment more than another, it is the salesman. Perhaps that is because the British market has been so accessible to us over the years.</P>
    <P>We have all been converted to the idea that there is nothing at all wrong in State intervention where it is for the public good.  Governments have always shown reluctance to appear to interfere. There was something always sacrosanct about private enterprise. Where private enterprise needs help and where it appears to a Government that help will not be sought, the Government should take the initiative in that particular industry, for the common good and to help those who work in it.</P>
    <P>Another proposal by the Taoiseach was that special preference be given by Government Departments, semi-State concerns and by local government bodies to Irish goods.  That is part and parcel of the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign and is to welcomed.</P>
    <P>I did not quite catch what the Taoiseach said in his next proposal but I think he said he would also ensure that State organisations would buy from the Irish steel industry. It was all vague and muffled to me but I gather it is an admonition to State organisations to buy Irish goods in that particular category.</P>
    <P>The last proposal was a general exhortation, and I assume a preliminary announcement, for a campaign to &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; in which he said the newspapers had agreed to participate. We do not know the cost of all this. The only information we have, apart from speculation by a lot of people who are not competent to speculate, is from the President of the Irish Exporters' Association, Mr. Wheeler.  Last night he said he thought the problem <Col N="736" /> in terms of money for the assistance of Irish industry affected by this surcharge would be in the region of £2,500,000.  There has been an intimation&mdash;I do not think there was a public announcement&mdash;that at least one firm, perhaps the largest in this country, said it could carry this surcharge for a temporary period of six to nine months. I am sure there are others who can as well.  Assuming, therefore, that the figure Mr. Wheeler gave is correct, presumably the Government's problem in terms of money is not a tremendous one.  It was for that reason I said earlier that it would not be desirable to impose taxation for the purpose of assisting industry for this temporary period.</P>
    <P>When I spoke about the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, the Taoiseach suggested it should have been carried on down through the years.  He said the time was not opportune but this is an opportune time.  I suppose it is the most opportune time for the last decade or two.  If this is an opportune tome to promote a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, it may be a God-sent opportunity for us to stocktake as far as Irish industry is concerned, a stocktaking to discover that we must pull up our socks.</P>
    <P>There should be intensification of the work the Committee on Industrial Organisation are doing.  I do not know whether they are equipped to carry out a complete survey on this because I understand they are members of the Employers' Federation.  They are trade union officials and both sides, plus the Civil Service who are on these committees, have other things to do.  It would be worthwhile in present circumstances to survey and take stock of the old established industries and particularly the new industries which have been established in recent years. There should in particular be an investigation into the needs of the old industries.  Many of those are industries which have been established here for 50, 100 or 150 years.  They never sought assistance from the Government by way of protective tariffs perhaps due to their own ineptness, inefficiency, or laziness.  These industries should, if they can, be preserved and we should <Col N="737" /> determine what extra help can be given to them if we make a thorough examination as to their running and their needs.  This survey should be carried out to see whether or not the money that is being spent or lent to industry established in the past ten years has been properly spent.</P>
    <P>I advocated here two or three years ago that one of the conditions for grant or loan in any substantial way should be a certain employment content in the industries concerned.  In respect of many of them I know, as far as the number of workers is concerned, there has not been anything commensurate with the amount of money lent or granted.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I advocated there should be more development of Irish industry by Irish people and suggested the expansion, if possible, of food processing industries.  I said at the time that if that were not possible, the State should take the initiative.  We had many examples here of successful State sponsorship&mdash;the Sugar Company, Bord na Móna, the ESB and others.  I believe we still have not reached our maximum effort in respect of State establishment of industry.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Taoiseach gave me hopes of more State enterprise in the establishment of industry and left me with the impression that where the Government believed private enterprise was not sufficient, the Government themselves would do it.  That has not happened.</P>
    <P>I have kept the House long enough and shall conclude by impressing on the Government that all our problems have been highlighted now by this clip on the ear we have got from the British Government.  Now the Government, and particularly the Minister for Industry and Commerce, have got to apply their minds to the introduction of a scheme of redundancy compensation and retraining.  This was mooted here three years ago but we still have not got a progress report.</P>
    <P>In view of our vulnerability, I think some scheme of redundancy compensation and retraining should be introduced without delay.  We are vitally concerned now about Irish industry <Col N="738" /> because of the abnormal drift from the land.  If we cannot steer our workers into industry, we shall be allowing them to drift across the sea. While we must preserve our markets, our industry, our employment, perhaps the situation we now are in is a stepping stone from which we can ensure by various methods, apart from those announced by the Taoiseach, that Irish industry will give permanent and secure employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon began on a very commendable basis that the present situation had created a problem in which all of us could help. Unfortunately, his speech quickly degenerated into what can only be regarded as very contentious matter. Apart from what he regarded as constructive suggestions, he accused the Government&mdash;I use his own words &mdash;of failure of foresight in meeting the present situation.  Deputy Dillon, of course, had the advantage of hindsight. I should like to ask him if he or anybody else in the world anticipated the imposition of this tariff by the British Government in breach of their trade agreements with us and with other countries.</P>
      <P>Of course this Government knew there was a balance of payments problem in Britain.  Apart from our knowledge, we had been told by the outgoing Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Maudling, that any incoming Government would have to deal with such a situation.  It was obvious then that no matter what Party were successful, measures would have to be taken to right that balance of payments problem.  However, I do not think Mr. Wilson or his advisers anticipated the magnitude of the situation facing them. Let us take Mr. Wilson's own words: &ldquo;I found the patient bleeding to death and could not wait for the doctor to stop the bleeding.&rdquo;  Unfortunately the method he adopted hit us as well as the rest of the world and I do not think any amount of foresight could have enabled us to anticipate the type of action taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Efforts to make our industry viable were the only practicable way we could <Col N="739" /> have dealt with this or any other situation that might have arisen.  The means we adopted were realistic and, to use Deputy Corish's words, the measures we applied were more than generous. Deputy Corish referred to the appraisal by the Committee on Industrial Organisation and suggested that some other type of appraisal should be carried out now.  It is well known to Deputies that there has not been in any country in Europe any appraisal as comprehensive in depth as that carried out by the Committee on Industrial Organisation.  It has involved 30 industries comprising many hundreds of firms.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish does not appear to be completely familiar with the methods adopted in this respect.  He said the members of the Committee on Industrial Organisation were representatives of trade unions, employers' organisations and civil servants, but did not advert to the fact that in each case a special survey team was appointed to examine &ldquo;on the floor&rdquo; every industry and report back to the Committee on Industrial Organisation.  That began three years ago and the most recent report is only about to be published.</P>
    <P>Therefore, nothing will be gained by going back on old ground to see to what extent measures must be adopted to improve the competitiveness of our industry.  As a result of these surveys, the House is aware we have been able to introduce several measures to assist industry to improve its competitiveness.  We have given technical assistance grants of up to 50 per cent of the costs, and adaptation grants.  All this has been going on for some time, in many cases with very good effects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not mean very much.  Could the Minister be more specific about the good effects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Adaptation councils have been set up in very many cases. Their purpose is to rationalise, where rationalisation would seem to be the answer to Irish industry, to encourage bulk buying of raw materials where <Col N="740" /> lack of that would seem to be one of the deterrents to the efficiency of the industry, and many other measures. As the Deputy knows, we have established in my Department a special section, the Industrial Reorganisation Branch, whose task it is to pursue the industries and ensure as far as they can that the recommendations made by the Committee on Industrial Organisation will be applied to these industries.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon referred to our balance of payments problem.  The Taoiseach said that of course, in present circumstances, it could assume serious proportions.  The balance of payments in 1963 was some £22 million. We did not regard that as serious because much of the goods we were importing were used for the development of our own industries and therefore of our own exports.</P>
      <P>One of the constructive suggestions he made was that we carry out an examination into restrictive practices on both sides, whether it be management or labour.  I think Deputy Dillon must know that there is no quick way of dealing with this problem.  I am sure he will agree with me that heavy-handed legislation on the part of the Government will not be the solution. But, again, we set about the elimination of these practices in a methodical way, for example, by the setting up of the Ceárd Comhairle which is representative of employer, trade union and educational interests.  Their principal function is to ensure that adequate skilled workers will be made available for the different industrial enterprises carried on in this country. I think they have succeeded to a considerable extent in opening up the bottlenecks of entry to many of the skilled trades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also the instance of the setting up of the Irish National Productivity Committee, which also is representative of employers and workers and its main purpose is to ensure that co-operation will be available as between the employers and workers in eliminating restrictive practices and in ensuring that we will at least have the means of <Col N="741" /> creating greater productivity in our industry.</P>
    <P>There is also the instance of the subvention to the Irish Management Institute to ensure that we will have a cadre of skilled management in this country so that we can match the management of those countries which have had such a start on us from the industrial point of view.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion that Deputy Dillon made was that the British content in goods that we were exporting might be excluded from the 15 per cent surcharge.  This is an old problem.  It is one that has been exercising the Government in a particular matter, that is, man-made fibres, over a number of years.  It will be possible, I think, in the case of some goods to obtain exclusion of the proportion of British manufacture in these goods but there is an overriding principle as far as the British customs are concerned in such cases, that is, that the goods must not have lost their identity. In a few cases this may be possible; goods processed here will still have as much of their identity as can be easily recognised and, therefore, the British content may be excluded so far as the 15 per cent surcharge is concerned but, by and large, I do not think there is much that we can do that we have not already done in trying to persuade the British Government to exclude the British content in man-made fibre commodities processed in this country.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, in this context I might mention that Deputy Dillon's suggestion that there has not been regular consultation as was agreed to in the 1960 Agreement is completely incorrect. There has been that regular consultation.  The pattern was that the consultation was between senior officers of both Governments.  These consultations have been, in fact, carried out regularly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon put an undertaking into my mouth when he suggested that the furthest the Government have gone as far as trying to maintain employment is concerned was an exhortation by the Taoiseach that no industrialist should take a decision that might affect his output potential without first <Col N="742" /> consulting the Department of Industry and Commerce.  In a recent newspaper article I expounded somewhat on that and I exhorted industrialists not to lay off any men until they had such consultations. Deputy Dillon suggested&mdash;I do not know where he could have got it&mdash;that I had guaranteed that there would be no sackings between this and Christmas.  I hope that will be the position and it will be the intention of the Government and of my Department in the consultations that we will have in the course of the next few days with the industries and with the individual firms concerned.</P>
    <P>I might say that almost 100 firms have already come to the Department and have given us an outline of their problems.  The problems were of different magnitude as far as different companies were concerned.  Some of them did say to us that their British customers would be able to share with them some part of the surcharge. Others said that the surcharge if unrelieved would have the effect of making their goods uncompetitive in the British market.  Others said that they themselves would bear part of the levy.  The pattern has not been the same in any cases or any category of cases but in order to ensure that we will have a full picture of the position in each case consultations will take place.  The first of these consultations on a representative basis will be held tomorrow in my Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish made some reference to the response to adaptation grants. Again, I think he may well have misunderstood the purpose of the adaptation grants scheme.  It has reference to more than exporting firms.  One of the purposes of the scheme is to ensure that industries in this country would equip or readapt themselves as a matter of urgency in order to withstand competition on the home market and also in order to expand their potential in export markets.  The test, of course, being applied is that the type of expenditure involved will have to be unusual expenditure over and above ordinary replacement obligations that any industry would have from year to year.  The response, while slow at the <Col N="743" /> start, has been reasonably satisfactory in latter months and, as the Taoiseach said, it is probably true that the bulk of those industries that could be assisted by way of adaptation grants have now made formal application. However, there possibly are some industries who, because of the present difficulties that the surcharge will create, may have to think twice about applying for adaptation grants and it is in order to help these industries to formulate plans&mdash;and again I urge them to formulate these plans quickly &mdash;that the adaptation grants system has been extended, not to the end of next year as Deputy Corish suggested, but to the 31st March, 1966.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish, in this context also, mentioned a case which I suggest is not relevant.  The case he picked out was the case of the motor assembly industry and he said that only one out of a total of 15 firms had taken advantage of the adaptation grants system.  In the case of the motor assembly business, the Committee on Industrial Organisation reported rather adversely on its prospects in free trade conditions.  The fact is that they have set up a committee representative of the whole industry, and, as he knows, many of them have already undertaken and are undertaking plans to expand their output.  One small motor assembly industry has come to me to take advantage of the special offer&mdash;and it was a special offer, I repeat&mdash;outside the special adaptation grants system&mdash;whereby they could switch production on to another line and so retain the men and other personnel they have in employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a special offer made on the publication by the Committee on Industrial Organisation of their report on the motor assembly industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Only one firm out of the ten to 15 assembly firms have accepted that special offer.  The offer was that they might go out of assembly, switch production to some other manufacturing line and so retain their workers, and at the same time the Government would give facilities for the importation of cars so that they could hold their position in the car distribution business as well.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon asked what is the meaning of the proposal by the Government to give assistance to the extent of 50 per cent of the net burden on exporting industry.  The details have not been worked out.  Different remedies will have to be applied in different cases and it will depend on the examination of each firm's or each industry's case.  The intention is to relieve exporting firms of a certain portion of the financial burden which necessarily falls upon them as a result of the British surcharge.</P>
      <P>Deputies will understand that there will be cases where this financial burden will not be the full amount of the British surcharge.  There have been and may continue to be cases where Irish firms succeed in persuading their British customers to share part of the surcharge.  That has been mentioned in a number of cases.  There may be other cases where because of the demand for the goods in question, because of the quality of the goods in question, Irish exporters may not have to adjust their prices at all to the full extent of the surcharge in order to maintain their exports to the British market.  As I said, it is intended that there will be immediate discussions with representatives of producers and exporters with a view to devising the scheme that will give effect to the Government's proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will appreciate that any such scheme must aim at ensuring a fair distribution of the burden between exporters and industry and in this connection I cannot understand Deputy Corish's suggestion that in order to meet this financial burden the Government ought to find means other than by way of taxation.  It is obvious that this exercise will cost money and the Government, as Deputy Corish <Col N="745" /> knows, has no means of providing money except out of taxation.  The relief given must be available quickly and in terms that will leave the exporters in no doubt as to where they stand.  The object of the discussions which, as I said, will be held tomorrow and on subsequent days with producers and exporters will be to devise a scheme that will satisfy these criteria.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish mentioned that some firms may resort to increasing prices on the home market in order to recover some of the surcharge on the British market.  One of the tests in order to procure assistance at all will be that the firm or the industry itself must have made positive efforts from their own resources or with the assistance of their customers to overcome the effect of the surcharge.  However, over and above this, this scheme can only be worked with full disclosure of invoices and other export documents; if it appears that in any case a firm has increased its prices on the home market, and this information will emerge very quickly, I can assure the House and the country that my Department will not be sympathetic to any firms that resort to increasing prices on the home market in order to recoup some of their potential losses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked how temporary all this is likely to be.  Of course, he cannot expect us to provide the answer but the provisions of the British legislation have now been announced.  The Act is intended to be in force for one year; nevertheless, side by side with the publication of the Bill, the British Government have stated that they hope to be able to reduce or abolish the surcharge in advance of the 12-month period.  Obviously their legislation would have to provide a sufficiently long period in order to ensure that they would have overcome the problem.</P>
    <P>We cannot be sure, however, that the imposition will last only 12 months because there could easily be amending legislation extending the period but it is hoped that, by and large, the period of the surcharge will be a matter of months.  In that connection, too, in so far as British public statements are concerned, the day after the conversations the Taoiseach and I <Col N="746" /> had with Members of the British Government, the Minister of State in the Board of Trade announced in Scotland that he expected that the surcharge would last deep into the Spring.  Whatever that means I do not know but it would appear that he had in mind months rather than a full year.</P>
    <P>There is one other important thing to remember in all this and it is that this 15 per cent surcharge will not leave our exporters in any worse position <i>vis-à-vis</i> their competitors from other countries in the British market. The 15 per cent surcharge in our case will represent only a 15 per cent tariff; in the case of exporters to Britain from other countries it will be 15 per cent on top of whatever the existing tariff is.  To that extent, therefore, we will maintain our advantage over our competitors from other countries in the British market.  There will, of course, be the difficulty of meeting competition within the British market.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need refer to the other measures that it is proposed to take but I might mention in more detail what is proposed in regard to the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  I agree that, generally speaking, there ought not to be a need for an ordinary much less a special &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign because every Irish man and woman, every member of the buying public, ought to realise it is good national business for them to buy Irish.  There is also the implication in an intensive &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign that Irish goods may not be as good as what is offered from other countries.  However, nowadays we can face criticism in that respect realising that our industrial goods have in recent years been achieving spectacular success on foreign markets and therefore in buying Irish we know we are buying good quality and good value as well.  Nevertheless this is an opportune time to bring home more and more to the Irish people the necessity to buy the products of our own factories.</P>
    <P>I must say, while I was expected to take the initiative in this campaign, I was encouraged by the spontaneous response I got from many quarters immediately the surcharge was announced.  Suggestions came to my Department and to other Departments <Col N="747" /> that different sectors of our community were anxious to pull their full weight in any campaign the Government would wish to undertake.  As the House is aware, certain organisations, particularly the National Agricultural and Industrial Development Association, have over the past half century been regularly campaigning in this direction.  This was one of the organisations that I invited to send representatives to a special meeting in my Department last Wednesday.  I also asked representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federation of Irish industries, the Federation of Trade Associations, the newspapers and Radio Éireann.  The Association of Advertising Agents, and other organisations have since indicated their support.  As the Taoiseach said, this will have to be a fully professional campaign.  It is impossible at this stage to anticipate what the cost of it will be put I hope the voluntary effort which has been stimulated will help to minimise the cost of the campaign to the Government.</P>
    <P>Representatives of certain newspapers have offered to provide advertising space free of charge and I hope this will be possible in the case of all newspapers.  A further meeting of this group will be held tomorrow.  I hope that it will be possible, as a result of that meeting, to announce the positive measures that can be undertaken.  It is the intention to have active people and not just a committee sitting back and offering advice.  We want active people going after all these organisations and ensuring that this idea percolates right down to all levels.  It was for that purpose I invited ICTU so that they could, in turn, imbue their respective trade unions and the individual members with this idea.  The Federation of Trade Associations who were represented, through their constituent associations, will have the opportunity of bringing the necessity for taking a full part in this campaign home to their members.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from these efforts, to use someone else's words, unless we can get behind the counter to the <Col N="748" /> assistants, the shopkeepers and store owners to ensure they give Irish goods a fair showing and provide their customers with the opportunity of buying Irish, without first being shown imported goods, unless we can do that successfully, it will be difficult to make a success of this campaign.  Further details will be announced in the very near future when, I hope, the first fruits of the campaign will be evident also.</P>
    <P>With regard to Córas Tráchtála, and the intention to make extra funds available to them, those extra funds do not appear as a subhead in this Estimate because Córas Tráchtála have sufficient funds available at the moment.  However, it will be necessary at a later stage to bring in another Supplementary Estimate to enable Córas Tráchtála to take the extra special measures required.</P>
    <P>In support of what has already been said in the House, I agree that the finding of alternative markets in other parts of the world will not be an easy matter.  We shall have tariff obstacles to overcome.  It will take intensive and continuous effort, and the production of quality goods mainly, to get a foothold in these markets. Recently I adverted to the success we have achieved in the German market.  In the past six years, our exports have increased in value from £1 to £6 millions approximately.  This increase has been assisted by the setting up here of some German industries which are engaged in the manufacture of goods for export to their own home market.  Nevertheless, I shall encourage&mdash;I know it will not be necessary to do so to any great extent&mdash;Córas Tráchtála to seek out other markets which it may not have occurred to Irish exporters to try.</P>
    <P>By and large, I believe we will have the co-operation of everybody concerned. The public know what will be involved for them.  Industrialists know what will be involved for them, as well as their workers.  Deputy Corish seemed to blame the industrialist for any shortcomings we may have in our industrial set-up but, as I said at the outset, this is a problem for all of us and, no matter how hard an industrial executive <Col N="749" /> works, or the man in the shop works, there is room, I believe, for improvement everywhere&mdash;I am confident that that improvement will be forthcoming &mdash;in order to ensure that we can surmount this present difficulty.  As the Taoiseach said, the measures we take now will not only help us to solve the present problem but will give us greater strength to expand our exports considerably in the future.</P>

      <P>This particular Supplementary Estimate and the circumstances in which it is introduced raise two problems: (1) the immediate steps necessary to deal with what we hope will be a short-term problem and (2) the long-term question of trade and markets.  The House is familiar with the circumstances in which the levy was introduced.  This is not the first time in the world's history that agreements, written or otherwise, have been unilaterally broken.  It is, however, the first occasion, I think, on which a trade agreement of this nature has been unilaterally altered without any consultation. If consultation had taken place prior to the introduction of the levy, it might have enabled a different decision to have been taken so far as our case is concerned.  I think we were entitled to expect that international standards of commercial behaviour had improved or were, at any rate, thought to be better than formerly.  Had Britain conferred with some of the international organisations dealing with economic and trade matters, such as the IMF, EFTA or GATT, certain criticism that has emerged, and which has not been confined to this country, might have been, if not avoided, certainly lessened, and there might have been a better understanding of the problems involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1956, when we had to take action to deal with the balance of payments problem, account was taken and preferential arrangements were made and permitted in respect of British imports. We could reasonably have expected that similar considerations would apply in reverse when the British Government felt obliged to impose a levy in respect of imports.  &ldquo;Necessity knows no law&rdquo; is a bad basis on <Col N="750" /> which to conduct international affairs, politically, financially, or economically. The effect of the levies in our case is much more severe than it is in regard to other countries.  In the 12 months ended last June, the total value of the exports from this country to Britain was over £152 millions, or about 75 per cent of our total exports, compared with, as the Taoiseach mentioned, five per cent in some cases and 2½ per cent in others, with the possible exception of Norway.  The predominance of our trade with Britain accentuates the severity of the 15 per cent and highlights the need to take whatever steps are possible to have this levy removed at the earliest possible opportunity as well as the immediate short-term action, and we hope it will be short-term, which this Supplementary Estimate is designed to meet.</P>
    <P>During this discussion the Taoiseach said by way of interjection, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce reiterated it in the course of his statement, that under the 1960 Agreement, consultations had regularly taken place at official level.  If that is so, and I do not doubt it, I should like to inquire did the special consultations attempt to keep the British Government informed about the basis of our trade? When it was announced by the British Government, after the election, that they proposed to take action to deal with the balance of payments situation, was any <i>aide memoire</i> or other representation, verbal or written, made to the effect that our trade with Britain was of a very special character, that in recent times it depended on the trade agreements referred to but that anteceding any of these trade agreements, we had, over many years, a special pattern of trade with Britain and, as was emphasised in the course of this discussion, that this country is one of the best customers for British exporters and traders?  Was it also pointed out that this country implements in full, in theory as well as in practice, the terms of the various trade agreements made not merely with Britain but other countries?</P>
    <P>The problem posed by this levy has been discussed in considerable detail and the measures to alleviate it have <Col N="751" /> been outlined in so far as it is possible to go into detail, by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Leaving aside the immediate problem for the moment, I want to get some information as to what long-term plans the Government have for dealing with our future trading arrangements and what long-term policy it is proposed to adopt.  On this aspect I thought the Taoiseach was somewhat vague and imprecise.  Is it proposed to renew or revitalise our application to join the EEC?  Even with the serious doubts which have been expressed in many quarters as to the future prospects of the EEC, is it intended either to pursue the original application for full membership or, as I gathered from the remarks of the Taoiseach, to seek some type of association or contact with that organisation other than full membership?  In view of the altered circumstances, has consideration been given to the question of joining EFTA?  The impression created by statements elsewhere, as well as by comments at the recent meeting of the Council of Europe, and indeed by the comments of the Danish Foreign Minister, would indicate that there are grave doubts about the future of that organisation.  I gathered from the Taoiseach that the question of pursuing our application to join GATT was also under review.</P>
    <P>I believe the time has arrived when we should have a fresh look at the whole of our trading arrangements.  It is easy for people to be exasperated and given to the free expression of opinions to the effect that trade agreements which are not kept are not worth making and that, because an agreement is broken, we should not make trade agreements.  I do not think that after full consideration and serious examination anyone can really agree with that view.  I believe we have got to endeavour to ensure that some trading arrangements are entered into. It is in our interests, in the interest of any small country, as well as in the interests of bigger countries, that, if possible, some multilateral trading arrangements in some organisation of <Col N="752" /> wider membership should be available under which this country or other countries would have certain trading rights, and that some system of sanctions might be possible in the case of a breach of the rules or regulations, which is not always readily available where bilateral agreements are concerned.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate the fact that the Taoiseach and the Government, because they seem to have no definite view on this aspect, have taken no definite decision, due to the fact that the immediate future of the EEC and of EFTA is unsatisfactory and it is not possible to be precise or definite.  In those circumstances, however, I believe we should consider the question of having direct representation in the headquarters of these organisations so that we may be informed of the very latest position and adequately briefed on what the prospects are as well as what is the general thinking in these organisations.</P>
    <P>In that connection it is a welcome decision that we should not further reduce tariffs, as was contemplated, next January.  I do not know whether we got any advantage from the two reductions already made.  They probably did not do a great deal of harm, and they have done a great deal of good, but it does not seem that we have got any compensatory advantage because these decisions were taken on the assumption that this country would ultimately be a member of the EEC. While that seemed likely enough some years ago, the French Government altered radically, for the present, if not for a considerable time, the prospects of membership.</P>
    <P>The decision not to proceed with a further cut in tariffs will naturally be welcomed but it emphasises the importance&mdash;while our bargaining capacity, political influence and the impetus we can give to any of these discussions is obviously not unlimited&mdash;as a country vitally interested in the future of European as well as world trade, of taking the initiative, in conjunction with other countries, in endeavouring to secure a general arrangement either <Col N="753" /> in one of these bodies or in co-operation with others, under which certain terms would be applicable to members in the hope that they would provide a permanent opportunity for improving trading arrangements, as well as the prospect of a degree of stability.</P>
    <P>The heavy adverse balance this country has had with continental countries emphasises the need to look afresh at the whole problem.  It has been our experience that these bilateral trading arrangements, while satisfactory from many aspects, have, in the main, meant that this country on average buys about four times from these countries what they buy from us.  It should also indicate to the British Government, if it is necessary, that, so far as trade with Britain is concerned, the balance is in their favour.  For many years the balance was fairly even, but last year it turned in favour of Britain.</P>
    <P>The decision to establish Córas Tráchtala was taken after an inquiry initiated by the inter-Party Government. As a result of discussions held at the time with representatives of the Marshall Aid authorities and representatives of traders and other organisations in this country, that decision was taken in the belief that initially we had to seek expansion of our exports to the dollar area.  Subsequently, the activities of CTT were extended to other countries as well.  More or less at the same time, the Government at that time initiated a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign. For that reason I welcome the announcement that another &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign is to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>It is essential that campaigns of that sort be undertaken periodically.  In the past it was regarded as something akin to patriotic duty for people to prefer goods of Irish manufacture.  It may be that because of the emphasis in recent years on internation trading and the possibility that we would become members of EEC the emphasis on giving preference to Irish goods has lessened.  For that reason it is important that the question of the dependence of employment in industry should be brought home to all sections of the community.  To that end the Government should convene meetings between the representatives of employers' <Col N="754" /> organisations and trade unions so that a joint effort will be made in regard to the problems confronting us as a result of the levy.  It should not be confined to questions of wages, salaries and conditions of work but should deal with the whole question of economic development as affected by the levy.  It may be only to a limited extent as far as certain undertakings are concerned, but united action can be taken only if there are joint consultations between the Government, the employers' organisations and the trade unions.</P>
    <P>The prospect that this levy may affect industrial development here is a serious aspect.  It may have an effect on an industrialist planning to establish new factories or contemplating expansion or further development. It has been stated that it affects the view hitherto held by outsiders that there was unlimited access to the British market.  The consequences of that may not have been fully understood or appreciated by the British Government when the decision to impose the levy was taken.  From the long-term point of view, this aspect is a serious one.  It places doubt on the availability in the future of that market.  It is to be hoped, therefore, that the statements which have been made about the British market, and given some credence by the measures introduced today, would indicate that the levy may not last longer than 12 months.  On the other hand, the fact that an interference of this sort has occurred places in jeopardy the whole prospect of our future exports to that market in view of the opportunities which existed in the past and the rights we had under the various trade agreements.</P>
    <P>The fact that these international organisations are in difficulty at present means that we should as far as possible initiate, either directly or in consultation with other countries affected, moves to secure some arrangement which would safeguard our trading interests as well as ensuring that certain sanctions would apply where breaches of these agreements take place.  The proposals announced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce will to some extent alleviate <Col N="755" /> the anxiety felt by many individuals employed by firms affected by the levy.  A great many persons have felt a great deal of concern since the levy was introduced and have obviously awaited with anxiety the proposals to remedy or alleviate the situation.</P>
    <P>It is important that, while a realistic appraisal of the situation should be made, no statements should be made blaming certain sections of the economy for any of the problems which exist.  I agree with Deputy Corish that the observations by the Minister for Transport and Power do not help in a situation of this sort. If a Minister has no direct responsibility in a matter it is better to keep out of it and to leave it to the other Ministers who have.  This is a national problem and can be dealt with only on a national basis.  It will require the united efforts of all sections whether employers or workers, whether representatives of management or representatives of trade unions, as well as the assistance which is provided directly by the State to ease if not to eliminate the difficulties which exist and so enable not merely those directly concerned but the country to weather the difficult circumstances created by the introduction of the levy and thereby safeguard the future of the economy.</P>

      <P>I should like to express my appreciation on behalf of some industries in my constituency for the ready manner in which this matter is being tackled by all sides of the House.  It is not a Party matter.  It is a matter of difficulty in which we find ourselves.  Whether or not we like it, we must remember that the only danger is the interference it will have on the industrial revival which was started in this country and which is continuing very successfully.  We are finding employment for our people today in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some ways, what has happened has been a godsend.  It will bring people to a realisation of what is happening.  Eighty per cent of our exports comprise agricultural produce &mdash;produced by the poorest paid section of our community.  There is a growing <Col N="756" /> resentment amongst our agricultural community in regard to what is coming back for the good food they are exporting.</P>
    <P>It is a scandal that we should produce and export butter at practically an uneconomic price at the expense of a subsidy from the taxpayer in order to bring back a tambourine or a flute for a pop singer.  I would advise Deputies to make an examination of this book <i>Trade and Shipping Statistics</i>.  They will be amazed to find that last year we imported pop singer's instruments at a cost of £792,745 and, again, for the first six months of this year we paid £376,835. That represents a total of £1,200,000 expended on musical instruments in the past eighteen months and paid for by the farmers' butter and the farmers' produce&mdash;80 per cent of our total exports.</P>
    <P>If you go further you will find that something like £3,076,835 was paid last year on the importation of novels, newspapers, periodicals, greeting cards, printed tickets and cheque books. From January to July of this year the sum was £1,857,000.  Surely we have enough printing premises in this country to print what we want and what bank is importing printed cheque books from England?</P>
    <P>Let us see what is happening and get some realisation of the facts.  The Minister wants £2,500,000.  What I have read out represents £5 million worth of imports.  Clap 50 per cent on them.  If a banker in this country is taking money from the Irish people and getting his cheque books printed in England then let him pay for them.</P>
    <P>I find that in the half year from January to July, 1964, £750,000 worth of English tablewear was imported. Where is the occasion for it?  In Cork, we have the Carrigaline Potteries. We also have the Arklow Potteries in Wicklow.  Anybody who was looking at television the other evening saw the beautiful things which are being produced there.  What about our balance of payments position?</P>
    <P>From January to June of this year, £780,000 worth of toys and table games were imported.  I have a very grave objection to the importation of <Col N="757" /> such articles.  I have mentioned about £6 million worth of imported stuff. How much employment would that give to our people here?  If the 15 per cent will have no other effect than to force Ministers, Government officials and the rest of them to examine the position for themselves and to see what can be pared, it will have done good.  This country has gone daft.  Fancy importing £1,200,000 worth of musical instruments. Is there any justification for it and, if so, what is the justification? Those are things we should consider.</P>
    <P>The only good thing about this breach of agreement, as we may call it, is that at least we did not agree to it and we are not in the position we found ourselves in after the 1956 Agreement when the unfortunate farmers were mulcted and their beet acreage slashed for three or four years through Ministers not knowing what they were doing.  One Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, woke up in June, 1960, to the effect of what he did in 1956 and said that it was not brought to his notice at that time that there was any breach of the 1948 Agreement.  At least this is out in the open.  I have as much respect for an agreement made with one British Government as another; I would have more respect for an agreement made with a fighting dog: at least you could give the dog a kick and he would not come back.  Those people have no respect for word, honour or anything else.  They have proved that repeatedly.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say more except to hope that when, as the Minister rightly states, taxation must be imposed to provide money, the Minister will read this book and pick out the luxury goods that are coming into this country. What is made in Ireland is not good enough now for the people of Ireland and so we have Italian shoes and other things.  If they want them, make them pay through the nose for them.  It would not take me three hours to find the full 15 per cent that is being bled out of us now in these books, without hurting anybody except those who deserve to be hurt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am doing no injustice to the Taoiseach if I say that in effect what he said was that we had relied in our economy on our exports and trade with Britain and that he had done all he could to rectify the situation resulting from the serious blow which has now hit our economy and that he had done so unsuccessfully. He proceeded to discuss generally our relations with EEC, EFTA and GATT and I do not think it would be unjust to him to say that we did not get from his speech a shred of hope that anything was likely to accrue to us in those directions.</P>
      <P>It is about five or six years since the OEEC, of which this country is a member&mdash;we subscribe to it and have representatives and advisers there&mdash; intimated to our Government that our economy was endangered by having all our eggs in one basket.  Perhaps what has happened during the past few days may bear results in the future and whoever is in a position of responsibility here may realise that it is necessary for us to diversify our trade and exports.  We are probably one of the few countries of the world in such a parlous situation that if anything goes wrong with our trade agreements with the United Kingdom, we suffer the most severe repercussions, leading to unemployment, difficulty in export trade and so on.</P>
      <P>On top of that, to cheer up the House generally, the Taoiseach, rather as an afterthought, said we ourselves were facing a balance of payments difficulty.  He let it out quietly that the sum involved was in the neighbourhood of £40 million.  Was that an indication that if what has happened had not happened, it might have been necessary to take action to rectify our own balance of payments situation? When we in the inter-Party Government were forced to do that in 1956, it brought screams from the Fianna Fáil Opposition at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to stress, that if we are to expand and increase our economy, we must do what every other country has been doing in the past five years.  I think Deputy Dillon already referred to the fact that we faced entirely different circumstances ten years ago <Col N="759" /> from what we are facing now.  It is not the first time I have suggested to the Government that they should go out and do what other countries are doing. We have a Minister who represents the Gaeltacht and who appears to me to be presiding over the obsequies of the Gaeltacht which is gradually sending its population away to build up the industry and economy in Britain, the US and other parts of the world.  It is long overdue that we should have a Minister of State or a Minister for Trade who would go out and seek trade.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is listening is aware of it but I know he had some experience in Europe at the Council of Europe before he became Minister for Industry and Commerce: I understand he has been to innumerable foreign conferences and he must be aware that trade, particularly in Europe where we must look for expansion if our trade with the United Kingdom is in jeopardy, is procurable only at political level.  I do not want to say anything against our devoted civil servants who go to international conferences and do their best to expedite the expansion of our economy but we must always remember that they have no negotiating power.  The initial negotiations in all cases must be carried out by Ministers, even though they have to be finalised and cleaned up afterwards by civil servants.</P>
    <P>That is where I indict this Government. This situation has been growing gradually; it did not arise overnight. On the Taoiseach's word this afternoon, we are facing balance of payments difficulties, and apart from any difficulties that have arisen in the trade between this country and the United Kingdom, there would surely be a situation in which the Government should realise what they were facing and should have done something about it before we reached the position in which we now find ourselves.</P>
    <P>We are now in the position that we are importing raw materials from Britain, processing and manufacturing them and exporting them back to the <Col N="760" /> United Kingdom and paying 15 per cent duty on them.  Someone should take a prolonged look at our economy. They should realise, if we are to step out of a situation in which we find ourselves, and which to a large extent we have been in over the past 30 years or so, that we should have a new economic outlook and we should have a new drive for expansion in keeping with the modern trend of events in the world.  We, in the main, rely on our agricultural exports to carry us through our trials and difficulties.  It is true to say, in the building up of our economy, that the export of our livestock is largely responsible for carrying our industries, enabling them to buy the raw materials to service such industries and to build up our economy.</P>
    <P>The position is no different from that of any other country in the world. Twenty years ago, the agricultural economy was responsible for employing an innumerable number of people. Today, where six men were employed before, we have one or two employed. Therefore, we have to diversify our rural outlook.  We have got to try to absorb into employment the people who were employed in agricultural industries before.  We can do so by the setting up of local industries and local production in some shape or form to endeavour to keep the people in the country.  That is where we have fallen down.  That is where, in spite of the glossy future the Taoiseach painted for us, we must do something to find employment for those people who were formerly employed in agriculture. We are still the only country in Europe without full employment.  We are still the only country in Europe who are sending out our people to help in the economy of other countries.</P>
    <P>It is surely time someone took a serious look at the situation.  I should like to suggest to the House that we are, as I have said before, largely dependent on the exportation of agricultural material.  We are largely dependent on the export of livestock to the United Kingdom.  The Minister will accept the fact if he has studied trade figures, that there is an ever-growing shortage of beef in Europe and everywhere <Col N="761" /> in the world and that there is an increasing demand for it.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister, if he wants to offset some of the difficulties that will face us in the industrial arena, that he concentrate on the processing of agricultural raw materials and on the processing of beef for which there is a ready and reliable market in the foreseeable future.  I would go so far as to say that there is a market for that for the next 15 or 20 years.</P>
    <P>It would have been a help to the House if the Taoiseach had something to offer, if he had some plan of campaign. The Taoiseach came in this afternoon and offered some palliatives. We have a situation now in which our economy is disorganised.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has this scheme whereby those who are affected by this surcharge will be able to get benefits by the introduction of subsidies or supports which he is prepared to give them.  He is not able to tell the House how that will work.  In fact, I am not surprised he is not able to tell the House how it will work.  He emphasises it will be complicated.  I believe it will take a great many more civil servants and involve considerable expense to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>When the Irish people read their newspapers tomorrow morning and read the statement of the Taoiseach they will realise that it boils down to this.  We have backed everything on our entry into the British market.  We have been let down by the British.  The Taoiseach is 40 years in public life and he ought to know the British Parliamentarians' expediency and that their hearts and hands are ruled by expediency.  He ought to have known that and he ought to have foreseen the present circumstances.  When the people read the papers tomorrow morning, I hope when they read through the Taoiseach's speech, they will see some measure of hope for the future and some indication of the policy.  I could not get it myself but I may be very stupid.  The Taoiseach mentioned EEC, EFTA and GATT but he did not give an indication of whether he is going to seek membership or a trade agreement. We do not want our economy to go haywire.  We should get up and do what <Col N="762" /> every other country is doing, that is, go out and look for a market.  That will stabilise our markets better than all the woolgathering by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from a city that has depended more or less on the British market because we, in Limerick, are situated within 11 miles of the industrial area at Shannon Airport. Last year, it was estimated that £1,500,000 was spent in the city of Limerick as a result of the industries which were created, built up and developed at Shannon Airport.  There are, at the moment, 2,000 workers employed at Shannon and the majority of the industries there concentrate on the export trade.  In fact eight per cent of the total Irish exports to Britain comes from Shannon Airport and, for that reason, we are particularly perturbed in Limerick in regard to the 15 per cent surcharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce that whatever liberties are granted and whatever provisions they intend to make with regard to the safeguarding of these industries, Shannon will get a particular place and that the two or three industries at Shannon which are completely dependent on the British market will get full and due consideration by the Minister.  Unfortunately there is an over amount of female labour employed there, badly paid and working hours that would not be tolerated, I imagine, in any other working area.  Some of the workers at Shannon are coming, not alone from Limerick but ten or 15 miles beyond Limerick.  In fact, some of them are coming a distance of 30 miles beyond Shannon.  The result is that employment is spread well round, not in the contiguous areas around Limerick but as far away as Cork.  I would appeal to the Minister in the considerations that will be given in the near future to whatever industries are affected by the imposition of the 15 per cent surcharge, that Shannon get a particular place and get particular recognition and consideration. Exports from Shannon now enjoy a substantially good name in England and it would be a pity and <Col N="763" /> tragic if, through the imposition of this 15 per cent, this market and the good name industrialists have in Shannon were lost and they had to start all over again to seek markets elsewhere.  I want to impress that on the Minister.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the effect of the 15 per cent on exports from the Shannon area, we have in Limerick a current period of depression in industry, particularly in the clothing industry, where we have the three leading factories of Ireland.  I imagine we employ more people in the clothing industry in Limerick than does any other area.  The advice was given in the past by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that we should produce, expand, and prepare ourselves for entry into the EEC, and these people took the Taoiseach at his word and accepted the assurance given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and increased production and expanded their industries. The result is that last week we had a severe lay-off in the clothing industry in Limerick.  One factory alone dispensed with 50 employees, all because of the fact that it is overstocked. They cannot sell what they have on hands because they expected to cater, not alone for the home trade but also for the export market.  This did not materialise and the forecast and assurances given by the Taoiseach have fallen by the board and these industries are now left facing a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said he would finance, as far as he could, the industries affected.  I wonder where the money will come from to tide these industries over this 15 per cent proposed for six or 12 months, or for God knows how long.  If we can do so by some subterfuge or another or by way of introducing a Supplementary Estimate I wonder why it was not possible to increase the meagre, miserable amount of 2/6d we gave to the old age pensioners.  It is a good thing that we should raise this money but I wonder whether these unfortunate people will be stricken again by this Supplementary <Col N="764" /> Estimate which I expect will be introduced in the near future.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say we will do this and that and that we can find millions for this and that but unfortunate people expected to live on an extra 2/6d a week are a different proposition. I hope these unfortunate recipients will not be affected by the money which is to be collected to tide us over this period.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration which the Taoiseach did not mention.  I was not in the House when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was speaking but I was surprised that the Taoiseach did not refer to these industries which have been exporting some of their surplus and who now find themselves no longer competing in the British market.  I am afraid that whatever was exported will now be dumped on the home market.  The result will be that people who already have stocks on hands will not get rid of them for the next three or four years.  I wonder what provision the Taoiseach has made to meet that emergency.  He has not mentioned it today.  I do not know whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce mentioned it or not but it is a situation that could have serious repercussions on the business life of the people of Ireland today.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not mention either that some of our Irish industries are capitalised one way or another by major industries in England.  Some of our industries in Ireland have a signed agreement and have become more or less subsidiaries of bigger industries in the same line in Great Britain.  The position, as I see it, is that while the subsidiary in Ireland will be affected the parent body in England will thrive because of the fact that we cannot send anything to them.  I wonder was this matter discussed by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce during their talks lately with the British Prime Minister?  Everybody knows the tie-up, particularly in the boot and shoe and leather trade that exists between Ireland and England. Everybody knows the tie-up also existing in the steel trade, in the manufacture of nails and screws and the tie-up <Col N="765" /> existing between the different manufacturing industries in this country and Great Britain.  But the Taoiseach never mentioned one word about that today, or that anything on those lines was discussed either by himself or the Minister for Industry and Commerce during their visit to London.  I am surprised at that.  The workers employed in these industries will be the people affected unless they take their bags and go across and work in the parent industry in England.  The board, the directors and management will not be affected.  That situation, as I see it, could have grave results as once these men go away it is hard to bring them back.  I am surprised the Taoiseach or the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not put that before the British Prime Minister.  It is elementary as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>There is another matter on which I thought the Taoiseach would have assured the House, the nation and the smaller industries in the country, namely, that he would now be prepared to make available loans or grants for the extension of the small industries. We had Deputy Dillon telling us of 30 people employed in Castleblayney and 30 more employed somewhere else.  We all know that and we all have made representations on behalf of old-established organisations employing 30, 40 or 50 men&mdash;men, mark you&mdash; for loans and grants and not one penny piece could they get even if they could prove in a <i>bona fide</i> way that their claims were just and that they needed this money for the extension of their industry or business so as to employ more male labour.</P>
    <P>Now is the time for the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce to turn their sights on that target.  They are crying out all over Ireland.  In Limerick, every time I made representations on their behalf, I was turned down; yet a German can come in and get what he wants.  It is only the man who has been established ten, 20 or 30 years who does not get help.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to impress on the Minister for Industry and Commerce the need for some kind of redundancy compensation for people <Col N="766" /> thrown out of work because of this tariff.  It would serve the double purpose of keeping workers at home and of tiding them over the next few months.  I should like to bring to the Minister's notice the terrible anxiety, fear and dread among workers in Limerick because of this tariff.  Many of them are employed at Shannon and have saddled themselves with SDA payments and other financial commitments. They are now in absolute jeopardy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take up Deputy Corish's interjection, his reference to a body blow.  He is trying to quote the Taoiseach but he is misquoting him. What the Taoiseach said was that this might be a body blow to our economy. I agree with him: it might be but it need not be, and, if we have any courage or real ability, it will not be. <Col N="767" /> It rests in our hands whether it is or is not.  The Taoiseach, in his introduction of the Supplementary Estimate this afternoon, did not produce the tale of woe Deputy Esmonde related. He faced facts fairly and squarely.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not say we were in a serious balance of payments difficulty. What he said was that he had pointed out to the British Prime Minister that we also had a balance of payments problem.  That is something we have known all along: it did not arise last week or the week before. It was clearly forecast in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> that a period of imbalance in our payments had to be faced.  That is inevitable in an expanding economy, so no one has been taken by surprise except the members of the Opposition who have not read the Programme or, if they have, prefer to forget it.  There was nothing defeatist in what the Taoiseach said today.  The only defeatism has come from the Opposition Benches.  This is no time for preaching woe and disaster.  It is a time of challenge which may very well be to our ultimate advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should make up his mind as to whether he is happy or not.  Let us look at a British importer.  British importers of Irish goods have selected this country as their supplier for four reasons, one of which is not love of dear old Ireland. We have been selected simply for hard economic reasons, under four headings. First, they want our goods because the material is what they require&mdash;good material; secondly, they want good design; thirdly, they want good delivery dates; and fourthly, they want a reasonable price.</P>
      <P>These are the four considerations which influence any British importer in selecting goods from this country. Only one of those points has in any way been disturbed, that is, price. Much of our industrial production going to Britain is in the form of small units&mdash;boots, shoes, clothing apparel and so on.  The actual increase in price on a pair of shoes will be, comparatively speaking, very slight, and I believe our industrialists will be able and willing, in their own interests and in the interests of the country generally, to cut back slightly on their profit margins in order to bridge the gap between the previous price and that which will rule now under the new tariff conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is every evidence in the British economy that most of the factories there are working at full production. They will find it quite impossible to satisfy the sector of the British home market which they have not been supplying up to now.  Consequently, I do not see any immediate danger of any set-back to our economy here. If there is any reduction in orders, it will not come for two or three months.  No reputable British company &mdash;and most of these importers are <Col N="769" /> reputable people&mdash;will consider cancelling orders due for delivery at the end of October, November or December. These importers would normally be ordering three or four months in advance and will now not be able to cancel these orders.  Therefore, the problem will, to a large extent, be theirs initially.</P>
    <P>They have elected that Government and that is their worry; but, I believe that these importers will be prepared to make some effort to keep their prices down by cutting their own profit margins as well and it is for that reason that the Taoiseach made it perfectly clear that the support which could be granted in suitable cases would be only 50 per cent of the amount necessary to keep the prices of our goods exactly the same in future as they have been in the past.</P>
    <P>I believe that Irish industry is well able to meet this challenge.  I have much more confidence in Irish industry than members of the Opposition have. I have no respect for any industrialist who panics in a situation like this and starts letting his employees go. When you get people like Deputy Coughlan coming in and blaming the Taoiseach for this happening, I think things have come to a pretty pass altogether; and when he goes on to say that an industrialist in his area has overstocked with material, and blames the Taoiseach for that, I say that that is rank bad production planning, rank bad market investigation, rank bad salesmanship.  That is all there is to it and any man who gets himself into that position has only himself to blame and I do not think he should expect, and I certainly do not think he should get, any support or any consideration from the State if he finds himself in that sort of difficulty.</P>
    <P>I believe that we will survive this challenge without too much difficulty at all.  I do not anticipate that the amount of support which will be necessary from State funds will be anything extraordinarily large.  I sincerely hope it will be comparatively small.  The main thing which we have got to get <Col N="770" /> out from this House today is that this House is united in its support for any measures which the Government may take to help industry which deserves help but it has been to my mind a tragedy that there has been such alarmist talk from the Opposition benches.  That is no credit to the Parties concerned.  It will not give them any Party advantage but it might do grave damage to the national economy and to the national morale. I would hope that we would get a unanimous vote in favour of this Estimate and that the country would feel there is no panic in this House, not just on the Government benches but that there is no panic on the Opposition benches and that in this moment of difficulty we will all co-operate to get out not only as well off as we went in but even better.</P>
    <P>All these challenges are opportunities and nothing more and any businessman knows it.  If you are in business, if things are too easy you will go to seed.  It is only when things become a little bit difficult, when the unexpected turns up, that a businessman shows what he is really made of. I have the same confidence in our people as the Chairman of the Exporters' Association has in his own members and he is a man who knows what he is talking about.  There is no question of our exporters in the past making exorbitant or excessive profits. I think their profit margins have always been small enough but there is sometimes a need for squeezing a little more as a temporary measure and, with the co-operation which I have every expectation will be forthcoming, I do not think this will be a load on the community.</P>
    <P>Therefore, let us consider this issue as a national business in which we can all join together without feeling we are letting our own side down.  There is no question of Party advantage arising whatsoever.  The Taoiseach has made his view clear as he made it clear to the British Prime Minister.  He has also looked forward to the future.  Some of the Opposition speakers, particularly <Col N="771" /> Deputy Esmonde, appeared to be confused as to what he said.  He was perfectly clear to anyone listening to him. He did look forward to a new trade agreement with Great Britain and he also made it perfectly clear that the main reason for that was that the present agreement was an obstacle to our entry into GATT.  He was perfectly clear on that.  He was not trying to whitewash anything.  He also stated that it should be a means towards securing for us better trading relations and expansion of trade generally with Great Britain at the same time, but the main objection to the present agreement, apart from its having been broken, was that it was an obstacle to our entry into GATT and as a small country it is essential that we should have the backing of an international organisation which will ensure that agreements to which we are a party are properly kept.</P>
    <P>We are in a vulnerable position if we have just a bilateral agreement between Great Britain and ourselves. Up to now we believed that such an agreement would be strictly upheld by both parties.  It has been a shock to us to find that a Government in difficulties, as the British Government find themselves, have seen fit to break that agreement.  I do not think anyone could have forecast that.  Personally, I do not believe for a moment that the situation in Great Britain is half as serious as the present British Government make it out to be.  I think there is a lot of Party politics involved in all this and that the picture is being painted far more black than it really is. I suppose it is almost inevitable that a Government that have just scraped into power with such a narrow majority after a long period in the political wilderness are in a fairly desperate situation but I do not believe that the British economy is tottering towards disaster.  I would venture to forecast that it will not be more than five, or six months at the most, before the cry goes out from the Cabinet in Westminster that by reason of the resolute steps which have been taken for the protection of the British economy everything has now been <Col N="772" /> rescued from disaster and the green light is switched on again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be.  I think it will not be long before the green light is switched on.  I do not believe that, even while the red light is on at the moment, we have any reason to panic or to run away.</P>
      <P>I would hope that the message going from this House to the nation would be: We are facing a period of some difficulty but nothing which is insuperable.  We are facing a situation which we can deal with by resolute cooperative action and by taking that action, joining all together, we will be able not only to maintain our economy but to go forward in a way which in our wildest dreams we have never dared to hope for.  We can do it and I believe we will.  Any Opposition Deputy who gets up to say the contrary is doing a very bad day's work for the country.  I am not asking anyone to adjust the facts to his own convenience. I am not doing that myself. I am not asking anyone to cloud the facts at all.  I think the facts speak for themselves and are not nearly as grim as some people would like them to appear to be.</P>
      <P>I feel that the bill which will eventually be presented for payment will not be large.  It would be very nice if we could have spent the money on something else but I believe that in the end it will prove a very wise investment and that when we do get a new agreement with Great Britain at least the British Government will have learned the lesson that the breaking of international agreements is not a wise thing and should never be repeated and we will also have got the protection of GATT which we do not enjoy at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I think this will present us with a new challenge to end forever our almost exclusive dependence on the British market.  I hope it will encourage our industrialists to search Europe and further overseas for new markets.  Our materials are excellent. Our design is improving very <Col N="773" /> rapidly.  Our labour is becoming better trained.  Our rate of productivity has increased.  These are things which must be said because so many people prefer to think the opposite.  The facts speak for themselves.  Irish industry is progressing and can compete in any market.</P>
    <P>I am absolutely satisfied that this is not a disaster.  I do not really believe it will be a serious setback but only on condition that everyone puts his shoulder to the wheel, gives a good strong shove and makes sure we have no divisive elements whatsoever among us.  The Opposition can make a useful contribution here or can become merely destructive.  They have been very destructive today but I hope that is the end of it and that from now on they, too, will put their shoulders to the wheel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech made by Deputy Booth was both ill-advised and ill-timed for two reasons. First, he offers comment on British politics.  He offers comment as to whether or not the British people were right to change the Government, and makes reference to the slender majority which the new Government enjoys in Britain.  Secondly, he says that the Opposition have not offered anything constructive but have adopted a destructive role in this matter.</P>
      <P>The last speaker must have a very short memory because Deputies who have spoken here this evening have reminded him and the House that during the term of the inter-Party Government, in 1956, when this country had a very serious balance of payments problem to be tackled, the Fianna Fáil Party, when they were in opposition, did not deal with it in the same spirit as they are now asking the Opposition to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil always seem to want the confidence of the House and the country and to get the full support of the Opposition in every line they take whenever a difficulty arises when they are in office but when they are out of office, they are always prepared to take advantage of whatever Government are in office, and even though the difficulties may not be of the <Col N="774" /> making of that Government, Fianna Fáil are always prepared to put the blame on their shoulders.</P>
    <P>This Party has taken the patriotic line in regard to this problem and no matter what Deputy Booth may think or say in this House, the members of this Party realise that this is a serious problem for the country.  It is a serious problem for the industrial workers and for the manufacturers.  It is not a problem from which any one Party has anything to gain or wants to gain anything.  It is a problem that calls for the support and co-operation of every Party and of everyone in this House. I am quite satisfied that this problem with which the Government now finds themselves confronted is one on which they will have the backing of the House.  The evidence of that is the fact that no Deputy has spoken against this Estimate.</P>
    <P>Why are the members of the House supporting this Estimate?  Because we believe in Irish industry.  No matter what may have been said in the past about Irish industry and Irish manufacture, we can produce in this country an article for export that can stand second to none in any part of the world.  We on this side of the House do not deny that fact.  On the contrary, we take credit for the first industrial seeds sown in this country.  In a debate such as this, it should be borne in mind that successive Ministers for Industry and Commerce from the time the State was founded have played their part in the establishment of industries and in industrial expansion. That was continued by the Fianna Fáil Government when they were elected in 1932 and by the inter-Party Government of 1948.  The evidence of the interest of those Governments in Irish industry was the setting up by the inter-Party Government of the Industrial Development Authority.  The Taoiseach, who was in opposition at the time, offered serious criticism to the setting up of that Authority.  His opposition was so fierce at the time that he said the moment he got back into office he would repeal the legislation. He got into office but he did not repeal it.  On the contrary, he continued on exactly the same lines as <Col N="775" /> were initiated at the establishment of the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>Again we see that from this side of the House a very useful contribution was made to Irish industry by the late Deputy Norton as Minister for Industry and Commerce and there is clear evidence that this side of the House was keenly interested in Irish industry. When Deputy Sweetman was Minister for Finance his policy was to grant certain financial concessions to industrialists to assist them in setting up industries for the purpose of providing employment and for the purpose of manufacturing goods for the export market.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, ridiculous for Fianna Fáil to claim that they are the only Party who have any interest in Irish industry.  Irish industry is the concern of every Irish Parliament and Government and of every Irish man and woman.  That is why every Deputy is standing behind the Government in relation to this problem.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce explained a few moments ago to the House that before the British general election Mr. Maudling had stated there was a balance of payments problem to be tackled but that Mr. Maudling left over the problem until after the election.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce knew the difficulties that faced Mr. Maudling at that time, why did he not immediately sit down and endeavour to foresee what steps would be taken by Mr. Maudling to rectify the balance of payments problem if he were re-elected to office; on the other hand, if there was a change of Government in Britain, as there was, what action would the new Government take to rectify the balance of payments problem because it was a matter that had to be tackled and tackled courageously by a new Government?</P>
    <P>Mr. Maudling made it clear that a problem existed in Britain and would have to be tackled.  Due notice was thereby given to this country and the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us tonight that he was aware of the position.  The Government should have <Col N="776" /> considered what possible measures would be taken by Britain to rectify the balance of payments position in that country but, apparently, our Government sat motionless until the new British Prime Minister announced the measures to be taken, and without any prior notice.</P>
    <P>It should be made clear, and we have made it clear in the country, that this Party are extremely sorry that the results of the negotiations between the Taoiseach, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the British Prime Minister were not more favourable. They received good wishes on their mission and, naturally enough, no embarrassment was caused by this Party: no comment was made by the Leader of this Party beyond offering his best wishes for the success of the delegation.</P>
    <P>It should, I think, be pointed out for record purposes that the present Government never had good negotiating ability with the British Government such as the Cumann na nGaedheal and the inter-Party Government had.  There is clear evidence that on every occasion these Governments went to Britain to negotiate, they returned with something gained for this country, bringing back an agreement which meant more money going into the pockets of the people or increased markets for Irish products. The 1948 Trade Agreement, which dealt with agricultural products, resulted in putting millions into the pockets of Irish farmers.  At a later stage we had the sorry spectacle of the former Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture going over to Britain to negotiate and coming back with less than he had when he was going.</P>
    <P>It is only right these things should be put on record.  Because of the poor negotiating ability of the Government, I think our industrialists, our manufacturers and the people generally were not expecting a great measure of success.  The record is not a very good one.  Nevertheless they had our good wishes and we are extremely sorry they did not do better.  The very least they should have been able to negotiate was the same facilities as we <Col N="777" /> gave British imports in 1956 when we had a balance of payments problem in this country.  The Taoiseach had a strong weapon in his hand and, no matter how bad the British balance of payments problem may be, ours was just as bad in 1956.  There should, therefore, have been reciprocity on the part of Britain in her crisis and I, for one, believed the Taoiseach would not come back without the same concessions at least as this country gave Britain in 1956.</P>
    <P>We must face facts now and the fact is this 15 per cent may be in operation for a year, or longer, for all we know. It may not be in operation for a year. Irish industries are asked to face the challenge.  I have every confidence that Irish industrialists and Irish manufacturers will meet the challenge with both credit and distinction and with the full co-operation of the trade unions.  The trade union movement is perhaps one of the greatest movements in this or any other country.  I believe every single citizen will respond to the appeal to &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; and use to the fullest extent possible Irish manufactured goods.</P>
    <P>What has prompted me to speak tonight is the fact that I represent a highly industrialised constituency, Laois-Offaly.  We have some of the finest industries in the country in that constituency.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce will, I am sure, bear in mind the difficulties of every branch of Irish industry but, as Deputy Coughlan said earlier, he should have special regard to the boot and shoe industry. That industry should have special care and special attention.  Recently the factory in Birr got an order for 5,000 pairs of shoes and boots from Little-woods of Liverpool for delivery next January.  Let us hope such orders will not now be cancelled.  I am glad that, as a result of the Estimate which has been introduced, and which we support, it will be possible for orders of this kind to be met.  Had this Estimate not been introduced, I am convinced this industry in Birr would be faced with redundancy in a very short time and good operatives would be likely to leave the industry if there were short time.  In my opinion, that would have <Col N="778" /> a very serious effect on the industry generally.</P>
    <P>We have another shoe factory in Edenderry.  That factory exports approximately 40 per cent of their output to the United Kingdom.  Their biggest export line is &ldquo;Hush Puppies&rdquo;. They are exported to the British Shoe Corporation.  That body has its own factories in Britain and the argument is why should they pay more for &ldquo;Hush Puppies&rdquo; manufactured in Edenderry when they can manufacture them in their own factories without any levy.  &ldquo;Hush Puppies&rdquo; are a very profitable export line, an export industry in which it would be impossible to carry anything like the 15 per cent levy for any length of time.  There are 420 workers employed in this industry and I feel the measures being taken under this Supplementary Estimate may partially solve their difficulties.</P>
    <P>Another industry in my constituency with which I am gravely concerned, is the moquette manufacturing industry in Birr which also gives very good employment.  They are exporting moquette to the value of some £40,000 to £60,000 per annum to Britain, a figure which represents one quarter of their total sales.  In recent times this firm has endeavoured to purchase new machinery and plant with a view to extending and expanding in every way possible.  They have organised their export sales arrangements and the levy would certainly be a very serious blow to the industry.  The action contemplated by the Government will certainly help in some way to remove their difficulties.  This moquette industry is one of the finest not alone in Ireland but in Europe. There is first-class management; there are highly skilled operatives, and their product is regarded as probably the best in that line that can be produced in any part of the world.</P>
    <P>We have in Tullamore the firm of Salts (Ireland) Limited, and in Portlaoise we have the Irish Worsted Mills, which manufacture textiles and worsteds.  This industry gives employment to hundreds of workers and is the main source of employment for practically every family in those areas. I have already given the facts to the <Col N="779" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce. The export of cloth and made-up garments is something we greatly value, something which gives substantial and profitable employment, and no matter what money is asked for in this Estimate, this House will gladly give it to maintain the steady employment at good wages, being given by woollen, worsted and textile industries.  Again we can see that the greater part of their export trade is to the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I should like to direct the attention of the Minister to the need for assisting in every possible way the jute industry.  We have a very successful jute industry in Clara, Offaly, and also one in Waterford.  This industry is probably one of the best known in the world.  It is also one of the best managed industries in any part of the world and provides substantial employment. In Clara, it provides employment for approximately 600 people and if there were redundancy or short time in that industry, it would have a very serious effect on the town as a whole.  Another industry with which I am concerned is Erisinn Peat Products, Ltd., Birr, where they manufacture peat pots and their largest market is the British market.  Peat pots are also manufactured in Scotland and without the import levy, it would be difficult enough for the Birr industry to compete. Therefore, I hope the Minister for Industry and Commerce will bear in mind the competition which this industry has to face from Scotland in the British market, and constantly review the situation with a view to maintaining a full measure of employment in that industry, which is managed in a very creditable manner and operated by skilled workers.  Another industry is the firm of Peerage (Ireland) Limited which is also in Birr.  This industry was extending and was about to seek markets abroad.  There is ample scope for their products on the British market and again I would ask the Minister to bear this in mind, because of the very useful volume of employment given locally.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in conjunction with the Taoiseach, should utilise to the <Col N="780" /> fullest possible extent the officials in our embassies abroad to obtain new trade.  An example of what can be done was given by Messrs. D.E. Williams of Tullamore when Mr. Williams, who is one of our leading industrialists, visited the USA and elsewhere and, as a result, the sales of Irish Mist and of Irish whiskey have gone up considerably.  The Tullamore whiskey can be described as being the best quality Irish whiskey and is known throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Those are just a few of the industries in which I am personally interested, particularly in regard to the workers, and that is why I agree with the Government in any action they may take to safeguard fulltime employment in these industries.  If there should be redundancy, half-time, or short-time, it will be the duty of the Government to compensate the workers who may lose their employment as a result of this levy, or as a result of conditions which are not brought about through any fault of theirs and which will be outside the control of the Government.</P>
    <P>When private industry can compensate for redundancy, what is to stop the State from doing likewise?  I recall when the maltings at Mountmellick closed in 1939, when Messrs. Arthur Guinness withdrew their contract from the maltings, the firm of Guinness gave the workers very substantial sums of money to compensate them for their loss of employment.  I am sure the memory of the Taoiseach is sufficiently good to recall this because he received a deputation at the time.  He may have forgotten it but he was Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time and was extremely helpful.  It was the first time I saw the Taoiseach and he was extremely sympathetic to the pleas made in regard to the closing of that industry.</P>
    <P>I want to say that I have every faith in Irish industry and every faith in every industry in my constituency.  I know the value of those industries and how they provide full-time and profitable employment.  It is to the credit of all the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce that Irish industry has reached the stage it has <Col N="781" /> reached today.  I do not see that we have any reason to complain about the state of Irish industry.  I believe in Irish industry.  I am convinced it will overcome this difficulty, the same as it overcame difficulties in the past.  We must have faith in ourselves.  It does not sound sensible to hear the Taoiseach having to ask people to buy their own goods.  Surely our people ought to be sufficiently public-spirited not to have to be asked to buy Irish? That ought to be part of good citizenship.</P>
    <P>For some reason or other we in this country always felt our goods were not as good as those from abroad.  All they had to do was to send over a poorer quality article with a different label and, according to our people, it was a far better article than the Irish one.  Nothing is further from the truth. Our products are as good if not better than any in the world.  I do not think there is any need to solicit the support of the unions for this campaign, because every worker knows the highly skilled staffs engaged in industry and the top quality of the products.  Is it not strange that after 40 years of native government we have to urge our people to be sufficiently patriotic to buy the goods made in their own country by their own fellow workers, goods which have stood the test of markets abroad?  When we see Irish goods of every description holding their own on the British market against world competition, it ought to be sufficient evidence of their quality to win for them the support of our own people.  Our people have a duty to buy Irish, to wear Irish, to eat Irish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a fine new mineral water factory in Birr. <Col N="782" /> We have one in Portlaoise and one in Tullamore.  They are under first-class management, give good employment and produce the best product.  Our industrialists have nothing to fear.  If they can produce a product which gains recognition abroad, I do not see what they have to fear.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Booth when he says that manufacturers should try to cut their profits.  They cannot be expected to do so when they have high overheads to meet.  If the Department were to investigate the profits Deputy Booth wants cut, I believe the manufacturers could show that their profits are extremely slender and would not warrant any reduction whatever.  The imposition of the 15 per cent levy has caused worry and anxiety amongst all those industrialists. Surely, on top of that, it would be unfair to ask them to bear any loss as a result of the problem that has arisen.</P>
      <P>I want to say something now about the industries in the constituency of Deputy Coughlan and Deputy O'Donnell&mdash;the industries in Shannon. They are a credit to this country.  I was tremendously impressed by them, because I saw the number of workers employed there.  When I see workers gainfully employed, I am quite satisfied. I would much prefer to see them working in Shannon than working in various cities in Britain.  I was impressed by the work undertaken by Mr. O'Regan and the energetic board, who deserve credit for the initiative they showed and the volume of employment they are giving.  That should go on record.  We should try to encourage those industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one problem I would refer to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Industries have been set up in recent years with substantial aid from the Government. Some of them are now competing with industries that had to be set up without one penny of the taxpayers' money.  I had intended raising this matter on the Control of Manufactures Bill, and I will raise it on that when the time comes.  I would ask the Minister to keep under review the position where a company set up with <Col N="783" /> State aid tried to capture the markets of an industry solely financed by the company itself.  Surely those companies which have stood on their own feet and have been no liability on the State should be given some preference over industries that had to be subsidised to a great extent by the State? I would not like to see subsidised industries putting out of business <Col N="784" /> industries that were established by the hard work, savings and investment of private citizens, who did not call on the Government for a penny to assist them.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
