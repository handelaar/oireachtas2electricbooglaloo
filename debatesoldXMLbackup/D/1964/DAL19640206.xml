      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was dealing with the quantity of work to be done in reorganising and completing our educational system and the amount of money which must be spent to achieve that.  We have to make a thorough study of the present situation, discover the gaps in our system, and the future needs of the areas in which the Government must be prepared to take action.  All this will involve a large expenditure and, because of that, the matter must be studied carefully.  It is, in fact, being studied carefully at the moment.  This is being done by a national team, the members of which are carrying out a survey and who will report this year.  The title under which they are operating is &ldquo;Total Investment in Education in Co-operation with OECD&rdquo;.  The Commission on Higher Education have almost finished their deliberations.  They expect to report this year.  When we have the reports and recommendations from these two groups, we should have signposted quite clearly the direction in which our educational planning must go, the amount of money which will have to be spent, and the manner of its distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, as I have said, we have taken into our own hands the planning of what was obviously necessary. I did this by announcing last May a plan for post-primary education which, when fully in operation, will, I imagine, fill up many of the gaps in our system at the moment.  Since last May, two committees have been working <Col N="505" /> in the Department on the details. One has been working out revised programmes in the various curricula and the other is carrying out surveys of the areas in which comprehensive schools may be sited.</P>
    <P>The Programme Planning Committee is far advanced.  This planning involves planning for a new examination at the present intermediate certificate level which will be open to students from not alone secondary schools but from comprehensive and vocational schools as well.  It will be, if you like, a comprehensive examination with a common core of subjects to which students may, according to their aptitudes and abilities, add subjects which are not at the moment on the intermediate certificate course.  Planning, therefore, involves new curricula to suit and embrace the present secondary school programme, changes in the present vocational school programme, a lengthening of that programme by a year instead of the present two-year course, and a complete new idea in the form of the comprehensive schools to deal with the whole lot within their own walls.</P>
    <P>The other committee have reached the stage where preliminary negotiations with the local interests involved have been entered into in regard to the placing and organisation of the comprehensive schools in certain areas. That comprehensive examination and curriculum will deal with the schoolchild up to the age of 15 to 16 years. The course for that examination will probably be a three-year course and the examination will be taken at from 15 to 16 years.  There will be some who will not normally want to go further, but the educational openings for those who wish to go forward will be the academic type of course now available in secondary schools to the Leaving Certificate level.</P>
    <P>There will have to be a change on the technical side because we do not have a corresponding limb in our vocational technical courses.  A new involvement, therefore, will be a technical Leaving Certificate examination with a course leading to it.  That will be for students in the 16 to 18 years range.  This technical Leaving Certificate <Col N="506" /> would be itself a means by which a student could get on to a higher technological course, whether in a higher technological college or a university.  This extra technical course will be carried out mainly in new regional technical colleges.  As I told the House yesterday, I visualise at the moment about ten of these colleges. In addition to the two centres in Dublin and the centres in Cork and Limerick, I mentioned Waterford, Galway, Dundalk, Sligo, Athlone and Carlow as places which seem to me suitable. They seem suitable to me because of the results of the surveys we have carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say whether the technical Leaving Certificate will be sufficient for matriculation as the present Leaving Certificate is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be.  There was a suggestion last night by Deputy Colley that this would be a broadly based examination, and I intend to give serious consideration to that.  I would hope that in that type of technological subject anyway it would be accepted for matriculation purposes as an entrance to the university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether these new technological colleges will be residential or whether provision will be made for transport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements will have to be made for students from outside places to stay near the college.  Whether this would be done in the way universities do it or whether there would be special residences attached&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be done that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the comprehensive schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>They are day schools. It is intended they would drain an area of ten square miles by the use of daily transport.  Deputy Dillon suggested that, instead of this comprehensive school with a ten mile drainage area, we should have a parish school.  The <Col N="507" /> idea of the ten miles was to get a sufficient number of students into the school to warrant the employment of a sufficient number of teachers so that we could have a wide range of subjects. The number of subjects you can teach will depend on the number of teachers you can employ.  This is directly related to the number of students coming in, and I do not think a parish school would be capable of giving the wide range of subjects to allow the aptitude of the pupils to be satisfied.</P>
      <P>As well as this planning which has been continuing on a broad basis, the House is aware that at a higher level the university science block at Belfield is well under way and it is expected to open this year.  For those who thought it was unnecessary, I should like to say it is just about on time to prevent a crisis in the university arising from the pressure of the number of students.  These are the things that have been done while we are awaiting for the study groups to report.</P>
      <P>The Dáil also passed a scholarship scheme which increased the number of opportunities for students by 300 per cent and also the opportunities to attend the university.  This was necessary because it is bound to take some time before you can develop a comprehensive educational system where everybody will get an opportunity.  In the secondary schools the last year or so has seen the revision of the physics course and of physics and chemistry, which is a separate subject, and botany.  In fact, all branches of science for Leaving Certificate level have been modernised.  Next year it is intended that a modernised mathematics course will be introduced on a five-year experimental basis.  Recognition has been given to language teachers for service in Continental countries. As I told the Dáil already, a language laboratory is being established in Gormanston for research work and the training of teachers in Continental languages and in Irish.  These improvements have been going on on the secondary side while awaiting larger developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken some notes of points <Col N="508" /> made by Deputies during the debate and I will deal with them now.  I think I have covered the broad basis of the general plan.  I hope nobody will say now that the plan was either produced for a by-election and that nothing has been done about it since.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree it is still fairly nebulous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>What is possible to be done has been done.  It is inherent in educational planning that you have to do a lot of paperwork and curriculum work, especially with comprehensive schools with new types of buildings and new types of courses and control. These are the time-consuming and the difficult things to arrange.  The actual building is much quicker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I still have a very dim understanding of what a comprehensive school will be.  Will it be a kind of technical school with a secondary edge to it or will it be a secondary school with a technical edge to it?  What will go on in the comprehensive school? Who will run it?  Will it be like a national school with a headmaster appointed?  Who will appoint the headmaster? What will be the courses in the comprehensive school?  Will they be English, French, Irish, German, Spanish, geography, mathematics, science, engineering?  What programme will the comprehensive school offer? What are the differences between a comprehensive school, a secondary school, a technical school and a primary school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Who will appoint the headmaster, for instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with the whole matter.  One must think in terms of a comprehensive course and a comprehensive examination.  My intention is to bring the vocational and secondary subjects, which are now in two separate compartments, together and make the vocational course, which is a two-year course with a certificate examination, a three-year course with an examination, which would be equal, both in its own merit and in the minds <Col N="509" /> of the people, to the secondary course. This can be done by arranging the curriculum and the examination and allowing the vocational schools, on the one hand, to run a course and choose the subjects suited to them with a central core of subjects which is common to both schools, Irish, English and mathematics, for instance and, on the other hand, allowing the secondary schools to choose the type of subjects they require.</P>
      <P>In certain areas of the country, there is no secondary school and no prospect of having a secondary school, and no vocational school.  In those areas I thought a comprehensive school should be set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of a secondary or technical school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Combined.  It would be all the subjects normally done in both the secondary and the vocational schools.  I visualise it being managed by a committee of three, a representative of the local religious, a Catholic bishop or a Protestant bishop, a representative of the Vocational Educational Committee and a representative of the Minister for Education.  The school would have a headmaster naturally.</P>
      <P>The range of subjects would be all the subjects now done in a secondary school, all the subjects now done in a vocational school with some extra subjects which are not done in either except in the very big secondary schools.  It is intended to have 24 or 25 subjects to give a sufficient range so that a child who is inclined towards the academic could follow what we normally think of as a secondary education, and a child who is inclined towards science could follow a stream where the stress is on mathematics and scientific subjects, all the time having the common core of essential subjects so that there would not be an imbalance.  A child whose aptitudes are in his hands could take, say, metal work as a subject at this common intermediate certificate examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To have that many subjects would require a large number of teachers and the lowest number of pupils that would warrant that number of teachers would be between 150 and 400.  To get that <Col N="510" /> many pupils it would be necessary to go ten miles on every side of the school.  This, of course, implies transport.</P>
    <P>In the first year when students would come in there would be great differences in aptitudes and intelligence, different types of intelligence.  Therefore, in the first year special services would be needed.  I have already set in train the establishment of a psychological service with the Department of Education.  In the first year students would be guided into the subjects for their second year.  As I told the House last night, I intend to establish tests which will be developed to suit our own types of intelligence.  At the end of three years it should be possible to advise students which type of course they should follow after that, and which subjects they should take in the examination.  That is the general idea of the comprehensive schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be technical schools with a full secondary programme incorporated in their curriculum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be both technical and secondary with a little bit more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>An extended curriculum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>With a choice of streams to be followed.  It cannot be said it will be a large vocational school with a secondary course.  It will have both what the secondary and the vocational schools can offer under the one roof and it will allow a student to take subjects from either course as he wishes and if he is able to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have answered many questions last night and this morning but when I was dealing with primary education I intended to deal with something to which Deputy Declan Costello referred, that is, the education of handicapped children.  He has a special interest in one type of handicapped child, the retarded child, but there are many other handicaps, blindness, deafness, and so on, and there are 37 special schools in operation for handicapped children.  I agree a great deal remains to be done.  It is very <Col N="511" /> heartening for me in relation to what is being done and what remains to be done to refer to the splendid work which is being done by large numbers of voluntary workers in that field.  As Minister for Education, I wish to thank them on behalf of the public.  Deputy Costello himself is very active in that field.  I think he will agree that neither the Department of Education nor myself have been lacking in co-operating with them and giving them all the help we can.</P>
    <P>There does remain the point referred to by Deputy T. Lynch, distinguishing between the function of the Minister for Health and that of the Minister for Education in relation to the mentally handicapped child as determined by the degree of handicap.  At the moment there is a loose definition of the educable child.  The teaching of such children comes under the Ministry of Education. The more severely handicapped children, and children in need of hospital care, come under the Department of Health.  A commission, set up by the Minister for Health, is studying this problem, and it is a real problem, and in the meantime, as I say, those children who can benefit by schooling have the enthusiastic help of these voluntary bodies and the co-operation of the Department of Education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister turns from that topic, has he had time to consider the problem of the slow child in the primary school who would greatly benefit if it were possible to give him special attention rather than trying to deal with him on the basis of the average child?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy means the child in the normal class. That depends on the pupil-teacher ratio being improved.  If the class is big, the teacher will not have a chance to give special help to the child, but with the removal of the marriage ban, and the extension of the building of training colleges, we are getting more teachers available each year.  Each year it has been possible to make an improvement in the teacher-pupil ratio. <Col N="512" /> It is a matter of having smaller classes so that the teacher can give more time to the slow child.  For the past couple of years St. Patrick's Training College has had special courses for trained teachers in teaching the retarded child. In this way we are adding each year to the number of specially trained teachers for dealing with special classes of retarded children.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether I should refer to this next matter.  It is hardly worth while.  A body was referred to here last night, the Federation of Irish Secondary Schools.  Deputy O'Donnell had a document produced by them, and he asked me to pay particular attention to it.  I dealt with that here before.  I was accused last night of having a vendetta with this group.  That is not so.  They may have a vendetta with me, but I am not troubled about them.  I am bothered by their title. They are an unrecognised group and they used the title of the Catholic Lay Headmasters Association.  They represent about ten per cent of the secondary schools.  Deputies were under the impression that they represented all the secondary schools, and that error has also been in the newspapers commenting on some of their statements.  They do not represent what their name would suggest.</P>
      <P>As regards the document which Deputy O'Donnell had, I understand the authors of that document have already been told by an expert in the field of economic investment that it cannot be a basis for anything relating to research in that field.  I do not want to take anything away from the amount of energy they have expended, but investment in education is a very specialised subject.  We have this OECD team headed by Mr. Patrick Lynch, the economist, and supported by a statistician, another highly trained man.  By the time they have finished, they will have spent two years studying, with the resources and co-operation of OECD and the Department of Education.  They will publish statistical information and a general plan of investment in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any document produced, even by the most enthusiastic <Col N="513" /> people, without the services of such qualified people, and without the support of an international organisation, can be regarded as being as useful as a specialist report.  That does not stop them from publishing documents and using this name.  I have no vendetta with them.  When I became Minister for Education, they claimed they were a partner of the Department. They were taking more of the time of my officials than I was, under the guise of being a partner, and I had to ask them to stop.  If they regard that as a vendetta, they are welcome to do so.</P>
    <P>My only motive in mentioning this is to let the House know that they do not represent what their name suggests and that the work they purport to do is being done by a national team, in co-operation with OECD.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the national team will hear and consider the representations of this body of Catholic laymen engaged in educational research. It is praiseworthy for them to formulate their views and bring them before the Minister and public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to take from them, but many things in the document were misleading.  I dealt with this matter on the Estimate last year and I am reluctant to say any more in case I might add weight to the suggestion that there is a vendetta, but it would be unwise to act or to base any opinion in regard to our educational system, or prospects, on the figures they have produced.  It will not be long before we will have a full and thorough report from the team who are well-equipped to produce it.  I admire their energy and I do not say they should not do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley said the question of Irish was mixed with education, to the detriment of education.  I presume more will be said about the report of the Commission, but there are certain things I have to say again.  One is the question of compulsory teaching through Irish.  I do not know of any such thing as compulsory teaching <Col N="514" /> through Irish.  I said that before, and I suppose I shall have to say it again. The use of Irish in schools was intended to be the practice in the oral use of the language which is the best way to learn it.  It may have happened because of over-enthusiasm, but it was never intended, that Irish was used to the detriment of education.</P>
    <P>About four years ago, or maybe three years, I sent a circular, to which Deputy Dillon referred, to the school managers.  It was not anything secret. I did not shove it under the door and say: &ldquo;Do not tell anyone,&rdquo; as Deputy Dillon suggested.  I mentioned it in the Dáil almost at the same time.  The circular was long, but it was long for the reason that it was in two languages, English and Irish.  It told the teachers that in the junior classes the language of instruction should be selected by the teacher himself, having regard to the ability of the class to learn and his ability to teach through that language.  If the teacher thought he could teach and the class could learn through the medium of Irish, then he should teach through that medium.  If he thought they could not do that, then he should do it through the other language.  This is not a change: it was never intended that Irish should be taught to the detriment of everything else.  It may be that over-enthusiastic teachers may have used Irish as a medium but it was not intended that way.  The use of Irish in the classroom was intended for those who already used it to improve their fluency while at the same time learning their lessons.  There is no compulsory teaching through Irish. I think it was Deputy Dillon who said that we had done a disservice to the language by associating it with the idea of compulsion.  All I can say is that everyone should examine his own conscience and see how much he has linked the word compulsion with the Irish language.  It was never intended in the schools.</P>
    <P>I have tried in recent years to put the stress on the oral rather than written use of the language.  We have graded text books and standardised Irish to make it easier for the pupils <Col N="515" /> to learn.  I understand from the teachers it has improved the situation in the teaching of Irish and the ability of pupils to talk Irish.</P>
    <P>There were many detailed points mentioned and one of these was mentioned by Deputy O'Donnell, who said he never heard the word &ldquo;sionnach&rdquo; in Donegal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what he said, but I am sure at some time he must have been called a sean-sionnach but perhaps he did not know it was the Munster word for &ldquo;fox&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I rejoice in the existence of the two expressions, although I am told it is high treason not to use the standard expression which is probably not either &ldquo;sionnach&rdquo; or &ldquo;madra rua&rdquo; and which is probably &ldquo;sionnach rua&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There it is.  We all know Irish but Deputy Colley does not know the standard Irish for fox.  If so apt a scholar as the Deputy does not know this, does it not show that we are trying to invent a language, since those who speak Irish do not know it?</P>

Does the Minister not agree with me that to invent a language is the last disservice to the Irish language?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I said this before.  A language that is alive is constantly <Col N="516" /> changing.  It is not a question of inventing it.  It is constantly changing and any short visit I made to the Gaeltacht showed me that.  New words are being brought in.  If the converse were true and no new words were brought in, then you should worry about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We are only getting the different dialects together into one so as to have some common basis that the children can learn and afterwards they can learn different dialects, if they want to.  We want to give them something capable of being learned and in which they can be fluent and which will not be difficult.  Much of the troubles of the Irish language are due to the wide variation in dialect and the difficulty which you normally hear about of a person in Munster listening to a radio news bulletin and not being able to understand a man from Connacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>I never heard of a Munster person not being able to understand a Donegal person.  You <Col N="517" /> might find that it was a bit hard for a Yorkshire man to understand a Lancashire man but it is basically the same language and they would know what each was talking about.</P>

      <P>As Deputies are aware, the main Estimates for the six Votes for which I am responsible were <Col N="520" /> passed without discussion before the summer recess, and the Supplementary Estimate which I have moved for the Office of the Minister for Justice is really a token Vote to facilitate an Estimates debate on my Department's various services.  I propose, therefore, to deal with the services as a group in my introductory speech so that, as in previous years, there may be one general discussion&mdash;without, of course, prejudicing the right of any Deputy to raise any particular point.  The Supplementary Estimate for the Garda Síochána will also be covered by the general discussion.</P>
      <P>The total Estimate for all the Votes for which I am responsible, including the token Vote for my Office and the Supplementary Estimate for the Garda Síochána is £8,662,400, an increase of £1,118,690 over the amount estimated for the year 1962/63.  Apart from the Supplementary Estimate for the Garda Síochána, which I shall deal with later, the increase is due principally to some extra staff in the Office of the Minister for Justice; to the larger provision which continues to be required for Garda pensions, as the older members of the Force retire: and to building improvements in the prisons.</P>
      <P>As we are already in the second half of the present financial year, the House will bear with me if, in dealing with the year ended 31st March last, I touch also on developments subsequent to that date.  The general picture is one of progress, not only in carrying out what I may call the Department's traditional administrative functions, but in developing new services and in the making of improved arrangements for the prompt and efficient discharge of the Department's work.  The increased staff for which provision is made in the Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Justice has been allocated to the various sections of the Department as required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements, now in the final stages, for the transfer of the Garda Síochána Training Centre to Templemore, have involved a good deal of work in the Department, which has also been closely concerned with the disposal, under the Garda Conciliation <Col N="521" /> and Arbitration Scheme, of a major pay claim brought on behalf of ranks up to chief superintendent. A Committee which I set up to consider the subject of penal reform has already made quite a number of valuable recommendations, many of which have already been not only approved but put into effect.  The staff engaged on the law reform programme continues to gather momentum, and is participating to an increased extent in the legal affairs of a number of international organisations.</P>
    <P>Mention of international contacts in legal matters would not be complete without a reference, which I am very happy to make, to the invitation generously extended to me by the German Government to visit that country with a party of Irish jurists to study legal developments and the functioning of legal institutions in that country.  The visit took place in September-October last year and was an interesting and stimulating experience for the participants.  I should like to take this opportunity to express publicly to the German Federal Republic and its distinguished Minister for Justice my appreciation and gratitude for their generosity and hospitality.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of international contacts, I should like to tell the House that the Third Conference of the European Ministers for Justice will be held in Dublin next May.  This conference which will be held under the auspices of the Council of Europe is the third in a series of such Conferences, the other two, which I attended, having been held in Paris and Rome.  On the occasion of the last Conference in Rome in October of 1962, I extended an invitation from the Irish Government to hold the next Conference in Dublin, and this was unanimously accepted.  About 15 countries participate in this Conference, which is concerned with a wide variety of legal matters, such as penal reform, criminology and international law.  It is, therefore, an institution of very great importance and the Government and I are gratified that Dublin should be chosen as the venue for this year's conference.</P>
    <P>On the legislative side, a fair amount <Col N="522" /> of progress was again made and a number of Bills were enacted into law; these were the Statute Law Revision Bill, the Official Secrets Bill and the Hotel Proprietors Bill.  A good deal of work has been going on simultaneously on the preparation of legislation to deal with registration of titles, a comprehensive, highly technical measure; a Bill to amend the law relating to extradition; a Guardianship of Infants Bill; a Bill to consolidate and amend the law relating to pawnbroking; a Bill to give effect to the Government's decision to abolish capital punishment except in certain circumstances; an amendment of the Adoption Act, 1952, in minor respects; an amendment of the Firearms Act, 1925, to provide for the control of air guns in the hands of young people; and a Bill to deal with the Administration of Estates and Wills.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, Parliamentary Bills are like icebergs in that less than one-fifth of the work put into their structure appears above the surface: a great deal of consultation goes on between the promoting Department and the various interests involved, with experts on the points of law at issue, and then the Minister and Government in turn have to immerse themselves in the intricacies and decide on policy and major issues. I am mentioning this in passing, as an explanation of what would appear to be the comparatively slow progress of some measures which I had hoped would have been dealt with in the House before now.</P>
    <P>Apart from the preparation of legislation, my Department has been concerned in the operation of several Committees of Inquiry.  There are, for instance, the Courts Committee which is enquiring into practice and procedure in the Courts, a Bankruptcy Committee, a Ground Rents Committee, an Inter-Departmental Committee examining the law relating to compensation for malicious injuries and an Inter-Departmental Committee enquiring into penal reform.</P>
    <P>Last year I mentioned that the indictable crime figures for the year ended 30th September, 1961, were a <Col N="523" /> little lower than the preceding year, the actual figures being 15,375 in 1960 and 14,818 in 1961.  The 1962 figures show a small increase, the figure being 15,307, which is substantially the same as two years ago.  Provisional figures for the nine months ended 30th June, 1963, however, show a further and fairly substantial upward trend, but the figures are still running well below the 1959 figure of 17,865.</P>
    <P>There has been a continuing increase in housebreakings since 1960, the figure for 1962 being 3,466, as against 3,186 in 1961 and 2,982 in 1960. Provisional figures for the period 1st October, 1962, to 30th June, 1963, show a further increase, and when final figures are in, it is not unlikely that they will show that the 1959 figure of 3,824 has been surpassed in the year ended 30th September, 1963.  By comparison with other countries, these figures are low and are not such as to constitute any really serious crime problem for the community.  Even so, the trend, in the case of crimes of this type, that is, breaking and entering, has been in the wrong direction and the Garda Síochána have been directing special attention to these crimes, with particular emphasis on precautionary measures.</P>
    <P>As is to be expected, the main problem arises in Dublin, and for this reason we have established in Dublin a special Crime Preventive Unit in the charge of an inspector.  Some months ago a sergeant from each of the seven districts in Dublin was temporarily assigned to assist this unit in their work of surveying business premises and advising the owners of ways and means of improving security arrangements. Outside Dublin, the same work is done by the Garda Síochána in the course of their ordinary duties, and there again the notice of all ranks was recently directed to the value of this work, and the need to give special attention to it.</P>
    <P>As I need hardly say, measures of this kind could achieve nothing without the co-operation and goodwill of the owners of premises.  Those are usually forthcoming.  The Gardaí for their part, have to have regard to the <Col N="524" /> difficulties facing the owners of premises and to realise that there is a limit beyond which the owners cannot reasonably be expected to go in the way of incurring expense on security measures.  However, it very often happens that the security of a particular premises can be greatly improved by a very small expenditure, which the owner gladly undertakes when his attention is drawn to the need for it.</P>
    <P>The overall detection rate in 1962 was 66 per cent, which happens to be exactly the same as in the preceding year.  In Dublin it was 47 per cent and outside Dublin 85 per cent.  These figures, I may say, are regarded as excellent in police circles and compare very favourably with those of other countries, in comparable conditions. This applies both to the Dublin figures and the others.  The position in regard to the summary offences is little changed from the previous year. The total number of offences for which proceedings were instituted was 105,189, as compared with 104,057 in 1961.  The number of prosecutions for road traffic offences was 77,203; the figure for 1961 was 77,834.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the fines-on-the-spot scheme came into operation in Dublin on 1st April, 1963, coinciding with the coming into operation of the new traffic bye-laws.  It seems to be working very well.</P>
    <P>The good work of the Adoption Board continues.  They made 699 adoption orders in 1962, approximately 150 more than in the preceding year, of which 339 were in respect of boys and 360 in respect of girls.  The Board normally sits in Dublin, but to facilitate adopters, they held sittings during the year in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Wexford, Sligo and Letterkenny.  As the House is aware, an amending Bill which will considerably facilitate the work of the Adoption Board and which makes a number of desirable improvements in the system has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1962, 3,177 aliens were registered, i.e. they were residing here for periods of three months or <Col N="525" /> more.  The corresponding figure for the end of 1961 was 3,140.  Apart from aliens who came here from Britain, over 47,000 aliens landed in the State during the year, as compared with about 43,000 in 1961.  Of these, of course, the great majority are visitors, and indeed there has been no significant change in the level of our resident alien population for many years.  Eighty-one persons were naturalised in 1962.</P>
    <P>Twelve hundred and twenty-five films were examined by the Film Censor in 1962, of which 1,007 were passed (two on appeal) and 192 were passed with cuts (one on appeal). Twenty-six films were rejected.  The total footage examined was over 3,300,300, a drop of about 400,000 feet on the previous year.</P>
    <P>The Censorship of Publications Board examined 569 books and 33 periodicals in 1962.  Of these, 36 books were examined as a result of formal complaints and 533 were examined on reference from the customs authorities.  The Board made 389 Prohibition Orders in respect of books and 26 in respect of periodical publications.  Four of the books had been the subject of Prohibition Orders in earlier years, but, for technical reasons, it was necessary to make repeat Orders in respect of them. There were five appeals in respect of periodical publications, one of which was allowed.</P>
    <P>Comhairle na Mire Gaile awarded 38 certificates of bravery.</P>
    <P>The Public Record Office continued to discharge its regular functions during the year, and received for safe keeping the usual batches of documents transferred from the offices of the various courts, that is to say, documents and records of cases disposed of for over 20 years.  In addition to documents from official sources, the office has in the past year received from private citizens presentations of a number of testamentary and other documents.  These documents are, for the most part, wills and papers of that kind which have served their original purpose, and are presented by solicitors and others to the Public Record Office, <Col N="526" /> where they can be preserved for the future and may be of importance for historical research purposes.  I regard such activity as highly commendable and would like to encourage persons having in their possession old documents which are no longer required for legal purposes but which may be of historical interest to present them to the Public Record Office.  Donors may get copies of these documents free of charge at any time, and their generosity will be recorded in due course in the reports of the Public Record Office.  If I might indicate the acquisitions of this kind which are particularly desirable, I would mention deeds over 200 years old, maps other than those emanating from the Ordnance Survey, rentals over 100 years old and briefs and abstracts of title containing early genealogical information.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the subject of the Public Record Office, I might mention also that, among the documents received for keeping during the year were a number of old prison registers. While these, because of the nature of their contents are not ordinarily made available to the public for inspection, I shall be prepared to consider applications from persons having bona fide reasons, for special permission to see them.</P>
    <P>Last year I referred to the new provision which had been made in the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Justice to subsidise the preparation and publication of legal text books. This scheme is operated by the Incorporated Council for Law Reporting with financial and other assistance from my Department.  The preparation of legal textbooks dealing with the law of this country is a slow and tedious process, but is becoming of increasing importance according as developments in the field of law reform here make textbooks prepared elsewhere, for use outside the country, progressively less suitable and less accurate for use by Irish practitioners and students.</P>
    <P>I am glad to record that the first book prepared under my Department's scheme&mdash;a textbook on the administration of estates&mdash;made its appearance in the bookshops during the summer. While I would not be justified in going <Col N="527" /> so far as to assert &ldquo;tosnú maith, leath no hoibre&rdquo;, the new book certainly represents a good start on which the Incorporated Council for Law Reporting is to be congratulated.  Now that the first furrow has been broken, we can look forward to quicker progress in this field, which is both extensive and important.</P>
    <P>I now pass on to the next Vote, No. 24, that for the Garda Síochána. Taking the figures in the original Estimate, £6,605,150, together with those in the Supplementary Estimate, £1,014,100, the total expenditure for the current year is estimated at £7,619,250, which shows a net increase of £1,077,960 on the Estimate for last year.  Virtually the full amount of the increase&mdash;in fact an increase of over £1 million&mdash;arises in the subheads dealing with the salaries, pensions and allowances of members of the Garda Síochána.  This results from the implementation by the Government of the findings of the Chairman of the Garda Síochána Arbitration Board on claims made by the Garda Síochána Representative Bodies for higher pay.  The estimated cost of implementing the award in respect of the current year is £787,000 for pay; an additional £115,000 will be required to cover the period from 9th January, 1963, to 31st March, 1963, in the case of Guards and from 15th January, 1963, to 31st March, 1963, in respect of inspectors, station sergeants and sergeants.  The increase in pay will also be reflected in an estimated additional expenditure of £102,100 in respect of pensions, gratuities, etc., of members of the Garda Síochána.  The pension provision in the original Estimate shows an increase of £204,805 on last year's figure; this follows from an increase in the number of pensioners and from increases in pensions approved by the Minister for Finance with effect from 1st August, 1962.</P>
    <P>Were it not for a reduction in the Garda strength, for which provision is made, with a consequential reduction in the cost of clothing and equipment, and also a saving under the heading of transport, the net increase in the <Col N="528" /> Estimate would be considerably greater.</P>
    <P>Once again I am glad to pay tribute to all ranks of the Force for the manner in which they carried out their duties during the year.  The pleasant and efficient manner in which they carried out their special tasks during President Kennedy's visit was commented upon favourably by many members of the public and earned the force the enthusiastic commendation of our country's very distinguished visitor. The crime position in the country, though not by any means such as to encourage complacency, is nevertheless relatively better than in any country we know of.  That is, in great measure, due to the zeal and efficiency of the Force.</P>
    <P>Deputies are already aware of the efforts being made to revive sport and athletics in the Garda Síochána.  The Central Committee, known as An Coiste Siamsa, is doing excellent work in this regard.  I feel I ought to mention that every Garda recruit is now given lessons in swimming and life-saving. We are indebted to Messrs.  Arthur Guinness &amp; Co. for so generously placing at the disposal of the Force for this purpose their magnificent swimming pool.  When recruits leave the Depot, they are encouraged to carry on swimming and life-saving courses and the Red Cross Society has undertaken to supply instructors and to provide groups with films for instruction purposes.</P>
    <P>Representations are frequently made against proposals to close down stations or reduce them to one-man units.  I should like to assure Deputies that these proposals, which fall to be approved by me personally, arise only in cases where, by reason of the absence of crime, the sparsity of population, etc., I am satisfied that such reductions can be made without detriment to police efficiency.  In the calendar year, 1962, seven stations were closed and four reduced to one-man units.</P>
    <P>I now come to a subject which is of great importance to the welfare of the Force, namely, the provision of suitable accommodation.  I am glad to be <Col N="529" /> able to say that the progress which I reported to the House last December is being maintained.  At present, work is in progress on the erection of 23 stations outside Dublin.  A new station at Cabra was opened at the beginning of October.  Another new station at Crumlin is expected to be ready for occupation by the end of this year.  In addition, it is proposed to provide new stations at Store Street, Rathmines, Terenure, Raheny, Dundrum, Coolock, Clondalkin and Ballyfermot and sites have been either acquired or are in course of negotiation for about 80 country stations.  An ambitious programme for the building of houses for Gardaí by the National Building Agency is now getting into top gear. During the past year 30 new houses for married members have been provided and work is in progress on 130 houses.</P>
    <P>The new Garda training centre at Templemore is nearing completion and I expect that the transfer will take place very shortly.  The new training centre will contain all modern facilities for the accommodation and training of recruits, while provision has also been made for the holding of higher training courses.  Excellent provision has been made for the recreational needs of trainees&mdash;there will be a sportsfield with two pitches, three handball alleys, one of which will be roofed and lighted and two basketball courts.  A new gymnasium is being provided and there will be a separate large recreational hall.  Reading rooms, lounges with facilities for light refreshments, and a billiards room will also be provided.  A feature of the new training centre will be a covered-in heated swimming pool.  This will ensure that the excellent work in connection with swimming and life-saving instruction to recruits at present being carried out in Dublin will be continued and extended in Templemore, and that in time the force will be in a position to make a very worthwhile contribution to reducing the toll of death by drowning.  Further, as young Gardaí are encouraged to partake in the various activities of the community in which they live, it is reasonable to expect that the enthusiasm <Col N="530" /> for swimming and lifesaving inculcated during training will lead them to give a hand on a voluntary basis to swimming clubs in the matter of training the young men and women of the country to become competent in swimming and lifesaving.  This development will also be valuable in reducing deaths from drowning, and will, I feel sure, commend itself to all members of the House and the public generally.  It is my intention also that this new pool at Templemore will be available to suitable organisations and groups in the surrounding counties for the promotion of swimming and life-saving.</P>
    <P>Vote No. 25 is the Vote for prisons. The Estimate, at £316,720 net, is £33,480 more than last year's.  The biggest increase, £25,221, is to be found in the subhead which deals with prison services, maintenance, etc.</P>
    <P>Structural repairs and alterations to all the prison buildings, which are over 100 years old, have become necessary in order to provide institutions of reasonably modern standards.  Consequently an extensive building programme has been planned, part of which is to be carried out this year at an estimated cost of £37,000.  This year's works include structural alterations to existing buildings to provide for the segregation at work, exercise and recreation of prisoners selected for the corrective training unit at Mountjoy, and the establishment of a 20-bed hospital unit at Mountjoy for adult prisoners requiring psychiatric hospitalisation. I already mentioned in my speech on the Estimates for 1962-63 that the establishment of these units and the training of personnel to man them at Mountjoy Prison had been recommended by the inter-Departmental Committee set up to inquire into the methods for the prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders. Under the same subhead provision has been made for the installation of new boilers at Portlaoise, an improved issue of clothing to male and female prisoners, improved accommodation and appointments for officers' quarters and replacement of bedding and furniture in prisoners' cells.  Also, a modern electrical baking unit is being installed <Col N="531" /> in Mountjoy in replacement of the old turf-fired ovens which have outlived their usefulness.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that the provision for victualling has been increased by about £1,800.  This additional amount is due in part to increased victualling costs but it is provided mainly because, at the time the Estimate was being prepared, trends in relation to the numbers of prisoners indicated an increase in the number of remand and trial cases that were being dealt with by sentence rather than by discharge, suspension or probation and, also, a tendency on the part of the courts to impose longer sentences. While it is anticipated, therefore, that the daily average prison population will go up it is not expected that the total number of persons committed in custody during this year will show any appreciable variation.  Last year the total number of persons committed to prisons during the year was 2,438, 2,124 males and 304 females.  The number of youths committed by the courts direct to St. Patrick's Institution was 325.  The daily average population was 490, as against 447 in 1961, which was inclusive of an average of 142 juveniles in St. Patrick's.</P>
    <P>The large scale building programme in hands and the changes in methods of treatment of offenders have, of course, called for the creation of additional posts of supervisory officers, medical orderlies, disciplinary and trades officers, and the necessary pay provision has been made in subhead A of the Vote.  The sum of £2,000 in that subhead for additional assistance is intended to cover the appointment of two welfare officers as well as expenditure in relation to medical consultant services and other possible outlay arising out of the Committee's recommendations, to whose work I will now refer.</P>
    <P>In connection with the re-examination of the penal system the House is aware that in September, 1962, I set up an inter-Departmental Committee with the following terms of reference:</P>
    <P>To inquire into the present methods for the prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders, <Col N="532" /> giving attention, in particular, to the following matters:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) juvenile delinquency</P>
    <P>(b) the probation system</P>
    <P>(c) the institutional treatment of offenders and their after-care,</P>
    <P>and to recommend such changes in the law and practice as the Committee considers desirable and practicable.</P>
    <P>The House would, I am sure, like to know something about what the committee has been doing and whether any changes have been made as a result of its deliberations.  I have deliberately kept the committee a small body: it has a single representative from each of the four Government Departments concerned &mdash; Education, Health, Industry and Commerce and Justice&mdash; under the Chairmanship of the Secretary of my Department and staffed by a secretary also from my Department. The committee itself, and the working parties which it has formed, have had several discussions and interviews with members of the judiciary, the clergy, the Garda authorities, Governors of prisons and managers of institutions to which persons are sentenced or committed, probation officers, doctors including psychiatrists, sociologists, social workers, representatives of employers' organisations, of trade unions and of miscellaneous groups interested in youth welfare.  Members of the Committee have inspected our prisons and Marlborough House, the remand home for boys, a sample number of industrial schools and the reformatory school for boys.  Furthermore, they have visited the Borstal at Millisle and St. Patrick's Institution in Belfast.  Again, members of the Committee have attended a United Nations seminar in Rome on the evaluation of methods used in the prevention of juvenile delinquency.  All this activity has, I am glad to say, been accompanied by practical results.</P>
    <P>The committee has not delayed in making recommendations in relation to day to day matters which could be rectified, and according as conclusions were reached it has put before me a number of recommendations which I have had no hesitation in <Col N="533" /> approving.  The following are among the principal recommendations which have already been implemented or are in course of implementation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) Recruit prison officers are now specially trained in the application of the rules and regulations and the training of all prison personnel in such matters as prisoner/ staff relationship, group-counselling and observation of inmates requiring special medical care.  The training of a number of officers has already been completed and these courses are now an established part of the training of prison officers.  The attendance of selected officers at study courses in other countries is being planned, and, in fact, following the award to him of a fellowship by the Council of Europe, the Governor of Mountjoy Prison has recently undergone a special course of study in Britain;</P>
    <P>(b)  Psychiatric treatment is now provided for inmates in need of special medical care.  A 20-bed psychiatric unit has been opened in the hospital wing of Mountjoy Prison and is operating under the control of the Prison Medical Officer who is a qualified psychiatrist. Occupational therapy is provided for those under treatment and consultant services are available to the Prison Medical Officer when necessary;</P>
    <P>(c) Additional medical orderlies are being appointed and are being trained in mental nursing.  Four extra appointments have been made and all medical orderlies have undergone a training course conducted by the Prison Medical Officer;</P>
    <P>(d) Special cellular accommodation, association cells with 3 beds, is being provided in St. Patrick's Institution for cases, such as epileptics, which require constant observation;</P>
    <P>(e) A prison corrective training unit has been established for prisoners most likely to benefit from special training and who would, through teaching and guidance, be prepared and fitted for taking their places as normal members of <Col N="534" /> society.  This unit has been established in Mountjoy and at present there are just over 100 prisoners receiving special training there.  The trainees are housed in a particular wing of the prison and arrangements are now in hand to secure their complete segregation from other prisoners.  The training programme is a three-phase effort and advancement to the final phase, which includes pre-release treatment, is based on conduct, industry and personal effort towards reform. Apart from instruction in particular trades and occupations trainees are given opportunities to develop their individual talents.  Private study is encouraged and hobby workshops for leisure time are provided. Debates are arranged and lectures given on subjects likely to assist in reform and rehabilitation.  To date 15 prisoners have passed the examination for the first aid certificate of the Irish Red Cross Society, and, thanks to the voluntary services offered by members of the Garda Síochána Civil Defence Instruction Corps, a large number of trainees have received instruction in Civil Defence;</P>
    <P>(f) A school has been established for backward prisoners.  There is a high rate of illiteracy among prisoners, and the inter-Departmental Committee felt that unless something was done to remedy this position any efforts towards rehabilitation by way of training at a trade had little hope of achieving any measure of success.  That school has now been established in Mountjoy. With the assistance and kind co-operation of the authorities of the Christian Brothers' Training School in Dublin, a prison officer, a former teacher, has been trained in the special teaching methods required for dealing with illiterates, semi-illiterates and backward adults.  Tests are now given to prisoners on committal, and those found to be in need of instruction are graded into one of four classes and attend school until such time at least as they have reached a standard necessary to equip them for trade instructions. <Col N="535" /> The school is having very satisfactory results.  Indeed, I was very heartened to hear that many prisoners had asked to be given the opportunity to better their knowledge because I felt that those with family responsibilities would, on discharge, see to it that their children availed themselves of the facilities provided for their education;</P>
    <P>(g) More effective teaching and training methods are being provided in St. Patrick's Institution.  Here, too, the rate of illiteracy is very high. There have been consultations between my Department and the Department of Education and Comhairle Le Leas Oige and the new curriculum being planned for the Institution envisages the employment of the services of an educational psychologist and of qualified teachers and instructors, as well as the introduction of a Boys' Club curriculum during the evening recreational period;</P>
    <P>(h) Some of the industries carried on in the prisons and St. Patrick's have been expanded and reorganised in order to give a greater value to an inmate's skill and experience and so improve the prospects of employment on discharge.  The purchase of new equipment for the tailoring, shoemaking and carpentry classes is being arranged.  Also the gardening activities in Mountjoy Prison are being extended to cover flower cultivation, propagation of shrubs, greenhouse work, lawn-laying etc., so as to provide training in the type of work done by nurserymen and suburban gardeners;</P>
    <P>(i) Full-time Prison Welfare Officers are being appointed to advise prisoners on personal and domestic problems, to help in securing employment and to give after-discharge counsel and guidance.  The preliminary steps have been taken towards this end and it is intended to appoint two such Officers, one of whom will be assigned to Mountjoy and the other to look after the needs of the inmates in St. Patrick's Institution and in Portlaoise and Limerick Prisons;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> (j)  A District Justice has been assigned on a permanent basis to the Children's Court and it is hoped that he will be able to make a close study of the problems of juvenile deliquency from the point of view of the judiciary;</P>
    <P>(k) Additional official Probation Officers are being appointed in Dublin and there will be a widening of the scope of activities of the voluntary probation workers provided by societies and organisations interested in youth welfare and in the supervision of young persons discharged from reformatories and industrial schools.  It is the Committee's view, which I accept, that outside Dublin the incidence of delinquency is not of such dimensions as to call for the appointment of full-time Probation Officers and that the work of supervision can be met, as in Cork and Limerick, by availing of the service of the voluntary probation worker.  As regards Dublin, the Committee consider that greater use could be made of the voluntary services so willingly offered and that if this were done a State establishment of one Probation Administration Officer and six Probation Officers should suffice at present at any rate fully to meet requirements.  I have seen no reason to disagree with this opinion and I have taken the necessary steps to bring the numbers up to the strength suggested.  It will be part of the work of the Probation Administration Officer to co-operate with other bodies concerned with youth welfare, and especially with the police and their juvenile liaison officers to whom I shall refer in a moment, so that not only will the necessary coordination of effort be effected but also through the assembly of reports from many sources the fullest possible information will be available to the courts as a guide to the treatment appropriate for a particular offender;</P>
    <P>(l) Arrangements have been made for greater participation by members of the Garda Síochána in the field of preventive justice particularly where juveniles are concerned. Many of the members of our Force <Col N="537" /> are playing their part in keeping down juvenile delinquency by interesting themselves in the promotion and management of clubs for young people and I am encouraging this as much as possible.  But apart from this commendable voluntary effort, the present policy, which calls for the co-operation of the injured party and of the parents, of &ldquo;warning&rdquo;, instead of prosecuting, the young delinquent of previous good character has now been taken a stage further.  In Dublin, a number of selected members of the Force have been appointed as Juvenile Officers, each of whom has the responsibility for all juvenile offences in a particular area and who acts as the liaison officer between the police and the other State and voluntary services concerned with the juveniles. This scheme has lately gone into operation and, if it proves successful, it will be applied in other centres of population.</P>
    <P>(m) the question of obtaining alternative premises for St. Patrick's Institution is being pursued.  Apart from their opinion that more spacious accommodation was needed to provide adequate elementary and technical education and outdoor recreational facilities, the Committee felt, and I heartily agree with them, that the siting of the Institution in close proximity to Mountjoy Prison was not the most desirable arrangement.  This matter is being actively examined in consultation with the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Other recommendations made by the Committee which are being attended to by my Department deal with such matters as the appointment of Prison After-Care Committees, the co-ordination of the various services concerned with crime and delinquency, viz., the police, the courts, the probation welfare and medical officers, the social workers, etc., and the wider use of the statutory powers for temporary release to enable prisoners who are nearing the end of their sentences to take up employment.  This last matter is one in which I have not waited on <Col N="538" /> the appointment of the Prison Welfare Officers and on other institutional arrangements, and I am happy to say that through the help of some of the present prison personnel quite a lot has already been done towards obtaining employment for prisoners who would shortly be due for release.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree with me that these recommendations are in full harmony with the Committee's &ldquo;terms of reference&rdquo; in that the changes proposed are reasonable and practicable.  I expect the same sound approach to be reflected in the further proposals which the Committee will be making.  The matters which are at present having the Committee's attention relate to the treatment of offenders in institutions which are not under my control, namely, reformatory and industrial schools and the Place of Detention at Marlborough House, Glasnevin, which is the only one of these institutions directly under State control.  Marlborough House is the place of committal for youths dealt with by the Children's Courts and who have been committed in custody on remand or for trial or while awaiting transfer to a reformatory or an industrial school, and for those who have received a sentence of detention which, under existing law, cannot exceed one month.  The short periods of custody served generally do not allow of any practical steps being taken with regard to the education and training of those detained.  However, it is the intention to introduce legislation to provide that the Courts can impose sentences of detention up to 6 or 9 months.  It is also intended to erect new premises for the Detention Home, to entrust the management of the home to the Brothers of the De La Salle Order and to provide for the teaching, training and care of the detainees by fully qualified personnel, including an educational psychologist. It is the view of the Committee that these desirable changes will lead to a wider use by the Children's Courts of the power of committal to detention, not only in relation to cases of the type which are dealt with to-day by fines or under the provisions of the Probation Act but also as an alternative to the exercise of the provisions <Col N="539" /> for committal to reformatories and industrial schools.</P>
    <P>It would be premature at this early stage to look for positive results but to judge by the enthusiasm and willingness to co-operate shown by all concerned in this work I have no doubt that the new approach will pay good dividends.  But, as I have said before, a more important factor in the scheme of rehabilitation of offenders is the provision of suitable permanent employment on discharge and I would again appeal to all employers to do what they can when approached regarding the employment of these people.  Here I wish to thank most sincerely those employers who have already responded to approaches and through whose co-operation prisoners who were being fully discharged or given temporary release were placed in remunerative employment.  In expressing thanks to these employers, I am speaking, not alone for myself, but also for the prisoners concerned and their families and all those connected with prison management and administration&mdash;the Governors, Chaplains, Medical Officers, prison staff and the Prison Visiting Committees.  The members of the Visiting Committees themselves deserve special mention for all that they do voluntarily, both in committee and by individual effort, to help in the rehabilitation of those in custody and to ensure that they are properly cared for during committal. The Committee's Reports for 1962 which appear in the Prisons Report for that year are ample evidence of their interest generally in their work and of their particular interest in the changes now being made in the penal system.</P>
    <P>As well as those connected with the prison service, there are many others without whose voluntary efforts and assistance the achievement of the modern aims of prison administration would not be possible.  I would like to pay grateful tribute to the Discharged Prisoners Aid Society, the Guild of St. Philip, St. Patrick's Welfare Association, the Irish Red Cross Society, the Garda Civil Defence Instructor Corps <Col N="540" /> and other such organisations as well as the individual social workers for all that is being done by them, by way of grants, visits, lectures and courses with regard to the moral and temporal needs of prisoners and the promotion of good citizenship.</P>
    <P>The next Estimate, No. 26, is that for the Courts of Justice.  At £394,560 it is less than for the previous year by £18,100.  However, Deputies who take these figures as an indication of a fall in expenditure will, I fear, be disappointed, as the apparent reduction has been brought about by a change in accounting arrangements.  For the future, this Estimate will take credit for moneys, estimated at £22,000, received in respect of fines, which up to now were remitted direct to the Exchequer.  There is, in fact, a modest increase in expenditure, due to a small increase in the number of stenographer and clerical staff and to some increase in travelling expenses.</P>
    <P>In the case of the District Court, the operation of the reorganisation of districts carried out in 1961 continues to be kept under active review so as to ensure that the best possible service is provided for the public.  When speaking on the subject of the District Court last year, I mentioned that I would like to see the justices having discussions amongst themselves on the general level of fines and other penalties with a view to the avoidance of undue divergencies in their judgments.</P>
    <P>It is important that in so far as possible undue divergence in the penalties imposed by different courts for offences of the same character and gravity should be avoided and I hope that it may be possible to have this matter brought forward for discussion at the next statutory meeting of the district justices.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of the courts, perhaps I should mention the <i>Legal Diary</i>, which is a sheet of the various cases listed for the courts in Dublin which is printed and circulated daily during term and which is of such importance to the legal profession and to the operation of the courts themselves. This publication has been in existence for over 100 years and had been published, <Col N="541" /> with the aid of a State grant, by a well-known firm of Dublin publishers in a manner which gave the greatest satisfaction.  However, with the development of their business it became no longer suitable for this firm to handle, so that during the year it became necessary for my Department to arrange for the transfer of the publication to another firm who are now continuing the good work of their predecessors, so that this valuable service continues.  The transfer, I may say, was facilitated by the commendable co-operation afforded by the firm first referred to, in the handing over of blocks and other incidental material.</P>
    <P>The retirement last August from the Circuit Court bench of Judge Binchy had the effect, under the law as it stands, of reducing by one the permissible number of permanent judges. As the volume of work, particularly in Dublin, made it impossible to carry on with one less, the President, on the advice of the Government, recently appointed a temporary Circuit Court judge.  Proposals relating to the Circuit Court have been brought before the Dáil in the form of the Courts Bill, 1963.</P>
    <P>Estimate No. 27 is that for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds.  This year's figure of £151,430 represents an increase of £7,470 over the previous year, attributable to some additional staff which are required for increased duties in the Land Registry.  The work of both of these offices is showing a progressive increase in recent years.  In the Land Registry, the number of dealings received for registration rose from 30,562 in the year ended 30th September, 1961, to 31,321 in the year ended 30th September, 1962, and again to 32,836 in the year ended 30th September, 1963; applications for discharge of equities rose from 1,815 to 1,830 to 2,100 for the same years and the number of applications for land certificates rose from 6,399 to 6,646 to 7,205.</P>
    <P>Again in the case of the Registry of Deeds, the number of registrations rose from 23,710 in the year ended 30th September, 1961, to 23,729 in the year ended 30th September, 1962, and again to 26,653 in the year ended 30th <Col N="542" /> September, 1963.  Applications for searches rose from 5,979 to 6,142 to 6,458 in the same years.</P>
    <P>The progress of work in the Land Registry over the past year was affected by difficulties apart from the increased volume of business.  Vacancies which had existed because of difficulty in recruiting specialised staff had caused arrears in practically all branches.  This was aggravated by a problem of space for office accommodation.  The progressively increasing number of holdings registered requires additional space from year to year and there has also been an appreciable increase in the number of persons availing of the services of the Land Registry, whose attendance at the office to examine maps and other documents makes further demands on space.  In consequence, an increase in office accommodation can no longer be avoided and arrangements are now well advanced towards an addition to the present building within the next year.  Preparations have also been begun to double the size of the Land Registry premises in about 6 years' time when the effects of the new legislation on registration of titles will make this necessary.  In the meantime spare office accommodation in the vicinity is being used as far as practicable.  The state of work in the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds at present is regarded as generally satisfactory in all departments.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the Estimate for the Office of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  Here, too, I am glad to be able to report steady progress during the past year in the various functions relating to the conduct and management of charities.  During the period there was the regular addition to charitable trusts vested directly in the Commissioners, with a consequential increase in the nominal value of their funds to £1,885,380.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I express my sincere thanks to all those members of voluntary committees and boards for which I have parliamentary responsibility, both present members and those who have retired during the past year?  I should like to place on record how appreciative I am of the <Col N="543" /> conscientious and able manner in which all concerned have carried out their tasks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>This Estimate, taken in conjunction with the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance, shows the extent to which the Government are prepared to &ldquo;chance their arm&rdquo; financially. The Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement mentioned&mdash;reference was also made to this by the Minister in the statement he has just read&mdash;the proposal to effect economies in the Minister's Department by postponing recruitment to the Garda Síochána. The figure given by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement was £50,000, to be saved by means of postponing Garda recruitment and making other economies.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice today gave us a picture of increasing crime, as shown in the Commissioner's report, and, in the light of that report, this is certainly not the time to start thinking in terms of reducing the number in the Garda Síochána or postponing recruitment to that body.  The same argument can be advanced in relation to the all-too-familiar picture of increasing road traffic offences; these might be prevented if there were more Gardaí.  Side by side with that picture painted by the Minister, there is the picture showing the increase in crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Commissioner's report&mdash;some of these figures were referred to by the Minister&mdash;for the year ended 30th September, 1962, the number of indictable offences is 15,307, showing an increase of 489 over the previous year.  The number of offences in which charges were made for driving, or attempting to drive, while drunk numbered 912, an increase of about 40 per cent over the previous year.  It was the highest figure in any year since 1957.  Careless or dangerous driving charges increased by 441 to a figure of 4,233.  According to the details given in the report, there were three cases of persons charged with manslaughter arising out of traffic fatalities; 99 cases <Col N="544" /> of persons charged with dangerous driving, causing deaths, and 104 cases of people charged with causing serious bodily harm.</P>
    <P>Burglary and housebreaking offences numbered 3,289, which again show an increase of 271 over the previous year. It is very disquieting to note from the report that there still seems to be a continuing increase in the numbers of young people engaged in crime.  The number under 14 years has apparently risen every year since 1957.  In the year to which this report relates, the figure was 1,375.  In the age group between 14 and 17, the number was 1,689; in the age group between 17 and 21, the number was 1,390.  In those circumstances, the desirability of stopping recruitment to the Garda Síochána is certainly not apparent.</P>
    <P>The same picture is presented in relation to road traffic offences.  Here I want to refer briefly to a speech the Minister made in the course of the year.  I believe the Minister's outlook on this problem is all wrong.  I know the Minister is not the Minister responsible for road traffic regulations, but he is responsible for the enforcement of these regulations.  In face of the general outcry which arose during the summer in connection with road traffic offences, particularly offences of the more serious kind, the Minister went to a Fianna Fáil cumann in Baldoyle, County Dublin, to issue a warning.  He indicated in the course of that speech &mdash;and no one will disagree with him on this&mdash;it was necessary that road traffic regulations should be fully and effectively enforced.  His solution for the effective enforcing of the road traffic regulations was to forecast the setting up of a system of concealed traps for motorists&mdash;the use of radar equipment and the use of non-uniformed police for the purpose of tracking motorists in the commission of road traffic offences.</P>
    <P>I said at the time, and I believe I was correct in the view, that that type of attitude on the part of the Minister and on the part of the authorities would simply be regarded as a challenge by some motorists and as an insult by others.  It was certainly not an attitude calculated to obtain the <Col N="545" /> co-operation of the motorist.  It was an entirely wrong approach by the Minister to this problem and to the question of the proper enforcement of these regulations.  The Minister indicated in that speech that he has a completely wrong idea as to the purpose for which the Force is in existence. The proper outlook on traffic offences&mdash;or, indeed, on any other offences, but I am dealing now with traffic offences&mdash;is that the primary task of the Garda should be prevention and that the question of detection and punishment of the offences arises only where, for one reason or another, the Garda have failed in what I would regard as their primary task of preventing the commission of the offences.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the same idea seemed to be expressed in the <i>Garda Review</i> some months ago.  It is self-evident.  The more uniformed members of the Garda you have in existence and in evidence, the less likely are people to transgress the traffic code or the law in any other respect.  The Minister's attitude is quite the opposite&mdash;that the right thing to do is to have Gardaí lying in concealed positions checking on motorists, so that if the motorist breaks the law, he will be punished.  That will not prevent the breaking of the law or prevent the motorist from driving too fast.  But if you have Gardaí in uniform on duty, it will prevent a breach of the law.  The Minister's approach to this is quite wrong, and I hope it will be altered.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to another matter which caused concern in the course of the year.  I do not want the Minister to misunderstand me on this. It is the question of the Minister intervening in court decisions.  There were two cases in the course of the year where members of the judiciary&mdash; one a High Court judge and the other a Circuit Court judge&mdash;found it necessary to comment on the action of the Minister in interfering with decisions given by the court.  As I say, I do not want to be misunderstood on this.  I am not suggesting that the prerogative of mercy which vests in the Minister for Justice should be set aside.  When the matter was raised in this House, the Minister's attitude, in <Col N="546" /> reply to a question, was that people were trying to prevent him from exercising his discretion in this matter. I am not suggesting that that discretion and prerogative should not exist, but I think there should be some clear-cut principle which can be understood by everyone.</P>
    <P>I am not necessarily to be taken as blaming the Minister in connection with the two cases to which I have referred.  As the person with the responsibility for making up his mind and coming to a decision on them, the Minister knows the details of these cases.  I am prepared to accept that he gave these matters full and due consideration before he decided to intervene.  What I do suggest is&mdash; whether it is that the Government, as distinct from the Fianna Fáil Party, need a public relations officer, I do not know&mdash;that the Minister's actions in intervening in these two cases clearly did raise a certain amount of public disquiet and uneasiness.  In the Circuit Court case to which I referred, the judge from the bench referred to this public disquiet which had been caused. It is most undesirable that should be so.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I feel that whenever the Minister acts in these matters, he should be in the position of saying and of demonstrating in public that he is acting on some clear-cut principle that can be easily understood by all.  It is quite proper that the Minister should act in cases where the defendant or accused or convicted person has exhausted the resources open to him under the courts, where there is no further appeal by him to the courts. In those cases there is no one else to turn to, if there has been a miscarriage of justice or a suspected miscarriage of justice, if new evidence comes to light and so on.  Clearly in such cases the Minister would be not only entitled, but it would be his duty, to act; but, as I say, it is necessary that all of us should know on what principle the Minister does act in these matters.</P>

      <P>With all respect to the Minister, I do not think it was the net point in one of them, the one to which the Circuit Court judge referred.  He was aware of the fact&mdash; and I am aware of it independently of him&mdash;that very grave public disquiet and uneasiness were caused in the locality.  It was that which motivated the Circuit Court judge to raise the matter, as he did raise it, in court and to require the attendance in the witness box of, I think, a senior Garda official, if not a prison official, to explain the position and to endeavour to set at rest the disquiet which had been raised in that particular case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's recollection of it may be better than mine.  I have not got the local newspaper report which I had on the occasion when I raised this by way of question here.  However, as I say, quite apart from the fact that the Circuit Court judge in question referred to the public uneasiness caused in the area, I know from a communication which I saw that that was so and that uneasiness was caused.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister a question last week as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been called to a newspaper report to the effect that a lady connected with the organisation of recent public protests against the Government turnover tax was warned by two Garda officers that she would be arrested if she watched or besetted the Taoiseach's house in any way; whether or not any such threat was made at the direction or with the knowledge of any member of the Government; if he will agree that it is most undesirable that the impression should be created, by Garda activity of the type reported, that official action will <Col N="548" /> be taken to discourage opposition to Government policies; and if, in the circumstances, he will make it quite clear that any person is entitled, by all lawful means, to express and to organise opposition to the turnover tax or any other aspect of Government policy without interference from the Gardaí or any other State authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply stated that the report was incorrect, that there was no question of arrest involved. I accept that, of course, because I did not see the report on which the Garda authorities acted but the Minister did not, in the course of his reply, deal with the specific question I put to him as to whether or not the threat or warning, whatever you like to call it, was made at the direction or with the knowledge of any member of the Government.</P>
    <P>The reason I raise this here is not that I want to be in any way controversial about particular cases but that it does seem to me that an impression has been created that the Garda are going to be encouraged in activity of this sort, activity which people might be justified in regarding as political activity.  We had the earlier incident of the use of police dogs in connection with a parade which obviously was a political parade.  We had the incident of a colleague of the Minister &mdash;I think it was the Minister for Lands &mdash;threatening legal action against some people who were agitated and protesting about the turnover tax at the time it was being debated in this House.  We had the unfortunate example of the Taoiseach addressing this House and threatening bloody noses to a trade organisation if they engaged in politics in connection with the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>All that does seem to be building up a picture which, to my mind, is quite undesirable.  It is wrong that the public should have the impression that either by doing nothing or else by encouragement the Government are going to have matters of political opposition dealt with now on the basis of threats of arrests or threats of prosecution by the Garda.  We have had <Col N="549" /> rough days in politics in this country and surely the type of protest which has been organised by housewives in Dublin is an extremely orderly type of protest?  It makes their views quite clear and well known and it is certainly not the type of activity which, to my mind, in any event, requires intervention from the Garda.  If the impression should be created&mdash;and I think it is being created&mdash;that the Government are prepared to call on all the forces of the State to squelch opposition of this kind to Government policy, all I can say is that it is most unfortunate and most undesirable and should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>There are some matters of perhaps lesser importance that I should like to raise for the purpose of getting information in regard to them.  There was a certain amount of criticism from these benches last year regarding the use of batons by Gardaí on traffic duty.  I have, in the course of the year since that criticism was made, made it my business to study as best I could the use of these batons by these Gardaí. Quite frankly, my own inclination is to agree with the criticism that has been made.  The signals made by the Garda by means of these batons are very much less clear than the old type of hand signal to which we were accustomed. I have myself on more than one occasion felt quite confused as to what signal I was getting from the Garda by means of the baton.  I know the use of these batons is for the purpose of putting the Garda on traffic duty on a par with his European counterparts but if that is to lead to confusion, then either their show value or their prestige value is not worthwhile and it is a matter that should be reconsidered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister also what is the position in regard to &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; signs which are erected around the place.  The Minister will recall that during the year a number of prosecutions were issued against motorists for failure to have regard to these &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; signs.  Some prosecutions were heard and a number of motorists suffered fines as a result. Then suddenly the pending prosecutions were withdrawn and when the <Col N="550" /> matter was raised here in the House&mdash; I have not at the moment got the Minister's reply&mdash;I was not entirely clear as to the reason why it was done. I am still not clear.  The Minister finished his reply on that occasion by urging motorists still to have regard to the &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; signs.  I have noticed that since then these are being gradually replaced by &ldquo;Yield Right of Way&rdquo; notices.  Perhaps the Minister would inform us as to the position in this regard.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister also tell us what is the position regarding the report on juries and what is the up-to-date position regarding the report of the Commission dealing with ground rents? The Minister referred briefly to the fines-on-the-spot system and said it seemed to be working well.  I should like the Minister to give us more data than that on it.  How many fines on the spot have been imposed?  How many people who have been fined have decided to test the matter out in court?</P>
    <P>I was glad the Minister referred to the question of uniformity of penalties imposed by district justices.  I know there is an easy way out of this problem, that is, to impose mandatory penalties, a situation which I should not like to see developing.  The proper approach is the one which was outlined by the Minister in his statement, namely, that this matter should be discussed by the district justices at their gatherings, to see if they could get some kind of uniformity in the penalties which they impose for similar offences.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the visit which a Party of Irish jurists made to Germany.  I think I am correct in saying that it was for the purpose of studying the legal system and legal developments in Germany.  I think I am also correct in saying the Minister did not include in his party going abroad any representative of the solicitors' profession or the Incorporated Law Society.  I think that was a pity.  It could have been done.</P>

      <P>I am sure they were quite right in doing so.  The Minister also referred to the closing down of Garda stations and I think he said seven were closed during the year.  He said:</P>
      <P>Representations are frequently made against proposals to close down stations or reduce them to one-man units.  I should like to assure Deputies that these proposals which fall to be approved by me personally, arise only in cases where, by reason of the absence of crime, the sparsity of population, etc., I am satisfied that such reductions can be made without detriment to police efficiency.</P>
      <P>I want to put the point to the Minister that very often it may be the existence of the Garda station that accounts for the absence of crime.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is proceeding on the basis that he is justifying the closing down of Garda stations by the absence of crime in an area, again, the Minister is acting on false premises.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested to me, and I should like to pass on the suggestion to the Minister, that the Garda Síochána directory needs to be modernised in some instances.  For example, the Garda stations at Shankill and Baltinglass are listed as being half a mile from the nearest railway station.  In view of the activities of the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, it might be worth the Minister's while to look again at where the railway station nearest to Baltinglass is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the question of reorganising <Col N="552" /> the district courts.  I suggest he should look at that matter again, particularly in relation to the Bray court.  The Minister will recall the abolition of the court at Shankill and Newtownmountkennedy.  The work which was previously done there now comes into Bray court, and the information given to me is that the Bray court is now very seriously overloaded with work and certain anomalies have been created.  People now travel long distances to the Bray court, although other courts might be much more convenient for them.  I should like the Minister to look at that question, particularly in relation to the Bray court.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter to which I want to refer.  I do it reluctantly, and with some personal embarrassment, because of family connections.  I am aware of the fact that the Minister and the Government have rejected an offer which was made to them of a small fund which would have been of benefit to the Garda Síochána.  The fund was offered by the daughter of the person who was primarily responsible for establishing the Garda in this country, in a natural desire to do something to commemorate her father.  It was rejected by the Minister, and rejected by the Taoiseach.  I am afraid I must say I believe the rejection of that offer was a petty political decision, not in the interests of the Garda, and not in the interests of the nation.</P>
      <P>I should hope that if any Deputy on these benches were in the Minister's shoes, and if a similar offer were made for the purpose of some memorial to the Minister's predecessor, for example, that that offer would not be rejected.  I believe it was a political decision which should not have been made.  As I say, I raise the matter with considerable reluctance but I feel, as a spokesman for the Fine Gael Party on this Estimate, it is a matter which it is proper for me to raise here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief because of the fact that in a few weeks we shall probably be dealing with the Minister's Estimate again.  The Minister made it clear that he has covered a period of more than 12 months.  I do not object to that except that perhaps there will be repetition on the <Col N="553" /> part of the Minister in a month or six weeks when he is introducing another Estimate, because he will go back more than the few months that are now left to him.  I wish to confine myself to a small number of items.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke of committees which have been set up.  I know the Minister, like all Ministers of all Governments, has a happy knack of setting up committees.  I do not blame him for that, because he is in good company, but there is one committee about which I think we ought to get finality, that is, the committee dealing with ground rents.  I know there are many difficulties, but it is about time we made some attempt to solve this problem.  The Fianna Fáil and the inter-Party Governments seem to have been trying to avoid it.  The more committees they were able to set up to deal with the problem, the more opportunity the Minister for Justice and the Government concerned had of saying they were waiting for some information.  It has gone on too long and the sooner finality is reached in this very important matter the better.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the Land Registry and rightly pointed out the difficulties prevailing there due to lack of accommodation and the difficulty of filling vacancies.  I wish to go on record as saying that I found I got more co-operation and help from the officials of the Land Registry than from any other State Department. Down the country much blame for delay is attributed to the Land Registry and many a client is told by his legal adviser that all the problem is due to the Land Registry when, from my own personal experience, I know that very often the hold-up is in the office of the legal adviser himself. The Land Registry is undoubtedly doing excellent work and its staff are most co-operative and it is only right to pay them that tribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave comparative statistics for crime but I think it is not sufficient for the Minister to show that we have not a serious crime problem compared with other countries. In dealing with questions of crime and <Col N="554" /> its detection it is not enough to say: &ldquo;We are good in bad company.&rdquo;  Our own ideal must be to prevent crime where possible and where crime is committed to deal with it in the most proper and reasonable manner possible. Our ideals and our sense of moral values must be somewhat different from those which may obtain in other places and we must uphold our own standards.  I must say I am not satisfied that conditions are good here in regard to crime and crime detection.</P>
    <P>It is true that child delinquency, in Dublin particularly, and in other cities, is high and adds to the overall percentage. The courts and those concerned have tried to deal with the problem most realistically from both the delinquents' and the public point of view.  I said years ago and now repeat that very often bad parents are hiding behind the fact that the names are not published in such court cases.  I should be the last to wish that the name of a boy or girl should be dragged out in public if it is possible to avoid it, but on the other hand, too often parents in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere are not worried about what the child may be doing because, even when the child ends up in court, the name of the child or parent is not published.  Protect the child as far as possible; be fair to the parents if it is a first offence and if they are doing their utmost to control the child but where it is a case of parents encouraging a child, such parents should be made accountable.  I read of a case some months ago where a boy was warned by his mother in the presence of the gardaí to give them no information. He was encouraged by the mother to treat the gardaí with contempt and to be prepared to defy the law.  The proper approach, I think, is that on the second, certainly on the third offence, the name of the parents should be published in the newspapers. That may seem hard but ultimately it may be better for the child who may otherwise carry the consequences of his parents' neglect into adult life.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Higgins, I wish to refer to the closing of Garda barracks. I approached the Minister about one <Col N="555" /> in particular and it is not because he turned down the request that I raise it but because I am not satisfied with the present position.  In Blackrock, County Cork, we have a village which was there when Cork was only half its present size.  The barracks there were closed and we were told the district was near enough to Cork city for supervision by the city barracks and by the squad car.  The Minister may be able to show that at present conditions in Blackrock have not deteriorated. I hope that is so, but I still say the squad car, moving through the parks in the suburban area between the city and Blackrock is in no way as good a protection to the people as the presence of a few gardaí in the barracks. Can anyone imagine a man who comes out from Cork city with the intention of breaking into a house standing out in one of the parks so that the gardaí in the squad car, which has its sign in front, can see him.  Even if they do their best, as they do, there is no comparison between that and the old system where the local gardaí knew every nook and cranny in the area and would be quickly able to discover the intentions of a prowler.  That was a far more sensible approach to dealing with the problem of housebreaking than the present system of the squad car going down to Blackrock from Cork city.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the overall policy of replacing Garda barracks in many parts of the country by squad cars should be re-examined.  It is my opinion that higher horse-power motorcycles would be far more suitable for the purposes of the Garda than squad cars.  A Garda on a motor-cycle can do more good than a few Gardaí in a squad car.  There is less publicity for his presence in the locality.  He can get around certainly as fast as a squad car does and can do more good than the men in a squad car are doing at present, despite their best endeavours.</P>
    <P>There is one item I want to mention. Naturally, the Minister did not refer to it and I would not expect him to do so. It is a serious problem.  I do not know how it affects Dublin but I do know <Col N="556" /> how it affects Cork city and county. I refer to these &ldquo;wandering minstrels&rdquo;, as some people are inclined to call them, these people who are doing a great deal of harm because their actions are most provocative, in Cork at any rate.  I am speaking of the members of the Jehovah's Witnesses sect.  If something is not done about this, I am afraid there will be trouble as there has been in the past.  Respectable people found themselves in court as a result of defending themselves because of the nuisance created by these people.  It is essential that fair-play be given to all sections of the community.  The individual is protected under the Constitution.</P>

      <P>This problem, or this menace, must be examined.  I would ask the Minister to get further reports from the responsible Garda authorities in the various districts as to what is happening.  I find that these people are appearing and causing trouble in even some of the most remote districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other items that I have no intention of discussing here.  I will come to them on the next Estimate.  I would draw attention to one very important item, that is, conditions for the Garda.  It is essential when a man joins the Garda Síochána that the authorities should be able to give him a sense of protection.  If he is doing his duty, he must be able to feel secure in his employment.  Without that, the Garda cannot hope to be the success that we would wish.  The Minister knows what happened in a certain town in Cork recently.  The Minister knows that in that particular case where a sergeant of the Garda who had been most conscientious in his work, had been fair to everyone there, had attended to every matter pertaining to his office, was suddenly put in the position of getting a quick shift to <Col N="557" /> another part of the county, which would be detrimental in so far as the education of his family was concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will mention it very quickly.  In this case nobody could ever accuse the member of the Garda Síochána concerned of having taken sides with any political Party or individuals of any political Party.  He did his work honestly and conscientiously. He was told to be ready for a quick shift.  What is the mystery with the Minister and his officials? The Minister gave a letter to Deputy Corish on this subject.  I asked Deputy Corish.  I did not ask the Minister because we probably do not see eye to eye on everything and I did not wish to approach him and make the position somewhat embarrassing between the two of us.  I have the reply from the Minister.  That sergeant of the Garda Síochána has not been shifted since.  He got a last minute reprieve but the axe is still held over his head. In six months' time, he will see what happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that the Minister had anything to do with the threat of transfer but somebody had.  I will go so far as to say that, in my honest opinion, the local superintendent or chief superintendent had nothing to do with it.  It did, I believe, emanate from Dublin.  I am quite satisfied that it may not have had any connection with the Minister at that time.  It was probably done without the Minister's consent, without his knowing anything about it.  It happened, and when the six months are up, we will see what happens.  The Minister got letters of <Col N="558" /> protest from the local clergy and from the local town council and from practically everyone about this transfer.  Did that not show that there was something mysterious behind it?  That should not happen.</P>
    <P>All I am saying to the Minister at this stage is that the letter he sent to Deputy Corish, the protests he got from the local people, were of such a nature that it would be very important at this stage for the Minister to examine the entire file himself again to see that an injustice will not be done to a member of the Garda Síochána who has been doing such a good job, who has been so honest and conscientious in his work, that that threat of six months' probation, as it were, will be removed.  If that is not done, there will be more unrest in the town. I leave it to the Minister at this stage to examine the situation regarding the threatened transfer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was deeply interested, as were the two previous speakers, in that part of the Minister's speech in which he said:</P>
      <P>Representations are frequently made against proposals to close down stations or reduce them to one-man units.  I should like to assure Deputies that these proposals which fall to be approved by me personally, arise only in cases where, by reason of the absence of crime, the sparsity of population, etc., I am satisfied that such reductions can be made without detriment to police efficiency.</P>
      <P>I would take it from that, that if any Deputy could show that the cause of crime or breaches of law and order was the fact that there were no guards stationed in an area, that would be sufficient justification for consideration of the erection or restoration of a station in an area.  A serious example of this is the murder of the old lady in a shop in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said at Question Time the other day to me and to Deputy Tully and other Deputies who referred to the matter, that we were endeavouring to be guards and policemen here.  I would not say we would have the <Col N="559" /> qualifications but we have the qualification of ordinary citizens to tell the Minister that he would not have that qualification either.  The way things are going, the Garda do not seem to be that well qualified in crime detection. The reason is that the Garda are not living in the area.  A murder is committed. Cars appear with strange gardaí in them as far as the people are concerned and they go around making inquiries and the people all fade away. I put it to the Minister that you could not beat the old idea&mdash;it was an English idea&mdash;of the village policeman, who lived in the area with a colleague or three or four colleagues, depending on the size of the station.  They knew everybody in the area and everybody knew them.  When we had these small Garda stations, the gardaí were friendly with the people and had the trust of the people.  They walked along their beat and somebody said to them: &ldquo;How are you doing about that case? Do you not know that Mick So-and-So was up at that corner last night?&rdquo; Those gardaí on the beat got the information they needed.  At present the gardaí are not getting the information.</P>
    <P>The purpose of a police force is the maintenance of law and order, in the first place, the prevention of crime, in the second, and the detection of crime, in the third.  If you want to prevent crime or any breach of the law, there is no better deterrent than the presence of the man in uniform in a particular area.  It is a serious matter that in face of a wave of juvenile delinquency and breaches of the law, the Minister is reducing the number of gardaí, the number of stations and is not recruiting to the Force.</P>
    <P>The Minister was kind enough to meet the Mayor of Waterford and a representative deputation about the building of a new Garda station in that city.  At present the gardaí are down at one end of the city on Adelphi Quay.  That station is to be closed and a big central station is to be built at Ballybricken.  But the people will be in the same predicament.  They will still be from two to three miles away from the station and the old system <Col N="560" /> of the man on the beat in the outlying areas in places such as Waterford will be gone.  That is bad.</P>
    <P>Two and a half years ago, I came into this House and told the Minister certain facts about what was happening in Waterford but he paid no attention to me.  My colleague, Deputy Kyne, was inclined to agree with the Minister and the Minister may have been influenced by the fact that Deputy Kyne agreed with him.  However, I was right and I will now prove to the Minister that I was right.  The fact that a city of the size of Waterford is left without patrols, particularly at night time, is detrimental to the maintenance of law and order.</P>
    <P>This is a quotation from the <i>Waterford Star:</i></P>
    <P>This incident occurred three days after the Minister for Justice told Mr. T.A. Kyne in the Dáil that he had been informed by the Gardaí that reports that the female residents of St. John's Park, Waterford, were afraid to venture out alone at night owing to the presence in the area of a marauder who attacked unprotected females, were without foundation.</P>
    <P>Mr. Haughey added that no complaints of assault on women or girls in the area mentioned had been made to the Gardaí nor had they any reason to think that such assaults had occurred.  In fact only one complaint of such an assault in the city of Waterford in recent times had been made.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that some complaints of a much less serious kind had been made to the Gardaí and had received and would continue to receive all possible attention.</P>
    <P>There was a note to this which says:</P>
    <P>To avoid causing distress to the family we are withholding the name of the girl who was accosted.</P>

      <P>And so are the <i>Munster Express</i> and the <i>Evening <Col N="561" /> Herald</i> keeping an eye on the Minister. The paper continues:</P>
      <P>A Garda spokesman in Waterford said this week that an incident in which a girl was accosted by a young man in the southern part of the city is under investigation.</P>
      <P>I had received many complaints from people about these attacks and I wanted them to go to the Garda and report them but they would not do so. I appealed to the parents of one girl to go to the Garda but they would not do so because they did not want their daughter to have to appear in court.</P>
      <P>In the <i>Waterford News and Star</i> of 5th April 1963, there is a report of a suspended sentence given to a man when convicted of assault.  His name and address are given.  The gardaí had been watching him for some time but they could not watch him all over the city as they had to keep buzzing around in a car.  That man got three months in jail from the district justice in Waterford.  If it had been another district justice, he might have sent him to Van Diemen's Land.</P>

      <P>In the <i>Munster Express and Waterford Star</i> of 29th November, 1962 there is the following statement:</P>
      <P>It was a rather serious matter and offences of this kind were very common in the city.  The Gardaí were under fire from all quarters and were asked why they were not doing more.  When a culprit was detected and brought before the court, punishment which would deter others from committing similar acts should be imposed.</P>
      <P>That is a quotation from a Garda officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to state here that I have nothing whatever to say against the efficiency, willingness and courtesy of the gardaí but I have everything to say regarding the position they are being placed in by the Minister and his Department.  In Waterford, they are all packed away in one station; <Col N="562" /> there are not enough of them; and there are not enough men for the beat. There is no better deterrent than a man in uniform walking along the footpath and it seems to be the idea of the Department to disperse all these men and to replace them by a few men flying about in motor cars.  Of course it may be the cheese-paring attitude of the Minister for Finance and his Department that is grinding down the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>This quotation is right up to the minute.  It is from the <i>Waterford News and Star</i> of January, 1964, and it is as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When reports of such assaults got out, it caused mass hysteria amongst the females of the city,&rdquo; commented Inspector T. Leahy at Waterford Court when he prosecuted in a case concerning assaults on girls.</P>
    <P>Let me say this to the Minister and his officials.  These things would not happen if the gardaí were in the position of being able to patrol our towns and cities and were able to look after the maintenance of law and order.  The best way in which that can be done in a city such as Waterford is not to build a white elephant in Ballybricken but to build five small police stations in the city or to build one large one and four smaller ones.  With three, four or five gardaí and a sergeant, there would always be gardaí in the area and the sergeant would be there. I know of a housing scheme with 600 people, 2½ miles from a Garda station. There are long avenues there and young people walk home at night along them.  There is no patrol and there are no gardaí.  There is no use in the Minister's trying to salve his conscience by saying that a patrol car buzzed through one of the streets and went off: that is useless.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to change a policy. I discovered that from the Minister for Transport and Power: how wrong he was and how bitterly he regretted it.  I should not like this Minister to be put in that position.  I will give the Minister credit for receiving a deputation from Waterford Corporation&mdash;unlike his colleague who locks himself up in an ivory tower and hides behind <Col N="563" /> his officials and will not let anybody see him.  I appeal to this Minister to change the policy of centralisation and buzzing around in motorcars.  I do not care what countries have given him reports or what people have told him about their squad cars and what they are able to do with them.  The Minister should stick to the system of small stations with gardaí in them.  Their very presence in the place will do more to maintain law and order, to detect crime and to protect the Irish people than anything else.  Furthermore, he will have more friendly relations between the Garda and the people and that is what we want.</P>
    <P>One of the things that irk the normal citizen&mdash;and the citizen is abnormal and is wrong in a lot of cases&mdash;is all these traffic regulations and parking laws, and so on, that are necessary.  I am saying this against ourselves&mdash;the ordinary Irish people. If a garda comes along one of the busy streets in Dublin and tries to move any of us away, we are a little bit annoyed about it, but the man is only doing his duty.  All of these things that the gardaí have to do and all the short answers they get from people often make them a bit irritable.  It finishes up that both the man in blue, in that case, and the ordinary Irish citizen are, we would say, not on great terms and, as a whole, the relations of the Force with the people are not as friendly as the Minister would like them to be.</P>
    <P>In other countries they have a special corps in the police for dealing with traffic and I would ask the Minister to consider that for the larger centres.  It would be well if there were men with maybe a different type of uniform who are members of the gardaí and who would be in the traffic section.  Their duty would be to look after parking areas and to attend to breaches of the law as regards traffic in the cities.  That would not prevent the ordinary garda in the country or city areas from intervening, if he saw a citizen flagrantly breaking the law. I should like the Minister and his officials to examine that line of country.</P>
    <P>I am often a little confused as to <Col N="564" /> where the Minister for Justice starts when it comes to traffic and where the Minister for Local Government takes up.  I know that the Minister for Local Government puts up the traffic signs, and so on.  The Minister for Justice sees to it that the traffic laws are obeyed.</P>
    <P>I would commend the Minister for Local Government on the drive he is making to endeavour to have safety on our roads but I would say to the Minister for Justice that he should join with him.  This will have to be an appeal from the Government&mdash;I would say even from the Oireachtas.  In spite of appeals by the Minister for Local Government&mdash;and very good appeals they are and the Minister did his business very well: I am not denying that or finding fault with it&mdash;seemingly it is very difficult to break through to the Irish people and therefore the Minister for Justice, as the other Minister concerned with traffic, should consult with his colleague about this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned decorations for bravery.  I would remind him of Maurice Ryan, aged 39, an unemployed labourer of Glin, County Carlow.  He went to the aid of the gardaí in that terrible fracas down there.  He went to the aid of Garda Bartholomew Foley and he lost his life.  We are great people for commemorating our heroes.  Maurice Ryan was a great hero.  That man did not owe this country very much.  He was unemployed.  There was a frightful scene.  There was an Englishman there&mdash;a great Englishman&mdash;and he went to help the gardaí in Glin.  But this man&mdash;Maurice Ryan&mdash;out of all the other people who were there, lost his life.  Now that the case is over and the people have been sentenced&mdash; whatever happened to them I do not know&mdash;there should be some recognition by the Department of Justice to Maurice Ryan's people.  I shall leave that to the Minister.  I have an idea he will consider it favourably.</P>
    <P>The last thing I have to say is to appeal that a Garda barracks be built in the town of Tramore.  The present barracks is hidden in the old coastguard station away out on the coast. <Col N="565" /> Tramore is a very busy place in the summer and it is inconvenient that the Garda barracks should be situated a long distance from the centre of the town.  This thing has been going on for years.  I have an idea that if the Minister sent a letter to the officer concerned and said to him: &ldquo;I want a result about this proposed new station for Tramore,&rdquo; it would be built.  If there are difficulties about the site, would the Minister ask his officials to communicate with the Tramore Town Commissioners?  They would meet the officials on the ground and if there is a dispute about the site or anything else, maybe the whole thing could be fixed up there by the Town Commissioners. The Town Commissioners have acquired the railway station and that might do but it is time something was done about it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I just want to stress the importance of the small police station and of the gardaí going on the beat.  I would not like the Minister to brush that aside and say that in the interests of either economy or efficiency that was going because it may not be in the interests of economy but it is in the interests of efficiency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Murder stalks the land at present and in this city there is a great wave of apprehension, of which the Minister is no doubt as much aware as I am, in regard to safety of life and limb.  The late Deputy Norton not long ago asked the Minister by way of supplementary question what was being done about the murderers who were at large and of whom there were so many that they could form a club. Since then their numbers have been added to.  This is the most serious aspect of the administration of justice confronting the people today.  It is a sad commentary on the state of affairs into which the administration of law has fallen when the ordinary inoffensive citizen cannot go about his or her lawful occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not concerned about the allocation of blame in this because that does not serve much purpose and it develops into abuse as between one side and the other; nor am I concerned to make it a matter of political advantage to my <Col N="566" /> own Party or a disadvantage to another Party, to the Minister or any other individual, but I am concerned that we should seriously consider what steps can be taken to restore public confidence, which is rapidly diminishing, in the administration of law as it relates to public safety.  Other Deputies spoke about the change in the system of Garda protection from the old one of the beat to the present mobile system of squad cars.  I do not know whether the substitution of squad cars for the old system was not inevitable but I do know from my contacts with members of the old RIC and from talks with them about the manner in which the law was administered in their day that the system seemed to be far more effective than our system is.  It was, as we know, primarily designed for a political purpose, to keep &ldquo;tabs&rdquo; on the Irish people but it was a system which also kept &ldquo;tabs&rdquo; on ordinary crime and gave, as far as I can gather, a great feeling of security to the people.</P>
    <P>I remember an old policeman telling me that he was in a barracks of four and the area with which they had to deal was divided into four.  A map of their area was provided and was squared off into four sections and each policeman was given an area and he had to know every man, woman, child, dog and &ldquo;divil&rdquo; in the area and everything about them.  Therefore, you had a police system which reached to the very last person in the whole country. While it was a political device by the British, it worked very well in the ordinary matter of protecting the people from outrage.  Of course, since the State was founded, we have been moving further and further away from that kind of police scrutiny.  I suppose that was an inevitable development but we have not found anything as effective to substitute for the old system of the beat policeman referred to by Deputy Lynch.  On the contrary, we have murderers going around with complete impunity.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary situation in a small country, where you might say almost everybody is known or related to everybody else, that murderers, not one or two but quite a number of them, can go about without being detected.  It is a most depressing <Col N="567" /> thought.  The public, especially in Dublin, as I am sure the Minister is aware, very often make the mistake of criticising the Garda for this situation. Every day they walk the streets they see plenty of gardaí available to book people who have parked their cars in the wrong places, or who stop their cars for longer than a few minutes in a busy street, or who have been, perhaps, deemed to be speeding.  The public view is that there seems to be plenty of policemen available for this kind of work and that anybody who stops his car in the centre of Dublin is nearly sure to get a ticket, yet we seem to fall down on the most important aspect which is the primary function of a police force, the protection of life and property.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested, but I do not know how true it is because I am not familiar with the identities of the various high officials in the gardaí, that one possible explanation of our present dilemma may be that we have not adhered to what is a very good principle, that it takes a policeman to run a police force; that the best man you can have to do any job is the man who has done it from the word go, who worked his way up from the bottom, who knows the problems, as in this case, of law and order, and when he eventually rises to the top he is the best man to administer the law. Whether or not that applies I do not know but I have heard it expressed not alone by people attached to the Labour Party but people in Fianna Fáil and other Parties and by people who have no particular political affiliations at all.  Whether that is a useful observation or not is something the Minister will have to determine for himself, but it does seem that we have something to look into in the detection of murderers.</P>
    <P>The same might be said about burglaries.  It is difficult for me to talk without any degree of ire on the question of housebreaking because&mdash;I am not saying this for publicity purposes or anything else&mdash;I have been a victim eight times in seven years and without any sign of anybody being detected for the offences.  There is a growing volume of housebreaking and <Col N="568" /> every time we pick up the newspapers we read about more and more.  I have talked about this problem with the Garda Síochána.  Some of them have said: &ldquo;But look what happens.  We capture some of these fellows and bring them before the court.  What do they get?  A homily from the district justice.&rdquo;  In a great many cases they are told to be good boys, and sent home.  Before ever they enter the sobering portals of Mountjoy, to get up at six o'clock in the morning, and learn the facts of life, they become almost hardened criminals.</P>
    <P>This idea of consideration for offenders has been pushed too far in the wrong direction.  Of course, there should be consideration for offenders, but there should also be consideration for law-abiding citizens.  I commend the Minister's efforts for penal reform. The Inter-Departmental Committee he mentioned is a very good idea.  I think, however, that the public generally&mdash;certainly I myself am&mdash;are a bit browned off with the decisions of district justices when these offenders appear before them.  We read in the papers philosophical dissertations from the Bench.  These are not the province of these gentlemen, most of whom are appointed to the Bench by virtue of political patronage.  These decisions do not seem to take into account the facts of life.</P>
    <P>A young person given his head can become a menace to society.  There is a feeling abroad to-day amongst these young people, among a certain fractious and dangerous fraction of them, that they can get away with anything. This idea is nurtured by the vulgar television serialisation and corny Hollywood pseudo-philosophies.  That can only be corrected by bringing these people face to face with the hard facts of life.  The Garda have told me that capturing these young offenders is an idle exercise on their part because they are merely told to go home and be good boys.  Then there is a next time, and a next time, until eventually they become incorrigible criminals and have to be put away.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no mention at all in his brief of these murders. Surely that is something that should be <Col N="569" /> discussed on this Estimate.  The question of the safety and protection of life is very important.  It passes comprehension, as Deputy T. Lynch pointed out, how in the daytime, around dusk, people can go into a shop in a crowded city thoroughfare, beat up two ladies, killing one in the process, and then walk out, and not be heard of again.  It cannot be argued that there was no public co-operation. There was ample co-operation. Everyone in the city was roused because of this brutal act.  I am sure no citizen would hesitate to get in touch with the Garda if the opportunity offered to bring these people to justice. Several people did try to help, in good faith, but apparently something went wrong, and these murderers got away. It is not good enough that we should just sit back and say: &ldquo;Oh, it is just another of those things.&rdquo;  We should do something about it.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with the administration of law in Dublin and throughout the country that permits these things to happen?  There was Wexford; there was Carlow.  In rural areas there may be a suggestion of agrarianism, which traditionally makes it difficult to detect crime, but crime in the ordinary sense of the word should not be as difficult to detect as it appears to be.  We must tackle the situation.  We have a duty to the people to do something about it. Otherwise, this will happen again. Something must be done.  Would the Minister have an investigation to see what steps are necessary to bring about a restoration of public confidence in his Department, because confidence in his Department is fast disappearing?</P>
    <P>I should like to commend the Garda Síochána.  There is no job so difficult or so disagreeable as the policeman's job.  Neither is there any job so essential. Will the Garda benefit by the recommended 12 per cent increase in pay?  I hope they will.  The Minister should implement that recommendation in their regard as quickly as possible.  Everybody realises we must have a force adequately recompensed for their duties.  We must have a satisfied force.  At the best of times their job is a difficult one.</P>
    <P>When the big occasion comes, they <Col N="570" /> do excellent work.  They did a good job on the occasion of the late President Kennedy's visit wherever they were during those momentous days.  It is a pity they were not at the Garden Party.  They might have put some manners into some of the people who were there.  Their conduct was exemplary and I am glad the Minister gave them full credit.</P>
    <P>With regard to the training of young people committed to institutions, there is a standard acceptance that young people should be trained in, of all things, cobbling.  I have seen chaps come out of these places great cobblers.  That is a trade that offers little or no opportunity for employment these days.  Institutional cobbling is entirely different from the cobbling that goes on in the commercial shop in the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear some got employment, but it strikes me as somewhat anachronistic and Dickensian in these days to train these young people in cobbling.  It would be an excellent idea to train both the youth and the adult in handicrafts which would enable them to earn a livelihood.  I do not know whether they still sew mailbags in Mountjoy, it is so long since I was there, but it often struck me as a most soul-destroying and unrewarding task in the sense that so much human labour was wasted and so much human spirit depressed. The committee to which the Minister referred should consider substituting some form of remunerative employment, which would not cut across the rights of people outside, for the old traditional penal duties imposed on prisoners.  I do not see how the products of prisons could impinge very greatly on any market.  Handicrafts, such as leatherwork, should be encouraged. I would urge the Minister to do his best in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ground rents were touched on in the course of the Minister's speech.  He indicated recently that the report of the Commission on Ground Rents would shortly be available.  I am glad <Col N="571" /> that is so.  When the Commission was set up, I feared it would enter the limbo of commissions and we would not hear about it again during our lifetime except when a question was put down.  It is good to know that the report is about to come in.  I hope that, whatever recommendations are made, no time will be lost in putting them into effect.  Ground rents, especially in and about the suburbs of Dublin, are not alone out-dated but are a downright injustice&mdash;an imposition on the people.  I do not know whether we would want to examine old prison registers, as the Minister has invited us to do.  It might be interesting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an odd thing that the Minister has not seen in his own statement the proof of the case made by Deputy Lynch and by other Deputies. If he looks at page six of his statement, paragraph 14, he will see that the overall detection rate in 1962 was 66 per cent, which happens to be exactly the same as in the preceding year.  In Dublin, it was 47 per cent and outside Dublin, it was 85 per cent. Is that not the most eloquent testimony to the fact that where the Garda are in close and intimate contact with the people the detection rate of crime is high, but the more anonymous relations between the Garda and the people become, the lower the detection rate falls?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dissent somewhat from the spirit of Deputy Dunne's approach to this problem. I do not think ferocity of sentence is the way to abate crime.  I think what deters criminals&mdash;juveniles, adolescents or mature&mdash;is the certainty of apprehension. If you could raise the detection rate to 95 per cent, I think you could afford to abate the punishments very materially.  But if you allow the detection rate to fall to 50 per cent or 60 per cent, it does not do the least good to increase the sentences to <Col N="572" /> savage dimensions in order to relieve public indignation and resentment.  I maintained in government and out of government that it is a wholly mistaken economy to withdraw Gardaí from intimate contact with the people. I believe at the root of it is a Finance desire for economy.  I believe it is a bad economy, a shortsighted economy and, in the long run, no economy at all.</P>
    <P>I have constantly made the case in government and out of government, that the whole objective of our policy should be to establish between the Garda Síochána and the people a relationship of intimate friendship.  The way to do that is to keep the Garda in constant contact with the people.  We are very fortunate in this country in that when the State was started, we got off on the right foot in the matter of establishing a police force that was unarmed, owing to the extraordinary foresight and wisdom of our first Minister for Justice, the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins.  He insisted on launching the Garda into the extraordinary tempestuous atmosphere then obtaining as an unarmed force and threw upon the original members of that Force the altogether intolerable burden of facing the problems they had to face unarmed. It was a decision for which all generations of our people should be forever grateful.  They should be grateful to those who took it and to the members of the Garda Síochána who implemented it, some of whom are still serving in that Force, of which this country has every reason to be proud.</P>
    <P>From that original decision and the Garda's effective implementation of it, there has grown up in this country in my life time a relationship between the police force and the people which any continental country would give their left arm to create.  Go to practically any country on the continent and compare the attitude of the people to their police force with the attitude of our people to our police force.  You will find there is quite a dramatic contrast.  On the continent the people look on the police force as something in the nature of one of the hazards of life.  Here it is true to say there are people who would regard the absence of the Garda as a hazard of <Col N="573" /> our lives.  The presence of the Garda is a reassurance and a certainty that the rights and privileges of the ordinary citizen will be adequately protected.</P>
    <P>I cordially endorse what Deputy O'Higgins said when he declared that the function of the Garda was not primarily to detect crime but to prevent crime.  I remember when I became Minister for Agriculture in 1948 there was an acute shortage of bacon.  Bacon was cured under licence in order that there should be a fair distribution of the available supply.  There broke out in this city a practice of the illegal curing of bacon, which gave rise to very undesirable consequences.  I arranged with the then Minister for Justice that uniformed Gardaí would be put in the vicinity of premises where I suspected illegal activities to be going on.  I remember the Garda authorities saying to me: &ldquo;If you put uniformed men there, you will never catch them.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;I do not want to catch them.  I want to fix them with notice that I am watching them.  I want them to know from dawn of day to nightfall that there is a Garda standing there and, if they try to break the law, they will be promptly arrested.&rdquo; Within a fortnight, the whole thing was brought under control.  If we had played a game of catch-as-catch-can, trying to catch them by Gardaí not in uniform, it would not have been brought under control.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister that the case made by Deputy Lynch and others is sound and valid.  The surest method of preventing crime is to get contact between the Gardaí and the people.  This method should be very acceptable to us for the historical reasons I have set out.  The first and most urgent step towards a realisation of that is a reversal of the policy of the centralisation of the garda.</P>
    <P>One of the most effective means of dealing with the problem to which Deputy Seán Dunne referred, the growing feeling, which undoubtedly there is, of apprehension in the city of Dublin and indeed in the country, that murder is not properly detected and grave crimes are passing without <Col N="574" /> detection, would be to multiply the number of Gardaí on the beat.  I make no apology for drawing again to the attention of the House the fact which is manifest to all who know the country that in rural Ireland if a crime is committed, within 24 hours, one of the Gardaí in the town or village is approached by somebody who knows him well and who tells him pretty clearly where to look for the perpetrator of the crime.  The evidence of that is that detection of crime outside Dublin is 85 per cent.</P>
    <P>Where there was a regular patrol of beats in this city, or indeed in the old days in London or in New York or in other big cities of the United States of America, it was notorious that if a crime was committed, there was a very high probability that the policeman who was familiar with the particular area in which the crime was committed would get pretty prompt information from somebody in the area who was in a position to inform him.  Over and above that, a garda who is familiar with a particular restricted area of the city of Dublin gets to know practically everybody there, and if he sees strange people operating in the vicinity, just as happens in rural Ireland it almost automatically registers on his mind, and if subsequently an offence is committed which is not characteristic of the sort of people he knows live in the district, his mind immediately turns to the unusual characters he saw knocking around and there is immediately available to the police a very useful line on suspects and a description from a garda who is trained in the business of observing unfamiliar faces and figures.</P>
    <P>I would urge strongly on the Minister to cause a re-examination of this whole policy, which I believe is primarily instigated by the Department of Finance with a view towards economy, and to revert to the more regular patrol of the city streets, albeit that such patrols are supported by the mobile forces which have been created. The point to be borne in mind is that useful as these mobile forces are, it is manifest that they are no substitute for the intimate contact which in our circumstances <Col N="575" /> it is eminently practicable to maintain between the Garda Síochána and the ordinary public by adequate patrolling of beats in the city.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise some other questions of a specific character.  What is to be done about itinerants?  I know the Minister has received the Report of the Commission on itinerancy.  I think everybody is agreed that, particularly in the vicinity of Dublin, we cannot go on chasing the itinerants from Billy to Jack unless we are in a position to say to them at some stage: &ldquo;There are suitable camping grounds with proper sanitary facilities on them and if you want to abide in the city environs, you must repair to these environs or else go out to the countryside and engage in your itinerant activity, but you may not constitute a menace to public health in the city when such camping places properly equipped are available.&rdquo; We seem to be in the ridiculous position that we tolerate the encampment of itinerants on eminently unsuitable sites which are notoriously a menace to public health.  Then when some nuisance turns up from England and starts kicking up a row because he has elected to come and live in a caravan in circumstances into which we need not inquire too closely and it becomes necessary to take some positive action, this gentleman from England can hold up the community to odium by saying: &ldquo;You are driving these poor itinerants from Billy to Jack and they have nowhere to go&rdquo; and we have no answer to that.</P>
    <P>We should not allow an outsider to put us in that position because it gives justification to what I think is very probably a fraudulent kind of agitation which this gentleman is organising for reasons best known to himself. However, a public nuisance of that kind sometimes serves a useful purpose. It brings vividly to our own eyes a shortcoming in ourselves.  We should recognise that shortcoming which relates to the provision for itinerants who elect to camp during certain seasons of the year in or about the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>As regards the general question of <Col N="576" /> itinerants in rural Ireland, I did not get very much light from the report, but as the situation stands in the country at present, the itinerants are no great affliction to anyone.  They do put horses in people's fields which is a very exasperating thing to do.  They do obstruct roads but if they keep off the trunk roads and make their encampments on county roads where motor traffic is not heavy and if they keep their animals under some kind of control, I believe the problem of the itinerants in rural Ireland is manageable.</P>
    <P>The situation obtaining in Dublin in regard to itinerants is not edifying.  It ought to be dealt with and I cannot see how it can be dealt with unless we are in a position to say to them that there are certain approved areas with proper accommodation where they can abide. Until we do that, we cannot go on shifting them from one illegal camping place to another.  I would urge the Minister to take counsel with the Dublin Corporation, the Dublin County Council authorities and probably the authorities of Cork Corporation and of other cities to see that the anomaly which has existed in Dublin and its suburbs in regard to this problem will not be allowed to arise elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that the report of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána on crime is available only for the year ended September, 1962. Would it not be reasonable that the Commissioner's report for the year ended September, 1963, would be available to Deputies before the middle of February, 1964?  Apparently it does not come out until April.  It is not a very long document; it is not a very original document.  It is mainly a collection of statistics.  I suggest to the Minister that he might suggest to the authorities that they could, with advantage, get the circular out somewhat earlier.</P>
    <P>I remember when I became Minister for Agriculture, I discovered that some of the reports emanating from that Department were two or three years in arrears, but when we put our <Col N="577" /> minds to it, we were very easily able to bring them out, from that time forth, within the financial year after that to which the reports related.</P>
    <P>The Minister says quite blandly:</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the fines-on-the-spot scheme came into operation in Dublin on 1st April, 1963, coinciding with the coming into operation of the new traffic bye-laws. It seems to be working very well.</P>
    <P>It does not seem to me to be working very well.  I met a distracted lady recently in a street in Dublin and she said she was parking her motor car in an illegal place.  I said that was not proper procedure and she said: &ldquo;It is all right.  I have a bunch of red tickets and I put one on the car when I am parking it illegally.  They never put on a second one.&rdquo;  I also met other respectable citizens who when confronted with a parking ticket, said: &ldquo;Sure, it is worth 10/- to park for eight hours. They never put on a second one.  What about it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not the way to enforce the law.  I do not think that is good citizenship. I think we ought to make laws which people can reasonably be expected to observe.  It is no substitute for that to make laws which people habitually defy, and shrug their shoulders and ask: &ldquo;Is it not worth it.&rdquo;  It is very important to preserve the principle amongst law-abiding citizens that they do not want to come in conflict with the law, either through the medium of prosecution, or being fined on the spot.  It would cause me very great concern, if I were fined for anything.  I suppose the 10/- would not make very much difference one way or the other, but it would cause me considerable distress to have it on record that I came into conflict with the law, and I think that should be the case with most of us.  This business of fining people on the spot, as it is called, is undermining that sentiment and that is something which is greatly to be deplored.</P>
    <P>Over and above that, I want to remind the Minister that when the Road Traffic Bill was before this House on 1st March, 1961, as reported <Col N="578" /> at column 1056, volume 186 of the Official Report I said:</P>
    <P>I do not complain of the necessity for introducing somewhat more stringent parking regulations than we have had heretofore in the city of Dublin but you cannot divorce from your mind, if you are an ordinarily observant person, that there does appear to be operating in the streets of Dublin to-day a sort of general vigilance to detect any minor parking offences on the part of anybody and that the distribution of tickets and the rebuking of citizens for parking offences has become very much more frequent. Indeed, if one is driving a car oneself in the streets of Dublin to-day, where heretofore you parked your car&mdash;and unless you parked on a pedestrian crossing you had no reason to apprehend that you would get into trouble with the Guards&mdash; now you are almost afraid to park it at any pavement for fear this is an area in which you could come into collision with the Gardaí.  For a great majority of people the very experience of being remonstrated with by the Gardaí for having broken the law is a disagreeable experience but if it happens again and again a new kind of atmosphere begins to arrive and the people begin to look upon the Gardaí as a menace; sections of the community begin to look upon the Gardaí as a menace who never looked on them in that way before.</P>
    <P>Then I said that was something which should be watched and that we should bear in mind what was discovered in Great Britain by experience but too late&mdash;and I resume the quotation:</P>
    <P>... that minor traffic offences of this kind would be better made the concern of a body of men whose sole function would be that of traffic warden.  If Gardaí must be required to patrol the streets in far greater than normal numbers in order to enforce traffic regulations, I cannot see why it should not be possible to provide that, instead of multiplying the number of Gardaí to enforce these traffic regulations, <Col N="579" /> you should have a body of traffic wardens whose concern it would be to enforce parking regulations or minor traffic regulations, such as not stopping at pedestrian crossings or matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>I went on to say that you should not forbid the Gardaí to intervene in a manifest breach of the law, but that you should avoid&mdash;and I resume the quotation:</P>
    <P>... associating the Gardaí in the mind of the ordinary law-abiding citizen with what is regarded unreasonably, I admit, but none the less in fact, as a kind of harassment and persecution.</P>
    <P>I went on to say:</P>
    <P>... as motor traffic tends to grow, as the necessity for more rigid traffic regulations grows in urban centres, we ought seriously to consider committing that responsibility to traffic wardens who will not wear the uniform of the Gardaí and who will not be directly associated in the minds of the ordinary public with that force.</P>
    <P>I want to renew that representation to the Minister.  I think there is a very grave danger arising of a growing number of people saying it would be better for the Garda to go and find a murderer in Ballybough than to be prosecuting motor car drivers in the streets of Dublin.  That would be a very undesirable atmosphere to grow up. Our concern, and the concern of all responsible citizens, ought to be to support and assist the Garda in the discharge of their duties, but the multiplicity of minor remonstrations which the Garda are called upon to make to respectable citizens in respect of traffic offences, threatens seriously to arouse, between the most respectable elements in the community and the Garda, a mutual atmosphere of suspicion and resentment.</P>
    <P>I renew my representations to the Minister that he should employ in controlling city traffic infringements, a body of traffic wardens who would do the bulk of this kind of supervision of the average respectable citizen who infringes the traffic laws in minor ways <Col N="580" /> by parking offences.  Not only would that remove a cause of friction between the public and the Garda, but it would create the additional advantage that if a traffic warden conducted himself too officiously, or unreasonably, the responsible citizen in that situation could turn to the Garda on duty and say: &ldquo;Look, this traffic warden is acting up; he is misbehaving,&rdquo; and you would restore the Garda to their proper status, that of being the friend and protector of the law-abiding citizen rather than a uniformed harassment which some people tend to look upon them as being at the present time, because this unsuitable duty is being thrust upon them.  It is certainly true that, if relieved of those trivial duties, more Gardaí would be available for patrolling the beat in the city of Dublin, for the collection of information, and for the prevention of crime which is the principal function they ought to discharge.</P>
    <P>There are certain other specific matters I want to mention.  I cannot be critical of the Garda.  I find that, as a whole, they are a splendid body of men.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to something which I think is deserving of attention.  In my experience of mankind, I find that you get much more out of people, as a general rule, by indicating your appreciation of their good performance, rather than habitually nagging at them over any defects in their efforts to carry out their duties.  I saw an article in last week's <i>Sunday Independent</i> descriptive of the arrival in this country of a foreigner who had taken out Irish citizenship.  He described how he moved into his house and the various processes which a stranger in taking up residence here has to go through. Finally, he said: &ldquo;I conceived it to be my duty to go to the Garda to notify them of my having taken up residence in their area.  When I went in and produced my passport and told the young Garda who was at the desk what I had come for, he said: `You are not in the right place'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This man said: &ldquo;I felt a bit crestfallen. I was not very clear where he wanted me to go, when a sergeant came along and said: `That is not the way to talk when a stranger comes in. <Col N="581" /> The first thing you should say is: &ldquo;You are welcome.&rdquo;  When you have said that, then find out what he wants and see if you can help him'.&rdquo;  That good sergeant had more understanding of public relations and tourism than many highly-paid officials of the Tourist Board.  Any of us with experience of travelling on the continent will know what an ordeal it is to batter your way through police regulations.  If you are not carrying a diplomatic passport, it is as much as your life is worth to go to a police station and unless you are a tough customer and prepared to stand on your rights, you are likely to get a pretty rough time&mdash;indeed, in any circumstances you are likely to get a rough time.  That Garda sergeant understood very fully the atmosphere of apprehension a stranger feels in the presence of a police force with which he is unfamiliar and with that gesture, in my opinion, he made a most valuable and significant contribution to the whole attitude of the public service in co-operating in the desirable aim of promoting a great industry.</P>
    <P>I took steps to see that the tourist authority would acknowledge that and I think it is a matter the Minister might correctly draw the attention of the Commissioner to so that we could multiply the number of public servants who appreciate the difference a little act of supererogation of that kind makes.  It would be greatly to the advantage of the community as a whole.  I think the Minister will agree that this kind of thing happens very often and nobody says anything about it.  I think they should be mentioned, and I do not apologise for reproducing it here.  I remember when I was Minister for Agriculture going to Dún Laoghaire at nine o'clock at night and going to an hotel there for dinner and finding one of the civil servants of my Department there.  I asked him what he was doing and he told me that there was a party over from Germany buying horses, that he thought it would be a bit lonely for them and that he came out to show them around the city.  He knew that this would help to promote the sale of horses.  It is these small acts of supererogation that distinguish the true public servants from those who <Col N="582" /> are concerned to do no more than what they are paid for.</P>
    <P>I want to mention another matter that is causing very grave concern to me and to other people.  I shall mention it on the Minister's Estimate because I think it is as suitable as any other.  It is not right for us to close our eyes to the grave social problem that exists in respect of young boys and girls who emigrate from here to Britain.  This matter has been brought very much before the public eye by a benevolent gentleman named Mr. Hauser.  I am sure he is a very well-meaning man and believes himself to be very highly trained and experienced but I think he gets the facts of the situation a bit out of proportion and possily overstates the case.  The fact remains that a great many young people going out of this country find themselves in an environment to which it is very hard for them to adjust themselves and, as a result, a great many social tragedies supervene.</P>
    <P>Boys get into trouble and end up in jail; girls get into trouble, sometimes end up in jail and sometimes on the streets.  That is very tragic.  When I ask myself how are we to help, I consider the first line of defence is the parents.  We should all concern ourselves in our own neighbourhood to persuade parents not to let young girls especially go to England if they are not going to friends.  They should have a home to go to.  Girls going to England should go to relatives and preferably should have the prospect of employment before going.  The plain truth is that for young girls to go to industrial centres in England without suitable employment and without homes, aunts or cousins or trustworthy neighbours prepared to receive them is to take an appalling risk.  Our first duty is to bring home that fact to the parents of these girls here in Ireland.  Despite all we can do at the family level of exhortation and warning, a great many of these boys and girls are going and may continue to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to make <Col N="583" /> a suggestion.  The great difficulty here is the tendency for everybody to say: &ldquo;It is not my responsibility.&rdquo;  Everybody says that what goes on in England is not his responsibility. When I reflect on this problem, I find it very hard to propose any constructive solution but I think there is a solution worth considering.  I think the great desideratum is to make contact with them and the great problem is that most of them, when they have got into trouble, do not want to have contact made with them. They want to disappear.  They have made this catastrophic choice, very often through no fault of their own, and they are ashamed.  They cannot feel that people want to help them to put their mistakes behind them and get back on their feet again.  They recoil from help.  How do you deal with that situation?  I often wonder if we could not emulate in some way the expedient conceived by the late President Kennedy as administered by Sergeant Shriver, in the Sons of Peace, a corps of voluntary social workers who would undertake to go to some of the centres in England where this problem is most acute and perhaps take employment themselves at the kind of work these girls and boys do.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  There are a number of voluntary bodies doing it but I think their resources are strained far beyond their capacity and the peace corps concept envisages young girls undertaking assignments of this kind with no prospects of material reward but at least they would have board and lodging paid for.  If young American kids go to Peru, Bolivia, to Africa or to other places to help the people in those areas, they get little or no pay, but they are provided and there is some system of administration.  I think the Legion of Mary and other bodies are doing all in their power but simply cannot be everywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the London police courts, to take the crudest end of the problem, simply have not got enough probation officers to deal with this problem and <Col N="584" /> I suppose they are inclined to say: &ldquo;Why should we be breaking our necks to provide probation officers to deal with these minor offences?&rdquo; and they do not unduly concern themselves. I am not altogether sure that the probation services that are available and which are designed for British conditions may best suit the kind of problem we have in mind.</P>
    <P>So far as boys are concerned, I think we understand their problem. Their problem is largely one of drink, largely one of loneliness and desire for company which leads them to the public house and can produce ridiculous results.  I think I described in the House before the problem of the London Metropolitan Police finding a group of Irish chaps kicking up a row and singing outside a public house in the East End of London and, deeming it desirable in order to enjoin discretion on them, sending for a motor Black Maria which they brought down to act as a warning that they would all be packed away if they did not behave, whereupon 15 or 20 of these young lads, who were much more cheerful than they ought to be, advanced on the Black Maria, laid hands upon it, combined to say &ldquo;Heave ho&rdquo; and turned it over.  The poor metropolitan police had to send for men to get their Black Maria back on its wheels again.  They were very incensed and outraged at this conduct and, of course, it was very unseemly conduct but, from our point of view, knowing the mentality of our people, it was not criminal conduct.  It is irresponsible conduct and it is reprehensible, no doubt, but it arises from a kind of irresponsible <i>joie de vivre</i> which manifests itself in that way because these lads are divorced from the background with which they are familiar and they are in a new background of this depersonalised materialist civilisation which a great industrial city presents and so their conduct becomes irrational.</P>
    <P>I wonder if such a peace corps as I have in mind might not provide voluntary personnel which in consultation with London magistrates could supplement the work of the probation officers.  I can imagine that if we had such a peace corps as I envisage the <Col N="585" /> girls who would be prepared to participate in it working with experienced members of the Legion of Mary or other social workers in England whose resources are now strained, could help a great deal not only in locating these girls but in keeping in contact with them.  I think that is the all-important thing&mdash;keeping in contact with them, not letting them drift out of human knowledge until they turn up as statistics in a prison return.</P>
    <P>I do not underestimate the formidable difficulty of this problem but I am sure the Legion of Mary do not want any kind of financial assistance.  It is quite foreign to their activity to accept that from a State source but it would be a great blessing to them if they had a substantial addition to the available personnel for the kind of work they are trying to do.</P>
    <P>I do not by any means say that this would be certainly a success.  I am obliged to make this confession.  When President Kennedy first formulated the concept of a peace corps I thought he had taken leave of his senses.  I thought it was the daftest proposition I had ever heard.  The extraordinary thing is, it worked, and a great many people who derided the thought when he first formulated it in the United States of America have come to recognise that it has worked and to the great advantage of those to whose relief these boys and girls went and to the great advantage of the boys and girls who were being induced to participate in it.</P>
    <P>I cannot say that I am fully convinced that a similar device would work in the situation with which we find ourselves confronted at the present time but I am bound to say that I think the time has passed when we can close our eyes to the problem that exists.  The time has passed when we can claim the right to wash our hands of it on the grounds that the tragedy is proceeding outside the jurisdiction of the State.  I think the time is overdue when, if there is no better suggestion than the one I am now advancing, we ought to take steps along those lines or at least consult those who are in the field in the industrial cities of England either as probation officers or members of the Legion of Mary or <Col N="586" /> other voluntary bodies as to whether this might not help to resolve a problem which should be a cause of very great concern to us all.</P>
    <P>There are some details in relation to the Minister's speech to which I should like to refer before I conclude.  In many ways the Minister's Estimate is one of the most exciting and important from many points of view because it deals with the prison population, both juveniles and adults.  I notice that the Minister has spoken about the proposals to rebuild and develop prisons. Have we considered establishing in this country the open prison?  I am not impressed with the idea that everybody is too soft with prisoners.  I think the vast majority of prisoners going into prisons in this country are not criminals in the full sense of the term at all.  I do not think we know the real problem of criminality such as they have to struggle with in Britain or the United States of America.  I think our principal task in prisons is the redemption of the people who find their way into them.  Now that the Minister is going to take steps to improve the accommodation in Mountjoy and Portlaoise, I wonder has he considered establishing an open prison?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are working towards it in the parole system.  We let people out to work during the day and they come back at night, which is fundamentally the same idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fundamentally the same idea but in England they have set up deliberately prisons of an entirely new design founded on that general principle, which have operated to relieve pressure on the existing anti-deluvian institutions and I would like to think that, if there was to be any replacement of existing penal institutions in this country, serious consideration should be given to the provision of at least one experimental open prison where that kind of treatment could be pursued and the prisoners prepared for early return to normal life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see the Minister speaks on page 22, paragraph (m) of proposals for the accommodation of the boys at St. Patrick's Institution.  I want to say quite freely that, with the best intentions <Col N="587" /> in the world, the Borstal was wound up in Clonmel and moved up to the city by Mountjoy.  I think that was a mistaken decision and I am glad that we are now considering steps to end that position.  That decision was taken when I was a member of the Government.  I think it was a mistaken decision and I would be happy to think that plans were going forward to remove the Borstal institution to new premises.  I gather from page 22 of the Minister's statement that there are plans going forward to that end. I understood that plans were well under way for the erection of an institution somewhere out in the vicinity of Lucan.</P>

I think Deputy Flanagan was proposing that we should take over Portlaoise and convert it.  I would be loth to see that done.  I do not agree with Deputy Flanagan about that.  I think the important thing is to get Borstal youths away from a prison atmosphere in so far as we can, fully aware of the fact that you do not find angels in Borstals.</P>

      <P>So that I may be in a position to obtain and to supply to the Deputy the precise information he requires, I would be glad if he would repeat his question in more specific terms.  It will be necessary, for instance, to know whether he wishes to have casuals included or excluded.  He will appreciate that one person who moved regularly round a group of counties, staying a few nights in the casual ward of the county homes concerned would be counted several times over in any data supplied to me.  It will be necessary also to have a clearer definition of the term &ldquo;able-bodied&rdquo;. Does the Deputy, for instance, contemplate that persons, say, over 70 who, while of only limited working capacity, are ambulant and reasonably able to look after themselves in the sheltered environment of a county home, should be included in or excluded from the reply?</P>
      <P>If the Deputy puts down the question in more precise terms next week, I shall seek to obtain the information from health authorities.</P>

They concern about 50 acres of poor moory land in 50 plots varying from one rood to five acres with undefined boundaries and there is confusion as to the extent and ownership&mdash;several of the reputed owners were unable to point out the boundaries of their plots. It was only after much correspondence and discussion with the solicitors concerned that specific claims were formulated.  Offers of settlement based on the advice of a qualified valuer have been made but the offers have not been accepted.  Those negotiations took a considerable time and the inevitable delays were not all on one side.  In a further effort to settle the claims amicably and to avoid the trouble of formal arbitration, which would be difficult for all parties in the involved circumstances, the Commissioners of Public Works have arranged for their valuer to discuss the matter again with the solicitors next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will give an account of the way in which the Phelan Estate, Kilgainy, Clonmel, was divided, including the names of applicants who were given land and the amount of land awarded to each applicant; if he is aware of the considerable public disquiet which exists in the area on account of the manner in which this Estate was divided; and if he will fully investigate its division.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran) Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>The competing claims of all applicants for land on this 82 acres estate were fully considered by the Land Commissioners before allotment took place.  Apart from the allocation of a small plot to Waterford County Council, the lands were utilised to enlarge eight local small holdings.  The limited acreage available for disposal, however, was not sufficient to bring these holdings up to current standard.</P>
      <P>The names of the successful applicants and the acreage allotted to each of them are contained in a tabular statement which I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report.  In giving this type of information, however, I would refer the Deputy to the reply to a request for similar particulars in another case on 31st ultimo (Volume 207, Column 303).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to accept the suggestion contained in the final part of <Col N="601" /> the question.  The selection of allottees of land is an excepted matter reserved exclusively to the Land Commissioners. While I do not accept that the position in the present case is as stated by the Deputy, I am only too well aware that, in the nature of land settlement, it is virtually impossible to formulate a scheme of division for any particular estate which will win all-round acceptance.  I referred to this very point when I introduced the Lands Estimate on 29th May last, I said then:</P>
    <P>The funds provided in this Estimate will be used, in the main, to advance the land settlement programme. Land settlement is by no means an easy task: the extent to which the human element is involved in the work ensures that.  Perhaps one of its most difficult aspects is the realisation that, with the demand for land far exceeding the supply, it is virtually impossible to formulate a scheme of division for any particular estate which will satisfy everybody; there will invariably be disappointment for some aspirants.  I do not know what the formula for success is but I do know that the formula for failure is to try to please everybody.  It is only too true to say that few sectors of the public service give rise to such high feelings as land settlement.</P>

      <P>In the case of Modeligo, County Waterford the new school has two classrooms and provides accommodation for 96 pupils.  Due to the improvement made by me in recent years in the pupil/teacher ratio a third teacher was sanctioned in the school and one of the three teachers occupies a room in the old building.  However, all the recent figures for enrolment and attendance at the school indicate that the services of the third teacher will not be required in the near future.</P>

      <P>The question of extending the retiring ages for nurses in Seirbhís Altranais an Airm is under consideration and I cannot say what decision will ultimately be reached.

      <P>A member of the Army Nursing Service with ten or more years' service whose services are terminated on account of mental or physical incapacity due to disease or injury contracted as the actual result of the employment or of the nature of the employment may, under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme, be granted added years of service for pension purposes amounting to one-third of her actual number of years of service or the difference between her actual service and thirty years, whichever is the less.</P>
      <P>The scheme provides for the grant of a pension calculated on one-sixtieth of annual emoluments for each year of qualifying service with an additional one-sixtieth for the twenty-first and each succeeding year of qualifying service, subject to a maximum of two-thirds of emoluments.  Thus a member granted added years under the foregoing provision can qualify for full pension after twenty-three years' actual service.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has got a wrong idea.  The three boats are serviceable. I indicated last week that there was an insufficiency of personnel. That has reduced us to the position of operating one only.  The other two boats are not, as he suggested, being &ldquo;cannibalised&rdquo; for parts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that we put to sea in those corvettes 25 years ago and that at that time they were not considered very suitable for the purpose for which they were bought and are certainly not suitable now? Does the Minister intend to buy alternative craft, because the personnel cannot swim out to deal with trawlers, and if he does, what does he propose to buy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that question has been given.  We have accepted the opinion of competent surveyors that these boats have a life, on the average, of about six years. Therefore I take it that replacements will not become a practical proposition, or at least an urgent problem for at least six years and it is quite possible at the end of the six years in a new survey, a further lease of life might be recommended again.  A decision on the major question as to the type of boat which Irish conditions require will have to be made first; in other words, will we adopt the suggestion which is frequently made that we should concentrate exclusively on fishery protection boats?  No such decision has yet been made.  I take it that when a decision on that point has been made, the other points mentioned by the Deputies will come up for consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The substance of the Minister's reply to the last supplementary question was the topic on which I was speaking when progress was reported.  I was saying, quite frankly, that the decision we took during our period in Government to move Borstal from Clonmel and put it in the immediate vicinity of Mountjoy Prison, under the name of St. Patrick's, was a mistaken decision.  I hope it will be revised.  I hope that Borstal institution accommodation may be found in some environment which is not closely associated with an ordinary criminal prison.  I know that a good many people are disillusioned somewhat with Borstal treatment but I am firmly convinced that, where you are dealing with adolescent delinquents, there is a grave obligation to make the maximum effort to redeem them before they are irrevocably launched on a criminal career.  I do not want anyone to labour under the belief that I suffer from the illusion that the inmates of a Borstal institute are all misunderstood angels.  I fully appreciate that neither the Garda authorities nor the judiciary, who deal with adolescent delinquents, send them to institutions unless they are satisfied that no probation procedure will operate to control them.  Fully conscious of the fact that many of them are very tough operators, I am still satisfied that, at that age, we are bound to make the maximum effort in the best surroundings we can provide to pull them back from the criminal <Col N="617" /> career on which their own folly threatens to launch them.</P>
      <P>We must, I think, content ourselves with the knowledge that, if we achieve a 60 per cent degree of success, that is something about which we can be gratified.  If we can raise the percentage to 70 or 80, so much the better.  But, even if we only achieve 50 to 60 per cent rescue work among these adolescents, then our solicitude for them will be abundantly justified.  We must have present to our minds also the fact that until we can provide optimum surroundings for this work of redemption, there will be a natural reluctance on the part of the judiciary to commit youths to a Borstal institution and, very often, for the want of training at that crucial time in their lives, they are lost.</P>
      <P>I should be glad, therefore, to hear further from the Minister as to what he has in mind as the alternative to the present accommodation which, I understand, it is the intention of the Government to wind up.  I hope it will be possible to provide a new institution, preferably in rural surroundings. I am aware of the fact that a good many people hold it is important to have such an institution in or near Dublin, because that is where the majority of the inmates come from, and it is desirable to maintain some contact with their families.  I have never been fully persuaded of the validity of that argument.  I am not at all sure that it is not a good thing to have a period of break, albeit humanitarian considerations would require us to provide facilities for parents to make such visits as the regulations permit.  Transport does not present an insurmountable difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In essence, Borstal treatment does not envisage frequent visits by parents or friends, any more than those of us who went to boarding school habitually received visits from our parents or relatives.  Indeed, it was not good for those of our companions who got such constant visitation.  It is much better for youngsters to settle down, going home for the holidays.  So it is in Borstal institutions.  Regulations will <Col N="618" /> permit parents reasonable visitation, but it is better for these youngsters to go through their period of training and emerge at the other end with the sense of purpose and character that that training is designed to give them.</P>
    <P>I have never been as much impressed as others with the idea of having Borstal in the immediate vicinity of Dublin but, if it is located in suitable surroundings, and those happen to be near Dublin, I see no objection to that.  I believe there ought to be a new establishment where the best we can provide in the form of treatment will be available for these young persons.  The Minister has on a previous occasion announced his intention to build somewhere in the vicinity of Lucan a new institute to take the place of the present place of detention located in Marlboro House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Actually it is Finglas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that we will continue the existing system of administration whereby the Minister is responsible for the detainees at Marlboro House up to the threshold and, thereafter, the Minister for Education takes over?  I think that is bad.  I think one person ought to be responsible.  Dividing responsibility in this way creates a most serious situation.  But I am primarily now concerned with the fact, and I have repeatedly made representations to successive Ministers for Justice in this regard, that in Marlboro House we are not dealing with adolescents.  We are dealing with children.</P>
      <P>I do not share the view of Deputy Dr. Browne that all children are angels and that there is no such thing as a bold boy.  But I do firmly believe that if any considerable percentage of the children who become so incorrigible as to require their apprehension by the Garda, and arraignment before the Children's Court, are suffering from some measure of psychological disturbance, that degree of psychological disturbance requires expert investigation before a proper informed decision can be taken by the district justice as to how these children may be finally disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extent to which abnormal and <Col N="619" /> obnoxious conduct by children can be due to psychological disturbance, either in the children themselves or in the families from which they come has never been fully recognised under our administration of justice in the Children's Court.  Unless there is proper observation of these children on remand, suitable investigation of their psychological condition and proper inquiry into their family circumstances, the most regrettable decisions may be taken.  Children may find themselves planted in institutions for the rest of their juvenile lives when they ought not to have been sent to institutions at all; when, in fact, they should have been given treatment in their own homes, or when, in fact, their mothers and fathers should have been offered treatment they might stand in need of.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister again: may we assume there has been provided suitable psychological examination for children sent to Marlboro House for detention?  I said to him on a previous occasion that I understood if he applied to the leading psychological authorities on children for assistance in that regard, it would be made available to him.  I do not know whether he ever made such an application or not.  Before giving that undertaking to the Minister, I asked a member of the profession: &ldquo;Suppose the Minister is not in a position to employ child psychologists, would you be prepared to provide assistance voluntarily?&rdquo; The reply I got was: &ldquo;You can confidently assume we will, if he asks for it.&rdquo;  I stated that on the Minister's Estimate last year.  So far as I know, up to very recently no such application has been forthcoming from the Minister.</P>
    <P>This service is most urgently necessary and ought to be provided.  The purpose of it is that the district justice of the Children's Court should not finally dispose of any juvenile brought before him, without having before him a report on the psychological behaviour of the child and a report as to whether, in fact, the child is suffering from any psychological disturbance.  It is only in the light of such a report <Col N="620" /> that he can properly make appropriate provision.  If the public rumour that the Minister does not intend to remove the Borstal to Portlaoise is untrue, perhaps the Minister would tell us what he proposes to do about it?  May I assume he is going to remove it from the premises in which it now is?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  One of the things you are tempted to speak of is an open prison.  But you have to remember you are dealing with adolescents. You cannot be sure you can get from disturbed adolescents the same measure of co-operation as you would get from adults fitted for proper prison treatment.  If you put excessive temptation in the way of mercurial adolescents by tempting them to escape, you are multiplying their difficulties.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in resolving that problem.  I hope he will be able to overcome his perplexities and find suitable premises where a reasonable measure of security can be maintained and, at the same time, the kind of accommodation both he and I desire to provide.</P>

    <P>There is one last matter: the scale of pensions provided for widows of gardaí.  This is a problem that afflicts us all, no matter in what walk of life we are.  If we are employed, with provision that at the end of our term of employment we are to have a liberal pension, that does not give a man the kind of security consonant with real peace of mind.  There is always the <Col N="621" /> ghastly prospect hanging over a man who depends on his own labour to maintain his family as to what will become of his wife and family should he prematurely die.</P>
    <P>We have fixed a reasonable enough salary and pension scale for Gardaí, but I feel the scale of pensions for the widows of gardaí is still a cause of legitimate grievance.  I think the present scale is at just that level which makes it impossible for the widow of the garda to qualify for non-contributory widow's pension.  I would suggest to the Minister that either of two things be done: either the scale of the widow's pension should be reduced, or regulation should be made by the Minister for Social Welfare that, for the purpose of non-contributory widows' pensions, the Garda pension should not be regarded as income. Either course would do something to relieve the present situation, but a continuation of a situation in which the widow of the garda does not qualify for social service benefit pension and is expected to survive on the extremely exiguous provisions at present made must cause very grave concern to a large body of men, who would wish to see their terms of employment established on a basis which would give their widows a reasonable degree of security in the event of their own premature death.</P>
    <P>The Minister, perhaps naturally, is much preoccupied with what he conceives to be his own achievements.  I have no fault to find with a volume of legislation designed to codify the law or regulate the law relating to pawnbrokers or anything else.  But I do not think he should forget that the primary function of the Department of Justice is the preservation of law and order in the land.  He is wholly mistaken if he believes there is not a very considerable amount of anxiety abroad at the growing number of crimes particularly offences against the person.  He is greatly mistaken also if he believes that the failure to apprehend the murderer of the lady in Ballybough has not caused serious apprehension in the public mind.  I would urge upon him that some reassurance on this important <Col N="622" /> question should be provided in his concluding observations.</P>
    <P>I am not forgetting that when this matter was raised in the House before, the Minister said&mdash;and fairly reasonably said&mdash;Deputies should not forget that the Garda often know who has committed the crime.  Of course, a crime cannot be returned as having been detected and disposed of until the criminal has been brought to court, been proved guilty and a conviction secured.  In our circumstances, it is difficult to get the kind of proof requisite to secure conviction and therefore prosecutions very often do not take place, even though the Garda are virtually certain of who is guilty of the crime.  I acknowledge that difficulty exists, but, without unduly labouring the point, I think keeping the Garda in close contact with the people could and would materially contribute to the disappearance of that difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up the point on which the last speaker has concluded and to remind the Minister that when I put down a question last week to get some information on the way the Ballybough murder had been handled, I had no intention of trying to assume the responsibility which is the Minister's and that of the Garda authorities, nor had any other of the members of this House who have been making inquiries about it.  The Minister must realise, being in touch as he is with the Force throughout the country, that there is unrest not alone among the general public but among the rank and file of the Garda because of the way in which this and other cases have been handled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards crime detection, while the Minister read out an impressive list of the numbers of murders which have been detected over the years, nevertheless he must admit there are far too many of these cases going undetected. The last speaker referred to the fact that in many cases the Garda know who the person is but because they cannot definitely prove it, no prosecution is possible.  I suggest to the Minister that if the Garda know and if there is no possibility of getting further proof, in the interest of justice, whatever <Col N="623" /> proof they have should be brought before the court.  It is ridiculous to find, as happened in one case a few years ago, neighbours putting up placards on somebody's gate and accusing him of committing a crime.  That apparently continued until quite recently in that case and yet the Garda authorities were not prepared to take any action. In the interest of everybody concerned in cases like that, the matter should be clarified once and for all.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Ballybough murder, it is quite true that the general public believe, and that the rank and file of the Garda believe, that nothing was done until it was far too late.  The steps taken were not the correct ones and when eventually patrols started to stop cars in the evening and in the night, nothing resulted.  In one case a patrol stopped a young man and his girl friend and tried to persuade them they were the people for whom they were searching, weeks after the murder had been committed when it was the easiest thing in the world to check who they were.  That is not good enough.  I myself was stopped late at night and I do not think I resemble in the slightest way either of the people in the identi-kit.  I do not even wear a red coat.</P>
    <P>The general public believe in regard to the Ballybough case that far too much information was given, that every assistance was given to those people to change their identity as far as possible and to prevent their being arrested and that this matter should have been dealt with in another way. I am not an expert on these things and I do not propose to offer solutions to the Minister.  However, if it is true that when a serious crime takes place, no positive action can be taken by the Garda authorities, by the uniformed gardaí, until such time as the people who are at the top, who are in fact civilians, put on their deerstalker hats, get their magnifying glasses and start looking into the matter, then the matter is not being handled in the proper way.</P>
    <P>With reference to the number of cases of housebreaking in the city and <Col N="624" /> throughout the country, and, as the previous speaker mentioned, particularly of assault upon the person, it is true there is a great deal of unrest.  In this case I am not blaming the Garda. Apart entirely from the blame attributable to parents who are allowing their growing-up children to do things they should not do, a lot of blame rests with the courts.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous that when cases are brought to court, somebody who has been before the court again and again on a series of housebreaking and other such charges can get away with a sentence of a couple of months or a suspensory sentence, given chances again and again.  It is quite a common thing in this city that people who have been charged and who have succeeded in getting out on bail feel free to commit as many offences as they possibly can in the time at their disposal before they appear in court again.  All they have to do is to ask that these additional charges be taken into consideration and they finish up with the same sentence as if they had committed only the original offences with which they are charged.</P>
    <P>There are also cases of which I am sure the Minister is aware where children have gone into shops and grabbed money out of a till and the gardaí have reached the stage where they believe there is no point in charging them.  If they are brought before the court, they get a pat on the head; they are told not to do it again and then they go back and do exactly the same thing again.  The whole procedure of the courts must be changed.</P>
    <P>Another thing which I think is wrong in court and which I believe must be changed is that where there is what is referred to as a State witness in connection with some minor charge of, say, breaking into a car and stealing property out of it, that person who may have been passing by and witnessed that, when he comes to court to give evidence, in many cases is cross-examined more by the justice than the person charged with the crime.  A person who comes into court to make an identification should just do that and should not be subjected to that sort of thing.  It does not help and <Col N="625" /> it discourages people from giving evidence which otherwise they might give.</P>
    <P>Car stealing has reached alarming proportions in the city, and all over the country, and people who have been involved in a series of car stealing offences have got away with a few months.  The Minister may say the law is there and ask how can he deal with them at this stage.  He could usefully point out that the present system for dealing with these offences has not succeeded.  I have no objection to anyone getting a chance if it is his first offence, but if he continues to offend, the sentences should not be concurrent but consecutive.  I believe that would help to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>The other day I asked the Minister how many people from outside this State were charged with speeding, and the Minister said that no statistics of that kind were kept.  He also said that as a man of Northern Irish extraction, he did not believe people from Northern Ireland were breaking the speed limit.  I travel up and down 30 miles of the Dublin-Belfast road every day, and I know it has become a joke on that road.  Most of the people from Northern Ireland who go through the villages on that road do not slow down.  Ninety per cent of the people from across the Border go through them at any speed.  There is no point in trying to prosecute them because they can go back across the Border and, apparently, we cannot follow them.  There is no check to find if they come in here again.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to introduce special fines for those people.  For example, a person may be in a hurry when going through the village of Swords, but he will slow down to 30 miles an hour, and five, six or seven cars with Northern Ireland or English registrations will pass him at 50 miles an hour.  Ordinary drivers will not tolerate that situation, and the Minister will be encouraging breaches of the law if he allows it to continue.  The present regulations do not seem to be of much assistance, but the Minister must do something about it to show the people who are doing that sort of <Col N="626" /> thing that they will not get away with it.  There are law-abiding people from Northern Ireland who will not break the speed limit.  We have to obey their regulations.  If the Minister is not prepared to take my word for it, I am sure he will have seen reports that interested people in the Northern counties along the Border were prepared to send a deputation to him protesting against the people who drive at any speed through built-up areas.  I do not want to labour the point, but I feel it has gone beyond a joke now.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also devise an improved method for detecting the speed at which people from both sides of the Border drive.  There are some people who think they should not have to drive at 30 miles an hour.  They think they are beyond the law.  They are usually irresponsible young people, or people who have not more sense, and when driving through built-up areas, they are a danger to the public. The danger is increased because of the fact that the local people know there is a speed limit, and accidents are caused which would not otherwise have been caused.</P>
    <P>I live on the seacoast near Laytown and Bettystown.  The road is pretty good, but it is not good enough to take cars at a speed of more than 30 miles an hour.  Especially on Sundays in the summer, when there is heavy traffic, there should be some method of detecting speeds other than the system we have at present.  I know there are Gardaí on motor cycles patrolling the roads from time to time.  There should be more of them, but at least they remind people that there is a speed limit and, if they exceed it, they will not get away with it.</P>
    <P>Itinerants, or tinkers, as they are called, have been referred to.  The situation that has been allowed to develop in this city over the past couple of weeks is a shame.  In my opinion, the Minister has very little responsibility for it.  At the same time, the Government as a whole must see to it that these people are not simply driven from pillar to post.  No matter what we think of their way of life, they should be given a permanent camping <Col N="627" /> place, and if they are not prepared to accept it, they should be dealt with very severely.  I am not aware whether or not some of the people who have come on the scene are alien to this country.  I understand there are rumours that that is so.  We know that vicious attacks have been made by some people on respectable citizens of this country.  There is no justification for those attacks, but the excuse given is that when they are driven from an authorised site, there is no other site to which they can go except another unauthorised site.</P>
    <P>We have this problem to a much smaller degree all over the country. The time has now come when we should be prepared to provide them with houses into which they can move and live like Christians.  The local authorities will have to erect houses for them and prevent them doing what they are doing.  It is all right to say they do not do much harm, that they just put a few horses in a field, but they move into an area and camp beside someone's house, as they do in the country, and where they find the dirt and filth which they leave after them is a mystery.  They need be there only a few hours and they leave after them boots, old clothing, bottles and a lot of unmentionable stuff.  They also go from house to house begging, but that is not the worst feature.  They leave a couple of hundred yards on each side of the roadway in an insanitary condition.  I suggest they should be taken off the roads completely and put into houses, and then there would be no further question of looking after them, or having sympathy for them because they are on the road.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister recently decided to put into operation the new Bill dealing with guns.  That is long overdue.  Because of its recent passage through the House, I shall not dwell on it, except to say I hope the Garda authorities will enforce the law in the strictest possible way.  Airguns are terrible things.  Airguns in the hands of children are terrible things.  Airguns have done irreparable harm and damage, not only to animals but to <Col N="628" /> human beings.  I know that pampered pets will be able to hold on to them unless the Garda are strict.  I want the law enforced in the strictest possible manner, and anyone found harbouring &mdash;and I think that is the correct word&mdash;or holding on to an airgun for a spoiled child should be dealt with in the way which the law lays down.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the reference to ground rents.  We have heard enough over the years about them.  It seems to me that while everyone is prepared to talk about ground rents, and to have a commission set up to consider them, there is a vested interest and a hidden hand which ensures that no matter how much we talk, nothing ever comes of it.  Again and again, there have been suggestions that ground rents should be abolished or terminated in one way or another, but in every case we come back to the situation where ground rents are not only continuing but growing.  It was bad enough with the old landlord who held on to ground rents but it has now become worse with the new landlords, the people in this city particularly, who should have more sense, and who are branching out down the country buying up land in order to create ground rents and put an added burden on unfortunate people trying to provide houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister is assured of the fullest support of the Labour Party in ending that sort of codology and also in ending the system whereby people who have gone out of the country for a long time&mdash;in many cases for several generations&mdash;and have gone as far away as South America, are still extracting a hefty income from ground rents in this country to which, in the first place, they were never entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not here when the Minister spoke but I read his manuscript and I shall be glad if he would indicate in closing the debate what is the exact position in regard to Portlaoise prison and whether the rumours current to the effect that some other use will be found for the prison building are correct or not.  I also wish to refer to the public concern in relation to the number of road accidents <Col N="629" /> and fatal accidents which are occurring and have been occurring consistently in recent years.  I appreciate that the Minister is not responsible for road traffic legislation but he has responsibility in regard to the enforcement of the law, being responsible for the Gardaí.  I should like to know if any effort has been or is being made to prepare an analysis of the cause of road accidents.  I do not share the oft-expressed view that when an accident happens or because a number of accidents have happened, the Minister or the Government should do something about it.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is much in that approach but we should certainly reach a stage where a scientific analysis can be made of the cause of most accidents, whether caused by speed, as some suggest, or by insobriety as others say, whether it is a lack of regard for ordinary road regulations or is due to the condition of the vehicles being used.  Perhaps it is being done but if not I suggest that the Technical Branch of the Gardaí should, where possible, compile scientifically their view as to what caused a particular accident.  If that were done I think that much of what is being urged on drivers regarding road safety would have a more realistic appeal.  If it is found on a fair survey that a constant cause of some of the accidents is that the steering mechanism is not as it should be or that many drivers are inclined to drive around bends and corners on the incorrect side or too far from the correct side&mdash;if things of that kind were pinpointed as major causes of accidents appeals made regarding road safety would be more effective.</P>
      <P>As a practitioner in the courts, I find that in the Dublin area there is apparently some rule or regulation in force which prohibits a Garda witness attending at a consultation prior to a legal action or giving any information other than the bare minimum contained in the Garda report.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, civil proceedings.  This particular rule so far as I am aware applies only in the Dublin area and I suggest the rule <Col N="630" /> should be changed.  The function of the Garda witness in any civil action or, indeed, any proceedings, should be to endeavour to assist the parties to arrive at the truth and enable justice to be done.  It often leads to considerable trouble for a litigant if a Garda is put in the position that he will only give the information in court.  That information may be so vital that if one of the litigants were aware of it beforehand they would never have initiated the action or would have taken steps to compromise and settle it at an early stage.  It seems no useful purpose is served by the continuance of a regulation the basis of which I find it hard to understand.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that matter in the interests of justice and within whatever safeguards are necessary allow Garda witnesses, who were present subsequent to an accident or who have information bearing on issues which are to be the subject of litigation, to operate in the same way as any other witness and give to either side before the court hearing such information as they possess.</P>
      <P>If that is done both sides will know clearly what the evidence is likely to be if the case goes to court and can take their decision accordingly.  As things are at present in Dublin, quite frequently nobody is fully aware of the nature of the evidence likely to be given by a Garda if he is called as a witness and it often has a very vital bearing on the issues involved.  Frequently, if one of the litigants had been aware of the full story, the case might never have come to court.  I suggest the Minister should consider this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>A number of Deputies dealt with the same point and in dealing with any particular point, I may not at all times indicate which Deputy raised it.  I hope if I omit to give the reference, as it were, to some particular aspect of the case, the Deputy concerned will forgive me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I should begin by dealing with the question of the strength of the Force as a whole.  This was raised by Deputy Michael O'Higgins and by other Deputies.  I want the House, first <Col N="631" /> of all, to be clear on exactly what year we are dealing with because the time of the year at which we are dealing with this Estimate tends to introduce a certain amount of confusion into the situation.  But, at the beginning of the last financial year the strength of the Force had been fixed at 6,440 and we prepared our Estimate for this year, that is, for 1963-64, on the same basis, that is that the strength of the Force would be continued at 6,440.  Subsequently, in his Budget speech, the Minister for Finance, in an effort to procure economies, cut the Garda Estimate to a figure which could have been achieved only by our postponing recruitment of 50 Gardaí who in the normal course would have been recruited in order to keep our strength at 6,440, so that we faced 1963-64 with a potential cut of 50 members in the strength of the Force.</P>
    <P>During the year it became apparent that we could not possibly carry on with that cut in our strength and I was able to persuade the Minister for Finance to restore the situation, so that, in effect, the established strength of the Force remained at 6,440.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies that in the current situation it is not possible to visualise any reduction in the strength of the Force.  In fact, for the coming year I am asking the Minister for Finance to agree to a figure which will be up by 100: in other words, in the coming year, I am looking to the Minister for Finance to permit me to have a Force of 6,540, an increase of 100 over the present strength.</P>
    <P>While I am dealing with strength, I might as well go on to the particular situation of Waterford, which is very dear to the heart of Deputy Lynch, and which he never fails to bring to my attention in some form or other. I could not agree that the strength of the Force in Waterford city or, indeed, Waterford county as a whole, is in any way inadequate.  Waterford is a divisional headquarters and we have there one chief superintendent, a superintendent, two inspectors, 11 sergeants and 47 gardaí.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that Waterford is a large thriving metropolis but I do feel that this force should be adequate to police the city properly. I have had no complaints from the officers concerned that the force at their disposal is inadequate and I am not aware that they have ever sought additional assistance and have been refused it.  We have normally on night duty one sergeant and seven men who are assisted by a patrol car and just recently we have arranged for the installation of radio equipment in the patrol car.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only go on the advice tendered to me by the officers whose responsibility it is to take care of these matters and, as I say, I have not received from them any indication that they regard the force at their disposal as inadequate.  Indeed, it compares favourably with the strength for any other city in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>What would the Minister think of spreading them out over the city and putting them into more stations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Lynch has raised that point because it is one that I am very anxious to deal with.  Deputy Lynch and I disagree about this matter.  I do not disagree simply as an individual; I disagree from the standpoint of the advice I get from the technical experts, namely, the officers in my Department in the first instance and the police officers in the second instance.  As the Deputy knows, I received a deputation from the city and we discussed the matter very fully.  I thought, at least, that the police officers were able to persuade us as civilians that the course which has been decided upon is the correct one.  The simple difference between Deputy Lynch and myself on this point is that I favour the establishment of one central Garda station in the city of Waterford while Deputy Lynch thinks it would be better to have a number of smaller stations diffused over the city area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> The first argument against Deputy Lynch's view is that centralisation in modern times is regarded as good police administration but, apart from any technical police argument, there is this simple commonsense argument which I would like to put to Deputy Lynch again.  If we have a number of small stations spread over the city is it not wasteful in manpower?  Each one of these stations must have an orderly who is tied to the station.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>But Deputy Lynch agrees with me that the more men we have on the streets, on the beat and in cars, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and have them in a place inside the barracks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have them on the streets if they are tied down on duty in the barracks.  However, I do not think we can argue it much further.  I want to assure the House that the experts are on my side. I realise that Deputy Lynch knows his native city very well and thinks he knows how it should be policed but, as against that, I have the best technical expert advice available to me and I am accepting it.  We will just have to agree to disagree, I am afraid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind saying to the Minister that I have the advice of men who have spent their lives in the Civic Guards in Waterford and who know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not give that advice to me.  I am also concerned, indeed, with this question of the relationship between the Gardaí and the general public and the allied question of the Gardaí being able to have the co-operation of the public in procuring information of one sort or another.  As Deputy Dillon rightly pointed out, the relationship between the Gardaí and the general public is excellent.  The people here regard the Garda Force as their own and, on the whole, they are very proud of it and they definitely regard the Garda as a <Col N="634" /> friend and protector.  There is very little left of any lingering hostility between the general public and the police such as we had throughout most of our history in this country.</P>
      <P>From that point of view this whole question of the closing of small rural stations is undoubtedly important. When I am presented with a proposal by the Garda authorities to consent to the closing of a rural station or to its reduction in strength, I always give the matter very serious consideration, because, like most Deputies, I am instinctively against the idea of closing any Garda station. I feel that the presence of a Garda station in a rural area, village or town is undoubtedly a good thing, a beneficial thing and something which helps to reassure people, if nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no substitute for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am often faced with the position that I am assured by the Garda authorities that a station may be closed without loss of police efficiency and that an area can be just as well policed by dividing it up between the adjoining areas.  As against that I have my own inclination not to close Garda stations and very often that is reinforced by considerable local opinion.  On the other hand I must have regard to the public purse and when I have the assurance that the area is practically free from crime there is no reason from the police point of view why the stations should not be closed.  In such circumstances it is difficult for me not to accede to the proposal to close the particular station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other aspect referred to is the question of the man on the beat.  This is probably one of the questions most often debated.  I would like to assure Deputies that there is no question of any decision to carry on by way of patrol car.  Our approach to the matter is to supplement the Garda on the beat with mechanical aids of one sort or another such as patrol cars and radio communications.  The fundamental basic structure of the Garda force is still the man on foot and what <Col N="635" /> we are doing is to augment him by mechanical aids.  It is a misconception of the situation to think in terms of the abolition of the man on the beat and the putting on of a patrol car as a substitute for him.</P>
    <P>I want Deputies to bear in mind that aspect of the matter and also to have regard to this&mdash;that the patrol car or the man on the motor cycle has a great number of advantages over the man on the beat.  They can move around much faster, can give greater supervision to any particular area and can come much more quickly on suspicious persons than the man in uniform can hope to do.  I think we are working towards the ideal solution, maintaining the man on the beat as the basic structure of the force and helping him out and supplementing his activities by patrol cars and men on motor cycles.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with Deputy Lynch that the number of cases of assaults on women and girls which we have on record do not reflect the true figures.  It often happens that the persons concerned are reluctant to come forward in person and make complaints.  It is probably true that there are more of this type of incident than we have recorded in the statistics. As against that I want to point out that some of these assaults which have become headlined in our newspapers have never taken place at all.  I can give Deputies concrete examples of such cases.</P>

      <P>I fully agree.  Deputy Lynch also asked me to do what I could in the interest of road safety.  I agree that there is a very heavy obligation on me to do everything I can in the present situation in this regard.  I would remind Deputies, however, that the primary responsibility in this matter rests on the Minister for Local Government who is the Minister charged with responsibility for road safety but both myself and the Minister for Education co-operated with him <Col N="636" /> last December in a special campaign which he carried out to keep death off the roads in December.  We cooperate to the full with the Minister for Local Government in anything he wishes to do in this regard and we never fail to avail of any opportunity to draw attention to this appalling toll of death on the roads and to use every effort to bring about a reduction in it.</P>
      <P>It is encouraging to note that, whether because of the campaign or not, in the month of December, 1963, the overall total of deaths and injuries on the roads was less than in the corresponding month of 1962.  That is something which we should feel grateful for.  We would like to see it still less but we did, in December, 1963, succeed in keeping the figure below that for the previous year.  This is something which is very satisfactory in contrast with what happened in Great Britain and the North of Ireland where the figures for December were considerably up on those for the previous year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond took me somewhat by surprise in his reference to what seemed like a big political scandal in some town in his constituency.  I have been looking up the records since he spoke and I am almost certain that he referred to the transfer of a member of the Force from a town in his constituency during last Autumn.  There is nothing sinister in what happened in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, as Minister for Justice, and the Commissioner of the Garda received complaints from prominent persons to the effect that the Garda situation in that town was very bad.  Reference was actually made to a crime wave. The Commissioner looked into the situation and decided to take a number of steps.  He increased the strength of the Force in the town and also decided that he would transfer one member of the Force out of the town in the interests of efficiency and good police work.  Subsequently, the member concerned submitted an appeal to the Commissioner on humanitarian grounds that his transfer should not be proceeded with because it would bring about a considerable amount of family upset.  The Commissioner, as he is <Col N="637" /> always prepared to do in cases of that sort, had regard to the humanitarian nature of the appeal and postponed the transfer for a period of six months.</P>
    <P>The matter is as simple as that&mdash; an ordinary matter of police administration which had nothing to do with me or my Department and which was dealt with entirely by the Commissioner in accordance with good police practice and in the interests of good police administration.  It is upsetting to find Deputies coming in here and giving colourful accounts of instances of this sort and trying to exaggerate them into something which they are not or could not ever be.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies spoke about the Ground Rents Commission.  I want to say, in reply to Deputy Dunne and others, that at least this Government have done something about the ground rents problem.  People, as Deputy Dunne and others have said, have been talking about ground rents for a long time but the reference had been restricted to talking about them.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to accept that but when it came before the House the Commission had already been established.  This Government is the first Government which have taken any practical step to deal with the problem of ground rents.  We established what I regard as a first-class commission of people all of whom are experts in some particular aspect of the problem.  I am hopeful that we will get a report from that commission very shortly.  When we get the report, it will be up to the Government and the House to decide exactly what should be done about the problem. At least we have done that much and I think it is the sensible way to proceed.</P>
      <P>It is a complicated and complex problem.  Any Government would, I think, be reckless in attempting to deal with it without being fortified beforehand with the report of an expert commission.  The Commission has, to my mind, at least, acted with commendable speed and promptitude and I am hoping we can get its report very soon now.  On this question of ground rents, the conscience of this Government is clear and we have done something about it.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies have spoken of the crime situation and referred in particular to the question of the solving of the murders which, unfortunately, have been committed here in recent years.  I agree with Deputy Desmond that it is no answer for us to point to our particular statistics and say, in relation to them, that we are much better off than any other country in Europe or that they compare favourably with those of other countries.  I agree that that is not the proper attitude or approach to a problem of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, of course, helpful from time to time to compare our situation with that of other countries.  It helps us to have a sense of perspective when we study our situation in relation to that of other countries, but I agree with Deputy Desmond that we must consider our own situation as such and do the best we can in our circumstances without regard to whether we are doing better or worse than other countries.  The proof of the matter, of <Col N="639" /> course, is that we do not do badly in this matter of solving murders.</P>
    <P>The overwhelming majority of murderers are brought to prosecution and justice in the courts.  We have at present, because of a variety of different and indeed unrelated circumstances, seven murders for which nobody has been prosecuted in the courts.  As I pointed out previously, that is not equivalent to saying that in all cases these murders are not solved.  As Deputies know, in some cases it happens that the Gardaí are quite satisfied as to the identity of the person who committed the crime but they are still a long way from being able to establish satisfactory proof of that in court. Therefore, if you exclude those types of cases from the number of murders concerned, the remaining number which could accurately be described as unsolved is quite small indeed.  However, no matter how small it is, we must face up to the fact that it is unsatisfactory in so far as there is any case of murder remaining unsolved.</P>
    <P>I can only assure the House that the Gardaí as a Force are just as anxious and concerned about this matter as any Deputy in this House and that an all-out effort is made in every case to bring the perpetrators of murder to justice.  Everything that we can do is being done.  The Gardaí have all the specialised training which we can possibly provide for them.  They go abroad to police colleges to keep in touch with the latest developments in other countries.  They study the latest techniques.  We procure for them the very best equipment we can and if there is anything else that they suggest they could with advantage use we do not hesitate to procure it for them.</P>
    <P>When a crime of this sort is committed, every resource of the Force is brought to bear in an effort to apprehend the criminals concerned.  I feel that from time to time it is inevitable that we shall have failures and despite the very best efforts of the officers concerned and the members of the Force concerned they will not succeed in solving a particular crime but I do not think that is any reason for panic or despair or wholesale <Col N="640" /> criticism of the Gardaí as a Force.  I think they do very well in this regard.  It would be wrong to let the coincidental approximation, if you like, of some failures, discolour the whole picture, to create the impression that murder is a crime which is to all intents and purposes undetectable in this country. The real situation is that year in year out the vast majority of these crimes are solved and the persons concerned brought to justice.  We must not let an occasional failure cast doubts on the efficiency of the Force as a whole.</P>
    <P>I know that the recent murder in Ballybough has caused some concern among the general public&mdash;I know this particularly because Ballybough is in my constituency&mdash;but I can assure the House that every effort was made from the moment the murder came to light to apprehend the criminals and every effort is still being made.  If the crime does remain unsolved and if the perpetrators do finally get away with their crime, I can assure you it will not be through any fault of the Garda or any lack of determination on their part.</P>
    <P>Deputy M. J. O'Higgins asked a specific question about figures regarding the so-called &ldquo;on the spot&rdquo; fines. The position is that up to 31st December 1963 a total of 34,126 notices were issued by the Gardaí and the amount collected up to 24th January in hard cash in respect of notices issued before 31st December was £14,382. Roughly 84 per cent of persons paid the fine on the spot, as distinct from going to the court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>How would it compare with court fines in the previous years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have not that information readily available. The fact that 84 per cent of the people who received these notices availed of the facility of paying on the spot rather than going to court proves that the system is working fairly satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked about the delay in producing the annual Garda report. There is really a technical reason for that.  It is because the crime year ends on 30th September but the figures <Col N="641" /> published in the tables include cases which are disposed of in the courts up to 31st December following.  In other words, any crime which is committed before 30th September in any year and is not finally dealt with in the courts until between that date and 31st December is included in the figures as published.  This system involves a delay in having the report published.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon is very interested in the penal reform programme and dealt with a number of aspects of it and asked some specific questions.  Like others, he was interested to know about the future of Portlaoise Prison as such and also wished to find out what we had in store for St. Patrick's Institution. We have decided for ourselves that the present location of St. Patrick's is unsuitable and that its close proximity to Mountjoy is undesirable.  It is easy enough to take that decision but is is very difficult to know where to go from there.</P>
    <P>The best thing I can do is tell the House what sort of institution we should have in St. Patrick's, what the ideal would be.  First of all, it is important that it should be in open surroundings with plenty of open ground around it, plenty of playing fields and plenty of facilities for open air recreation. Secondly, it is important that it should be in or near Dublin for a variety of reasons.  First of all, as has been pointed out, the majority of boys in St. Patrick's come from Dublin. Therefore, from the point of view of visits by their parents, relatives and friends, it is important that the institution should be fairly readily accessible, at least to Dublin city.  Indeed, that would facilitate most of the people throughout the country as well because our transport system is such that Dublin is fairly conveniently accessible from any part.</P>
    <P>It is also important that it should be in or near Dublin from the point of view of rehabilitation.  One of the most important points in this regard is the ability to procure suitable employment for the boys when they are discharged.  This point was well brought out in a film on St. Patrick's <Col N="642" /> which was shown on Telefís Éireann and which was produced by Radharc Productions.  Siting in or near Dublin is also very important from two other points of view.  First of all, if we are to go in more and more for the system of allowing boys out on parole when they are serving their sentences, to look for employment, it is important that they should be near Dublin.  In addition, if we are to go ahead to any extent with this scheme of letting boys who are serving sentences go out during the day to work, in appropriate cases, and return to prison at night, then again, proximity to Dublin is desirable from the point of view of any such scheme.  As I say, on the whole the advantages are in favour of its being situated in or near Dublin, provided we can procure somewhere with plenty of open spaces.</P>
    <P>With regard to the building itself, one immediately thinks of a number of desirable requirements.  We must allow for the maximum possible degree of segregation.  This is important in any prison but it is vitally important in an institution for young people.  Secondly, we must, if at all possible, provide for the incorporation of a matron in the prison service. Where you have juveniles confined in an institution of this sort, it is very important from a number of points of view to have a matron system of some sort in operation.  The type of building, therefore, will be determined by a number of requirements of this sort.  We have been closely examining the matter for some considerable time and we have invoked the aid of the Office of Public Works in our search. We have considered all sorts of existing buildings and institutions to see whether they could be adapted for our purpose.  One by one, we have regretfully had to rule them out.</P>
    <P>Some considerable time ago we initiated the examination of the proposition of transferring St. Patrick's to Portlaoise&mdash;that is, closing Portlaoise as an adult prison, transferring St. Patrick's there, and making it a juvenile prison.  While that examination has not been completed, it is my own personal view at this point of the examination that it is unlikely that <Col N="643" /> Portlaoise would prove suitable from a number of points of view, including some of those I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I see Deputy Treacy in the House. I am not forgetting the fact that he never misses an opportunity to press the claims of Clonmel in this regard. This problem is very much on our minds.  As of now, it is one to which we can see no ready solution.  I believe we shall have to build eventually and my personal opinion is that we shall have to try to get a suitable site on the outskirts of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it the Minister has ruled out the possibility of a return to Clonmel, the original home of St. Patrick's?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost certainly, yes. I mentioned a number of reasons which indicate fairly clearly that it is desirable that the new institution should be in or near Dublin.  However, if the town of Clonmel were to offer us a new institution, built from the ground up to our requirements, then we would have to consider that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies are confused, I think, about the relationship between St. Patrick's and what is commonly called Marlboro House. The replacement of Marlboro House is now under way.  The new institution will be in Finglas. There will be accommodation for between 80 and 90 boys.  It will be under the control of the De la Salle Order.  There will be an educational psychologist attached to the institution. The new institution will, of course, like Marlboro House, be under the control of the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked whether we are considering the setting up of open prisons.  We have certainly looked into the matter and examined it.  The idea of an open prison is in many ways very attractive but, as of now, I think most sociologists and most people interested in penal reform would agree <Col N="644" /> that the case for the open prison has not yet been established.  In our own way we are working towards the idea of an open prison, in so far as we now have several cases in which we grant prisoners parole to go out during the day to work, returning to the prison each evening.  That has innumerable advantages.  It helps to rehabilitate the prisoner, give him back his self-respect and soften the process of his return to the outside world.  It enables him to earn money to keep his family while he is in prison, if he has such a responsibility. It also enables him, when he finally leaves the prison, to continue in employment.</P>
    <P>It is very valuable.  It is a scheme from which we expect great results. We are getting very good results from it at the moment.  To that extent we are operating an open prison, but we are not at all convinced that a fullscale open prison on the lines of those in Britain and elsewhere should be adopted here.  In all these matters we are keeping our minds open, watching developments and studying reports from Britain and international organisations. We have certainly not ruled out the open prison as something we will never contemplate; as I have said, we are progressing towards the idea.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have mentioned traffic wardens and indicated a preference for traffic wardens as distinct from ordinary members of the Garda Síochána engaging in these duties.  I am not sure whether such a scheme would finally commend itself to me.  If we were to implement such a scheme, we would have to provide for it in legislation and we are at the moment examining the possibilities of making provision for it in a piece of legislation which the Minister for Local Government has on the stocks.  When people talk about a special traffic corps or traffic wardens, they are, I think, thinking in terms of a scheme of fines-on-the-spot being administered by this type of official.  We have not really decided whether or not such a corps would be advantageous or feasible, but we are examining the question of making provision for such a corps in the legislation I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made a very good <Col N="645" /> point and I agree with him fully when he says he does not regard harsher sentences by justices and judges as the complete answer to our crime problems. He made the point, very validly, that a high detection rate is very important in this respect.  That is quite true.  The greatest possible deterrent to criminal activity is a high detection rate.  We have a high detection rate here as compared with other countries and, in that regard, we have some grounds for satisfaction.  It is not, however, correct to emphasise one factor as against the other.  Both are important. A sensible attitude by our courts to crime and criminals is of vital importance. There is ground, I think, for criticism from time to time that our courts are too lenient in this regard. These opinions have been expressed from time to time by members of the public, public bodies and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be glad to know that the district justices have agreed to consider at their next statutory meeting the question of the avoidance of undue divergences in the penalties imposed.  Most Deputies will agree that this is very desirable indeed.  We would all like to see penalties roughly in correspondence.  I must immediately qualify that by saying that only the presiding judge or justice is in a position to judge the case fully.  Only he has the full knowledge of all the circumstances. He can never deal with cases coming before him by any rule of thumb method.  While having regard to that, and to the necessity for a judge to deal with each case coming before him as he sees it, I still believe there is room for greater uniformity of penalties.  I hope the forthcoming statutory meeting of the justices will do good work in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputies mentioned the question of itinerants.  Again, I want to claim that this Government have done something positive in regard to this long-standing social evil.  The Government established a Commission to examine the problem and make recommendations. That Commission, which did an excellent job, has submitted a very fine report.  That report is at present under examination in the various <Col N="646" /> Government Departments, and the Minister for Local Government has the function of co-ordinating that examination.  In due course we will have a decision by the Government on the various matters dealt with in it. This Government&mdash;maybe not more than any other Government before them, but certainly as much as any Government before them&mdash;recognise there is a problem here, that it is, if you like, a blot on our national escutcheon.  We have these people in our midst who are definitely not getting a fair crack of the whip or a place in the sun.  This Government recognise we have an obligation to do something about it, and we intend to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned the question of courtesy in the Garda Síochána. I fully agree with him&mdash;both from the point of view of our own people and of tourists&mdash;it is desirable that in all their dealings with the public the Gardaí should be as courteous as possible.  I think the situation in that regard is very satisfactory indeed. From time to time I receive very pleasant and encouraging reports from different parts of the country about the helpful and courteous ways in which members of the Force deal with the general public.  In a Force of 6,000 it is inevitable that we should have an odd incident of discourtesy here and there; but on the whole the picture is a satisfactory one.  The Garda carry out their duties in as helpful and as courteous a fashion as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy M. J. O'Higgins raised two matters with which I want to deal specifically.  He mentioned, first, two cases in which two judges&mdash;one in the Circuit Court and the other in the High Court&mdash;had occasion to comment from the bench on my action in regard to petitions I received.  I am happy to know from what Deputy O'Higgins said that he is solidly behind me in my insistence that, as Minister for Justice, I have the right and the duty to consider any petition which comes before me.  Deputy O'Higgins made it clear that he does not question that for one moment, and indeed I know the overwhelming majority of Deputies will agree that it is necessary for the proper <Col N="647" /> administration of justice that this petition procedure be continued and that the Minister for Justice should have in exceptional cases the right to exercise the prerogative of mercy handed down to him.</P>
    <P>In both the cases concerned&mdash;I do not want to be raking up old sores or stirring up old controversies&mdash;what was at issue was my right, as Minister, to defer the execution of warrants, pending my decision on petitions received.  This was the only issue on which both judges, in my opinion wrongly, commented.  As I said before in the House, I propose to continue to exercise this power.  Until this House decides otherwise, I am not going to be stampeded out of my rights in appropriate cases to instruct the Gardaí to defer execution of the warrant until such time as I have an opportunity of considering a petition coming before me.  If I am not to have this power, then the whole petition procedure is, to all intents and purposes, useless.</P>
    <P>Very often the proper consideration of a petition involves a very great deal of time.  Sometimes it takes up to a month to get all the reports and the views of all the persons concerned. That month could be in many cases crucial.  It would, in effect, be negativing the whole petition procedure if I were to agree to opinions which suggest I should not have the right to defer the execution of warrants in appropriate cases where I receive petitions.  In both of the cases mentioned, as a matter of fact, I rejected the petitions.  I decided not to accede to the petitions, and that the decision of the court should stand.  All that was involved, as I say, was whether or not I had the right, exercised by all my predecessors, to withhold or defer execution of warrants until I had an opportunity of considering the petitions before me.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins also mentioned the case of Mrs. Costello.  I want honestly and seriously to suggest to him that he is making a mountain out of a molehill.  This was a trivial and unimportant matter.  Indeed, to suggest there was any question of the Government using the big stick, of threatening <Col N="648" /> people or of forbidding people to exercise their proper democratic rights is just a little absurd.  All that happened was this.  A report&mdash;as it transpired, an irresponsible report&mdash; appeared in some of the newspapers to the effect that Mrs. Costello was about to embark on an illegal course of action.  The Gardaí, very rightly and as they do frequently from time to time &mdash;and indeed many Deputies here this evening have spoken on the very fact that the Gardaí had a primary obligation to prevent crime if they possibly can rather than have it happen and then detect it &mdash; went along to Mrs. Costello on the basis of this report. They interviewed her politely and courteously and informed her that if this report were true and if she were to embark on this course of action she would render herself liable to prosecution for a criminal offence.  The good lady had no hesitation whatever, having thanked the Gardaí for their services in coming to her, in assuring them she had no intention whatever of pursuing the course which had been suggested, that she had plenty of means at her disposal for conveying her views to members of the Government if she wished to do so and that she intended to avail of these means.  That was the end of the incident.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully returned to his charge that the citizens of the North of Ireland are very lax about their observations of our speed limits.  I have no evidence that this is so but as Deputy Tully assures me from personal observation that he believes it to be, all I can do is to take note of what he says and direct the attention of the Garda authorities to the stretch of roadway in question, the main Dublin-Belfast road.  I am sure the Gardaí already are devoting as much attention to the enforcement of the speed limits along this road as they possibly can but to satisfy Deputy Tully I promise him I shall have a word with them about it and see if anything can be done to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt as fully as Deputies would like with most of the matters that were raised.  If I overlooked any particular point it was through inadvertence and not through <Col N="649" /> any desire to do so.  I hope the explanations I have given commend themselves to the various Deputies concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Transport and Power, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this token Estimate is to enable the Dáil to discuss the 1963-64 Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
      <P>In the Book of Estimates the net Estimate of £5,219,880 is compared with a sum of £5,015,060 granted in 1962-63 (including two Supplementary Estimates for £10 each, and £10,300 in respect of services transferred from another Department) and shows an increase of £204,820 compared with the sum granted last year.</P>
      <P>The 1962-63 figure was increased to £5,067,480 by way of a third Supplementary Estimate for £52,420 (Tourism) which was taken too late for inclusion in the Book of Estimates thereby reducing the net increase of £204,820 to £152,400.</P>
      <P>The principal increases are in the provisions for Salaries, £50,990 (Subhead A); Redundancy Compensation &mdash;Córas Iompair Éireann £120,380 (Subhead D. 2); Tourism £410,000 (subheads F.1, F.2 and F.3); Radio Equipment £189,700 (Subhead K); and Rural Electrification £67,285 (Subhead O).  Increases on other Subheads amounted to £77,000.  This gives a total increase of £915,355 as shown in the Estimate.  The &ldquo;late&rdquo; Supplementary Estimate in 1962-63 increased the grant for that year by £52,420 and thereby reduced the increase to £862,935.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal decreases are in the provisions for Constructional Works at Airports, £440,000 (Subhead G.2); Catering &amp; Sales Service, Shannon Airport £50,000 (Subhead J); Shannon Free Airport Development Company <Col N="651" /> £80,000 (Subhead L.1) and Bottled Gas Installations £61,500 (Subhead Q). Decreases on other subheads amount to £14,170.  To these must be added an increase of £64,865 in the Appropria-tions-in-Aid subhead which is equivalent to a decrease in the net Grant. This brings the total of decreases to £710,535.</P>
    <P>The net increase in the Estimate for 1963/64 compared with 1962/63 is therefore £152,400 as I have already stated.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the first Supplementary Estimate in 1962/63 for a token sum of £10 was to enable the Dáil to debate the full Estimate for 1962/63 subsequent to the passing of the Appropriation Act 1962.</P>
    <P>The Second Supplementary Estimate provided for an increase of £63,490 on <Col N="652" /> the original Estimate of £10&mdash;(Subhead Q&mdash;Grants for Bottled Gas Installations). This sum was offset by savings of £63,480 on other subheads so that only a token sum of £10 was required.</P>
    <P>The third Supplementary sanctioned increases of £30,456 on Subhead F.1 (Sec. 2 of the Tourist Traffic Act 1961) and £102,989 on Subhead F.3 (Development of Holiday Accommodation)&mdash; a total of £133,445.  This increase was offset by savings of £81,025 on Subhead F.2 (Resort Development) so that the additional sum required was £52,420.</P>
    <P>This Estimate was not taken in time for inclusion in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 11th February, 1964.</P>
