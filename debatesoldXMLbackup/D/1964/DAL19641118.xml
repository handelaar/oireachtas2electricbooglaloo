    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if Ireland will now apply for associate membership of the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Developments in the European Economic Community are being followed closely and I see no reason at this stage to modify our application for membership of the Community.  I would, however, direct the Deputy's attention to my remarks, in this connection, in the Dáil on Wednesday last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach would be good enough to say what exactly is the status of our present application for membership?  Is it under consideration, or is it suspended, or are negotiations proceeding in regard to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Action on it has been suspended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It rests there, to be revived at our instance, if and when we ask for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Doubtless the Taoiseach will inform the Dáil, if and when he intends to revive the application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach not say last week that he might give some consideration to a form of association with EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="966" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite in that form.  We are not thinking of association with the Common Market as the permanent relationship between Ireland and the Community, but it will be remembered that a member of the Commission, M. Rey, who visited Ireland last year, suggested it would be advantageous to examine the possibility of an interim arrangement until full membership is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under the impression that the Taoiseach said last week that in the circumstances in which we found ourselves <i>vis-à-vis</i> Britain, we might consider some form of association?  I was wondering if he intended to take any steps towards that end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;association&rdquo; has a particular meaning in the context of the Treaty of Rome.  I used it to signify an interim arrangement rather than a formal association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in regard to that interim arrangement, is the Taoiseach considering that now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are considering it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that action on all applications is suspended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that means we might consider opening negotiations with Brussels for a trade agreement with the Common Market, which would fall neither within the category of association, as technically defined in the Treaty of Rome, nor of membership, as defined in the Treaty of Rome?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I am thinking of something of more significance than a trade agreement, which would be a normal arrangement to have with the Community, once they have reached the stage of having a common external commercial policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government still believe that this country will be a full member <Col N="967" /> of the EEC by 1970; and, if so, if he will state the grounds for this belief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While future development of the European Economic Community is impossible to forecast, I see no sufficient reason to modify at this stage our expectation of membership of the Community by 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we assume from that the Taoiseach considers that Great Britain will be a member by that date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am basing my view on the opinions expressed to us by Governments of countries in the Community that it is reasonable to assume that by 1970 the situation will be such to permit of our proceeding with our application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say whether or not there would be consultations, or mention of our application for membership of the EEC, with the British Government, if and when our Government meet the British Government with a view to formulating a new trade agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is something I have not considered.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he has available to him statistics of the number of cases of elderly geriatric patients not suffering from mental disease who are <Col N="971" /> at present in mental hospitals throughout the country; and, if not, if he will carry out a survey of mental hospitals to obtain this information with a view to planning provision of geriatric care outside the mental hospitals for this type of patient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>In consultation with the Commission of Inquiry on Mental Illness, I caused to be introduced last year a new system of mental hospital statistics designed to give a better picture of our hospital population and of the admissions to and discharges from hospital. An essential element of this new system was the taking of a survey of all the patients in hospital on the 31st March, 1963.  Among the analyses made from this survey was a classification of the patients by reference to the diagnosis of their illness. This classification shows that there are no patients in mental hospitals not suffering from mental disease and this is only to be expected because there is a statutory obligation on persons in charge of mental hospitals to discharge patients who have recovered.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, many elderly patients in mental hospitals.  According to this survey there were 5,305 patients over 62 years of age in district mental hospitals and of these 2,101 were over 72 years.  I am advised that an appreciable number of these do not need the full range of psychiatric treatment which is available in district mental hospitals and could be adequately looked after in less specialised institutions.  During recent years five former sanatoria have been diverted for this kind of use and approximately 700 patients have been transferred to them from mental hospitals.  The possibility of further development along these lines is kept constantly in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the fact that the residents of the Ardrahan area in County Galway are greatly dissatisfied with the decision to abolish the Ardrahan dispensary; if in the circumstances he will reconsider the matter; and if he will receive a deputation from the residents regarding it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there have been local representations regarding the abolition of Ardrahan dispensary district.</P>
      <P>I made the Order abolishing this dispensary district in April, 1963, following receipt and full consideration of proposals to this effect received from Galway County Council which had been unanimously approved by the council.  My decision was taken after full deliberation and I considered the matter fully again when I received a resolution passed by Galway County Council on 25th January, 1964 requesting me to revoke the Order.  As result of this reconsideration, I was satisfied that the case for the abolition of Ardrahan Dispensary District was sound and reasonable and I informed the council in April, 1964 that I did not consider that I would be justified in revoking the Order.</P>
      <P>Since then I have received representations from local bodies in the matter but these have brought no additional material factors to light which were not previously examined by me in my consideration of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances, I do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by my meeting a deputation <Col N="973" /> from residents of the dispensary district regarding the matter.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to questions addressed by him on 5th February, 1964.</P>
      <P>I am not empowered to intervene in relation to the discharge by the Civil Service Commissioners by their statutory functions.  I am not prepared to initiate legislation to alter a system which has worked satisfactorily over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that while the Commissioners had not previously done wrong, they may have done wrong in this case, would the Minister not agree that it is a matter of elementary justice that any person suspected of committing a wrong should be notified of what he is suspected of having done before he is punished?  Having regard to the fact that these suspicions of the Commissioners have prevented a person getting a pass in two examinations, is it not proper that he should take remedial steps to ensure that he is given full details of the matter in order that he may be in a position to defend himself?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed the Deputy on 29th January last that it was proposed to interview the candidate in this particular case, but when the Deputy put down the question the interview was deferred until the question was answered.  Nothing further <Col N="977" /> was heard from the Deputy until 6th October, and by that time another examination had just concluded and the Commissioners were awaiting the result.  That result has now come through and the Commissioners are prepared to see the candidate at any time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <P>And that subsequently the Commissioners&mdash;and up to this date&mdash;have not communicated with the candidate in question but have assumed that a person whose injustice is raised in this House has no right to be communicated with by them?

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the candidate asked to be told what was being alleged against him, that after asking that, the matter was raised in this House by me and that subsequently the Commissioners have never communicated with the person concerned, not even to this day, and have never told him what was alleged against him in respect of this examination?</P>

      <P>A meeting of military experts to consider the technical aspects of United Nations peace-keeping operations took place in Ottawa from 2nd to 6th November, inclusive, at the invitation of the Government of Canada.  Representatives from the following twenty-three countries attended: Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, Ghana, <Col N="986" /> India, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Liberia, Malaysia, Morocco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sweden, Tunisia and United Arab Republic.  The Military Adviser to the Secretary-General of the United Nations attended the meeting as an observer.</P>
      <P>Three working groups were established. Group 1 studied the questions of composition, command, control and liaison, training and operational problems. Group 2 studied questions relating to environmental operating information and logistic support.  Group 3 studied personnel administration, public relations, accounting procedures, and legal problems.</P>
      <P>The chairmen of the working groups reported to the delegates on the work of their groups at the final plenary session, but no attempt was made to reach formal conclusions on the items discussed.  I feel that the exchange of views at the meeting will contribute to the effectiveness of such national forces as may be made available to the United Nations in the future, and that the meeting therefore has served the general purpose of improving the efficiency of United Nations peace-keeping operations.</P>

Alternatively, if permission for development has been refused on appeal and the owner of the land claims that the land has become incapable of reasonably beneficial use in its existing state and that it cannot be rendered capable of such use by the carrying out of any other development for which permission has either been granted or promised, he may serve a notice on the planning authority requiring them to purchase his interest in the land in accordance with the provisions of section 29 of the Act.</P>

      <P>The Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Acts apply only to land in county health districts.  Land in urban areas, however, is rated only on a proportion of the valuation.  Such land includes, in addition to parks, <Col N="995" /> playing fields, and other open spaces, building sites and other nonagricultural land which, as compared with land in county health districts, has an enhanced value as potential sites for housing and other development, due in the main, to the operations of the local authority and the availability of the public services provided.  It is not proposed to change the law affecting the rating of land in urban areas.</P>
      <P>The standard rates of State housing grants are payable in urban as well as rural areas.  The higher scale of grants for small farmers and other classes in rural areas is a measure designed to deal with the special problems of rural rehousing.  So far as supplementary grants are concerned, there is no discrimination in housing legislation between farmers in urban areas and those in rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The post of building construction instructor which is not to be confused with that of woodwork instructor calls for a very special type of recruit.  The recruit must possess not only full qualifications as a tradesman but must have adequate supervisory experience in the building industry. In addition he must have those attributes which are required of a teacher.</P>
      <P>The field of recruitment has, therefore, always been a very narrow one and has in recent times been narrowed further by the great demand in the building industry for men of the qualifications and experience mentioned.</P>
      <P>Because of these facts and because also of the fact that many vocational education committees are increasing the number of building construction instructors employed by them, there is at present a shortage of such instructors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to inform the House that a new National Loan will open for subscription on Monday next, 23 November. The loan will be for £20 million but £4 million of the stock is being allotted to certain life assurance offices and an application for £4 million of the stock is being made on behalf of funds under my control.  The balance of £12 million will be underwritten jointly by the banks and the Government.</P>
      <P>The rate of interest will be 6 per cent per annum and the price £98½ per cent.  The stock will be redeemed at par not later than 1990 and may be redeemed at any time from November, 1985.  The yield to redemption on these terms is £6 3s. 0d.</P>
      <P>The usual provision is made in the prospectus whereby only 10 per cent of the purchase price need be paid on application, the remainder being paid in three further instalments spread over the period to the middle of January.  Those subscribers who wish to pay the full amount on application next week, or to complete their subscription on 16th December, will be entitled to discount equivalent to an interest rate of 6 per cent per annum on the advance payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax privileges attached to recent National Loans are again included. Interest will be paid without deduction of income tax at source, but, of course, holders will, if ordinarily resident in the State, be liable for whatever tax on the interest is appropriate to their respective incomes. Stock of the issue will be accepted at <Col N="1020" /> its nominal value as the equivalent of cash in satisfaction of death duties on properties of which it formed a part. The stock and the interest on it will be exempt from all Irish taxation, present and future, if owned by a person neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
    <P>The issue is being made under the authority of the Appropriation Act, 1964, and other statutes.  Both principal and interest will be a charge on the Central Fund.  The attractive interest rate it carries, its status as a trustee security, the concession whereby it will be accepted in payment of death duties and substantial sinking fund allocations should ensure that the stock will always have a high market value.  The Government stockbroker will be ready continually to buy and sell reasonable amounts of the stock, and this will help to maintain an active market in it.</P>
    <P>The loan is required for the financing of State capital outlay on agriculture and industry, on housing, sanitary services and schools, on afforestation and fuel resources, on transport and on other development schemes in pursuance of the Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
    <P>The prospectus of the issue will be published in tomorrow morning's newspapers.  Copies of the prospectus, with the application form for subscriptions attached, will also be available as from tomorrow from any bank, stockbroker or post office.  The lists will close not later than Friday, 27th November.</P>
    <P>I ask every Deputy in the House to give the issue his full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of a National Loan is not a Party matter but a national matter.  Accordingly, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I wish to make it clear we give the issue <Col N="1021" /> our full support.  Any advance we can hope to make in our national living standards depends on a programme of capital investment, and that programme must be financed to a very large degree from the savings of our own people.  The National Loan offers an opportunity to those people who have any amounts, large or small, to take part in this development.</P>
      <P>It is very often accepted by people outside that the issue of a National Loan is something of concern only to the large investor.  It cannot be too often stressed that the small investor is more than welcome in National Loans and that it is indeed the accumulation of small subscriptions that helps to make the issue of a National Loan a real success.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the proceeds of this Loan will be used for the purposes of productive investment. In this scientific and technological age, it requires very great investment indeed for a real advance. Accordingly, we on this side of the House can fully understand the necessity for productive capital investment, and indeed we have long advocated it.  In addition, social investment&mdash; matters such as housing&mdash;requires great priority, particularly in the city of Dublin.</P>
      <P>On that account we sincerely hope the issue will be a success.  It should be a success, because the rate of interest and the terms offered are very favourable to investors.  I think it is almost the highest rate that has ever been offered and I know of only one other occasion when a very slightly greater discount was given.  In the circumstances, those who subscribe to the Loan will not only be doing something useful and worthwhile for the country but, in addition, will be getting a really substantial benefit for themselves by way of the interest and repayment terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I should like to express our approval of the issue of this Loan which we thoroughly recommend to the public.  It should be attractive to investors because of the generosity of its terms.  It is pleasing to note that <Col N="1022" /> £4 million of the stock is being taken up by certain large assurance companies. It is encouraging to see they are prepared to invest part of their incomes in an Irish Loan.  I should like to ask one small question.  Two or three years ago when a Loan was issued these companies took up £4.8 million.  I think I am right in assuming from the Minister's speech that £4 million was the amount allotted to them and is not what they applied for?</P>
      <P>It should be impressed on the people that this money is being raised for national development.  If we are to further progress in industry, agriculture, the building of houses and schools and the development of forestry and fisheries, we must be prepared to continue to raise by way of loan the money necessary for these activities. Like all National Loans, this Loan will test the faith of the nation in the future development of the country.  I have no doubt that on this occasion, as in the past, there will be a very generous response.</P>
      <P>We are wholeheartedly behind the Loan.  While we may differ on the methods of development, the priorities and the details of expenditure, that does not make any difference: we back any project, such as the raising of a National Loan, for the development of the country.  We believe in the necessity of this investment and of saving for the provision of such investment. For those reasons, we fully support the Loan and recommend it to the public.</P>

      <P>Over the weekend, has the Minister considered the lengthy and reasonable debate which took place last Thursday with reference to the dual position of the Secretary of his Department being also a Land Commissioner?  Has the Minister had an opportunity of discussing this matter with the heads of his Department or has he sought any advice which might help him to see reason in this matter?  It is a matter on which the Minister would be well advised to make a statement for the record.  The statement he has made does not hold water and few will consider seriously the excuse he gave.  I feel there is some other motive behind this.  The Minister should re-examine it.  If the Minister has not sought the advice of his Department, perhaps between now and Report Stage, he will be prepared to go into it fully?</P>
      <P>The points raised by the Leader of the Opposition are points which have met with one hundred per cent approval from the general public.  That is why I think that this is something on which the Minister ought not adopt a childish attitude.  This is going to be a very serious matter for landowners and the decisions which will be taken by the Commissioners will be very serious for the people.  In order to have the whole matter straightened out, it would be as well to have all these problems cleared up while we are on this section of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon pointed out that this Party have acted throughout the whole course of the Bill in a very reasonable way and I should like to take this opportunity to deny some of the statements made by Government Deputies over the weekend.  It was alleged that this Party are deliberately obstructing the passage of this Bill.  There is nothing further from the truth.  There has not been any obstruction but, on the contrary, constructive proposals have been made by this Party.  We want to make this Bill a workable Bill and that is the reason we have gone through it section by section and subsection by <Col N="1024" /> subsection, to help the Government to change what we consider the bad sections of the Bill into something really workable.  The statements made by Fianna Fáil Deputies would lead one to believe that there is no section in the Bill with which we agree.  There are valuable and useful proposals in it and we want to see these sections put through and brought into operation so that their benefits will accrue to the people.</P>
    <P>When we are of the opinion that there are sections, such as these we are now discussing, which would be bad for the country, it is our duty as a constructive Opposition to focus attention on them.  That is our duty as an Opposition and surely the Minister realises that that is so, and particularly so in the case of a constructive Opposition, anxious to give the country the best type of land legislation.  That is one of the reasons I feel the Minister would be well advised to tell us now, in order to expedite the passage of the Bill, that he is prepared to see reason and will reconsider the attitude of his Department in relation to the position of the Secretary of the Department.</P>
    <P>We have debated these amendments at very great length and there is nothing that could be said on them that has not already been said.  All we want is to extract from the Minister an undertaking that he will examine the matter seriously and not deal with it lightly as he appears to be dealing with it.  The decisions which will be taken in relation to this section are likely to be contested in the courts and the result of such a contest will not be favourable to the Land Commission.  We want to avoid that and now is the time to do so. That is why I ask the Minister to leave aside his childish attitude, to take the work of his Department seriously and to protect the interests of the landowners of this country from decisions which might later be found to be unconstitutional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee Stage of this Bill started on 3rd March, 1964.  This is the sixteenth day Dáil Éireann is discussing the Committee Stage and I leave it to the public to judge whether <Col N="1025" /> there has been obstruction or not. Deputy Flanagan has asked me if I took advice on these amendments over the weekend.  I suggest that Deputy Flanagan is the person who should take advice from his own colleague, Deputy Professor Patrick McGilligan, on this issue.  I have put the matter on record in Deputy McGilligan's words when he said that, in his opinion, it was desirable where four Commissioners were operating, that both the posts of Secretary of the Department of Lands and that of Chief Inspector should be held by Commissioners. Deputy Professor McGilligan hoped that the way would be left open for such an arrangement in future.  That was his letter to his colleague, Deputy Blowick, as Minister for Lands.</P>
      <P>Here is the letter drawn up by the pride of Fine Gael in the field of constitutional law, Deputy McGilligan. That was what he thought to be not alone practical but desirable for the future running of the Land Commission. I am quite satisfied to accept his interpretation of the law, quite satisfied to accept his considered view that this is a proper proposal.  I am quite satisfied that Deputy McGilligan, who is eminent in the field of constitutional law, would not make this recommendation unless he was satisfied that it is acceptable by our courts.  Should the matter ever arise, I am sure that my legal advisers will have Deputy McGilligan come into court and confirm his advice given to Deputy Blowick when Deputy Blowick was Minister for Lands.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to what Deputy Dillon stated on the last occasion in column 851 when he said:</P>
      <P>We will put down an amendment on the Report Stage which will declare once and for all that executive officers of the Department of Lands must not be members of the Land Commission, and that the quasi-judicial status of the Land Commission must be restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has indicated his intention to put down an amendment on the Report Stage and I suggest that we can debate the rights or wrongs of this <Col N="1026" /> matter, as advised by Deputy Professor McGilligan, on that Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not right to let the Minister away with the idea that Deputy McGilligan wrote to Deputy Blowick giving his legal opinion in this matter.  Deputy McGilligan wrote as Minister for Finance, giving the official view of his Department to Deputy Blowick as Minister for Lands.  Nothing could be further from the truth now than for the present Minister for Lands to say that Deputy McGilligan was giving a legal opinion.  The Minister is not familiar with his facts and he must be under the impression that Deputy McGilligan was writing as Attorney General.  Deputy McGilligan held with honour and distinction a number of very important posts, Minister for Industry and Commerce, Minister for Finance and Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The present Minister discovered a letter in his Department.  Whether he had the able assistance of the Minister for Local Government or not, we cannot say, but in the letter it was found that Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance was conveying the official Departmental view on this matter.  Nobody knows better than the Minister for Lands that every Minister for Finance who properly and efficiently carries out his duties, as Deputy McGilligan did, must take all steps to cut down public expenditure, and here we see a good Minister for Finance saving the taxpayers, keeping down expenditure and ensuring there was no extravagance in any State Department.  He was giving his approval when he saw that one man could do the work of two, something that any Minister for Finance would be delighted to do and if he did otherwise, he would not be doing his job efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But if Deputy McGilligan had been asked to express a legal opinion on the matter, it would be very different from his expression of opinion as Minister for Finance, entrusted by the country with the job of ensuring economies in administration.  Unlike Fianna Fáil, who promised to reduce the number of civil servants and at one stage were <Col N="1027" /> going to get one civil servant to do the work of three, here was Deputy McGilligan exercising economy.  Now, the Minister for Lands turns and twists the letter giving an official opinion of the Department of Finance to the then Minister for Lands.  I want to put on record that this was not Deputy McGilligan's legal expression of opinion but an opinion of the Department of Finance conveyed through the Minister to the Minister for Lands.  It was nothing more.  I now trust that the Minister for Lands will see the folly of his statement and how unreasonable it is, and how untrue are the conclusions he draws from the letter that he had discovered and about which we heard nothing until last Thursday.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to communicate with his colleagues, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Justice, and get them to look for another letter because there is another letter, an expression of opinion from Commissioner Dan Browne, that it is most undesirable that the Secretary of the Department should be a Land Commissioner.  The Minister had no trouble, with the aid of his colleagues, in finding Deputy McGilligan's letter because he feels it is something he can twist and turn to suit his purpose, but it is a different matter when it comes to finding the official views which must be on record, of every Land Commissioner since the State was founded.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the late Mr. Deegan who retired in 1951, every one of them expressed the view that it was unwise and undesirable to have the Secretary a Land Commissioner.  Whether the Minister has checked or not, there must be on record an expression of opinion by the late Commissioner Browne.  It was made in the presence of some high-ranking officials at present in the Land Commission and he said that in no circumstances was it wise or desirable that the Secretary should be a Land Commissioner.  The only person to express the opposite view was the late Mr. Deegan.</P>
    <P>I now ask the Minister to make more inquiries in his Department and to give us the facts which he has so far failed <Col N="1028" /> to convey to the House as to why every Land Commissioner, with the exception of the late Mr. Deegan, held it was unwise that the Secretary should be a Land Commissioner.  I assure the Minister that we shall go on to debate this on the Report Stage and since the Minister is not prepared to see reason, perhaps it is better to leave it over until the Report Stage.  In all seriousness, I ask the Minister to explain his unreasonable attitude in this matter.</P>

      <P>I have listened to this debate from the very beginning.  I had a completely open mind on the section then, not having had the experience of other Deputies of the working of this system, but, having listened to the arguments on both sides, I am perfectly satisfied that the Minister's side has been more convincing than Fine Gael. That is a personal opinion.  If a vote did take place, I would recommend my Party to vote in that way.</P>
      <P>The Minister, however, has referred to holding up the Bill and I want to point out that the Bill contains 45 sections and since it was introduced, the Minister has introduced 46 amendments, one of them running into a complete page of the amendment sheet.  Some of these amendments were broken down into (a), (b), (c) and (d), so that, in fact, if taken separately, the figure would be nearer the 60 mark.  I am satisfied that if anyone must bear responsibility for the length of time we are debating the Bill, it is the Minister and those who drafted a Bill which, before getting halfway through Committee Stage, required 46 suggested amendments, so, while there may be something in what the Minister says about some of the sections being held up, he must bear his full share of the responsibility for the condition in which the Bill reached this House and the way in which it has been dealt with since it reached the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully has made a very effective answer to the outrageous suggestion of the Minister and the unreasonable attitude he has adopted in complaining that this Committee Stage took sixteen days to discuss in this House.  That is a tribute to <Col N="1029" /> the serious consideration given to the Bill by all the members of the House and it was in consequence of the fact that the Bill was framed in such a manner and contained such obnoxious inclusions that it was necessary to spotlight what was objectionable so that the Bill would be remedied in Committee.</P>
      <P>It is also true that the Bill must have been presented to the Government in ample time for the members of the Government to give it the consideration which it deserved before it ever reached this House on Second Stage. One must remember that it is the very same Government as, we assume, gave similar consideration to the Succession Bill and we assume that they were as confident of the advisability of the inclusion of every provision in that Bill as they are in relation to the measure before the House now.  The contributions made in the necessarily lengthy deliberations that ensued following the introduction of this Bill had the effect of making it necessary for the Minister to bring in an inordinate number of amendments so as to rectify the Bill as it stood when it left the Government table.</P>
      <P>We would be happier if the Minister and the Government had gone further, had treated this Bill as drastically as they were compelled to review the Succession Bill.  We wish that they would have agreed to drop proposals that are causing considerable disquiet throughout the country relative to the removal of what had been accepted down through generations, and was so dearly won, by way of rights for the farmers.</P>
      <P>We have no apology, therefore, to offer for the close attention to detail and the trojan efforts put into the discussion at all Stages of this Bill up to now.  The same attention will be devoted to it until it leaves the House and then we will be able to bring it home to the people that every effort was made to see that those parts of the Bill that were obnoxious would be removed and, if they have not been removed or rectified, it cannot be alleged that that was due to any dilatoriness on the part of the Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I must, for the record, reiterate that there is no evidence at all in the Land Commission that the late Commissioner Browne or any other Commissioner suggested that the Secretary of the Department should not also be a Lay Commissioner.  Deputy O.J. Flanagan glibly keeps repeating these assertions but I have given the House anything that we have on record on this issue from the letter that I put on record from the late Commissioner Deegan, who said it was essential for the Secretary to be a Land Commissioner, to the letter of Deputy McGilligan, who was then Minister for Finance, to Deputy Blowick, as Minister for Lands.</P>
      <P>What I want to ask is this: where is Deputy McGilligan, the pride of Fine Gael, the nation's hope in the field of constitutional law?  What is wrong with Deputy McGilligan coming into this House and denying authorship of this letter dated 26th April, 1949 and telling the House that he was not responsible for it and that it was written by civil servants?  I put it on the record of the House before and I will put it on record again that in writing to Deputy Blowick, the then Minister for Lands, he said:</P>
      <P>With reference to your letter of 1st April, 1949 and to our discussion of 21st idem about the future position of the Land Commissioners I set out hereunder in modified form my suggestions for dealing with the problem.</P>
      <P>This letter confirms that there was a discussion between Deputy Blowick, the then Minister for Lands, and Deputy McGilligan on this issue, and following that discussion, Deputy McGilligan wrote and gave his considered view to Deputy Blowick as to how the Land Commissioners should be constituted and as to the desirability of making the Secretary of the Department of Lands a Commissioner of Lands or Lay Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what wriggling is done on this issue by Deputy Flanagan, there is a simple way of denying authorship of this letter.  It is signed by Deputy Patrick McGilligan, Professor of Constitutional Law for many years in University College, Dublin, a former Attorney General, and <Col N="1031" /> Deputy Flanagan suggests that Deputy McGilligan did not know what he was writing about when he writes and tells Deputy Blowick that the proper thing to do would be to make the Secretary of the Department a Commissioner for Lands.</P>
    <P>It is alleged by Deputy Flanagan that because Commissioner O'Brien, Secretary of the Department of Lands, is now Commissioner, anything done in future will be completely unconstitutional because of Commissioner O'Brien's appointment.  It is extraordinary that this did not occur to the Fine Gael constitutional legal authority, Deputy McGilligan, when writing to Deputy Blowick and advising him that for proper administration it was not alone right but desirable that not alone should the Secretary of the Department of Lands also be a Lay Commissioner but that the Chief Inspector of the Department of Lands should also be a Commissioner and this letter was following discussion between these two Ministers on this issue at that time.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Dillon puts down this amendment on Report Stage, we can go into this matter further.  I am quite prepared to accept Deputy Professor McGilligan's advice to his then colleague at that time and I am quite prepared to accept that Deputy McGilligan's view of the law is correct and that if ever this matter is raised before the Supreme Court, Deputy McGilligan's view will prevail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is deliberately raising a dust storm to cover something and for the past five minutes I have been puzzling as to what he is trying to cover up.  There is no doubt that these notes from Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance came across to me.  There is no denying that.  As Deputy Flanagan has pointed out, it is the duty of every Minister for Finance to watch every sixpence expenditure or else he is not worthy to be Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kernel of the whole thing is this&mdash;when I took over the Department in 1948, there were three judicial posts.  In other words, each of three Commissioners held a judicial post <Col N="1032" /> as well as an administrative post.  The late Commissioner Deegan was Commissioner and Secretary of the Department and Secretary of the Land Commission. He had three posts.  He was Secretary of the Department of Lands, which included Gaeltacht Services and Forestry as well as the Land Commission at the time.  The late Commissioner Herlihy, if I remember correctly, was Commissioner and Assistant Secretary.  Ex-Commissioner Waddell was Chief Inspector and Commissioner. They were three posts.</P>
    <P>In the 1950 Act, I proposed to separate these three; in other words, to let the Commissioners be Commissioners only and to let the administrative men be administrators only. That meant increasing the cost of running the Department because, while each of the Commissioners I have mentioned held both judicial and administrative posts, they were paid for only one.  Deputy McGilligan foresaw that by the 1950 Act I was adding, not perhaps very seriously, but somewhat, to the administrative cost of the Department, and as Minister for Finance, he would be perfectly justified in sending me a much stronger note than that.  Let me say also that Deputy McGilligan did not go into a tantrum and resign his post as Minister in the inter-Party Government of the day.  The matter came up at a Cabinet meeting; the Cabinet decided what was to be done, and that was that.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made great play with this whole thing.  I do not lose any sleep because the present Commisioner, Mr. O'Brien, is Secretary as well as Commissioner.  I do not believe the Minister's explanation but I believe that the present Secretary, Mr. O'Brien, will administer the two posts properly and correctly.  Therefore if there was a vote on the question, I do not think I would take sides, even though I deliberately, in the 1950 Act, took away the administrative posts from three Commissioners of the day. During the four or five years I was Minister for Lands, I could not see any great damage being done by having Commissioner Deegan as Commissioner and Secretary.  I have nothing <Col N="1033" /> but praise for him and I have nothing but the highest respect for his two colleagues who had administrative posts for many years before I became Minister for Lands, Commissioners Waddell and Herlihy.</P>
    <P>If the Bill goes through in its present form, it will not disturb me in the least if Mr. O'Brien is Commissioner and Secretary, because knowing Mr. O'Brien as I do, I have not the slightest doubt that he will carry out his judicial and administrative duties in an absolutely fair manner.  That has been my experience over many years.  I have no doubt that when Mr. O'Brien comes to relinquish the two posts, there will be, as always, a decent official who can be safely appointed.  As I say, I have such an open mind that if there was a vote, I do not think I would take one side or the other.</P>
    <P>Let me refer now to an aspect of this Bill which has been disturbing the Minister very much, that is, the horrible obstruction that Deputies on this side of the House, myself included, have been engaging in.  What has been the history of this Bill?  The very first thing that happened was that the Taoiseach, away back in 1961, at a Muintir na Tire meeting in Thurles, announced or forecast this Bill, and so the Bill was conceived.  It was finally born last year after hatching somewhere for three years.  Now the Minister wants to steamroll it through the House.  What have we got?  We have a Bill with a few good points, a whole lot of blah-blah and two very poisonous stings in it.  We as an Opposition are perfectly justified in fighting to the last ditch.  One of the stings is that a farmer is denied the right to let his land or do what he likes with it.  The second sting is the right of the Minister to order an inspection of land, thus taking away the right of ownership which we fought so hard to get.</P>

That is another way of saying we have no right to criticise him when he brings in a Bill, that we should go down on our knees and thank God for such a brainy Minister for Lands who brings in such a perfect Bill.  That is his attitude.  There are two very poisonous stings in this Bill which I want to put across to the people.  The Minister is taking steps to deny people the right to let their holdings.  Again, although it has passed the Committee Stage, I say the Minister is doing a rotten job of work for the farmers if he denies them the right to do what they like with their own land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not possibly allow the Minister to get away with what he has said.  He has endeavoured to show that Fine Gael are opposed to Mr. O'Brien as Commissioner and Secretary of the Department. May I place on record that I have known Mr. O'Brien for over 20 years and I want to add to the tributes that have already been paid to him as a conscientious, honourable, highly qualified civil servant?  If there was any one man in Ireland who was well qualified for the position of Commissioner it is Mr. O'Brien.  What Deputy Blowick has missed and what other Deputies do not seem to realise is that at the present time it makes no difference whether the Secretary of the Department is also a Commissioner because what is happening at the moment is quiet different from what can happen when this Bill is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> At the present time the Minister has no right to order a senior inspector of his Department to inspect any man's land.  That is the great difference between Mr. O'Brien being Commissioner and Secretary now, between Mr. Deegan being Commissioner and Secretary in his day, and the future situation.  The power that the Minister has already won for himself in this Bill makes it impossible for the Civil Service head of his Department to carry out his duties, no matter how good or well meaning he may be.</P>
    <P>Here we have the Civil Service head of the Department taking an order from his own Minister to cause an inspection or to decide on the distance limits with which we are now dealing. His Departmental Secretary issues these instructions and then the farmer makes an appeal against what he feels is a wrong and unjust decision.  To whom is he appealing?  He is appealing to Mr. O'Brien, not this time as the Minister's agent, Secretary of his Department, but as a Commissioner, both judge and jury in the Land Commission. He will be asked as a Commissioner whether it was right or wrong for him to carry out his own administrative orders.  That is why this Bill is an entirely new departure.</P>
    <P>Up to now, whether it was Mr. O'Brien or Mr. Deegan who was Secretary and Commissioner, it was all the same.  The Minister for Lands of the day had not the power the Minister has vested in him in this Bill.  We have disposed of that section and the House has agreed to give him that power.  Because he has that power, we seriously object to the Secretary of his Department, who has to take his instructions, sitting in judgment as a Land Commissioner on an issue passed to him by his own Minister to deal with.  That is our objection.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have no objection whatsoever to Mr. O'Brien&mdash;quite the contrary. There is not a more highly qualified man in Europe to be a Land Commissioner.  What we object to is this entirely new departure whereunder <Col N="1036" /> the Minister will have powers no Minister ever had before and it is that that changes completely the position in relation to the Secretary of the Department being also a Land Commissioner. The Minister is now trying to make the case that this is Fine Gael versus Mr. O'Brien.  Our objections were clearly stated.  It makes no difference to this Party who the Secretary is because, after the next general election, we propose, as the Government, so to alter this measure as to remove both the unreasonableness and the embarrassment which the powers the Minister has now won for himself will cause. The House and the country have been made aware of our views on this matter by the Leader of the Opposition. It is wrong of the Minister to try to convey to the House that this Party object to Mr. O'Brien.  It is all the same who the Secretary is.  This Bill is unconstitutional and the moment we get authority from the people we propose to change it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Blowick said the gestation period of this Bill was some three years.  That is quite inaccurate. The Taoiseach's speech, to which the Deputy referred, was made on 14th August, 1962, and this Bill was introduced in July, 1963.  What will happen after the next election is another matter, but, if Deputy O.J. Flanagan continues to pursue the policy he has been pursuing on this Bill, I doubt very much that he will be here after the next election.</P>
      <P>On the principle of this matter, Deputy Blowick sees no objection to the Secretary of the Department being also a Lay Commissioner.  Labour Deputies see no objection.  Only in the Fine Gael benches has there been some sinister motive attributed to the appointment of the Secretary as a Lay Commissioner.  Strange to say, the Cumann na nGaedheal Government away back in 1930 appointed the then Secretary, Mr. Deegan, a Lay Commissioner. They were all in favour of this procedure.  Deputy McGilligan is all in favour of it.  I think I have said sufficient.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>In page 15, lines 2 to 5, to delete &ldquo;or, in the case only of land forming the bank or shore of a lake or river, the provision of facilities for persons boating or fishing on the lake or river,&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;or (in the case only of land not adjoining an occupied dwellinghouse which was in existence at the commencement of the qualifying period) the provision of facilities for persons boating or fishing on the sea or on a lake or river,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have received very reasonable representations to the effect that, where the Land Commission provide a site on the bank of a lake or river for the use of persons boating or fishing, there will be a tendency for these people to use the site for picnic meals and perhaps to light fires for that purpose.  If the site were adjacent to a dwellinghouse, such activities might create nuisances for the residents in the form of smoke and noise and I propose, therefore, that sites near dwelling-houses should be excluded, but, so that no landowner may seek to defeat acquisition proceedings by starting to erect a dwelling nearby, the concession will apply only to an occupied dwellinghouse which is in existence for one year before the commencement of proceedings.  I am also taking this opportunity to add in &ldquo;sea&rdquo; as well as the &ldquo;lake or river&rdquo; covered in the earlier text.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware there has <Col N="1038" /> been some criticism about people buying land adjoining the foreshore where traditional rights of access were enjoyed by the public going to the shore and excluding or purporting to exclude the public from enjoying these traditional rights.  If the public were sufficiently active where these rights exist, they could, under the law as it stands, claim a public right-of-way. In many cases the public have been slow to act mainly because, as we say in the country, what is everybody's business is nobody's business.  I have received complaints that certain purchasers of land, particularly in the south, have stopped people enjoying certain traditional amenities in the way of access to the seashore.  In future, where the Land Commission are satisfied that the public enjoyed certain facilities giving them access to the sea, and where these facilities are denied, the Land Commission can take action to provide such rights-of-way to enable the public to continue the enjoyment of their traditional rights.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first part of the amendment, provision is made that the Land Commission will not compulsorily acquire places on lakes or rivers beside an existing dwellinghouse. I think this is reasonable.  It is designed to meet representations made to me since the Second Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Assuming the Land Commission decide to provide boating facilities or a place where boats can anchor, and so on, it would defeat the Land Commission's purpose if the owner could start erecting a house near the place designed to be taken over by the Land Commission.  Without the clause, the owner could defeat the purpose of the Land Commission and therefore we say the Land Commission would be stopped from taking a site on the lake and that the house must have been there a year before they commenced proceedings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is anything unreasonable in the Minister's amendment.  The section in general gives power to the Land Commission compulsorily to acquire land <Col N="1039" /> adjoining a lake or river in order to provide boating or fishing facilities. There was a certain amount of anxiety on the part of owners of residential property that the Land Commission, in their anxiety to provide these facilities, might considerably reduce the value of property convenient to such a site.  I am glad the Minister is taking these steps suitably to amend this section so as to convey to the owners of residential property that there will be no possibility of the Land Commission making an effort to reduce the value of their property in their effort to provide boating or fishing facilities.</P>
      <P>It is true that the owner of a residence convenient to a lake or river would have the value of his property seriously reduced if he had not got the safeguards which the Minister's amendment now guarantees him.  It could be that the public, having the right of freedom convenient to a lake or river and starting, as the Minister pointed out, picnic fires and so on, could be the cause of a plantation being burned through carelessness.  That is why I am glad to see these steps being taken and to see that the hazards which landowners had in mind will disappear completely.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether he has considered, or is considering, the question of compensation for landowners where compulsory powers are to be used and where the landowner may not wish voluntarily to surrender portion of his ground convenient to a lake or river.  Perhaps he might have decided to have a pleasure garden there for himself, might have been considering the family privacy or might have had other plans involving the spending of large sums of money on his property to maintain the beauty, peace and quiet of the place.  Then he finds that the Land Commission are going to acquire part of his property in order to provide boating and fishing facilities.  What would be the nature of the compensation that would be paid in such a case and will there be machinery to consider fully the case of such an aggrieved party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree fully with the steps being <Col N="1040" /> taken by the Minister to ensure that where the public have enjoyed rights of way to the sea, these rights of way will be preserved.  This question has aroused a lot of anxiety, more particularly because we have seen aliens who purchased lands and who had no responsibility whatever to the country, restricting the movement of persons through rights of way to the sea which had been established hundreds of years.  As the Minister pointed out the general public are very slow to take legal action in a case of that kind.  Some public-spirited citizen must be the first to move in order to set the legal machinery moving and nobody wants to be the first.  That is why I am glad that where it has been or can be established that rights of way to the sea exist, steps will be taken to ensure that no alien or other person will obstruct the movement of the public through the right of way. I trust that if the attention of the Land Commission is directed to any case where an absentee landlord, an alien or an owner of land, for selfish reasons wishes to prevent the public from using the right of way to the sea, they will take steps to see that the interests of the public are protected. These amendments will ensure that the rights of way that have existed will be maintained and that the public will not be prevented from using them.</P>

      <P>I should like to inquire if this amendment relates only to rights of way to the sea.  I fully agree with what Deputy O.J. Flanagan and the Minister have said and with what the country feels generally about the inviolability of such rights of way. It seems to me, however, that it may develop the problem of the deprivation of public rights of way which do not concern access to the sea.  I am thinking of places of scenic beauty where people take walks, say, in and around Dublin.  I know of one place in the county where it was possible some years ago for the public to take walks.  There is no question of access to the sea from this place but it might have been acquired by foreign interests. I am happy to say that that did <Col N="1041" /> not happen.  I should like to know if this amendment will provide that any right of way which has no relation to access to the sea will also be protected by this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Under these amendments, we are, for the first time, taking power to create rights of way into lakes and rivers.  I found from my experience as a fisherman in dealing with fishing clubs that in many cases, where you have troublesome landowners, it is impossible for clubs to operate.  Fishing as a sport is becoming more and more popular with our people.  There was no power I could find to enable boat owners to anchor boats off shore, because it can be argued that riparian owners are the owners of the land to the middle of the stream, and likewise in regard to many lakes except what are called State lakes.  Therefore I feel it is necessary in this day and age to provide for these amenities to enable fishermen and tourists to have access to these lakes and rivers and, of course, to the sea, as I explained before the Deputy came in.</P>
      <P>Under this amendment, we are taking power to acquire sites along rivers, lakes and at the seaside.  Though it was not usual for them to do so, I think under the existing law that the Land Commission could provide a right of way, but the practice has been to do so for the purpose of giving access to people for land user rather than for the purpose the Deputy has mentioned.  However, I think there is nothing in law to stop the Land Commission acquiring a right of way to some scenic spot, as the Deputy has suggested, if they so desire and if a proper case is made for such acquisition by the public.</P>

    <P>The short answer to Deputy Flanagan about where the Land Commission would exercise these powers to take sites on lakes and rivers and provide access is that they will have to pay the full market value for the land.  People are entitled to compensation. Just like any normal land acquisition, if they are not satisfied with the price offered, they will have <Col N="1042" /> an appeal at law to the Appeal Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 40a:</P>
      <P>In page 15, lines 9 to 29, to delete &ldquo;(b) either&mdash;&rdquo; and subparagraphs (i) and (ii), and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) any one of the following requirements which is applicable has been <i>bona fide</i> complied with&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) where a person other than a body corporate is the sole tenant or proprietor of the land &mdash;such person has throughout the whole of the qualifying period resided either on the land or in the immediate neighbourhood thereof;</P>
      <P>(ii) where a body corporate is the sole tenant or proprietor of the land&mdash;each of the persons entitled to a beneficial interest in the body corporate has throughout the whole of the qualifying period resided either on the land or in the immediate neighbourhood thereof;</P>
      <P>(iii) in any case not mentioned in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph&mdash;all the persons entitled to a beneficial interest in any part of or share in the land and all the persons entitled to a beneficial interest in the body or bodies corporate, which is or are entitled to any part of or share in the land, have throughout the whole of the qualifying period resided either on the land or in the immediate neighbourhood thereof;</P>
      <P>provided that the requirement in respect of residence shall in no case be satisfied or deemed to be satisfied by compliance with any statutory provision whatsoever relating to residence by a body corporate, and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments are designed to improve the wording of those parts of the text which deal with the residence qualification.  For example, on page 15 <Col N="1043" /> of the Bill as introduced, the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; in line 15 clashes with the words &ldquo;has or have&rdquo; in line 23.  This is really a drafting amendment.  Also I have not been entirely satisfied with the provision about bodies corporate. One of the advantages of the proposed new text is that it deals rather neatly with (1) the individual, (2) the company and (3) every other combination of individuals and companies in joint or inter-related ownership.</P>
    <P>It may be objected that the residence qualification will be very severe on companies with large numbers of shareholders. My answer to this objection is that we are not seeking to make companies comply with a residence qualification; we are merely saying that if their lands are otherwise judged necessary for the relief of congestion they may, as vacant or non-residential lands, be acquired.</P>
    <P>It is to be especially noted that the &ldquo;family company&rdquo; will in normal circumstances be protected.  We are basing our farm structure plans on the &ldquo;family farm,&rdquo; but, if the family chooses legally to transform itself into a limited company, no difficulty will arise.  The shareholders of this type of company, living a normal family life, will no doubt be ordinarily dwelling on the farm and will not be vulnerable under this heading.</P>
    <P>The amendment is designed in the main to deal with companies owning land.  In many instances the registered offices of these companies may be in London, Dublin or God-knows-where. It is to make this type of land vulnerable, where congestion exists, and to enable the Land Commission to move in in such cases.  Deputies will appreciate there has grown up a practice where in certain instances big business men form companies to take over land and siphon off certain profits into such a proposition.  Where such land would be required for the relief of congestion, this will enable the Land Commission to move.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear a little more from the Minister on this.  There is a little uneasiness on the part of certain landowners in regard to <Col N="1044" /> the residence clause.  Why has the Minister introduced a residence clause at all?  The Land Commission are going to have a difficult time dealing with the many problems caused by the residence clause.  Leaving aside entirely companies owning land, let us take the case of a landowner who, for some reason or other, goes to live with a son or daughter.  Is it held that the landowner does not reside on his property? The holding may dangle attractively before the eyes of the Land Commission as a suitable holding for acquisition. We have the case of many landowners who have to emigrate to Scotland and Britain for temporary employment and whose holdings are not sufficiently large to enable them eke out an existence They find it necessary to be absent from home frequently.  In some cases this absence may run to years, with a return at Easter and Christmas.  Even though this land is well worked, will this mean that the fact that the owner is absent at certain periods, due to circumstances outside his control, is to be used by the Land Commission for the purpose of dispossessing him?</P>
      <P>In this country there are a large number of small holdings where the owner, for one reason or another, is not resident on the holding.  I feel that a special case can be made for the owner of a small holding who has to emigrate frequently.  Because a case can be made by the Land Commission that Mr. X is the owner of so many acres in such a district and is employed in England, Scotland or Dublin and is not depending on the land for his livelihood, is this non-residence clause going to be used as a lever to deprive him of his land?  It would be unfair and unreasonable if this House were to allow amendments to go through without a clear understanding of their meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the case of many landowners who reside in towns.  Are they to be evicted as a result of the residence clause?  We have the owner of what can be described as the draw farm, the second or third farm which a man may have on which he does not reside but which he intends to keep for his sons or daughters in years <Col N="1045" /> to come.  The farmers who usually have these draw farms generally have them for the purpose of settling their sons or daughters when they come of age.  Are we now to be faced with the position that because the owner does not reside on such a farm the Land Commission will acquire it?</P>
    <P>We know that there are many such holdings well worked and well looked after, giving reasonably good employment, on which the owner does not reside.  I have in mind a number of very well worked holdings where the owner is residing with relatives or friends or, for his own convenience, in a town.  I would ask for a guarantee from the Minister that the owner of such lands who does not reside on his holding and the owners of draw farms can be assured that the residence qualification will not be used as a method of depriving them of property which they are working well, producing food for man and beast, giving employment and on which they intend to settle their sons or daughters, nieces or nephews. This is a very important matter because there is great anxiety about the position of landowners who do not reside on their holdings.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend that such people should immediately dispose of their property to the Land Commission? In the case of the farmer who may have two or three holdings, five or six sons and three or four daughters, is he expected, in order to hold on to the lands on which he intends to settle his family, to spend his money wastefully on the erection of houses and outoffices until the family are ready to move into occupation?  These are matters which are causing anxiety to many farmers at the moment.  I have met farmers who seem to be much concerned with what is to happen to non-residential holdings.  Very often the non-residential holding is subsidising very generously the residential holding.  The farmer cannot work one without the other.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission do not appear to study the economics of family living as closely as the landowner down the country studies them. That is why I can foresee grave difficulties <Col N="1046" /> arising in this matter.  The Minister should take steps to reassure the smallholders and others whose lands are scattered.  What about the landowner whose lands are not consolidated and who may have them stretching over a distance of three or four miles from his home?  We also have the position of a farmer residing on a holding which is completely subsidised by the profits from a farm on which he does not reside.  If the farm on which he does not reside is to be taken from him, he will then have to dispose of the holding on which he resides because one cannot work without the other.  That is endangering the principles of fixity of tenure and freedom of sale for every landowner.</P>
    <P>The fact that a man does not reside on his holding does not mean that he should not have it.  It does not mean that such land is not contributing towards his livelihood.  The family circumstances of the landowner, his family, whether they have a taste for farming and what his capacity is to buy land for his family, if the Land Commission decides to buy the holding on which he is not now residing, should all be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be more familiar than I am with the case of the extremely small holder who may have five or six pieces of land and who can live on only one of these pieces. Does this proposal mean that the four or five pieces on which he does not live are in danger?  Reading this section and the amendments, I fear that such a property is in danger of what the Minister described last week as the teeth of the Land Commission.  That is why we have been so careful in dealing with this Bill because the teeth of the Land Commission may be far too sharp.  We want to slow up the jaws of the Land Commission in operating these teeth because in the event of the Land Commission taking action, it might lead to a loss of employment on the land.</P>
    <P>I should like a little more information regarding the ownership of land by companies.  What will be the position of a company owning a stud farm?  Are we to understand that all the directors must live on the farm? <Col N="1047" /> The Minister should clearly indicate what the position is regarding stud farms owned by companies.  We have a number of farms owned by companies giving good employment and treating their workers generously.  I know a number of them in my constituency. They set a headline with excellent crops; they carry on private afforestation schemes, and private land drainage schemes, and in some cases have demonstration plots which are an example of good husbandry.  Is it unreasonable, in the case of farms owned by companies, to expect that the Land Commission will not require all the directors and all who derive financial benefit from that company to reside on the holding?</P>
    <P>The Minister now guarantees that this will not refer in any way to companies but that there might be an instance in which the Land Commission will want to acquire the holding of a registered company and that he is just putting the provision in the Bill to sharpen the teeth of the Land Commission to deal with such a company. Perhaps the Minister will tell us if there will be any difference between an Irish company and a foreign company owning land here.  The Minister will be well-advised while on these two amendments to convey to the House the attitude of the Land Commission regarding land owned and worked by native companies as compared with land controlled by alien companies. This matter deserves very serious thought by the Minister.  I am sure the Land Commission have considered land owned by foreign companies.  To what extent do such companies own such land here?  Are statistics readily available of the amount of land they hold?</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister assures us that in the case of land held by companies, all those who have a financial interest in the company are not expected to reside on the holding.  That possibility caused a good deal of anxiety on the part of directors of such companies.  One can easily imagine how difficult it would be in the case of a substantial farm owned by a company to comply with the provisions of <Col N="1048" /> the Bill if all connected with the farm had to reside on the holding.  Since we now see that the individual farmer who resides on his holding cannot have a draw farm without meriting the serious notice of the Land Commission and that the Land Commission may attempt to acquire it on the residential qualification grounds, how will it be established otherwise in the case of the company when the directors do not live on the holding?  I take it from what the Minister says they are exempt from the provisions of the section?  I have asked the Minister to let us know his attitude regarding native companies and foreign companies owning land here.</P>

It is extraordinary that we have, I suppose, about one out of every six in the House an auctioneer and it is these people who have opposed this Bill day in, day out.  We in the west want this Bill to go through and I am frequently blackguarded in the papers for not saying something but anytime I do speak, I am slowing down the progress of the Bill.  I do not agree with anything Deputy Flanagan or anybody belonging to him has said.

      <P>Deputy Flanagan is opposing them and I must make a case against him.  He evidently thinks we are in the same position as we were in over 30 years ago when we needed a blue card before we got anything from the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  There is no use in a Deputy coming along to-day and suggesting that the Minister will be unreasonable or harsh with anybody because he cannot be.  We are living in a completely modern world and the sooner we get to realise that the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the west want to see the Minister getting these powers.  It is not <Col N="1049" /> a question of the Minister leading the people of the West into the promised land of the midlands because they do not want to go to the Midlands at all. It is a question of the Minister being able to deal with the lands in the west that are lying derelict, of being able to take over these lands and to make it possible for the people of the west to live there, rather than have to emigrate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan's attitude towards this Bill is purely and simply that he is afraid of his life that the auctioneers will lose their five per cent.  I do not mind whether Deputy Flanagan or any other Deputy loses his five per cent.  My attitude towards this Bill is that I want to see the Minister putting the Bill through so that derelict lands in the west may be acquired by the Minister and allotted to the people of the locality at a reasonable price to enable them to live there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan starts off with the ballyhoo about Fianna Fáil doing this, that and the other thing.  He should go back to Cumann na nGaedheal, who did nothing in their life but change their name.</P>

      <P>The Deputy talks about stud farms.  Who owns the stud farms?  I doubt if there are more than two Irishmen among all those people who own stud farms there.  I do not believe for one moment that the present Minister for Lands or any other Minister for Lands would take any action to deprive any man of his land where that man was operating a stud farm and operating the farm properly and giving employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This attack on the Minister for Lands, who is a Mayoman and who knows our troubles probably better than anybody else, is pure, unadulterated bunkum and I am not going to accept it from a midlands man.  The Minister comes from Mayo and certainly knows our troubles.  Our main trouble is that we just have not got enough land.  In Mayo it often happens that there are several farms left idle for <Col N="1050" /> years and years.  If they are vested holdings, they can be put up for sale, whether the owners are in Canada, the United States or anywhere else.  That is our big trouble.  As the Minister knows, such a case has occurred at my doorstep over the past 12 months.  I want that position ended.  I want to see the Minister in the position that he will be able to acquire these lands at a reasonable price and make them available to people who can use them to make a living and not have to go to Canada, the United States, England or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the position is that these places can be bought at fantastic prices and the Land Commission must make the highest bid in order to acquire the land.  The lands cannot be left; they cannot be allotted to local tenants.  For the first time in the history of this country, a Minister is taking steps to end this position by putting this section into a Bill.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday Deputy Dillon blazed forth as hotly as he could and spoke of simple-minded Deputies and referred to everybody in the most deprecating terms.  Deputy Dillon is not right in referring to simple-minded Deputies. There are no simple-minded Deputies in this House or, if there is any simple-minded Deputy, it is the Deputy himself from Roscommon who was returned here by the obviously simple-minded people of Monaghan.  That kind of thing will not go down here.</P>

      <P>I agree with you, Sir.  Practically every Deputy who has spoken has gone 300 miles outside the scope of anything contained in sections or amendments to this Bill.  I suppose I am fairly in order in doing so as well. The fact remains that a great deal of ballyhoo is being brought in here purely and simply because there is a by-election pending in Galway and if there were no by-election in Galway, <Col N="1051" /> the chances are that this Bill would have been through long ago.</P>
      <P>I cannot stand idly by and listen to people from the midlands who regard us from the west as second-class citizens or as not being first-rate citizens. I want to assure the House that we are first-rate citizens.  Anybody who has been transferred to the midlands has proved his worth and anybody who will be transferred to the midlands will also prove his worth.  Consequently, I cannot agree with either Deputy Flanagan, Deputy Dillon, or any other Deputy, be he an auctioneer or otherwise, who opposes this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I should like to make in connection with the residence clause which has been referred to.  Deputy Flanagan raised the question of a man residing on one farm and having an outside farm.  There are many cases where there is no residence on the outside farm.  I am sure it is not the intention of the Minister to interfere with the man who has one farm where he resides and who takes an outside farm perhaps three or four miles away.</P>
      <P>The Minister has referred to big business combines.  We all know that for the past couple of years at least, there was a combine buying up land. There were cases where men, who advocated that foreigners should not get Irish land, sold their farms to this combine at a good price.  Deputy Flanagan spoke about small men with three or four small holdings in the west.  I am sure it is not the Minister's idea to take over these places.  It is his idea to help these men and to enlarge the farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, with regard to the point I have raised about men living on one farm and having also an outside farm, on which there is no residence, I do not believe that the Land Commission have any idea of interfering with such land.  It would be very wrong to do so. I am not in favour of the big business man, whether he is a foreigner or otherwise, who lives in a big town or city, being allowed to buy up all the <Col N="1052" /> holdings he can lay hands on.  I do not think he is entitled to do that and to produce crops and to put the small man out.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows what he is talking about and he knows also what the amendments are likely to prove to be worth.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat that I am quite certain that the man who has two farms, on one of which there is a house in which he resides, and who is making a good job of the outside farm will not be interfered with in any way.</P>

For the purpose of the relief of congestion it is necessary to abolish three Fs, particularly the three Fs representing Fine Gael frustrating failure in the land policy field.</P>

      <P>These amendments are designed to make these lands vulnerable that are owned by big companies throughout the country where they are non-resident.  The suggestion, of course, is utterly absurd that it is the Land Commission's intention to go after people who are properly working their lands.  Time and again in discussions on this Bill the cause of the widow is trotted out by Deputy Flanagan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would imagine that in acquiring land the only object of the Land Commission was to pick on people like widows with small farms, to pick on people who are temporarily absent in England to earn a few pounds. Everybody living in rural Ireland knows that is not so.  It is the people who have been absent for a very long time, who have a bad land user record, who have been letting their land year after year for 25 years&mdash;those are the <Col N="1053" /> people against whom the Land Commission are moving to acquire land and those are the people who, under these amendments, the Land Commission will be pursuing.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, I had to find a definition for the vacant and under-worked holding which would particularly be under severe scrutiny by the Land Commission and would be especially vulnerable where lands are required for the relief of congestion. Therefore, I had to find a formula which would identify the vacant holding. After consideration, I thought it best to come at the problem from the other side by saying in effect that a farm is residential if the owner lives within three miles.  This deals with companies, non-resident companies, one of the worst forms concerning those resident abroad who have bought Irish land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has an amendment to this motion and if he had phrased his amendment so that the word &ldquo;continue&rdquo; was not included in it, it might nearly meet our wishes.  While I am quite sure we shall be told, when the Minister speaks to his amendment, about the increases which have been given over the past few years, I have some evidence here <Col N="1054" /> which will show that though it may not be the Minister's responsibility over the years, the social welfare benefit and the assistance sections, in particular, have not got their fair share of the national wealth and that, from the period when old age pensions were first introduced in 1909 by the British Government to the present day, the value of pensions <i>vis-à-vis</i> wages being paid has dropped very considerably.</P>
      <P>When I started doing some research into this recently, I was rather amazed at what I found.  At the present time an applicant over 70 years of age cannot obtain the full non-contributory pension of 35/- per week if his means exceeds £1 Os. 6d. per week, and he cannot get any pension at all if his means exceeds £2 15s. 4d. per week. What was the position when the pension was first introduced in 1909?  At that time, 55 years ago, the basic farm wages&mdash;it is better to take farm workers' wages because they are reasonably traceable right up to the present day&mdash;ranged from 8/- to 10/per week.  In places like Dublin, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wicklow, Cork and Tipperary, the basic wage amounted to 10/- per week.  The average was about 9s. 3d.</P>
      <P>At that time a farm worker retiring at the age of 70 could obtain a full old age pension of 5/- per week; in other words, he could get more than 50 per cent of his basic rate by way of non-contributory old age pension, and if he was married he could get more than he was earning because he could get 10/- a week, and I stated a few minutes ago that the average wage over the whole country for that type of worker was only 9/3d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister tells us now that the pensioners have been fairly treated, the arguments will sound very hollow in this House because, as we know, the minimum rate for farm workers is an average of £7 12s. per week and the non-contributory old age pension is only 35/- for a single man.  A sum of 35/- is a small amount to live on. The Minister may claim that it is adequate, but if he does, his colleagues <Col N="1055" /> at the Árd Fheis yesterday did not consider it was adequate.  The following comments were reported in today's <i>Irish Press</i>.  One gentleman from the Lucan-Finglas Ceanntair said:</P>
    <P>There was an urgent need for increases in old age pensions.  By the world standard Ireland's population is extremely old and many of the old people live lonely lives and sometimes are forgotten.</P>
    <P>Forgotten even by the State, let me add.  Another man from Dublin North East is reported as saying that an adult dependant's allowance should be provided with the non-contributory old-age pension.  Somebody else spoke about all the money the teenagers could spend and about the old age pensioners not being able to get enough money to live on.  The final comment is: &ldquo;This pension is quite inadequate by 20th century standards.&rdquo; I know the Minister replied to that and possibly we shall have another version of his reply here tonight but surely if we need any evidence, apart from that given by the Labour Party, that the pension is inadequate, then we have got it from the Minister's own colleagues who were not afraid, apparently, to tell the Minister that they considered he was not doing enough for these people.</P>
    <P>The years move on and we find that in 1935 the average farm wage was 21s. 3d. a week and even then a farm worker could retire and get an amount equal to half his wages and a married couple could have the equivalent of almost a full week's wages by means of a non-contributory old-age pension if they retired at 70 years of age.  The Minister should not now try to say that the State has done as much as it could be expected to do in cases like this because it should be evident to everybody that these old people are not getting enough to live on.</P>
    <P>I do know, as was mentioned today during Question Time, that recently the old-age pensioners have had added children's allowances to their pensions both for contributory and non-contributory pensions.  We are very glad to <Col N="1056" /> see that being done and the Minister was less than gracious when he claimed during Question Time today that the idea was the brainchild of himself and the Fianna Fáil Party.  If he cares to get someone to trace back over the Official Report for the past two or three years, he will find question after question directed to him and to his predecessor asking that this should be done.  He may recollect that he told me personally that, because of the pressure that was being put on, he had looked into the matter and decided it was the right thing to do.  Surely he should not now be ashamed to admit that he was influenced by the facts and surely he should not be ashamed to admit that the idea was put into his head by somebody else and that he was man enough, and Minister enough, to implement it.</P>
    <P>We will give him all the credit he wants for doing it.  It is something which might have been done much earlier.  I am sure the Minister will have the blessing of the old age pensioners affected.  Many of them have young families and these have been trying to exist on a non-contributory pension of 35/- each for man and wife and on a pension of something over £4 per week in the case of a contributory pension.  They are all delighted to get this increase by way of children's allowances. The Minister should, I think, have been a little more gracious when replying at Question Time today.</P>
    <P>For the information of the Minister, if we take one particular section of the community, statistics prove that in 1961 there were only 3,693 farm workers between the ages of 65 and 70, or six per cent of the working force. If that is true also of the others, I am sure the Minister will appreciate the very strong argument there is for granting the old age pension at 65 years of age.</P>
    <P>It is easy, of course, to find many defects in the old age pension code when dealing with social welfare benefits.  Now, those defects apply equally to other types of social welfare benefit and assistance.  One thing I find it hard to understand&mdash;obviously one of the gentlemen at the Árd Fheis found it hard to understand also&mdash;is <Col N="1057" /> why some effort has not been made to give benefits of some kind to adult dependants other than the husband, wife or children.  I am sure the Minister knows many people are living with a brother or some sisters&mdash;an invalid brother, a father or a mother not old enough to qualify for pension.  There is no other source of income except that earned by, perhaps, a son.  Now, if the son should fall ill, the only income available is the miserly £2 2s. 6d. given to a single man by way of sickness or unemployment benefit.  Surely there is good reason why that amount should be increased and surely there is a good argument for including more people than are included at the moment in these benefits?</P>
    <P>The motion deals with the necessity for alteration now rather than waiting for some later date.  It is evident to everybody that over the past five or six months prices have increased for practically every commodity bought by the ordinary individual.  I was amazed when, a few days ago, an employer defending a case before the Labour Court gave concrete evidence that the workers concerned in the claim for increased wages had received an increase of 16 per cent in their commission, not because more goods were being bought &mdash;that was freely admitted&mdash;but because of the increase in the prices of the goods they were selling.</P>
    <P>We have heard arguments here over the past few months about the increase in the prices of various items following the 2½ per cent turnover tax and the ninth round of wage increases.  We were told that one reputable firm had increased the price of its wares by ten per cent from 1st February and that another had increased its prices by 12 per cent from the first week in February. That was the pattern all round, but it now becomes evident that these were the small boys and other people have been cashing in to a much greater extent.</P>
    <P>A motion by an Independent Deputy to have the disabled persons allowance increased because of the factors to which I have referred was accepted by the Government.  The motion was that the increases should be proportionate <Col N="1058" /> to increases in wages.  Can the Minister explain why, following the increase in wages and following the increase in prices generally, no attempt has been made to bring up the incomes of those people dependent on social welfare benefit and assistance?  Rather than put down a meaningless amendment suggesting that everybody is quite happy with what he is getting, might I suggest to the Minister that he should do what can be done and what he has already done in relation to children's allowances in order to alleviate to some extent the distress these people suffer?</P>
    <P>I meet a great many more of these people, perhaps, than the Minister does.  I have been checking with some of them as to their personal position and I am told by the majority that, if they try to live on their non-contributory pensions, they cannot last, and, after a short time, they find no alternative except illness, a visit to the hospital and transfer to the county home.  I do not think people should be put in that position.  Remember, this is a position with which the Minister can deal.  The Minister is not a member of a local authority, and never was, but I am sure he is aware that these people cost very much more when they go to the county home than they would cost the State if they were receiving a decent amount of assistance in their own homes.  I understand the average cost per week in the county home is about £3 10s.  Compare that with the miserly amount given to these people outside the county home and one can appreciate immediately the strength of the argument behind this Labour Party motion.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would ask the Minister when replying, not to depend just on the old clichés which he has used time and again in regard to how much he gave in certain years and what the inter-Party Government or, as he prefers to call them, the Coalition Government, gave in certain years. That does not put any food on the tables of the old person, the unemployed person, or the sick person. Can he tell us whether or not the Government are making any attempt to restore the position which operated <Col N="1059" /> when the old age pension was first introduced and which will give these people enough to live on in frugal comfort?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. This motion is particularly opportune because it has been put down at a time when even the Government, and even the Taoiseach, are concerned about the present trend of rising costs and their implications for the community generally.  It comes as no surprise to us to know that there is this escalation of prices clearly out of control of the Government following the policies accepted by the Government over the years, particularly by the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Taoiseach's Department.  The Taoiseach has refused to accept that there must be some form of price control, profit control and dividend control if the impact of the cost of living is not to be made intolerable or is not to become more unbearable than it is at present on all sections of the community, whether they are wage or salary earners but in particular the group mentioned in this motion.</P>
      <P>As we all know, the trade union movement is suffering under the castigations of various Government speakers at the moment because it continues to draw the Government's attention to their failure to control prices and to the inflationary trend which is now taking hold of the economy.  Where these people are concerned, there are virtually no powerful advocates outside this House who can insist that the allowances paid to them will permit them to enjoy the frugal comfort of three meals a day, warmth, shelter and clothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is typical of the cavalier attitude of the Taoiseach over the years to this question of social security, his indifference to the various issues in public life, that the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> should contain little but meaningless clichés as to what the Government intend to do in regard to the improvement of the social welfare services generally.  The only quotation that might be considered <Col N="1060" /> reasonably relevant is from the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> in which he states that specific forms in which improvements in these services should take place will be under constant study and that they have been under constant study since the State was formed.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Tully pointed out, there has been no serious, significant advance in the effective pay rates to these dependent groups virtually since we took over control of the State.  The statement is in effect completely meaningless and it is quite clear that the Taoiseach, obsessed with the idea of trying to make the unworkable work, that is, private enterprise capital in this community, has not had time to give thought to how the old people, the unemployed, the widows and orphans and these other dependent groups are to survive in this bitterly selfish, self-interested, materialist type of society.</P>
    <P>Another quotation of the Taoiseach's was at the Chomh-Comhairle of the Fianna Fáil Party in July of this year when he referred to the Programme as being related to economic activities and that the defence of the social progress does not come directly into its scope. He can have that point of view if he wants to, but at some stage he can declare that this is a strictly economic programme.  On the one hand, he claims that it is an economic programme and on the other, that the specific forms in which the services will develop will be under constant study.  What does the Taoiseach mean? Under which thimble is the dice?</P>
    <P>For too long the Taoiseach has been getting away with this kind of bluffing of the public, particularly this sector of the public.  The figures bear out this charge against the Taoiseach.  If one goes back over the years, it will be found that in fact the proportion of money spent out of the gross national product on social services generally has gone down.  As far as I can find&mdash;and the Minister can correct me if this is not so&mdash;from the Programme, there is not going to be an effective increase in the proportion of moneys being spent on social services by 1970.  The proportion for <Col N="1061" /> 1963-4 is £46.5 millions and in 1970, it is proposed to be £62 millions, an increase of 33 per cent.  That is slightly less than the established volume of national output in the same period for which the figure is 35 per cent.</P>
    <P>This means that it is intended to continue, but not even as vigorously, the trend of expenditure on social services between 1957 and 1963 in which social benefits rose in current money terms by 37½ per cent.  I am glad that the members of the Árd Fheis had the courage and honesty to draw the Minister's attention to this fact.  I do not think that the Minister can accept or seriously believe that the payment of a couple of pounds a week to an old person could be considered a just payment.</P>
    <P>Some of the figures illustrate the complete indifference to the needs of this sector of the public.  For instance, a married person with three children gets approximately £3 a week or about 12/- a head.  The average patient cost in the Dublin Health Authority institutions is 21/4d per week.  The food consumed by a prisoner costs about £42.10.0d. per year and works out at approximately 24/- retail, 16/- wholesale. It is quite clear that the amounts of money paid out in unemployment pensions and old age pensions are grossly inadequate.  The contributory old age pension of around £4.5. for the two people starts at 70, which is a great age, while the British rate has greatly increased over recent weeks. Before the British rates were increased, they exceded our benefits by 60 per cent for a man with three children, by 80 per cent for a single man&mdash;these are unemployment benefits&mdash;and by 90 per cent for a widow with three children.  That is at a time when the purchasing power of the £ has continued to drop here as a result of the continuing inflation referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>Further, we are in the difficulty here that our wage rates are amongst the lowest in Europe.  So, if you give the answer to us that the provident person can afford to save for a rainy day, it is quite clear it is much more difficult to save here than it is in Great Britain or <Col N="1062" /> on the Continent.  The average wage rates paid to workers here are between 30 and 40 per cent lower than the European rates.  This is in a society in which our average prices for consumer goods are between eight per cent and ten per cent higher than in Great Britain or Europe.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister, a young man, can continue to defend the record of his Department over the years in regard to the grossly inadequate, meagre payments it makes to the old people and the unemployed.  I believe the policy of the Government over the years has been to pay so little to the unemployed as to force them to get out of the country and to find work in Great Britain.  It seems to me to be particularly arrogant of our Government speakers and other public speakers to criticise, as they did recently, what the British Government have done in their financial difficulty, when in fact the best part of one million of our people have been forced out of Ireland by means of unemployment and inadequate unemployment benefits, to be fed, clothed and housed in Great Britain over the past 40 years. We were very glad indeed that that access to work and food was available to us.</P>
    <P>The first charge on the economy of a properly-ordered society should be in regard to these groups.  The unemployed man is unemployed for one reason only.  He is unemployed because of the incompetence of the Government. Over the years since the State was founded, from eight to ten per cent of our people have been unemployed, in addition to the threequarters of a million or one million who have had to get out.  It is no fault of theirs that they are standing on street corners or in the labour exchanges, that they have five or six children to feed, clothe and house on these grossly inadequate allowances.</P>
    <P>It is part of the wonderful myth created by the Government, in the past few years in particular, that this is an affluent society.  The sad tragedy is that the members of the Government themselves and many public figures are coming to believe that that is so, <Col N="1063" /> that there is a substantial amount of affluence in our society.  There are many families where men are unemployed in which the children see nothing except bread and margarine as their staple diet.  There are those who are living in candlelight, because they cannot pay the light bill, and who have no fire in the grate.  I know these people in my own constituency, where there is great hunger and poverty.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt in stating&mdash;if the Minister chooses to contradict me, he is welcome to do so&mdash;that in our so-called Christian society the old people starve to death.  They die of malnutrition; they do not die of old age. It is a completely scandalous thing that, at a time like this, there should be the great extravagances by the minority, the great profits earned by the minority, at a time when it appears that the community is not able to pay adequately these people depending on it for food, shelter and clothing.  This argument that we must wait and we will get better health services, better education, better care for the old and bigger allowances for the unemployed is one we have listened to for too long.  The public is not going to accept it any longer.</P>
    <P>The public must begin to understand that the type of economy operated by both sides of this House&mdash;private enterprise capitalism&mdash;is not designed to see that the mass of old people, the great majority of widows and their children, the unemployed and their children, will be properly cared for. That is not the purpose of private enterprise capitalism.  Its purpose is to create great wealth for a minority.  If you look back at the figures I got from the Taoiseach the other day, you will see that between 1957 and 1963 there was an increase of from £9 million to £23 million in profits to a tiny minority of people.  This is at a time when the Taoiseach comes in with a poor mouth, when the Minister for Transport and Power lectures the workers about the poverty of our society and our inability to pay bigger wages and social welfare benefits, provide better educational and health services, and <Col N="1064" /> all the rest.  They join in the caoin and whine of poverty when it suits them.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt at all that this rubbish outlined in the amendment, this expansion of gross national product over the years to 1970, is, on the record of the Government, not true. Any increase has been a nominal increase and, anyway, it was increased from such a pathetically inadequate base that any percentage increase was completely inadequate.  A multiplication by ten or 20 of the Lloyd George amount is the only amount that would be sufficient to protect people from the great hardships which many of them are suffering.  I will put this figure to the Minister in contradiction of his suggestion in the amendment and he will be able to verify it for himself.  By 1970, social benefits will absorb 6.2 per cent of national output as compared with 6.5 per cent between 1957 and 1958.  That is a reduction in the total amount paid in the form of social benefits.</P>
    <P>It is about time the Government decided that this society is not composed solely of wealthy industrialists. A little while ago, when they whimpered their heads off in the press in seeking help because they were faced with the cold draught of a little greater competition, there was no difficulty in the Taoiseach coming into this House and asking for so many millions for that assistance.  No matter what the bill was, he was given a blank cheque to help these people who already have £23 million in profits, these poor, hungry industrialists coming in here begging for help with hat in hand, these great private enterprise capitalists who believe in free competition. These are the people who can get millions without any serious imposition on anybody.  We know well from whom they are going to get these millions. Direct taxation has stood still or has been reduced in recent years whilst indirect taxation has been greatly increased.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leneghan referred to this matter recently when he said that instead of taking from the wealthy to pay the poor, we had reversed the <Col N="1065" /> Robin Hood principle and now take from the poor to pay the rich.  The position is going to be that when we come to pay these industrialists for their inefficiency and incompetence over the years, for their failure to develop a greater gross national product, we will rob the pockets of the old age pensioners, the widows and their children, the unemployed and their children in order that these people should not carry the consequences of their own ineptitude.</P>
    <P>This confidence trick on the part of the Government has gone on long enough.  The fact that they have been able to control the great propaganda media has protected them to some extent.  The fact that they can create a miasma of an affluent society because the Intercontinental Hotel and places like it are bursting at the seams with people who have too much money to spend will not protect them much longer.  There is a slow awakening taking place in Ireland and the worker is beginning to understand that he is entitled to a bigger share of the cake and, more important still, is determined to get it.  whether it comes in wages, salaries, pensions, unemployment benefits or widows' and orphans' pensions.  The worker is no longer going to be fobbed off with this homily on the necessity for a nice happy family in which nobody squabbles about the division between the wealthy and the poor in our society.  Those days are going.  We can only hope that we will do all that we can to speed them out.</P>
    <P>We believe it possible for the Government to get the money to increase these social benefits.  We believe it is imperative for the Government to do so.  If there is any conscience in the Government, and I do not know how close they are to the ordinary people these days, that conscience should bring them to the reality that there are old men cold and hungry tonight in Dublin, that there are old men, women and children hungry and cold in Dublin and other towns throughout the country tonight, that there are unemployed people, who, through Government incompetence, are also hungry or underfed or suffering <Col N="1066" /> from malnutrition because of the grossly inadequate level of payments made to our people.</P>
    <P>The more I look at our society, the more I begin to wonder if this is Christianity and if it could be such an obscene faith that it will tolerate these conditions among so many of the under-privileged of our society.  Surely this is a complete negation of all the things preached by Christ, that old people, widows and children, the blind and disabled and the unemployed, who are the first charge in the most materialistic Marxist society, should, in this so called Christian society, be those who least concern the Taoiseach and his colleagues?</P>

      <P>I move the amendment: To delete all words after &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;that the Government should continue to implement its declared policy of arranging that improvements in the national income, resulting from national economic growth, should be shared by Social <Col N="1067" /> Welfare recipients, and notes that this has brought about increases in rates of benefit in every year for a number of years past.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I intend to show the House that the principle embodied in the amendment, which the Government have been following, is more desirable from the point of view of social welfare recipients than the principle embodied in the motion put down by nine members of the Labour Party.  Their principle is that increases in social welfare should be related to the cost of living.</P>
      <P>It is not easy to deal with a debate conducted on the basis on which this has been conducted by the two Deputies who have spoken, Deputies Tully and Dr. Browne.  One would like to feel at least that the Deputies who had sufficient interest in the matter to put down a motion would have sufficient knowledge of social welfare, as it stands, to know the actual rates that exist at present, but it is obvious from both speeches that they have not even troubled to acquaint themselves with the different rates of payment at present.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully spoke on two days, today and last Wednesday, and on each occasion he dealt with the non-contributory old age pensions and based his arguments entirely on an outdated figure.  He is apparently still unaware that in the last session we passed a Social Welfare Bill raising the maximum rate of non-contributory old age pension from 35/- to 37/6.</P>

      <P>This motion was put down originally in February, 1962.

      <P>I have shown previously that if we go back as far as 1947 which is a reasonably long distance, the rates of payment under every social welfare scheme that there is have very considerably outstripped rises in the cost of living.  I can go back, if Deputies like, either to 1957&mdash; I think that would be a reasonable time&mdash;or to the time when this motion was put down, in 1962.  In February, 1962, the increase in the consumer price index since 1961 was 3.3.  Whether that was a steep rise or not is a matter of opinion, I suppose.  Certainly, the rise in essential foodstuffs was still <Col N="1071" /> less&mdash;2.25. But, that position was more than dealt with in the Budget of 1962 and since then.  If the motion intends this assertion of a steep rise in the cost of living to refer to the period from the time the motion was put down up to the present date, the rise in the cost of living since February, 1962, to the present date is 12.34 per cent.  In every single one of the social welfare services, the increase granted is more than double that amount.  In non-contributory old age pensions since before the 1962 Budget to date the increase has been 25 per cent; in non-contributory widows' pensions, 26 per cent; in unemployment assistance, urban, 45 per cent and, rural, 48 per cent.  In the contributory old age pension, which was introduced for the first time in 1961, the increase has been 25 per cent.  In contributory widows' pensions the increase has been 31 per cent and in unemployment benefit and disability benefit the increase has been 31 per cent.</P>

I do not know whether the people are prepared to accept that countries that have adopted the type of society that Deputy Dr. Browne advocates have, in fact, got a better way of living than we have here.  I <Col N="1072" /> accept that Deputy Dr. Browne believes that.  I do not and I do not think it is necessary for me to argue that point here tonight.</P>
      <P>The economy of the country has been improving and because it has been improving since we rehabilitated, or started to rehabilitate, it in 1957, we have been able to make these significant gains for the recipients of social welfare.  The economy is still improving and we expect it to improve further in line with the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and I agree that according as we progress towards the targets that we have set ourselves it should be possible to speed up the pace at which social welfare payments have been gaining over the cost of living with the objective&mdash;and I admit it is an objective that is still in the future&mdash;of reaching as soon as possible a position in which the rates under all these schemes will be adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been here for 40 years.  Unfortunately, within the past 16 years, there have been two periods of Coalition Government and that has slowed down the rate at which we were approaching the target in this respect.  I accept it as my task to make as much ground as possible towards that objective but, as I have said, I realise that it is first of all necessary to develop the economy to the stage at which it can supply the necessary revenue in order to do that.  I can see no point whatever in trying to go at a rate faster than is justified by the state of the country's economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is as clear as it could be that if the underlying idea of this motion was accepted as the guiding principle for social welfare increases the recipients of social welfare would, in fact, be much worse off than they are at present.  The policy that the Government have been pursuing and intend to pursue in the future has, because of the improvement in the economy, produced much more favourable results, as I have shown on a number of occasions.  That policy is to arrange that improvements in the national income resulting from national economic <Col N="1073" /> growth should be shared by social welfare recipients.  That does not necessarily mean that the percentage increase in the rates of social welfare payments must be exactly the same as the percentage increase in the national income.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, I think that according as things improve, we should try to arrange that social welfare rates will, in fact, gain more than the gain in the national income, and I fully agree that every sector of the community should appreciate that there is leeway to be made up in regard to social welfare and that they should be prepared to allow the Government to make the necessary financial arrangements to meet that situation.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there is any point in my giving any further figures because Deputies opposite are not interested in the facts.  They know that at this time when it is still some months away from Budget time that it is comparatively safe to become emotional about these things and to suggest that all these rates of payment should be increased by a considerable amount.  When it comes to a question of making the necessary financial arrangements, however, Deputies take a completely different attitude.  I do not mind that but reasonable people will see that a Government must consider the two aspects of the matter, the desirability of improving the rates and also the necessity for raising the money.</P>
    <P>That is the way we have been doing it and that is the way we intend to do it in the future.  We prefer, and I think it is more realistic, that the House should consider this thing in a responsible way, considering the two vital aspects of the matter together rather than to be discussing the desirability only of increasing social welfare payments and completely ignoring the practicability of it.  It is easy to do it at this stage but at Budget time the two things have to be taken into account.  Therefore, I ask the House to amend this motion as I have suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister need not have troubled the House with his <Col N="1074" /> remarks.  They were the remarks which we have expected, the remarks which we have heard from his side of the House for many years.  The idea is they know the social welfare benefits are inadequate.  They would love to increase them further but they very much regret they cannot do so.  I do not think the country will stand for this sort of talk much longer because, as Deputy Dr. Browne said, there is considerable misunderstanding of the reality of Irish life and a very serious misunderstanding of the conditions in which many of our people live.</P>
      <P>What are we dealing with in this motion?  We are dealing with approximately 151,000 persons in receipt of old age pensions, either non-contributory or contributory.  We are dealing with over 60,000 widows on contributory or non-contributory pensions.  We are dealing with over 200,000 people.  The non-contributory widows' pension is 36/- per week. The non-contributory old age pension is 37/6 per week.  We are also dealing with persons on unemployment assistance who have completely inadequate money to look after their wives and children.  These are the subject of this motion.</P>
      <P>We are also dealing with the cost of living which since 1957 has gone up by 28.1 per cent, the cost of living which since 1960 has gone up by 20.1 per cent.  When we are dealing with analyses like the cost of living, in many ways this is not a fair criterion in dealing with old people on pensions and widows on pensions because the cost of living index figure is so weighted that it weighs more heavily on those poor people in receipt of pensions.  Things such as food which are weighted to a certain per cent in the consumer price index take up a much higher percentage of the income of the recipients of social welfare benefits, and any increase in the price of bread, sugar or tea or any increase in bus fares hurt more the lower sections of the community than those to whom the cost of living index figure generally applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that increases have been given in the past, and of <Col N="1075" /> course we are aware of it.  He omitted to state that it was expressly admitted that the increases given last year were not sufficient to compensate the recipient for the increase in the cost of living which had occurred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can juggle around with the figures as he likes and take certain base years to suit his argument.  The fact is that the people in receipt of social welfare payments are less well off than they were some years ago.</P>
      <P>I want to quote for the benefit of the House some figures given in an Economic Research Institute paper which was published recently by Mr. Kaim-Caudle, who brings out a very salutary fact about this society in which we live.  He states that taking into account the six countries of western Europe, and England, this country spends the lowest percentage of its gross national product in cash in social security benefits.  We spend less of our wealth helping our poor people than any of those countries. It is interesting to note that our expenditure is a quarter less than in Italy whose gross national product per capita is something close to ours and which has the same income per head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the society for which the Minister's Party is largely responsible. You would imagine from what has been said that they only came into office a week or two ago or a year or so ago.  How long do they want?  They have been in office since 1932 except for two short breaks.  Do they want <Col N="1076" /> another generation to try and improve this, another 25 or 50 years, perhaps, before they improve the conditions?</P>
    <P>It is difficult to get comparable figures of actual amounts spent on social welfare in the six countries and in England because the cost of living figures differ and payments in kind and in cash differ in different countries but it is a fair indication of the way your society is organised if you ascertain exactly what percentage of gross national product is being spent. The percentage which I have stated is the correct one and it shows that we have a lower percentage than any of those countries I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The Minister has enunciated a principle which, if the Government would accept it, we would welcome.  He would like to ensure that social welfare benefits would represent a higher percentage in the national accounts and that, even though we are going to increase our national production each year, it is not sufficient to keep the same percentage going to social welfare but that a greater percentage should be given.  This would meet with universal acceptance but what are the facts?  There has been an analysis made of the Second Programme by Mr. Garrett Fitzgerald in the autumn edition of <i>Studies</i>.  Mr. Fitzgerald has examined the social welfare payments adumbrated in the Second Programme and his conclusions are diametrically opposed to the principles the Minister has just enunciated.  At page 246 of this volume, after dealing with the increased public expenditure on goods and services, he suggests that, though these figures</P>
    <P>...may at first sight suggest an intention radically to expand social services.  This is very far from being the case, however, at any rate so far as social services involving payments to individuals are concerned.  Indeed, no section of public expenditure is to be expanded more <i>slowly</i> than transfer payments of this kind, which are clearly the cinderella of this Programme, although Part II of the Programme contrives to obscure this fact by failing to state clearly and explicitly what is proposed in connection <Col N="1077" /> with these transfer payments.</P>
    <P>Is that statement wrong?  If it is wrong, then it should be contradicted.  If it is right, it means that the grandiose statements of principle enunciated by the Minister are just so much eyewash because, in fact, the analysis which this economist has carried out shows that this expenditure will expand more slowly than other items of expenditure and that it is, in fact, the cinderella of the Second Programme.</P>
    <P>He goes on then to point out what has occurred in the past:</P>
    <P>The increase of 33 per cent which is thus proposed in resources devoted to social benefits is slightly less than the estimated increase in the volume of national output in the same period (35 per cent) which means that it is proposed to continue the trend of the period 1957/1963, during which social benefits rose in current money terms by only 37½ per cent as against an increase in national output of 41½ per cent in current money terms.  Thus by 1970 social benefits will absorb 6.2 per cent of national output as compared with 6.5 per cent in 1957/58.</P>
    <P>Are these calculations wrong?  If they are not wrong, it means that what is contained in the Programme is diametrically opposed to what the Government, through the Minister, says they are going to do.  Of course, we are used to this now but, unfortunately, the public has not yet caught on.  I suppose there are still left in the Fianna Fáil Party those exuberant spirits who make these speeches at the Árd Fheis and listen to the Minister reply, saying: &ldquo;We are doing the best we can&rdquo;, and who do not know the facts.</P>
    <P>I think the public should know the facts.  The public should know that, under the Government's Programme, it is proposed that social welfare payments will increase less and more slowly than other items of expenditure. That is not something of which the Government should be proud.  The social welfare aspects of the Programme are largely ignored.  Social welfare payments are treated in the Programme in vague terms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> The Government have failed to realise that one of their most important duties is to ensure a fair distribution of income.  The Minister says he could not get the money.  He did his best.  He said the economy could not bear increased taxation; if you increase the rates, taxes have to be raised to meet the increases.  He used the old argument that we have heard over and over again.  Again, this is an area in which the statements are accepted by people who do not know the facts.</P>
    <P>What happened in the last Budget to the £3 millions usually allowed for over-estimation?  It would have been possible to allow £3 millions more in last year's Budget, had the Government done what every other Minister for Finance has done and did for many years before, namely, made this allowance of £3 millions for errors in overestimation. That assists the Minister for Finance in balancing his Budget. That was not done this year.  Why was it not done?  Because the Government were bringing in what they described as a mildly inflationary Budget.  The Government play around with these ideas.  They do not tell the old age pensioners: &ldquo;We have a mildly inflationary Budget and we are very sorry we cannot give you 5/-.  We can give you only half-a-crown.&rdquo;  That is the effect.  The increase in the last Budget could have been doubled if the Minister had not brought in what he regarded as necessary, a mildly inflationary Budget.  It was, of course, nonsense to think that the Government's fiscal policy of a £3 million allowance would make the slightest difference to what was going on.  The Government ignore the reality of the situation and tinker around with ideas like mildly inflationary Budgets, when, in fact, developments outside need to be and should be handled.</P>
    <P>A proper incomes policy needs to be developed.  There are numbers of things that need to be kept in hand and, if they were, we would not have this run-away inflation which is developing.  Instead of that, the Government think they should bring in a mildly inflationary Budget and do not make this allowance of £3 millions <Col N="1079" /> which every other Minister for Finance for years past allowed.  The plea is that the Government cannot get the money.</P>
    <P>The plea is the Government would love to give bigger increases in social welfare payments but just cannot get the revenue.  I challenge the Minister and his colleagues.  I ask them why they did not make this allowance.  The Budget could, of course, easily become unbalanced and we may easily find ourselves, and the Minister has hinted as much, running a large unbalanced Budget next year, but the Minister did not know that when he could have, had he so wished, taken the measures I have suggested.  If the Minister and the Government had the courage to come into this Parliament, and say: &ldquo;Look, we are going to increase social welfare payments, but the increases will cause an increase of 6d. on income tax&rdquo;, is there anybody who would vote against that?</P>

      <P>That is their policy.  They reduce surtax and direct taxation and increase indirect taxation. That is their declared policy.  These are the facts.  Efforts may be made to try to obliterate them by words or ignore them by phrases, but the reality is there.  The Government have failed to appreciate the realities of modern life in Ireland.  That is true.  The <Col N="1080" /> Government have failed to appreciate reality.  They just do not know.  The Government do not know what it is like to try to live on the old age pension. They do not know the hardships suffered by those on social assistance. They do not know the problems of the widow.  If they did know, they would not have taken the sort of measures they have taken in recent years.</P>
      <P>That is the truth of the matter.  That is the reason why we are hoping we shall have an opportunity to change this Government in the near future. We are now in a situation in which the Government have lost touch with the realities of Irish life and, so long as they have, and so long as they fail to realise that, they will go on finding excuses for not increasing social welfare benefits, for giving only small increases which never make up the leeway in relation to the cost of living. Year in and year out we will go on, so long as this Government last, with one Minister after another, saying: &ldquo;We know it is inadequate but we are hoping things will impprove in the future.&rdquo;  The country is tired of that and it is tired, I think, of the men who continue to say it.</P>

Stud farms have been excluded for a long time from our Land Acts and I am not changing the position under this Bill but I should like to put on the records of the House section 9, subsection (1) of the Land Act, 1927 which reads:</P>

    <P>Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (1) and (3) of the Land <Col N="1082" /> Act, 1923, there shall not be vested in the Land Commission by virtue of the said Act otherwise than in pursuance of a voluntary agreement any untenanted land so long as the Land Commission are satisfied that such land is being used in a <i>bona fide</i> manner as a farm for the purpose of breeding thoroughbred stock which in the opinion of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture is of a nature and character suitable to the requirements of the country.</P>
    <P>So that stud farms have been sacrosanct, so far as the land law is concerned, since 1927.  I am not interfering with that situation here.  As far as Deputy Flanagan is concerned, he can be assured that the law is still there and this Bill does not interfere with the exclusion of stud farms from the land law.</P>

      <P>These amendments deal with the question of reasonable absences from home, that is, what I would call excusable non-residence. Now, the words &ldquo;ordinarily dwelt&rdquo; remove the rigidity of lines 11 and 12 of the original text but at the same time ensure that no owner can satisfy the requirement by establishing any sort of formal or technical residing which the ordinary citizen would not accept as such.  The discretion proposed for the Commissioners will allow them to deal humanely with all human problems, while bearing down on the trickster.  The alternative could well mean endless legal argument on fine points and technicalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blowick in his amendment has tried to list all instances but the official amendment takes the more generous line of admitting &ldquo;any other cause&rdquo;; this will cover the odd case where a man has some extraordinary excuse for absence and yet the Commissioners are convinced that he is genuine.  I could cite many disadvantages in Deputy Blowick's amendment but the main one is that his sub-paragraph (iv) is too broad and a man might spend years in England and say that he was seeking to provide &ldquo;funds <Col N="1084" /> to equip and stock&rdquo; his holding.  There must be some limit to the time a man may spend on this activity.  In practice, the Commissioners do make allowances in genuine cases of shortage of capital.  In this official amendment, I am leaving it completely at the discretion of the Lay Commissioners to decide every case on its merits.  This is a matter that has to be decided by the Commissioners and just as they do now people are entitled to take their case before them.</P>
    <P>We have all had experience of people who may have been absent for ten or 12 years and once they come back and convince the court that it is their genuine intention to return and work their lands and take up residence, the Land Court is always very reasonable with them.  By adding &ldquo;any other cause&rdquo; it means that the Lay Commissioners may decide every case on its own merits and can, where satisfied that the case is genuine, without writing in any particular legal reasons, decide to leave the lands alone if they are satisfied the man has a genuine intention of coming back and working his land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment which calls for a more detailed and clearer explanation from the Minister.  He went to great lengths to tell the House that the decision in regard to absence will be for the Lay Commissioners&mdash;in other words, it will be exclusively a function for them&mdash; but he appears to forget that earlier in this Bill he has vested in himself the right to authorise an inspection of any holding, if he so decides.  I presume that when the Minister is authorising an inspection, he will be prompted by representations made to him, that one of the main facts of any deputation which approaches the Minister asking that a holding be acquired for the relief of congestion and for division amongst the local applicants will be that the owner is absent, and upon hearing that, the Minister may authorise an inspection.  Whilst he tells us that the decision to take action or not to take it will be a matter entirely for the Commissioners, it puts the owner of such lands in a very weak <Col N="1085" /> position, having regard to the fact that the Minister may order an inspection, and when the officials of the Land Commission see that the Minister is so interested in such a holding as to order an inspection, that may be a means in itself directly or indirectly of influencing the Commissioners to take a certain line of action.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister if he will order an inspection in the case of a small holding which the owner inherited and which was very heavily in debt due to the financial circumstances of the family or due to economic considerations: the owner is compelled to draw the curtains, close the door, put a padlock on the door, and emigrate to Scotland or England to earn sufficient money to pay his debts, to obtain a full title to his holding and to remove the mortgages thereon; and while he is in the process of earning that money, he may find that the Minister has ordered an inspection, that there has been local agitation for his land as a result of which he may eventually be dispossessed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's efforts to knock me off my track will <Col N="1086" /> not succeed this time, I am afraid.  I am dealing with the question of the owner being absent from the land. There are many cases in which the owner is absent from the land for very genuine reasons.  He may decide to emigrate to earn money to pay his debts.  He may have failed to obtain a loan from the banks or the Agricultural Credit Corporation to stock his land.  He may decide to leave the land to make quicker money to pay his debts.  Surely in a case of that kind the Land Commission would be unreasonable and unfair if they entered into proceedings, much less an inspection.</P>
      <P>There are many cases in which the owner of a farm may decide for one reason or another to live with his relatives or in a town.  Now, as never before, since these amendments were circulated people who do not reside on their holdings are haunted night after night by the ghost of the Land Commission appearing to them.  There is great uneasiness in the country.  There are many holders of land on which there is no house.  A small farmer may have another small holding four miles away, and a further small holding the same distance away but probably in another direction.  It may be the intention of such a farmer to keep those draw holdings, as they are described, to settle his sons or his daughters.  In many instances the draw farm subsidises the home farm.  A man may be supplying milk to the creamery and he may decide that when his stock go dry, he will put them on what he calls his outfarm.  His livelihood is now endangered and his very existence is threatened because his outfarm is in danger of acquisition because it is not a residential holding and he is not living on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, that provision contains a very high degree of insecurity of tenure.  When land is well worked, whether the owner lives on it or not, one would expect that it would be free from the teeth of the Land Commission, as the Minister described it last week. I believe very many people who for one reason or another do not reside on their holdings will now find themselves in very grave danger.  For the record, and so that we can quote them <Col N="1087" /> to remove the doubts, the uneasiness and the fear that exist in the hearts of many landowners, I should like to hear from the Minister what guarantees he is giving to the owners of all the draw farms throughout the length and breadth of the country.  If he tells us the Land Commission will not interest themselves, provided the lands are well worked and well managed, why are these amendments necessary, if the Minister has confidence in and trusts these hardworking and industrious people who depend entirely on their land?</P>
    <P>This provision is causing considerable worry and for the Minister to speak for five or six minutes is not sufficient for the landowners who want some security and who are dependent on the land for their livelihood.  In the west of Ireland, the people are as hardworking and as industrious as they are in any part of Ireland.  There are hardworking people in Galway, Roscommon and Mayo who must leave their land idle when economic circumstances force them to put padlocks on the doors.  We do not want those people to be faced with the position when they return home, having put a few pounds together to purchase livestock and equipment, of finding that their lands are between the teeth of the Land Commission and in the jaws of the Commissioners.  That is something we want to avoid.</P>
    <P>It is something the Minister says is not going to happen.  All we have for that is the Minister's word, but, according to the amendment, it can happen.  It is our duty as an Opposition to take steps to see that it will not happen.  That is why I am so disturbed by the provisions in these amendments in relation to the absence of the landowner because of domestic or economic circumstances.  I feel that while it is a matter for the Commissioners, they will be reasonable in dealing with them, I would be satisfied if I could be sure that it was the Commissioners who would be dealing with them but I am afraid of this because of the powers the Minister has taken in this Bill that certain absentee landowners may be the victims of these provisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> I should not be the one to stand over or defend the absentee landowner, the man who may own a couple of hundred acres of land and who may visit it once in four or five years.  We are not interested in that man.  We are interested in the small men who must leave their lands as a matter of necessity and I am not at all too happy that such men will not come under the notice of the Land Commission according to these amendments.  For that reason, I should like a more detailed statement from the Minister, reaffirming the security of such people. I think the powers given in these amendments are drastic and that they put these smallholders in a high degree of insecurity.  I am afraid that the power given in them will be used to drive the smallholder, who cannot pay his way and who has to go abroad, out of his holding.</P>
    <P>That is why I think the Minister should make it perfectly clear to the people in the congested parts of the country, particularly in Mayo, Roscommon and Galway, that if they have not a good standard of living on their own smallholding from their own Government, they are guaranteed against the acquisition of their lands when, for sentimental reasons, they want to hold on to them.  They are entitled to hold on to them and the fact that they are absent from them through economic reasons is no reason why the Land Commission should take them from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are in ease of persons who are absent from their holdings.  The trouble about Deputy Flanagan is that he has not a clue about the west of Ireland or about the congestion problem.  He comes from a rancher county.  The most important of these amendments is the one which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;throughout the whole of the qualifying period resided&rdquo; shall be construed as requiring that the person or persons mentioned in sub-paragraph (i), (ii) or (iii) (as the case may be) of paragraph (b) of subsection (3) of this section has or have <Col N="1089" /> ordinarily dwelt on or in the immediate neighbourhood of the land, provided that the Lay Commissioners may at their discretion disregard, for the purposes of this section, any temporary absence or absences from the land which they are satisfied is or are reasonably attributable to illness, business, vacation or any other cause.</P>
    <P>That discretion could not be wider. The Land Commission can decide every case on its own merits and can decide whether they can move or cannot move in any particular case. Deputy Flanagan is very concerned about some people who own big tracts of land in this country, people like Mr. Skorzeny who has a big farm in Kildare and who lives in Paris. This is the type of person this section can deal with; it can bring these lands in where they are required for the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>I suggest that Deputy Flanagan is more concerned with obstruction than with the relief of congestion.  He is creating fright in the mind of the landowners on the assumption that the only land which the Land Commission go after is the land of the small man who has to go to England, the widow whose husband has recently died and who has left her lands, when everybody knows that these people are never touched.  The Land Commission go after lands that have been misused and let for years and years, and even then the owner of these lands has the right to come back from Australia or America and protect his right if he can satisfy the land court that he is going to come back in one, two or three years and use the land.  If he does that, the land court will support him.</P>
    <P>These amendments are designed to get after the type of people I have described to this House and I commend them to the House.  It is essential under this Bill to set up a new land pool for the relief of congestion, a problem which I intend to deal with.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Amendments 41 and 42 not moved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1090" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 34, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>As we now come to consider section 34 itself, I want to assure the House that in preparing it, I had no intention of arming the Land Commission with any unreasonable or intolerable powers over landowners. My aim was, and still is, to give them adequate power to proceed with their work, unhampered by certain difficulties which have grown up around them since the principal post-Treaty Land Acts were framed.</P>
      <P>Deputies who are at all familiar with land reform work will be aware that if lands are offered for sale and the Land Commission start to show an interest in them, the owner may be advised by over-cautious friends to make a quick sale to a third party or to cancel the offer, fight off the attentions of the Land Commission and then sell when he feels safe.  This is not quite so common, now that we have started to pay auctioneers' fees, but it still occurs.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, one of the proposals in section 34 is that if the Land Commission require lands for their general statutory purposes and if these lands have recently been offered for sale, then the ordinary defences against acquisition are not available to the owner.  This does not mean that every holding offered for sale is going to be snatched compulsorily by the Land Commission.  Far from it.  What the section does mean can be summed up by saying: &ldquo;This man no longer needs his land and if the Land Commission do need it, they may have it, provided they pay market value.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies, who are familiar with the land code, will also be aware that the principal defence against compulsory acquisition is that based on what we call &ldquo;the two adequates&rdquo;, that is to say, adequate production and adequate employment.  Not all Deputies may be aware that, under a judicial decision made some years ago, the &ldquo;adequates&rdquo; defence is available, even if the owner of the land resides permanently, say, in Australia and lets his lands each <Col N="1091" /> year.  Yet, where there is no local congestion, that is the law.  The owner may be a permanent absentee but if he ensures that the conacre tenants supply &ldquo;the two adequates&rdquo;, his position is invulnerable, under the law as it at present stands.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to believe that Dáil Éireann, which approved this protection against acquisition, intended it to operate so broadly as to protect a permanent absentee in Australia.  I am sure it was generally intended to extend protection to the ordinary resident Irish farmer who achieved the adequates by his own efforts or management.</P>
    <P>In any event, the relevant sections have been interpreted in the manner I have indicated and it is very necessary to tighten them up, if they are to function properly in future.  In seeking a remedy for this situation, I came finally to the conclusion that the &ldquo;adequates&rdquo; defence should be available only to a resident tenant or proprietor. In the context of the family farm and our general desire to see a thriving and prosperous rural society, I think we should start from the argument that only the good resident farmer is clearly entitled to the fullest protection of the land code.  All others &mdash;the non-residents&mdash;should be open to question and scrutiny.  They may have excellent reasons for not being resident and, in practice, the Land Commission will have to make allowance for these cases, but these do not take from my main contention that the non-resident, on the face of things, is not entitled to the same guaranteed statutory security as the resident farmer.</P>
    <P>I want to assert, in the same way, that landowning companies cannot claim the right to be sheltered by the statute in quite the same was as the family farm.  The company formula has been used to cover many things from tax evasion to purchases by non-nationals and I have no desire to see it used as a smart device to defeat the Land Commission.  On the other hand, the genuine family company will normally be fully protected because <Col N="1092" /> its shareholders will normally be in residence on the lands.  Again, I would assure the House that exceptional cases will get all the consideration they can reasonably expect from the Lay Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The two adequates had to be judged in former cases of land code.  In sections 34 and 41 of this Bill, it is provided that the &ldquo;adequates&rdquo; defence must be related to the 12 months preceding the Provisional List, thus giving the owner opportunity to be judged on the full annual cycle of operations and making the law definite about the period.  There have been no amendments tabled in respect of this 12 months period and I take it the House is in general agreement with that proposition.</P>
    <P>I can say that in the past few months I have given careful consideration to the criticisms levelled at section 34 inside and outside the House.  I have heard and read quite sympathetically the views of various organisations intimately concerned in these matters; where practicable, I have accepted suggestions and made suitable adjustments by way of official amendments, but the text, as now amended, represents an honest attempt to overcome the genuine difficulties in the working of the land reform programme and, by and large, it is the least which should be done towards that end.  I accordingly recommend section 34 to the House.</P>
    <P>Let me say, in anticipating any further arguments that, of course, I appreciate that circumstances may change.  A man may offer his farm for sale and, due to family circumstances, because somebody comes home from somewhere or for some other reason, may change his mind about selling.  If that is so, he has the Land Commission court to go before and to satisfy them that he has genuinely changed his mind, that his family circumstances have changed.  He no longer wants to sell the farm; he wants to keep it.  All these circumstances will normally be considered impartially by the court.  I cannot for the life of me see what is wrong with this proposition, where a man wants to unload a farm on the public market <Col N="1093" /> within a certain period, why that land should not, in the first instance, be available to the Land Commission for the special purpose of relieving congestion.  Normally when a man wants to get rid of a farm, he does so for personal reasons.  When this farm comes on the market, there is no argument in good sense or law as to why the Land Commission should not be entitled to have first option on it for the purpose of building up family farms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the undertakings given by the Minister, I have certain grave fears about this section.  Let me say at the outset when the Minister was so ready to preface his remarks with the statement that I represented a ranchers' constituency and that I was putting forward the ranchers' views, I can assure him that in the constituency which I have the honour of representing there are pockets of congestion as great as there are in any part of County Mayo, and I am very familiar with the problem of congests.</P>
      <P>I am so familiar with the problem of congests that I am quite satisfied it is a national problem that must be solved and must be tackled.  I am quite satisfied that the approach which the Fine Gael Party are taking is the most satisfactory manner of solving the problem of congestion.  We all know there are congests in every part of Ireland.  We all know there is insufficient land in the country to give every applicant a portion of land but I am greatly afraid that section 34 holds a high degree of insecurity for certain persons whose intentions are good. Whilst the Minister may tell us that such persons, because of domestic or financial circumstances, will not have their land interfered with, I want to say that it is only an expression of opinion on the part of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister must have asked the officers of his Department to brief him with statistics, with special reference to this section, dealing with the number of holdings set, sublet or worked by the owner himself for part of the year who for another part of the year must emigrate.  I am satisfied <Col N="1094" /> that there are a number of such small holdings, as I am equally satisfied that this Bill is designed to bring within its clutches small holdings in the same manner as big holdings.  Surely the Minister was wrong in trying to convey to this House that any of us on this side of the House, or indeed in any part of it, were trying to defend the absentee landowner, who is living abroad, not depending on his holding for a livelihood, who may have other vast sources of income, or indeed the alien gentlemen he has referred to in another county.  We are not concerned with those people.  On the contrary, we want to help the Land Commission and assist the Minister's Department in focussing the attention of the Commissioners on such holdings, with a view to having them acquired and divided amongst the local smallholders and deserving applicants.</P>
    <P>When we see that a section such as this holds out fear for people who are not economically in a position to work their own holdings, either because of the size of the holding or because of domestic circumstances, the fact that the Minister gives this House a guarantee does not mean that such people are safe from the clutches of the Land Commission.  I would have expected the Minister to have had from his advisers a suitable amendment to relieve the anxiety and worry of the many smallholders today and, indeed, reasonably good farmers who have draw farms to which the Minister has not referred.</P>
    <P>There are numerous farmers in this country today who have two and three well-worked farms.  Deputy Fanning of North Tipperary painted the clearest picture here.  He is a good farmer and knows the conditions of the farmers who have these draw holdings for the purpose of settling their sons or daughters, or for the purpose of subsidising the holding on which they live. He reasonably inquired and solicited the support of the Minister to guarantee and ensure that the lands of such honest, hard-working farmers would not be interfered with.  I am quite satisfied that, whilst the Minister agreed <Col N="1095" /> that there are special circumstances&mdash; and he quoted the circumstances&mdash; which the Land Commission will consider, when this section is passed and becomes law, he cannot stop the Land Commission from making a survey of every acre of land where the owner is working in Britain, Scotland or America, or even those who have come to the city to work.  I think it is unfair and unreasonable that any man should be put to the trouble, expense, inconvenience and torment of having to consult his solicitor, pay costs and have a case prepared to bring to the land court and present it in such a fashion as to enable him to retain his lands.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that no worthwhile farmer will leave his farm.  That is the first consideration.  The farmers love their farms and their land and take great pride in them.  I want to assure this House that, while this is so, there are numerous draw farms, the owners of which are now in dread and fear that these farms will be taken from them.  I have referred three times today to the question of the draw farms.  The Minister has deliberately made no reference to them on every occasion. This leads me to believe that when this Bill is passed, the Minister and his Department, no matter what the circumstances may be, will concentrate on the man who has a holding on which there is no residence and which may be some distance away from his main holding.  I am also quite satisfied that there are dairy farmers in milk-producing districts with draw farms, who, when their stock go dry, shift them over to these draw farms and leave them there.  I am afraid these people will be greatly disturbed and this section involves a high degree of insecurity of tenure for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken what we have described as the three Fs&mdash;fair rent, free sale and fixity of tenure&mdash;I suppose one thousand times and has torn them into shreds ten times over. It is a bad thing that this House should see the freedom we have enjoyed on the land being in any way disturbed. I feel the Land Commission may be <Col N="1096" /> inclined to let the Minister see how quickly they can get their work done and the moment this section of the Bill becomes law, notice will be served on every landowner who, because of domestic circumstances, must leave the country or leave his land.  I can assure the Minister that this is a measure which has caused, and is causing, a great measure of worry and insecurity for these people.  I am sorry we have reached the stage at which such provisions might be included.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept for one moment the excuse the Minister gives this House, that his desire for such power and authority is solely in the interests of the congests and those who reside in congested districts, and that he is so anxious to see what he describes as the family farm of 45-50 acres.  This House should view with serious concern the fact that we will provide with additional land and dispossess other people against their wishes of land they may have had in the family chain for hundreds of years.</P>
    <P>In regard to the companies owning land, I should like the Minister to make a statement on the difference between native companies and alien companies. There is a difference.  That in itself should be referred to by the Minister for the records.  Many landowners, or foreign companies, for the purpose of expanding agriculture or increasing the amount of livestock on the land, have invested considerable sums in farm buildings, drainage, silos and other means of modern farming.  There are many of those enterprising people giving good employment.  Because the lands are owned by companies, they should not be the subject of special attention by the Land Commission, if they are well worked and giving good employment.  I agree there is a considerable difference between that kind of company and the type of alien company who control certain lands. We shall have an opportunity later of discussing the subject of the purchase of land by aliens in all its aspects.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, we should have from the Minister a statement in relation <Col N="1097" /> to the difference in the Land Commission approach to native companies and foreign companies.  I have very great sympathy for the landowner who works with the object of providing farms for members of his family.  We have in many parts of Ireland a love of land which is hereditary, where young people now in agricultural colleges learning modern methods of farming are anxious to take over their fathers' farms, whose fathers have been industrious hardworking people.  It is regrettable that the Land Commission should take such farms away.</P>
    <P>The farms I am speaking of are the draw farms which I mentioned earlier. In all such cases, the Land Commission should consider very seriously the ability of the farmers involved to work their land and whether or not they have sons and daughters to settle on the land.  It is the duty of the Land Commission to give every encouragement to industrious farmers who have earmarked such draw farms for sons or daughters.</P>

      <P>I entirely, and completely agree, but the point I am making is that a genuine effort is being made here, at last, to take over the neglected lands of this country and settle them on deserving people.  The position up to now has been that all anybody has to do, even if he has been 50 years in the United States, is to hand his land over to an auctioneer, or put a notice in a local paper, and it is time that was brought to an end. The man who puts them up for sale can bring in all the fake bidders in Europe he can assemble to bid the lands up to any price, a fake price, as we know.  Then if the Land Commission wish to acquire those lands to settle on the poor people of this country who have no land and who have to ramble over to England because they have not, the Land Commission have to buy at these inflated prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not unfair that in any country you can find a whole townland owned by two people aged 70 and 80 years? They are not married.  I do not think they would even go out with other men's wives, not alone get married themselves.  They are in the unhappy position that they have nobody to <Col N="1099" /> whom to leave those lands.  If this section is enacted, it will do away with that situation and if we can get this section through, we shall get the Bill through.  Then, instead of having people rambling off to England because they are unable to get land at home, we shall put the Land Commission in a position to acquire lands for our own people at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>I suppose Deputy Dillon probably got at least £4,000 out of the £15 heifer subsidy scheme and it is rich to hear him and people like him coming in here and talking for the poor people. I come in here to speak for the poor people of the west, not for the rich man.  I say unhesitatingly that the Minister also speaks for the poor people of the west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that in 1961 we introduced a Bill designed to facilitate the frustration of the acquisition of Irish agricultural land by aliens.  The Minister at that time thought such a Bill was unnecessary and opposed it.  The Bill was defeated.  The Minister has now come round to share our point of view, and we are still of the same view as we were in 1961.  We think some restriction should be placed on the acquisition of agricultural land by aliens, and where they employ devious methods to cover up their acquisition of agricultural land, we are of the opinion that the Land Commission should be furnished with powers to frustrate that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister, however, that we ought to differentiate between the foreign company formed to frustrate the land code of this country and to enable foreigners to acquire ownership of agricultural land, and a company formed by a genuine Irish family in the course of a family settlement. This section requires every beneficial participant in a company owning land to live in the vicinity of the land, as defined by the Minister's amendment, that is, within three miles of the principal holding.  It is quite manifest that, where a trust is formed in the shape of a company to cater for a family, you may have elderly relatives <Col N="1100" /> who have retired from the land and are living in Dublin, Cork or Limerick. You may have the son of the family running the place, residing on the farm and operating it, and his grownup children possibly abroad in London or elsewhere earning their living.  Yet, the old people, the actual operator of the farm and his children are all beneficial members of the corporation which owns the farm and, perhaps, a good deal of other property as well.</P>
    <P>We are urging on the Minister that he should differentiate between the obligation which he places upon aliens and that which he places upon nationals.  I think he is right to go the length of saying that, if aliens participate in a company which holds Irish land, we should apply to that company the full rigours of this proposal so as to exclude the possibility of fake companies being established for the purpose of frustrating the general principle on which the land code is founded, and which the Minister has now accepted, that is, that no more agricultural land should be transferred to foreign ownership.</P>
    <P>At the same time, while we support that view, we think it is a bad principle that we should treat our own as we treat strangers.  I know there is a temptation in a situation of this kind to call up the memory of the old days and much of the hardship and injustice that was wrought in past generations on our people by landlords and people who owned land.  But we won that battle.  We joined the battle with these people and we defeated them.  Far from allowing them to drive us off the land, we drove them off the land.  Now that we are the lords and masters of this land, the obligation is upon us to extend to them that justice they withheld from our fathers and grandfathers and those who went before us.  We despised them for the injustices wrought on our people.  It would indeed be a deplorable thing if we were misled by crackpots and imbeciles into emulating the example of those against whom we invoked heavy sanctions in the long ago.  Now we have the power to treat them justly or unjustly.  The temptation of the base and the contemptible is to indulge their yearning <Col N="1101" /> for vengeance by being as unjust to them as their forbears have been unjust to us, but I cannot see an Irish Legislature cast in that role.  I think the very measure of the injustice done to us in the past should be our stimulus to say that, now that we have the power, we should do strict justice by them.</P>
    <P>It is not strict justice to provide that, where, perfectly legitimately, a family whom we recognise as Irish, as belonging to our country, have, for their own family reasons, made certain family dispositions, in casting a net to catch aliens who we feel should not buy Irish land we should treat our neighbours on the basis as though they were aliens.  They are not aliens; they are Irish just as we are.  They are equal before the Lord with everyone else in this country.  It would be a sorry day if an Irish Legislature would deal with their neighbours in a matter of this kind on the same basis as it is legitimately sought to deal with foreigners.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I ask the Minister to leave this section as it stands but to make provision that it shall not apply to companies constituted exclusively of Irish nationals.  If he does that, he meets our point.  I cannot imagine he really intends that this section should be invoked against a company constituted exclusively of Irish nationals.  There are ample powers, where the public interest demands that any land should be compulsorily acquired, to acquire it, but, as I understand the Minister, this section is primarily designed to deal with the fraudulent company that seeks to frustrate his purpose, and our purpose, to prevent the control and acquisition of Irish land by aliens. He can meet our point immediately by saying: &ldquo;Very well; on Report Stage, I will provide that this section does not apply to companies, the shareholders of which are exclusively national, but let it be understood that, if any alien professes to participate in the company, it becomes subject to this section.&rdquo;  That will meet our point.  If the company is exclusively Irish, it ought to be excluded from the purposes of this section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> I put it to the Minister it would be much happier if the bulk of this Bill could be carried with general consent.  As far as we are concerned, we are anxious to see what appears to us to be the useful elements of this legislation expeditiously passed. But we do urge on the Minister that this is a valid point made, not on behalf of people who are numerous in the country, nor on behalf of people whose cause is popular in the country, but on behalf of Irish men and women who are in our power and of whom we desire to boast that such people in the power of an Irish Parliament are secure of justice.  I do not think the Minister will weaken his Bill in the least if he says: &ldquo;Very well; between now and the Report Stage, I will arrange that this section shall not apply to such a company&rdquo;.  If he does that, there is no further argument between us and we are agreed on a common purpose.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the section, which I went into in more detail before Deputy Dillon came in, is to deal with certain situations of companies owning lands here, the real beneficial owners perhaps being abroad, and to make these lands vulnerable for Land Commission purposes for the relief of congestion.</P>
      <P>Deputies, including the Leader of the Opposition, are always quoting extreme cases and suggesting that the Land Commission will take land from the widow or the genuine company, and so on.  Deputies know that that is not so and that, even under the existing law, the Land Commission can go after unworked land, land that has been let over a long period of years. These are the kinds of cases this section is designed to meet and that is why we have forged this qualification to make these lands in suitable cases vulnerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people who purchase land under one device or another and usually under the name of an alleged Irish company.  The land is let and they are living in Paris or London or where have you.  These are the kinds of people I am endeavouring to deal with here.  The question of providing for elderly relatives under a family <Col N="1103" /> company and all such extreme cases do not really apply under the existing law nor are they contemplated here. Many wealthy factory-owners play about with farms as a hobby and there are certain taxation devices for siphoning profits from one section to the other.</P>

      <P>Here, we are trying to deal with the relief of congestion and to provide a land pool.  These are the types of cases&mdash;non-resident companies and what have you, owning big sections of land that should be vulnerable for Land Commission purposes and in respect of which the statutory protection provisions should be removed where these lands are wanted for national purposes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon asked me to look at this between now and Report Stage.  I shall, but I can assure him and the House that, unless we remove the front of the Irish company in this field, we might as well throw our hats at it. There are so many devices open, under the company laws of this country and probably of other countries too, to evade what we are after here that unless we make this applicable to Irish companies we are simply wasting our time.  The simple case is the foreign company.  We all know where we are in that connection.  The trouble is an alleged Irish company with, for instance, a herd on the land the major shareholder in order to avoid the provisions of this section.  I invite Deputies to consider that position.  It is to ensure against that position that the powers here are being sought.</P>
      <P>I shall have another look at it but, from my knowledge of the company laws and the stories I have been told, whether true or false, in connection with manipulations of Irish companies, I say to the House seriously and sincerely that unless we spread our net in this way we are wasting our time in trying to make these lands vulnerable to the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that this argument will be prolonged as long as the Opposition can possibly prolong it.  We have all heard the saying &ldquo;<i>De mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>&rdquo; but what about <i>&ldquo;De mortuis et vivis nil nisi verum&rdquo;</i>?  I am afraid a lot of the latter has not been spoken in this House in the past few weeks. Deputy O. J. Flanagan probably knows more Latin than Deputy Dillon and no doubt he will understand the point I am making.  I think it is a shame.  In all fairness to the people in the west of Ireland, in particular, I must point out that the prolongation of this debate is designed to ensure that this Bill will not go through this House and, even if it does, that it will not go through the Upper House until after next Spring with the result that very few people in the west will be transferred next Spring to holdings in the midlands.  I consider that this is very poor politics.</P>
      <P>I completely and entirely agree with the Minister, not simply because he is a Mayoman but because I honestly believe that what he has in mind is the correct thing to do.  However, the fact that he is a Mayoman makes it much easier for me to agree with him because he or anybody belonging to him is not the type of person who would do any of the things fired forth here by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Flanagan.  According to them, if the Minister gets these powers there will be fire and brimstone upon certain people.  There probably will.  That should have happened a long time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ordinary common man, the ordinary tenant down the country and even the ordinary person who had to emigrate to make extra money, perhaps to buy extra acres next door so that he or those coming after him will be able to live there in reasonable security, should not be touched.  I know from my associations with the Minister and with these people that he is the last man in Europe to do anything which would deprive the widow, the orphan, or anybody else of that type, of their land.  This matter has been fired up here purely and simply in an effort to stop this Bill from going through because we have people here who are auctioneers and <Col N="1105" /> who are afraid that if this Bill goes through, they will lose their five per cent.  I do not think they are right.  I suggest that in the west of Ireland at least that will have no effect and that in the midlands and in the east&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister is undertaking to look at this again between now and Report Stage to facilitate our procedure.  I am prepared to bring in an amendment.  I can recognise the difficulty the Minister has in mind. You can have the one hundred per cent Irish company that is owned by a holding company in which there are shareholders who are aliens.  You can have the company in which the holding, down in the provinces, is owned by a gentleman living in Vienna.  Surely between us we can devise a section of an Act which will provide that if any beneficial interest, direct or indirect, hereafter vests in someone other than a national in a company owning land in Ireland, that company shall become fully subject to all the powers in section 34.  That meets our point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite prepared to say &ldquo;any beneficiary, proximate or remote&rdquo;, and then it is up to a family making a genuine family settlement in consultation with a solicitor to see that no jiggery-pokery is engaged in.  If, at any stage, there is a beneficial interest passing to any alien, then automatically the whole settlement becomes subject to the general provisions of this section. If the Minister will make such a provision between now and Report <Col N="1106" /> Stage, that satisfies us.  We are solely concerned to protect the security of tenure of a genuine company representing an Irish family.  Outside that, we are in entire agreement with the Minister, and I think we urged this before on the Minister, as far back as 1961, that the time was overdue to take Draconian measures against foreigners acquiring ownership of Irish agricultural land, either <i>per se</i> or <i>per alios.</i></P>
    <P>In regard to land legislation, I do not think it desirable that acrimony should be engendered.  I should much prefer to see land legislation passed by general consent.  From every point of view, I believe that is desirable. Certain fundamental issues emerged in the course of the debate on this Bill and it is manifest that on these issues, we and the Minister are not going to agree.  We have argued them and we are pledged unequivocally, if we get into office, to repeal the provisions of section 27 and to cancel any arrangement the Minister may make whereby an executive officer of his Department is a Land Commissioner.  We must agree to differ on those issues.  But here is another matter where I do not believe there is any genuine difference between us.  We both want the same thing, and I think, on reflection, the Minister will find that if he puts the matter before his legal experts, an agreed solution can be found.  On that basis, we are prepared to let the section go through. We shall submit an amendment for Report Stage and I have no doubt the Minister`s draftsmen will be able to prepare a better one.  If that should be the case, we shall be very happy to accept it on the Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>They say: &ldquo;<i>Qui facit per alium facit per se</i>&rdquo;, but Deputy Dillon must realise that this section is designed to deal with what I call the Dame Street type of farming, a front of a farm company with nobody residing on the <Col N="1107" /> holding which is not being used in the best national interest.  I am satisfied, and I have been told, that there is an instance or two of registered Irish companies, which, on paper, are still 100 per cent Irish controlled, but in actual fact are a front for other people.  How one can get over the position when an alleged mortgagor realises his mortgage and takes over possession without dealing with documents of title unless you make a provision of this kind, is beyond my ingenuity to answer at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

      <P>This section proposes to allow the Minister for Finance to fix, from time to time, the maximum expenditure by the Land Commission on work connected with watercourses, drains or embankments.  Under the existing law, section 44 of the 1933 Land Act, the Land Commission must obtain the sanction of the Minister for Finance before incurring expenditure exceeding £500.  With changing money values, the limit of £500 has become too restricted and, for instance, a severe winter storm can overnight create urgent need for repair work costing much more than this sum.  Indeed, in many cases where there is a question of expediency and urgency, if the Land Commission can go in in a hurry, the work will cost much less than if it is left for a while.</P>
      <P>This section generally deals with emergencies but it will enable the Minister for Finance to fix with me, or with whatever Minister for Lands is there, a global figure under which the Land Commission may move in without reference to the Department of Finance, without red tape.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 37 amends the Land Act of 1936.  As Deputies who are familiar with this field know, there is a safe period of seven years after vesting during which, under the law as it exists, the Land Commission cannot touch a farm.  Some very odd cases have arisen.  For instance, I was questioned by Deputy Sweetman in this House some time last year about a case in which there was a migrant who died and his widow sold out the new migrant's holding within six months of coming to it but because of the fact that there was this immunity the Land Commission could not step in.  There were two cases some years ago of two brothers from the west who were in holdings up here who had them let. One of them had gone away, in fact. Again, there was this immunity so that the Land Commission could not interfere.</P>
      <P>This section, of course, would also deal with unvested holdings that may become vested in future.  There are approximately 10,000 holdings still unvested because for one reason or another, the Land Commission have not got around to them but by virtue of the fact that a vesting order is made, whether the owners of these holdings may have them let for years and may be in England, America or Australia, again after the vesting order is made there is this seven year period during which the Land Commission are prohibited from acquiring or taking them over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not wedded to the proposition that is here, that is, the period of two years which I have suggested.  I am quite satisfied that seven years is absolutely unreasonable and that there is now no good reason why there should be this immunity for a period of seven years.  The odd case can occur, particularly now in the valuable new holdings migrants are getting, costing up to £8,000, for instance, that are specifically designed for migrants, that due to some family circumstance, within a short time, the migrant that has gone <Col N="1110" /> up there may go away, may die, may give up the holding, or the Land Commission may have picked a bad land user.  In these cases it should be open to the Land Commission to move in within a reasonable time.  I do not say it should be moved into straightaway, overnight.  But the Land Commission's hands should not be tied from moving in in a suitable case to acquire such lands.</P>
    <P>Normally, of course, the Land Commission would not move in unreasonably and, indeed, it can often happen that a man going up from my part of the country may need a couple of years. He may have to build up stock because he needs more stock for the bigger holding he is getting and may need, perhaps, to let a couple of fields or to go to England for a year, or what have you.  I contemplate that that must occur from time to time in this sphere of things but I do feel that, outside migrants altogether, the law is wrong whereby by the very fact of vesting this field down in the west of Ireland these lands, irrespective of their user, are inviolable for a period of seven years after vesting.</P>
    <P>On the Second Stage of this Bill, some Deputies referred to this period as being unreasonable and to this power as being a wrong power to give to the Land Commission.  I do not think they quite understand what my real purpose was in trying to cut down this period.  I suggest to the House that a reasonable period after vesting is two years.  If, on the other hand, there are any convincing reasons given to me between now and Report Stage as to why I should add another year to that, I am not tied to two years.  My own judgment is that two years is quite reasonable.  Again, it is solely in an extreme case that the Land Commission would be moving in at all within that period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I not right in believing that the average period that elapses between allocation and vesting is ten years?  The tenant is usually in occupation of the holding for ten years before he is vested during which period &mdash;it used to be certainly all around <Col N="1111" /> Ballaghaderreen&mdash;the practice was that a new allottee might expect to be ten years on the holding before he was vested and during that ten years he was, in fact, paying rent in lieu of annuity and was or could be excluded from the holding by the Land Commission at any time if there was nonuser or unsuitable user of the land, whereas, when the land was vested all the rent that he had paid during the years of tenancy was credited to him as instalments as from the date of his original entry on the holding but my recollection was that there was ten years probation.

      <P>In the old days, we called it an annual sum or, in the west, interest in lieu of rent, but my recollection of these procedures is that it was generally where an addition may have been given but where the Land Commission were still waiting to get another holding in the area, as they did not consider that they had sufficient land to make a proper scheme, that they were left in that way for so long as the Deputy has suggested.  I think the practice now is that where they are vesting them they vest the whole townland together after giving them additions and there is no such time lag as there used to be.</P>
      <P>Indeed, as I have said, there are only about 10,000 unvested cases now left in the whole country and probably most of them are in the west of Ireland and most of them are probably old rundale estates the problems in relation to which have proved insoluble up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in regard to many of those cases some are gone abroad; some of them are gone for many years with no intention of returning.  Those few acres may be vital for Land Commission purposes, <Col N="1112" /> but by virtue of their vesting, the holdings are untouchable for a period of seven years.  I am saying I think that is wrong.  The object of this section is to cut that down to two. In the case of the unvested holding, I have also mentioned to the Deputy the question of a migrant who for one reason or another fails in regard to land user on the new holding and that there should not be this protection for a period of seven years and that the Land Commission should be able to move in on him in proper circumstances if he deserves it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in substantial agreement with the Minister but, as usual, my mind is, I confess, prejudiced and harassed by apprehension of the new character of the Land Commission.  If the Land Commission were constituted as I think it ought to be constituted, exclusively in a quasi-judicial form and if section 27 did not exist, I would not quarrel with the Minister at all.  If he said that, on reflection and having listened to the best advice, he would make the two years three or four, I would not quarrel with that.  He will agree with me that 20 years ago the ordinary period for vesting was about ten years and if you added two years to that, it meant that a man got ten years during which he was on probation and two years in which he was in an inalienable position <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Land Commission and thereafter he became susceptible to acquisition like every other landholder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would find myself&mdash;and I think Deputy Flanagan will agree with me &mdash;with no reservations on this section if we had not this fundamental difference in regard to the two previous sections, that is, the constitution of the Land Commission and the power of the Minister under section 27 to direct the inspection of lands.  I am not without hope that before this Bill finally leaves Dáil Éireann we shall manage to persuade the Minister to drop these two powers.  It would be a source of great benefit to the country if the discussion on this Bill had not those two confusing elements in it. It would have been good for the land code to have the wider measure of <Col N="1113" /> agreement that could have been arrived at in the absence of the two provisions to which I refer.</P>
    <P>However, so far as we are concerned, in view of the abbreviation of the period of years between entry and vesting, we think the Minister might be prepared, having obtained the best advice, to appoint three years rather than two but it is not a matter on which we have very strong views.  If the Minister says on Report Stage that, having taken the best advice he prefers two, we are prepared to agree.  If, on the other hand, he takes the view that three or four years is the better period, we shall be prepared to agree to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no great difference of opinion between ourselves and the Minister on this section.  It is true to say that there has been a considerable speeding up by the Land Commission in the vesting of holdings and I ask the Minister to direct seriously the attention of the Land Commission to the early vesting of holdings.  The new tenant may require financial assistance and in most cases where financial assistance is sought either from the Agricultural Credit Corporation or indeed from any other financial concern, they usually address a query relating to the vesting of the holding.</P>
      <P>I have recently directed the attention of the Land Commission to a number of these cases where the very progressive and most successful allottees were farming according to the highest standards, but when they sought financial accommodation from the banks they were told to address a communication to the Land Commission with a view to early vesting. It would be a very great asset to those allottees to be vested as early as possible so that they could be accommodated if they required financial assistance.  I agree there is a considerable speeding up in vesting but I would ask the Minister to endeavour to get this section of the Land Commission working so that vesting will be completed at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's attention has been directed to a number of estates where <Col N="1114" /> vesting is overdue and where hardship is being experienced because of this. The Minister sees frequent reports from the Land Commission as to the progress these new tenants, migrants or others, are making on their holdings. While there always appears to be a great deal of publicity given to the one undesirable who may not work his farm in accordance with the high standards expected of him, it is generally felt that the vast majority of them make a great success of their holdings.</P>
    <P>On an occasion such as this when we are discussing these people under this section, it can be said that the Land Commission have in most cases made wise choices and that many of those who have obtained holdings are living up to the expectations of the Land Commission and to the expectations of this House.  It is encouraging for us to be able to say that they are making a good living and settling down on the land which they love. The Minister will agree that it is very seldom there is a failure in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have paid tribute on many occasions in this House to the outstanding success which the vast majority of migrants have achieved on their holdings, and particularly migrants who were brought up over the last 15 or 20 years.  I am thinking more in this section of dealing with the type of case left in some of these land slums in the west and of the 10,000 unvested cases to which I have referred.  Deputies may not be aware that in some of these cases tenants object to vesting because they feel, not without reason, that once they are vested, they are written off by the Land Commission, that the Land Commission have no more use for them and they will get no more grants, and so on.  They sometimes object to vesting, not on the best legal grounds but for the purpose of keeping themselves as Land Commission liabilities. I am not thinking so much of the odd case of the migrant, such as the case raised here last year by Deputy Sweetman, and one or two others that I know of, in which there were very <Col N="1115" /> unusual family circumstances.  There were cases in which, if this protection did not exist, the Land Commission would have moved in and taken over holdings.  I am thinking in the main of the vested cases to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 38.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 38 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to expand and complete the arrangements under which the Land Commission may recover sums by way of claims against purchase moneys or similar funds.  The existing law is governed by section 13 of the Land Act, 1939, as amended by the Land Act, 1953.  Broadly speaking, provision is made for the recovery of sums due to the Land Commission, or losses, or expenses incurred by them, through owners overholding beyond the appointed day.</P>
      <P>The main weakness in these provisions is that they include (1) the possibility of a claim relating to a period before the appointed day&mdash;for instance, apportionment lettings, and (2) claims relating to a period after the date of possession when the owner re-enters the land.  Sometimes we have these troublesome cases and expenses are incurred by the Land Commission that should be recoverable out of the purchase money and interest.  Claims for apportionment lettings of the land are only adjusted by consent but, if the owner repudiates them, or if the owner goes to England or America, for instance, and ignores them, the Land Commission are left without a remedy under the existing law. Whereas they may have a remedy at law, they are also hamstrung in the case of the owner who re-enters the lands in defiance of the Land Commission, in defiance of a court order actually, and resists being put out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am asking under this section is that in these cases, in order to deal with the troublemaker, the Land Commission should be entitled to reimburse <Col N="1116" /> the expenses they will have to incur in dealing with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer to believe this proposal had its origin in the Department of Finance.  It does not sound to me like the spirit of either the Land Commission or the old Congested Districts Board, many of whose distinguished officers now adorn the Land Commission.  These are cases very largely of people who are acting quite irrationally under an illusory sense of grievance against the Land Commission. They are the people who will not go out or who, having surrendered their holdings, go back in again.  They are the cases one sees brought in the courts, committed to jail for failure to carry out a High Court order to vacate land or surrender possession to the Land Commission on a certain given day.</P>
      <P>I cannot imagine the Land Commission or the Department of Lands urging on the Minister for Lands that he should seek by way of recovery of cost to exacerbate a family problem created by an eccentric parent who resists a decision, which has been confirmed on appeal, because, if the man's grievance is one relating to price, he has the right to go to the Land Judge and have the price settled under the terms of the 1955 Act at full market value.  We know of cases where you get people who dig their heels into the ground.  Mark you, it is not only odd evicted tenants of the Land Commission who dig their heels irrationally in the ground.  Now, with such people I have got considerable sympathy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do we seriously desire here in dealing with such a person to impose upon him a fiduciary penalty by telling him: &ldquo;If you put the Land Commission to expense that will be taken out of your purchase&rdquo;?  I do not think that is proper. God knows, the family is already afflicted with a parent who has developed an obsession in this matter, who gets himself cited for contempt of court, does a week in Limerick jail, and finally comes before the High Court, apologises, and says he will be good, and promptly goes back next week into the holding and the Land Commission is put to further expense, <Col N="1117" /> but do we really want to take it out on his wife and children by recovering the cost in the purchase price?  I have no objection if the Land Commission go to law and the court awards a certain sum in favour of the Land Commission, having heard all the circumstances of the case, but do not think it is in the spirit of the Land Commission at all to seek, by a kind of sidewind, to impose a fiduciary or monetary penalty on a man who proves unduly troublesome.</P>
    <P>We ought to bear in mind that in dealing with land acquisition, we are going to the very core of some people's whole nature.  I remember the boast of the Land Commission in the old days of the rundale estate in the west of Ireland, which was insoluble until one of the senior inspectors heard there was an old pishrogue in the vicinity that the man who settled the rundale would have a red coat on him.  He went down in a scarlet waiscoat and, lo and behold, the rundale problem resolved itself automatically.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is a source of inspiration to many another country.  I <Col N="1118" /> put it to the Minister we ought to be slow to take powers further to impose costs where we are dealing with a peculiarly difficult individual.  I know how difficult it is on occasion to resolve these problem cases but I do not believe the Land Commission require the added power to increase the burden of costs chargeable against the purchase price.  I should be glad to be advised by the Minister if I am wrong: does this not amount to levying a penalty on the wife and family of an intransigent owner rather than on the owner himself?  If it does, do we really want to do that?  I suggest to the Minister we should not do it.  We have got along fairly well heretofore.  It has been very often difficult and tedious but the State has not suffered any loss the State was not able to bear.  If the Minister submits to the application of charging the purchase money of a farm he acquires with the legal costs that may be involved in resolving a difficult problem I believe he will have cause to regret it and, if this proposal came from the Department of Finance, I suggest to him that he tell the Department of Finance that he is collecting as much in these cases as he at present thinks it is prudent to collect, and he will be damned if he will collect any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has misinterpreted the position.  He is incorrect in his assumption that this proposal originated with the Department of Finance.  It did not; it originated in my Department.  It is a tightening up of section 13 of the 1939 Land Act which deals with charges on purchase moneys of and in the Land Commission. In a number of these cases where the Land Commission are, either compulsorily or by consent, going in and taking lands that had been let for probably a great number of years and when the appointed day, for the purpose of the Land Acts, is invariably the date on which the Land Commission take possession of the land, they may get formal possession, we will say, in November, whereas there may be existing lettings these lands up to the following March.  Under the existing law, if this owner chooses to ignore <Col N="1119" /> apportionment of these lands, and particularly if the owner is abroad, the Land Commission do not under existing law have a remedy unless they go to the rather expensive business of applying to serve writs outside the jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Let us not forget that it is the taxpayers' money we are dealing with. It is all very well for Deputy Dillon to say, and it is true, that in many cases you have a recalcitrant owner who is what they call a bit of a head case. Having agreed to give up possession, the Land Commission are put to great expense, and if the Land Commission collect the money, it is a penalty against the man's wife and family.  It is true that every head case that goes into a court&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What a reflection on his wife and family.  With that, I am in entire agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The family possibly are the sufferers ultimately but what Deputy Dillon does not appear to appreciate is that the remedy is already there, except that it must be exercised in a far more drawn out and expensive way.  Instead of getting in the purchase money direct, the Land Commission will have to institute proceedings separately for this sum.  If they do that and get a judgement, they can come in before the allocation of the purchase money.  In the end, the position would be much more expensive on the unfortunate wife and family than it would be if this section is passed because you would be avoiding the expense that would be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Dillon knows, if there is an amount due to a Department, that Department must proceed for that amount and recover it, if it is recoverable. That rule has been there since the foundation of the State.  If there was an amount due in one of these cases to the Land Commission, they would have to proceed for it, but it might well be that by the time they got their decree, it might not be worth the paper it was written upon, but the <Col N="1120" /> Auditor General will not allow them to write it off without making the attempt.</P>
    <P>This section is designed to extend the powers existing under section 13 of the 1939 Act and to provide a central procedure to deal with the cases I have dealt with, and indeed it is much more necessary to deal with the individual who is abroad and to deal with claims relating to a period before the appointed day than with the individual who is abroad and to deal with claims relating to a period before the appointed day than with the very odd character who comes back on to the land and has to be ejected by the Land Commission.  Even in the latter case, it will be far less expensive to go at the matter in this way than if the Land Commission were compelled to institute separate proceedings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary to me that the Minister should adopt the view of the Executive, that if you can short-circuit the courts, it is an admirable thing to do as it saves money. It is quite true to say that if you short-circuit the whole procedure of the court, you arrogate to the Land Commission what I imagine the Minister must have strenuously maintained in his professional days was the exclusive prerogative of the court.  Is that wise? I know that this is merely a tightening up of section 13 of the 1939 Act, as amended by section 13 of the 1953 Act.  Does the Minister observe the strange coincidence that it has its origin in section 13, as amended by section 13 of the second Act?  Thirteen is not usually a very lucky number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a matter of high principle but it is an unsound thesis for the Minister to advance that it is desirable, where you can save money, to short-circuit the courts.  I do see at once that, where you are dealing with an absentee owner, the business of issuing writs outside the jurisdiction does not appear to be a very desirable device.  I am thinking, however, of the head case, and God knows, any of us living in the country, particularly in the west, realise you are liable to come across a head case in the most unexpected places.  A family which has to live with a head case suffers enough without heavy penalties of a <Col N="1121" /> fiduciary character wrought upon it as a result of the head case acting as a head case.  Far from exciting our desire for revenge or hatred we should pity the head case and do our best to alleviate the circumstances of those who have the misfortune to have their destinies cast with him or her.</P>
    <P>I commend this suggestion to the Minister for Lands.  He is probably as familiar with instances of head cases as I am and he is probably moved to a sincere compassion for those who have to endure them.  With that in mind, perhaps the Minister would look at this between now and Report Stage, and if he can see his way to tempering the wind to the shorn lamb, I am sure he will.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The central idea of the section is to simplify the arrangements for disposal of default holdings.  There is a relaxation of the rigid control by the Minister for Finance in the matter of writing off arrears and costs.  Under the existing law, that is, section 20 of the Land Act, 1939, it is provided that <Col N="1123" /> the Land Commission must have possession of the default holding before they can resell it on compromise terms including a writing off of all or part of the arrears and costs.  It also reserves to the Minister for Finance the right to sanction every write-off.  In practice, a reasonable settlement is often made with a member of a defaulter's family and the technical necessity of insisting on obtaining possession merely delays matters and forces up costs.  As to paragraph (b) it is in the interest of more efficient administration that the Minister for Finance proposes to authorise the Land Commission to make their own settlements within reasonable limits to be fixed by the Minister for Finance from time to time.  This really gets rid of the red tape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very sensible provision, in my judgement, but I suggest to the Minister that he should look at section 38 again.  He is on the right lines in section 39 where he can get a settlement which does not involve protracted litigation and odds and ends may be written off.  He should have that general discretion within limits as suggested in paragraph (b).  He can use his wisest discretion in writing off incidental costs and getting the business closed.  I would be very happy to see paragraph (b) of section 39 attached to section 38, which would give the Minister discretion to pursue the purchase money for the statutory charges, or not, as he in his discretion thought suitable in the special circumstances of the case.  If the absentee from whom the lands were acquired were living in Chicago or Los Angeles, I do not see why the Land Commission should not recover the costs before remitting the money to Chicago or Los Angeles, but if the Minister's inspectors told him that a head case, or a sad case, was involved and the family had suffered great trouble already, I should like the Minister to have the discretion to say: &ldquo;They have had trouble enough. Write off these odds and ends.&rdquo;  That is the kind of discretion I would readily place in the hands of any Minister <Col N="1124" /> for Lands, in the conviction that it would be used in a humanitarian and sensible way.  Any of us who have experience will recognise the desirability of the global control of the Minister for Finance expressed in paragraph (b), but within that global control, the Minister for Lands should have the widest discretion to waive claims of that character.  I suggest he should seek a similar discretion in section 38.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the section is to fill a gap in the existing <Col N="1125" /> law.  It is proposed that on the partition of a commonage, the burdens, charges, etc., attaching to each undivided share shall transfer to the corresponding share in severalty.  The existing laws dealt with under the section are section 24 of the Land Act, 1939: fee simple purchased under the Land Acts; section 25 of the Land Act, 1950, which covers land dealt with under Forestry Acts and other lands not dealt with under Land Acts; and section 23 of the Land Act, 1953, which covers rights of commonage without fee simple.</P>
      <P>These sections do not provide, as simple justice would demand, that burdens and charges should transfer in an orderly manner to the appropriate partitioned parts of the commonage. The registrar in the case of registered land has no clear authority to amend the folios in a commonsense fashion, and this section is designed to deal with that situation.</P>
      <P>For instance, you have the rather absurd position under the existing law where there is a parent holding&mdash; and this is very common in congested areas&mdash;with perhaps undivided 56 shares of commonage and that commonage is being taken over by the Forestry Division or the Land Commission, and the old lady in the house has a charge against the parent holding for right of residence and support, that charge also attaches to the undivided 56 shares in the commonage. She could come in on the take-over of the commonage by the Land Commission. It is to deal with that situation that this section was devised.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan, earlier this evening, made use of some things he heard in East Galway over the weekend and gave us quite a long talk on the honourable purpose of Fine Gael in talking on the Bill.  I was in Loughrea over the weekend and I heard some things and I would like to know if there is any basis in truth for them.  I heard of a parcel of land not far from Loughrea owned by the Fine Gael Deputy for that area and which, under this section, would become land to be acquired by the Land Commission.  I understand that not only has that Deputy been unco-operative with the Land Commission but she has locked the gate of the field and denied a neighbouring farmer the right of way to bring his cattle out on the road.  I should like to know if there is any truth in this.</P>
      <P>Even though Deputy Ryan in my constituency took an interest in the Land Bill, I felt it was not altogether right for a Dublin Deputy to participate in the debate.  I should like some assurance from the Minister that the prolonged filibustering operation indulged in has not been to protect the rights of the Fine Gael Deputy for East Galway so as to enable her to jump the gun on the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>The proposals herein are very similar to section 39, except that they deal with the case in which the Land Commission make an advance to repay arrears as distinct from the ordinary case in which they seek a cash payment to recover them. The same principles of cutting out the expense of possession proceedings and relaxing finance control apply here. In this case, where there is a holding and a relative or a new man comes in to take it, the Land Commission can advance the purchaser the necessary money to meet the arrears on the holding which is being sold.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister will agree with me that the Land Commission, ejecting an existing tenant and installing an incoming tenant, appear to be cast in the role which used to be associated with the name of Greville in rural Ireland.  I have never heard of a case in all my experience of the Land Commission evicting a tenant and installing somebody else.  I cannot recall one single case.  Can the Minister recall one?  I <Col N="1133" /> have known of a case where people have given up a holding and it has been divided for the relief of congestion but I cannot remember a case where the Land Commission evicted a tenant and put in somebody else.  Has the Minister ever known a case in which the Land Commission evicted a tenant and put in somebody else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have known of a case in which they were on the point of doing so and the neighbours came to the rescue.  This section is designed also to deal with a different kind of case.  We have sometimes a case of abandoned land, particularly in isolated areas, where the tenant went away and left accumulated arrears of annuities.  As the law is, these arrears will have to be put down in cash by the neighbour or relative.  There is provision made here so that the Land Commission can make an advance to cover the arrears and enable the new man to purchase.  It does not arise very often but it is a useful provision and it is in ease of the purchaser when he comes along in cases of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I misunderstood the Deputy.  I had understood that in a case where the Land Commission evicted a man for non-payment of rent and where arrears had accumulated, the incoming tenant was given an advance by the Land Commission to pay off the arrears which the evicted tenant had accumulated, and that this was then added to the land annuity of the incoming tenant who was allowed to pay it off over the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If this is a proposal that where arrears have accumulated on a holding and a neighbour or relative or purchaser for value says: &ldquo;I will buy that holding at an auction but I cannot possibly put down the money for the land, plus arrears of land annuity outstanding&rdquo;, thus enabling the Land Commission to say: &ldquo;You can pay it <Col N="1134" /> on the annuity, pay it off with the outstanding instalments of the annuity&rdquo;, that is sensible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It proposes to facilitate the Land Commission in evicting the sitting tenant and facilitates a grabber who comes in to pay off by giving him an advance to enable him to grab. That seems to me to be an outrage in every sense of the word, and the kind of transaction I have never known the Land Commission to be associated with, if it is not exclusively for the relief of a purchaser of value for what is virtually abandoned land.</P>

      <P>A farm is abandoned, as the Minister says, and in a short time the Land Commission take it over and there is no accrued annuity.  The Land Commission take it over and appoint another tenant.  Should there be equities on that farm?  The reason I ask the Minister is that I know of an instance where a man who had a big family got a farm.  Subsequently he died.  His family sold everything in the place.  The farm was taken over by the Land Commission and given to a son subject to equities.  The family who had sold everything came back and sued the son who, because the farm was given to him subject to equities, had to pay out hundreds of pounds.  This was, I think, the result of a mistake by the Land Commission. There were no equities on the farm because it had been abandoned.  The Land Commission had taken it back and appointed another tenant.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission must be realistic and we know in rural Ireland that if a man is sold out by reason of arrears of annuities, there is not a neighbour within a hundred <Col N="1135" /> miles who will touch such a place.  This section is really designed to deal with cases where you have abandoned land or where a relative will take over in aid of the existing owner and that relative has not sufficient money to pay off the arrears and purchase the land. This device enables the Land Commission to make a second advance in respect of some lands.  Under existing law, once one advance is made, that is the total purchase.  Under this they can make a second advance for the purpose of enabling the relative, or new man, to take over and pay off the arrears.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the land is, as the Minister says, abandoned, surely the only responsibility the tenant should have is for any accrued annuities?  He should not have responsibility for anything else.  Why should the Land Commission appoint a tenant and put him in the position of being liable for debts which did not exist except in the imagination of some people?  Is there any way by which, when this section is being put into the Bill, that sort of thing can be stopped?  When it happened once and the courts decided there was a claim against the land, surely it can happen again and is there no way by which the Minister can ensure that only accrued annuities will be redeemable and chargeable against the new tenant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very technical field and it is difficult to give any kind of global opinion on all these kinds of cases.  Each case would hang on its own tail.  Normally if a holding were being sold for arrears of annuity, depending on the Land Commission, the information would be sent to the local Land Commission auctioneer and he would be supposed to put it up for sale.  He is supposed to get a realistic price for it, and the amount of that money attributed to the arrears should be taken by the Land Commission and the rest set aside for what Deputy Tully calls these people who would be entitled to certain equities. In other words, the owner or his relatives should theoretically come in <Col N="1136" /> for anything that was left over, after the Land Commission arrears of annuities and costs are deducted from the purchase money.  In actual fact, what happens is that, outside the question of abandoned land, and even in this case, a relative or neighbour comes along and the technical sale is theoretically gone through for the amount of arrears due and the new man or neighbour comes in.</P>
      <P>This section is designed to enable the Land Commission to make a second advance to cover these arrears in a case where a new man would not have the wherewithal to pay off the arrears, so it amounts to a second advance.  One could not, and I certainly could not at the moment without having another look at this matter, assure the House that this section could provide for all the types of case Deputy Tully gives, or could possibly arise.  It is a very technical field and would depend upon what happened in an individual case and how it was handled.  I shall have a look at what the Deputy said and consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Have I made my point clear?  This was not a question of somebody being sold out for arrears of annuity.  It was a case where a tenant died and left his wife and one or two children on the farm.  They sold everything and moved out.  Subsequently they notified the Land Commission that they were giving up possession. The Land Commission repossessed the farm and house and appointed the son of the former tenant as the new tenant.  The land was vested subject to equities which the court interpreted as being a share of that farm, and to go to each member of a very large family.  After the court case, which involved £1,600 to £1,700 the new tenant succeeded in getting on his feet many years later. Can the Minister ensure that under this particular section that sort of thing can be avoided in future, so that if somebody abandons a farm, there will not be any further claim on it&mdash;the new tenant will get a clean bill?</P>

I do not know if this provision would affect a case of that nature.  Coming down to fundamentals, if the man died, if he were the vested owner of these lands, then the Statute of Distribution under the intestacy laws would apply to his interest in that holding, and how the Land Commission would override that and substitute something to the exclusion of the other members of the family&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The purpose of the section is to remove restrictions on the classes of persons to whom lands already purchased for cash under the 1950 Act may be allotted, which, incidentally, we are repealing under the Schedule.  Section 22 (1) (c) of the Land Act of 1950, which is scheduled for repeal, as I have said, restricts cash purchase to lands required for migrants and for re-arrangement. Allottees of exchange holdings or rearranged holdings are known domestically as &ldquo;class (b) allottees&rdquo; because they are listed under &ldquo;(b)&rdquo; in the lists of persons or bodies mentioned in section 31 (1) of the Land Act of 1923, which is the main section governing the resale of untenanted land.</P>
      <P>Section 28 (12) of the 1950 Land Act provided a small escape clause by which lands found not to be required for class (b) could be disposed of to certain other classes.  The new proposal will release lands on hands from all the old restrictions and will allow them to be sold, if necessary, to any of the other classes: (a) uneconomic holders, (c) evicted tenants, (d) exemployees, (e) trustees, <i>et cetera</i>, (f) landless men, public bodies and miscellaneous. It is likely, however, that this release will be needed only to allow the Land Commission to dispose of some odd lots of surplus land.</P>
      <P>These legal doubts have arisen under the restrictive sections of the 1950 Land Act, now being repealed.  The Land Commission found they were not free&mdash;one case I recall was a parsonage &mdash;to dispose of lands.  This is to enable them to unload the few odd lots they have acquired under that section.</P>

      <P>The Minister is saying to himself that this provision worked very well, that because it worked so very well he wishes to extend it to a wider field in which he can use the <Col N="1139" /> procedure hereafter.  I think I am right in saying that this section is designed to apply exclusively to lands held at present by the Land Commission as a result of purchases by public auction. Hereafter, the Land Commission will be free to buy at public auctions land for a very much wider category of purposes than hitherto.  In the circumstances it would be only fair for the Minister to say: &ldquo;I appreciate the purpose for which Deputy Blowick brought this section before the Oireachtas. I now confess that the restrictions imposed in the 1950 Act have proved so successful in their restrictive sphere that I am now asking Dáil Éireann to use the provision in a much wider field to dispose of certain properties on hand for which we have ready purchase but which we could not put up for sale owing to the restrictions of the 1950 Act.  We foresee that in the future we shall be able to work this procedure much more widely&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If the Minister had said that, we on this side of the House would have replied: &ldquo;Well, better to learn late than not at all.&rdquo;  Surely the Minister feels in the light of his knowledge now that the strictures passed on Deputy Blowick at the time have been disproved and that the genial character of Deputy Blowick, of which we are at present deprived, reminds us constantly of his responsibility and of his excellent understanding of Land Commission needs.  Surely Deputy Blowick is entitled to that testimonial as the author of this new and revolutionary principle which has resolved a great many difficult cases and which, apparently, the Minister thinks can be used hereafter to resolve a great many more.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick and he represent the same constituency.  This, surely, would be a gracious gesture from one Deputy for South Mayo to another.  It might be a deathbed conversion, but at least it would prepare the Minister for his coming career on these benches: it would entitle him to say in Opposition: &ldquo;When I was Minister for Lands, I was never slow to pay a tribute to my predecessor in office&rdquo;.</P>

I think the Minister ought to have learned, in the course of this long, anxious debate, what many of us already know&mdash;that the soft answer turneth away wrath. It has been a source of gratification not only to the members of Deputy Blowick's Party but to those who were privileged to be his colleagues in Government that his colleague in representation in South Mayo&mdash;I do not know if you wish me to report progress, a Cheann Comhairle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of the Ardrahan dispensary has been a sore problem in the area for the past two years.  I should like to remind the House of the facts.  In living memory, Ardrahan always had a doctor in residence, even in the British time.  After that there were three doctors in the area: one in Ardrahan, one in Gort and one in Kinvara.  The Gort dispensary became vacant in 1962 when Dr. Fallon retired.  At that time in Ardrahan there were 173 medical card holders, in Gort 179 and in Kinvara, 213.  I should like the House to remember these figures because they are significant.  The Minister knows what happened, but the House does not, and I should like briefly to run through the events.</P>
      <P>In 1962 the doctor at Gort retired. In 1963 a motion was proposed at the county council to amalgamate the Ardrahan dispensary with Gort and Kinvara.  The reasons given at that time were, first, that the number of medical card holders in the Ardrahan area had gone down.  The second reason&mdash;and this, to my mind, is the meanest reason of all&mdash;was that by amalgamation of the three dispensaries the county council would save money. Surely the county council and the Minister cannot justify the saving of money when human life is at stake?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this was done without consulting any of the local people.  In fact, the only people consulted were the two doctors concerned.  When the decision of the county council became known, the local people formed a protest committee <Col N="1142" /> headed by their parish priest, Father O'Donoghue.  They got together and approached Senator Lahiffe, who had proposed a motion at the county council.  To give him his due, Senator Lahiffe told Father O'Donoghue: &ldquo;If you can convince me of the validity of your case, I will propose another motion to rescind the first one.&rdquo;  Apparently, he did that. Senator Lahiffe proposed a second motion, which was carried by a two-thirds majority.</P>
    <P>Then the matter passed on to the Minister for his decision.  The Minister decided to let the amalgamation take place at that time, on the ground that there were now only 146 medical card holders in the area as compared with 173 in 1962.  It is significant to note the large reduction in the number of medical cards.  I am told by the people in Ardrahan that there was a drive to abolish medical cards; in fact, the parish priest described it as a ruthless drive, completely unchristian. These were the figures produced at the time.  I understand there were a number of people in the area entitled to medical cards but who, for some reason or other, never applied for them.  Some people prefer to pay for the doctor, even if they can pay for nothing else.  I know of five such cases&mdash;three farm labourers and two old age pensioners.  I have the names if the Minister wishes to have them.  I am sure there were other such cases I am not aware of.  This proves that the figures issued by the council and the Minister were not true.</P>
    <P>The amalgamation of this area means, in fact, that the people are getting poorer service.  They have to pay increased car hire to get to the dispensary area, because there are parts of Ardrahan as much as 14 miles from Kinvara; and as Ardrahan has no night exchange, it makes it even more difficult.  The people say they suffer tremendous hardship.  I have a long list of signed statements, which I will give to the Minister if he wants them.  I think he has them.  I shall quote just two of them:</P>
    <P>I live within half a mile of the Ardrahan dispensary.  I am now in <Col N="1143" /> the Kinvara dispensary area.  On Sunday morning, 23rd of February last, my husband got suddenly ill. We rushed to Ardrahan for a doctor but there was none there.  We then tried Kinvara but there was no doctor there either.  We then rang Oranmore for Dr. O'Connor who was doing duty for Dr. Greene but he was not available.  We then contacted Dr. Marlborough of Gort who came some hours later.  My husband was then unconscious.  He was removed to hospital and died that night.  I regret that I could not have a doctor sooner for my husband as he could have been saved.  I am now left with one child of twelve months.</P>
    <P>I cannot say whether or not this man's life could have been saved if he had got medical attention in time, but this I can say: his wife and the people of Ardrahan believe he could have been saved.</P>
    <P>I have another letter, also signed, which reads:</P>
    <P>On Sunday 24th May at about 5.30 p.m.  I came home from my sister's house and found that the baby was ill.  About 6 p.m. I and the baby and mother got into the car to go to Ardrahan to Dr. Joyce. He was not there.  Dr. Joyce's girl rang Kinvara for Dr. Greene and he was not there.  I told her to ring Gort for Dr. Marlborough and this took over a half an hour ringing between both doctors.  Dr. Marlborough was at home and I went back to Gort to him.  This took over another half hour.  He examined the baby and told us to go straight to Galway hospital and that took nearly three-quarters of an hour before the child was taken in to hospital.  I arrived there about 8.45 p.m.  I feel that the child could have been saved by going to hospital straight from Ardrahan.</P>
    <P>To my mind these letters make shocking reading.  I have a complete list of them and I will let the Minister have them.  Surely no economy can justify the loss of life?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> I should like the Minister to note that these hardships occurred while the doctor was still in residence in Ardrahan. Surely the position is bound to be worse when he goes to Gort?</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister of a letter written in regard to this matter by the Irish Consul General in Boston, in reply to whom the Minister's secretary wrote:</P>
    <P>It appears that the main body of objectors are persons who wish to avail of the services of the dispensary medical officer in his private capacity but who are too few in number to provide him with the private practice that would be sufficient to induce him to remain in the area.</P>
    <P>Let us be fair to the doctor.  Why would the doctor remain in the area when he is given a large populous area adjoining his dispensary and also a bonus of £250 per annum and the promise of a new dispensary residence reported to cost £11,000?  That would not induce anyone to stay in the area. I should like to remind the House that at the time Dr. Joyce applied, I am told, there were at least 20 other applicants for the area.</P>
    <P>To say that the council will save money by this move is very misleading. The two doctors involved are to get an extra £250 per annum.  A new house, costing approximately £11,000, has to be built in Gort.  Besides, there will be extra hospital bills.  When people find they cannot get a doctor in the area, they will go straight to the hospital, and the hospital will have to take them in.</P>
    <P>It seems to me there is a certain amount of discrimination being practised against the people of Ardrahan. I have a list of dispensary areas, showing area and acreage, secured since Ardrahan was to be abolished.  The figures are: Ardrahan, 31,843 acres; population, 2,191; Avoca, County Wicklow, 17,758; population, 2,178; Ballinameen, County Roscommon, 28,769 acres; population 2,192; Tulla-roan, County Kilkenny, 18,990 acres; population 1,113; Glasson, County Westmeath, 24,794 acres; population <Col N="1145" /> 2,307; Clonbur, County Galway, 31,426 acres; population 658.  In all of these cases, the Ardrahan dispensary area is the largest and there are only two of these with a larger population, a little over 100 in these two.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why Ardrahan has to be picked on as an example.  When all of these other areas can be filled, surely Ardrahan is as entitled as the rest of them?  The dispensary should be restored to Ardrahan because the county council recommended it.  A motion was proposed, seconded and passed to restore the dispensary.  An examination of the case and of the hardships that occurred since the dispensary was abolished proves that the plan is inoperable.  It will lead only to further hardship and even further loss of life.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister whether or not he has the power to abolish this district. I understand that under the Health Act he may alter the boundaries of dispensaries but I doubt if he can abolish them completely.  The only people consulted about the whole business were the doctors concerned. The people of Ardrahan were left completely in the dark until it was a <i>fait accompli</i>.  The making of the Order was preceded by a drive to abolish a number of medical cards in an effort to justify the amalgamation of the dispensary area.  The only people to benefit, as far as I can see, are the doctors.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister's telling me that there is another doctor available.  I know there is another doctor in Gort.  He has been there for years.  He has given long and very good service to the people there.  He is now an old man and cannot be expected to get up at all hours of the night to travel a wide area to attend patients.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister will not receive a deputation from the area.  Is it because he does not want the facts or because, having once made a decision, he wants to dig in his heels and stand over it, right or wrong?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join in the <Col N="1146" /> appeal to have the Ardrahan dispensary restored.  It is not in my County Council area but, like Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins, I am one of the T.D.s for the East Galway constituency and I realise the position.  The Minister made an Order in 1963, after having been requested by the Galway County Council to have this dispensary abolished.  I cannot recollect, offhand, how long it was before that date in April that this came before the Galway County Council but I see now, when there is a by-election in East Galway, that political propaganda is being made of this affair.  At the time the Health Act was passed by Fianna Fáil certain people were saying it was costting too much.  These people were shouting about the high cost but when there was a dispensary vacant and the Minister's experts said that instead of having three doctors now looking after the area two would do the job at a saving of at least £1,000 per annum the very people who were most vocal at that time about saving money are the very people who are now most vocal to have the dispensary restored. In Galway County Council, Fianna Fáil have a majority.  We were always looked upon by the Opposition as the squandermania Party.  I support this appeal and I support every progressive step for the good of the people of my constituency or my area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this matter was first mooted at the Galway County Council a resolution was put before the members. I am a councillor for the Ballinasloe area.  Deputy Geoghegan is a Councillor for the Connemara area and Deputy Coogan is a Councillor for Galway area.  We were not concerned as there was a local Councillor, Senator Lahiffe&mdash;he cannot speak in this House though his name was mentioned by Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins&mdash;and a Fine Gael Councillor Lambert.  Not alone did the council unanimously agree to abolish the Ardrahan dispensary but the Fianna Fáil and the Fine Gael councillors for the area proposed and seconded that, as a saving, this dispensary be abolished.  Naturally, we being from different areas, agreed and the matter went through.  There was <Col N="1147" /> no such thing as a protest and no notice was taken of it.  It was published in the local papers including the <i>Connaught Tribune:</i> everybody reads that.</P>
    <P>After some time had elapsed, it was realised that the step imposed a terrible hardship on the people of that area. I have here the same letters as Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins has.  I got further letters since.  On 24th January last, the two local councillors who in the first case proposed and seconded that the dispensary be abolished in order to save money for the rate-payers came along and put down a motion that it be restored.  I read all the letters I got.  I read the cases of hardship.  I have them here.  I had deputations to my house at all hours of the day and night.  I was one of the councillors and a TD for the constituency who voted to have it restored.  That is the reason why I am adding my appeal to the former appeal in this House tonight to have this dispensary restored.  That is as high as I can put it.</P>
    <P>I am behind the people because in Galway County Council we did not realise at the time that we were imposing a hardship.  I would ask for a truce on this matter.  Things have happened and things have been said that should not have happened nor been said.  There were protest meetings. Deputations with placards have come to the Galway County Council and banged on the windows.  I believe that if some of the things done and said had not been done and said we might have got a lot further in this case.  I am willing to forget all that and to forget the past.  I am behind the people in this appeal to have the dispensary restored and I should like it to be done in a nice and quiet and orderly way.</P>
    <P>We had a further proposal before us to amalgamate two other dispensaries in the Connemara area, Clonbur No. 1 and No. 2.  The council, having seen the <i>faux pas</i> made in the first instance, unanimously agreed to ask the Minister not to amalgamate these two dispensaries. He has not done so or forced us to <Col N="1148" /> do so since.  I appeal to him now to reconsider the matter.</P>
    <P>I know of the letters Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins has read as I have similar copies in my possession which are also signed.  I should like an investigation of the cases of the people who made these complaints.  They claim they did not get a proper hearing when they came before the Council and that the complaints they made were not explained to them.  I think they should at least have got a reply to say that this or that did or did not happen. We are all human beings and we cannot afford the loss of a life.  I am not saying they are right or wrong but if there is an explanation for the complaints these people have made I am sure it would be satisfactory.  I again appeal to the Minister to reconsider the matter and if possible to have this dispensary restored.</P>

      <P>It is right that I should put this matter in its proper perspective.  What we are concerned with here is the provision that must be made under the Health Act, 1963, for medical care for those entitled to it under that Act, that is to say, for those who are medical card holders.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins put before this House this evening two moving cases, moving, that is, if the statements contained in the letters which the Deputy received should be true, substantiated and relevant.  I should like to put the facts before the House in both these cases because when I received these complaints, I asked that they should be investigated. These complaints have been investigated by the county manager of Galway, where the County Council is the health authority.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1149" /> The first is a case in which a widow said that her husband had become ill on a Sunday morning in February. She sent a messenger, his brother apparently, to Ardrahan&mdash;to Ardrahan remember&mdash;to contact the doctor there and bring him to attend the patient. The first thing to note about this case is that it was not a medical card case; it was a case of a private person going to his family physician in Ardrahan&mdash; Ardrahan, where the abolition of the dispensary is being challenged, not Gort or Kinvara.  The doctor in Ardrahan was not at home to his private patient&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Or to a medical card holder either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He was resident in Ardrahan but he did not happen, unfortunately, to be at home.  So it was suggested by his housekeeper that the messenger should contact the doctor whom the Ardrahan doctor had asked to act for him on that Sunday.  The messenger refused to do this and endeavoured to contact somebody else. He is also alleged to have phoned a doctor in Oranmore, a doctor who denies receiving the phone message. Ultimately, at 11 a.m., just an hour after the messenger had arrived at the house of the Ardrahan doctor, the doctor the messenger had been told was acting for the Ardrahan doctor, met this messenger and went to the house of the sick man.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate patient died; but he had with him the doctor who had been rejected by the messenger in the first instance.  This doctor summoned the ambulance and had the patient brought to the hospital where, as I have said, he died.  It has been reported to me that the case was, in fact, hopeless from the outset&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The next case was the case of a baby whose father arrived home at 5.30 and found that the baby was ill.  He took the baby with its mother, got the car and went to Ardrahan to the doctor there.  The doctor was absent but he had requested another doctor to do duty for him.  This doctor's house was contacted and he was not there but the housekeeper of the Ardrahan doctor contacted another doctor&mdash;he was contacted by telephone &mdash;and he immediately agreed to attend the baby.  He arrived at the baby's house at about 6.20, less than one hour after the father of the baby had returned home to find the baby ill.  I am not mentioning names and therefore I may appear to be a little circumlocutory. Within less than an hour, the baby, whose parents lived some distance from Ardrahan, was seen by the doctor, and he had the baby removed to hospital without delay.</P>
      <P>Again, unfortunately, the baby died but in neither of these cases was it a fact that a doctor could not be contacted in Ardrahan so this could not be responsible for the deaths.  They were entirely due to the illnesses from which both patients suffered.</P>

      <P>Why do not those who have been writing those letters tell the truth?  It is not the case that the people behind this agitation are concerned with the position of the medical card holders.  I have here a number of cases, 14 in all, and of these not more than four or five are medical card holders.</P>

      <P>Not only that, but in no case can it be shown that their deaths or inconveniences were due to the fact that there was not a doctor in Ardrahan.  Because there was a doctor resident there.  In fact, so far as the abolition of the Ardrahan dispensary is concerned, it is in no way responsible for these complaints.  The main fact is this: it is quite clear from the figures that those who might be eligible under the Health Act to avail of the dispensary service are much too few to support three doctors; and that, even with two doctors, the workload on each is comparatively light&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But I have taken the precaution of having the <Col N="1152" /> cases she mentioned investigated and most of them have been found to be flimsy cases, flimsy in the sense that they are not relevant to the complaint which has been made that because of the abolition of the dispensary district, a doctor was not available in Ardrahan and the patients suffered.  In fact, it was the other way round.  The doctor concerned resides in Ardrahan, and the cases where fatalities occurred were hopeless from the beginning.</P>
