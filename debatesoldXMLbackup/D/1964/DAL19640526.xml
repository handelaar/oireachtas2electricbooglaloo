      <P>The Central Statistics Office publishes enumerations of turkeys in January and in June and an estimate of the output&mdash;or production &mdash;of turkeys in respect of each year. The enumerations serve as bases for the estimates of annual output.  I am satisfied that these estimates are realistic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health (a) the date when the planning of a new St. Laurence's Hospital started, (b) the date of starting to plan a new nurses' home, and (c) the amount of money expended on these works to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>While various tentative schemes for a new St. Laurence's Hospital had been under consideration for some years and a certain amount of preliminary planning had been carried out in relation to such schemes, effective planning work commenced only after final approval was given to a specific scheme in June, 1953.  As I indicated in my reply to a question from the Deputy on 12th of this month, plans for a new nurses' home were included in the plans for the new hospital.  Tentative proposals in relation to a nurses' home were also made by the hospital authority in March, 1960, as part of an outline scheme which envisaged the continued location of the hospital on the present site.</P>
      <P>I have ascertained that the total amount paid to date by the hospital authority in respect of fees to consultants for planning work in connection with these projects is £65,367 4s. 4d.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if in preparing propaganda intended to discourage excessive smoking he will consider pinpointing and <Col N="5" /> underlining the importance of frequent X-rays in the case of heavy smokers, and point out that only cases of lung cancer detected in the very early stages are capable of effective treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that if a person cannot desist from heavy smoking, he would be very well advised to have the condition of his lungs checked regularly.  However, my Department's propaganda on smoking is designed to discourage people from becoming or remaining heavy smokers. I fear that, should the Deputy's suggestion relating to this propaganda be accepted, the impression might be given that it was safe for a person to smoke heavily as long as he had frequent chest X-rays, which is not, of course, the case.  Separate propaganda on the value of chest X-rays is conducted by the National Mass-Radiography Association.  A leaflet widely distributed by the Association makes it clear that mass X-ray shows up other lung conditions as well as tuberculosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the certain diagnosis of really early cancer of the lung by X-rays alone is nearly impossible and that, even if it is diagnosed early, the only cure for it is a major operation requiring the removal of the lung?  Even if this operation is carried out, it is unsuccessful in the cure of cancer in a big percentage of cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <P>The income tax organisation has been under constant review by the Revenue Commissioners in recent years and substantial measures have been taken by them to modernise and improve working conditions in income tax offices and to relieve generally the pressure of work on the staffs concerned. The growth, however, in the number of taxpayers resulting mainly from wage increases is tending to outstrip the effects of the measures I have mentioned and is presenting accommodation as well as certain recruitment difficulties.  The operation of the turnover tax also entails extra work in the tax districts.  I have before me recent proposals from the Revenue Commissioners for the provision of additional clerical staff in the income tax offices.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the proposals made in the recently published Report on Pilot Area Development which were discussed by the Taoiseach and myself on 19th May with representatives of the Charlestown Committee.  While a number of suggestions put forward by the Charlestown representatives were discussed at length, no indication was given that they were dissociating themselves from the proposals.  It is not, of course, unusual for committees to express dissatisfaction when their proposals are not fully accepted and statements released to the press after such discussions do not always conform with the impressions created in the course of the discussions.</P>

Does he agree that Appendix A and Appendix B of the publication to which he refers, namely the Report on Pilot Area Development, submitted by the Rev. Fr. McDyer are in disagreement with the general report of the Committee inasmuch as they recommend specific things to be done while the other is only a generalisation?</P>

I find it impossible as Minister&mdash;the position would be a very happy one if it were otherwise&mdash;to concede every point made by the many organisations coming forward with proposals of one kind or another.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.  CIE may under transport legislation terminate its liability to maintain accommodation works such as fences, drains, etc. when a railway line is formally abandoned provided that at least one month's notice is given to the owner or occupier of the adjoining land.  The Board is, however, obliged to pay compensation to the adjoining owner or occupier for all such injury or damage, if any, as he may sustain by reason of the cesser of such liability.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether recoupment grants are payable to local authorities for snow clearance and sanding against ice-skidding; and, if so, the amounts paid to each local authority for either of these purposes in 1962-63 and 1963-64, and the basis on which the payments were calculated.</P>

      <P>Grants are payable for this work in the normal course in the case of main roads.  Local authorities charged with the maintenance of main roads receive an annual Main Road Upkeep Grant from the Road Fund at the rate of 50 per cent of their expenditure on such maintenance, including any expenditure that may be incurred on the treatment of these roads to deal with snow and ice conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the exceptionally severe winter conditions of 1962/63, and in deference to the representations of a number of county councils whose <Col N="23" /> areas were very severely affected, I made arrangements for a special grant in respect of snow clearance work on main roads, at the rate of 75 per cent of the excess expenditure incurred by local authorities on this work, that is, expenditure over and above the normal maintenance provision in respect of these roads for that year.  While final returns of this expenditure have not yet been submitted in all cases, it is estimated that the additional charge falling on the Road Fund as a result of this concession will be about £34,000.</P>
    <P>No special grants for such work were allocated in respect of last winter.</P>

    <P>This resolution is necessary because with the passing of the Firearms Bill, certain charges have to be provided by Financial Resolution.  As Deputies are aware, there is a new tax on airguns and there is also some change as regards shotgun licences.  The change there is that a man can get a licence for a shotgun&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Up to this a farmer could get a shotgun licence at a fee of 10/- to shoot over his own land.  He can now get that same licence for a nominee.  These are the main changes. Anyway, there is an extra charge, and, therefore, this resolution is necessary.</P>

      <P>That for the purpose of any Act of the present session to charge and impose certain duties of customs and inland revenue (including excise), to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provisions in connection with finance it is expedient to authorise that to redeem borrowings and interest thereon in respect of capital services, there shall be charged annually on the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof a sum of £1,384,304 in the twenty-nine successive financial years and a sum of £1,588,036 in the thirty successive financial years commencing in each case with the financial year ending on the 31st day of March, 1965.</P>
      <P>This is necessary because there is a charge on public funds in the redemption of debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have something to say in relation to the new law on stamp duties which has recently been prepared and published.  The Minister will appreciate I am speaking without having had an opportunity of reading it in detail.  I must confess that after all the queries I raised with the Minister in this House with reference to it by way of question and by way of speech on various Budgets and Finance Bills, I thought it would have been a nice little gesture if the Minister had sent me one when it was published and then I would have had more opportunity of reading it.  He did not, and it was only last night I realised it had been published and I got it this morning.  Therefore I have not had the opportunity of considering it in the detail I should like before making certain remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a most comprehensive document and one in respect of which the Revenue Commissioners are to be congratulated.  The manner of publication by a loose-leaf system so that one can take out pages as they become obsolete and replace them with other pages has everything to commend it. <Col N="36" /> However, it is a pity, and I mention this not in any way to denigrate the value of this but for the purpose of considering it in relation to the get-up of similar documents in the future, that in the actual printing of these loose-leaf documents of this sort, something is not done to show on the head of each page the date up to which it brings the law.  There will be a difficulty in future as new pages are put in and we will not know the date on which these books are made out.  I mention it not, as I say, in any way to denigrate the value of this because it is one of the best things done by the Revenue Commissioners in a long time. I understand it is proposed to do it on the same basis and I should like to keep it on a system that is clear.</P>
    <P>I have had only a short time to examine it, but I cannot see anything to show me the date up to which the law has been included in the volume. We have the Finance Act, 1963, and, therefore, we know it is an accurate statement of the law as it is up to 30th July, 1963.  Obviously, it was with the printers for a long time and, for that reason, it does not include the Finance Act which was passed at the end of 1963, so it cannot be the calendar year 1963.  Personally, I should like something at the top of each page to show 1963 issue or 1964 issue, or whatever it may be.  This is something which will go on for many years and it will be very helpful if we could know the years in which a particular page has been issued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Deputy had not the opportunity of putting this more minutely before now.  If he looks at the preface, he will see that the volume contains both those Acts with amendments effected by the statutes enacted in the period ending with the commencement of the Finance Act, 1963.  It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>Unless the contrary intention has been expressed, the provisions of the various Acts, which have been included, operated as from the dates of passing of those Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention is that any future amendments that will be sent for insertion <Col N="37" /> in the book will bear the date in each case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that statement mean that the Acts will be scheduled? I am aware that the various Finance Acts are scheduled.  I saw that, but it did not state that it is the law up to 30th July, 1963.  Is that what is intended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

It is desirable, if we are to do this in relation to customs, and in relation to death duties, to have on the corner of each page the date, say, 30/7/63, when they were issued.

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>A matter has been brought to my attention and I am not sure on which section of the Bill it is appropriate.  Had the matter been drawn to my attention earlier, I would have framed an amendment.  I want to bring the matter before the Minister at this stage.  It might be possible to draft an amendment for the Report Stage.  The matter to which I refer deals with industrial buildings allowances. These allowances, as the Minister is probably aware, were first given in the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1956, and provide for relief against tax in respect of all industrial buildings.  Hotels were specifically included.</P>
      <P>At that time let property was taxed under Schedule A.  The Finance Act of last year brought all such property under Schedule D.  The letting of houses and provisions of flats were in that respect recognised as an industry. I understand the Revenue authorities do not allow the industrial buildings allowances to be set off in respect of the capital expenditure on flats.  It might be easier to give a specific example.</P>
      <P>I have in mind a case where a house was purchased for a sum of £4,500. At least the expenditure on it would be £4,500.  Of this sum, £3,000 approximately represented the amount required to recondition the house and a sum of £1,500 was regarded as the amount required to convert it into flats.  The first figure, that is the sum of £3,000 or the amount spent on reconditioning the house, has been disallowed in total by the Exchequer.  The second amount of £1,500 should, I think, be eligible for an industrial buildings allowance but, I understand, that the Exchequer do not regard it as so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that Schedule A tax on the property is £20, but the total tax under Schedule D is approximately £200.  As the Minister is aware, under legislation passed in recent years, there has been a very considerable conversion, particularly of old houses, into flats or multiple dwellings. To that extent, it has made a contribution towards alleviating the housing problems <Col N="39" /> as well as reconstructing old and large houses into dwellings of a more habitable and suitable size to meet present requirements.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the question of considering the industrial building allowances might be widened in scope to include the type of work I have mentioned, which is at present outside the ambit of that relief.  Expenditure in relation to this work is naturally considerable and the persons concerned, as well as bearing the increase in taxation which has occurred, have also to face the problem of meeting the greater expenditure involved in the conversion of these houses.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me that the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956, should be extended in order to cover the type of cases involved in the example I have mentioned and which, to a very considerable extent, involve not merely capital expenditure but a form of investment which is of a desirable character and a form of expenditure which has many advantages, not least the one which I have mentioned&mdash;assisting in the provision of dwellings for those in need of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Deputy's suggestion is that we should extend the provisions of the Industrial Buildings Act to cover business premises and perhaps even flats.  That, of course, has been considered.  I discussed the matter with deputations of traders but did not find it possible to adopt it.  It may be done some time, but we have not yet reached the stage where we can do more than consider it.  It would have to be done on a different basis from that suggested by the Deputy, as I feel most Deputies will agree.</P>
      <P>A factory, because of the shaking it gets from machinery, does not last as long as a building used for purely commercial purposes, or as long as a building converted into flats, because of the different conditions obtaining. I can assure the Deputy we have considered the problem on a number of occasions but have not found it possible to move in the direction he suggests.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In previous years I spoke at some length on this section but I do not propose to do so this year. This is the section under which we are renewing for a further year tax legislation at present in force and it gives us fairly wide scope.  I am availing of the section for the purpose of pointing out to the Minister the increasing extent to which he is relying on wage and salary earners, persons paying income tax under Schedule E, for tax revenue, and of pointing out to him that the relative increase in the tax burden of wage and salary earners is gravely inequitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to point out to him that wage and salary earners are taxed under the most severe, rigid and exacting section of our tax laws, that they are the only section of the community who have no way whatever out of the income tax net.  The rule as to expenses which may be charged by wage and salary earners against assessable income is one which has been condemned time and again by the courts as inequitable. <Col N="41" /> There is a very obvious amendment of the expenses rule which would have the effect of alleviating the justifiable sense of grievance under which wage and salary earners labour, yet the Minister persistently refuses to make that change.</P>
    <P>I wish to renew my protest.  We are here renewing the existing personal allowances for income tax purposes. Allowances are granted to individuals for their own subsistence and that of their children.  These personal allowances are considerably out of date. They are very much out of tune with the times in which we live, very much out of tune with the rapid rate of inflation to which our economy is at present being subjected.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Income Tax which sat for a period of many years and issued several painstaking, detailed reports, with many recommendations, most of which have not been implemented, recommended a change in approach to these personal allowances.  For budgetary reasons, the Minister has not seen fit to accept these recommendations.  I wish to point out to the Minister that the personal allowance for a married man and his wife in 1938 stood at £225.  It is easily provable that today's pound, in terms of 1938 values, is worth precisely 6/8, and if one were to be logical and consistent, the 1938 personal allowance of £225 would now be exactly £675.  In fact it is £372.</P>
    <P>They are very simple figures, easily understandable by even lay people. This type of income, as distinct from that of the corporate taxpayer, is more and more being relied on for tax revenue.  The individual earner, under PAYE, is left with no way out of the tax net.  It is true to say that the PAYE taxpayer is, broadly speaking, the person who is also paying indirect taxation at a very high rate.  Indeed, today, not only is he being subjected to regressive indirect taxes on his consumption but there are concealed indirect taxes such as one to which I referred here last week on the Transport Bill&mdash;the indirect tax on Dublin citizens' bus fares.  It is a cardinal principle of taxation that the tax <Col N="42" /> burden should lie on the shoulders most readily capable of bearing it.  It is true that in this country wage earners and salary earners are subjected to inequitable taxation.  They are expected to pay direct and indirect tax far more than their share of the national cake warrants.  The Minister has yet again, in this year's Budget, failed to appreciate that viewpoint.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer at this stage and that is a matter about which Deputy Cosgrave has been speaking in another context&mdash;Schedule A taxation.  The Income Tax Commission have recommended substantially the abolition of Schedule A taxation on the residential occupier of his own home.  Schedule A tax is an archaic survival from Ricardo's theory on economic rent from discredited 19th century economists.  The theory that a home owner has a cash income from the ownership of his home in which he lives is one which, in today's context, is quite absurd.  It is a theory which was of great advantage to property owners in the past.  The Minister happily has largely removed that advantage.  In section 10 of today's Bill, the Minister is admittedly&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy really relevant to section 1?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 1, we are providing in subsection (3) that the several statutory and other provisions which were in force on the 5th day of April, 1964, shall be implemented. That includes the various Schedules to the Income Tax Act, 1918.  In that context, I suggest I am relevant.  However, in so far as I have referred to section 10, I have done so merely in passing because it has a certain relevance to the argument I am now making.  In section 10, the Minister is removing some of the more absurd features of this archaic tax.  He is removing the feature whereby he was in the past losing on the swings what he was gaining on the roundabouts&mdash; the position where assessments were being raised on the one hand and cancelled on the other at great expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> We are now left with the position that the only persons effectively paying tax under Schedule A are the residential occupiers of their own homes. That is the position despite the recommendation of our Income Tax Commission, which recommendation has been treated with next to contempt by the Minister.  In Britain, under a Tory Government, this tax on the home owner has been abolished.  We are still saddled with it.  If the Minister came along and said to me that, for budgetary reasons, he is unable to make any concession on this score, I should at least see the force of that argument. But the Minister, on doctrinaire grounds, has attempted to justify this absurd tax and I urge him to press his advisers to take another look at that antiquated document.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the principal argument for retaining any of these provisions that we have at the moment with regard to expense&mdash;not giving more generous expenses or leaving the Schedule A tax&mdash;is that they are needed.  If we had money to spare and did not know what to do with it, perhaps we would be tempted to abolish the Schedule A tax although I would be prepared to argue that it is as fair as some of the taxes which we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Things being as they are, and all of these being needed for budgetary reasons, if we were to be more liberal about expenses or abolished the Schedule A tax there would have to be some taxation in lieu.  Probably, the only thing to do would be to raise the standard rate of income tax so that we would not have done much good for anybody.  The Deputy is hardly fair when he says we ignored the recommendations of the <Col N="44" /> Income Tax Commission.  We have adopted at least half of the recommendations. I said, in the beginning, when the report was published, that the Government intended to deal with them over a period&mdash;when there would be time to consider them, time to adopt them and an opportunity to adopt them as far as financial considerations are concerned.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Before section 2 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.  Income Tax shall be assessed on a person engaged in rearing broiler chickens under Schedule B and not under Schedule D.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill, I dealt with this question of the broiler chicken.  There is really very little I can add to it.  It seems to me that the case the Minister made was that he was sorry that the law was such that the Revenue Commissioners had to administer it and had to collect the money.  Of course, the Revenue Commissioners have to administer the law. They are not to be blamed for collecting the tax if the law so states it should be collected.  That is no answer. The Minister is in the position of being able to change the law.  Let me agree at once that the wording of this amendment would not be sufficient. One would have to have a very much more detailed and longer drafting.  It is quite enough to hang one's hat upon in relation to the matter at issue.</P>
      <P>The production of broiler chickens is, after all, another method of husbandry from the land and it is a more modern method.  I thought, in present circumstances, one of our aims and objects was to make our agriculture, as well as our industry, use more modern methods.  What is the sense of encouraging people to use more modern methods, on the one hand, if, on the other hand, we put a penal tax on them when they do so? That, in effect, is what the Minister says is the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="45" /> I also feel that this should be amended because the smallholder is one of the people who is obviously going to find it more and more difficult to manage in the future.  Any type of intensified production on a smallholding is something that should be encouraged.  The rearing of broiler chickens is such an intensified production and on that account it is wrong that it should be penalised by the law, as it is at present, which requires taxation of it under Schedule D instead of under Schedule B.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the point that the Minister says it could be carried on in a town.  It is not beyond the wit of the draftsman to provide a schedule that will exempt the actual part of the husbandry on the farm and will not exempt it from taxation under Schedule D when in fact, as in a town, there is no Schedule D.  That is a bad argument because it is easy to draft something like that with the resources at the draftsman's disposal.  This is one of the most modern methods of using intensified production and as such should be encouraged rather than penalised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is probably as clear on this as I am.  If profits on the rearing of broilers arise from the occupation of land, then I think the person appeals to the Special Commissioners and probably wins his point and would be assessed under Schedule B.  Of course if he is not occupation of land, he does not succeed and has to pay on the profits. If I am right in my interpretation of the law, is it not better to leave it as it is?  If we were to adopt the amendment or what Deputy Sweetman intends by the amendment&mdash;I do not want to pin him to the wording of it &mdash;it would mean, actually, I think, that the person who rears broilers on a farm would be at least theoretically subject to paying tax on Schedule D but the person who rears broilers not on a farm would not have to pay tax at all.  There is certainly a bit of difficulty that we must try to get over.  I should first, however, like the Special Commissioners to decide what the law should be in this case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister remarked, it is somewhat difficult to follow the precise effect of these sections. I had hoped the Minister might be able to give details of the actual effect of the concessions that have been granted.  As one who over a number of years made representations on successive Finance Bills and on other occasions during discussions here, on behalf of those sections which I think everybody recognises are among the weaker sections of the community&mdash; elderly persons living on some form of fixed income, either pensions or partly pension and partly income derived from investments as a result of money put by and invested during their working lives&mdash;I think it is correct to say that no sections&mdash;or certainly few sections&mdash;of the community have been so seriously affected by the general drop in the value of money as pensioners and retired persons living on fixed incomes.</P>
      <P>Those who are covered by the sections to which we are now referring are persons whose income, in general, is above that covered by State social welfare services and while otherwise, if they are better off than other sections of the community, their plight is still in most cases difficult and in some cases serious.  Because of their age, in most cases they are beyond the time when it is possible for them to work and in any event there are relatively few opportunities available to elderly people to secure part-time employment to supplement their income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concessions granted are generally welcomed but they are regarded as inadequate, particularly in view of the rise in the cost of living.  Of course the general tendency for prices to rise has resulted in persons living on pensions or fixed incomes finding that, unlike other sections in the community <Col N="48" /> who have got wage and salary increases, in most cases their incomes remained fixed.  Although on some occasions certain small reliefs have been granted, in the main, a great number of retired persons are persons on fixed income such as pensioners. They find their income, from whatever source, remains static while costs of every kind continue to rise.  Because of their age, these people are ineligible, on the one hand, to participate in, say, voluntary health insurance and because of the level of their income, are ineligible for any, or certainly for most, of the State welfare schemes in the sense that they are not eligible for old age pension and are generally regarded as outside the scope of the Health Acts.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister what exactly is the effect, say, of the relief in respect of a person on a certain income limit.  The view that has been expressed generally over the years is that the total income which is allowed and which stands in this country at a figure of £600 a year should be increased.  That has been the case that has been made in the past on the ground that the value of money has dropped since that income limit was fixed and, indeed, in recent years in Britain it was brought up to £800 and subsequently in the last few years to £900 a year, while here the figure has remained at the £600 level for quite a number of years.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the view that has been expressed in this House and that has been expressed, I have no doubt, to the Minister by the pensioners' organisations and certainly to myself and other Deputies, is that that figure should be raised.  Instead of that, the Minister has introduced the allowances provided for in sections 2 and 3 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Quite recently an article was printed in the <i>Irish Independent</i> dealing with the concessions granted in the Budget to elderly persons and subsequently a letter was published which set out the figures applicable at present, say, in Britain, to persons of 65 years of age or over and the comparable allowances which will be granted here in the case of persons of the same age.  I need not quote the figures because I have no <Col N="49" /> doubt they are available to the Minister and to the Revenue Commissioners but I would be interested to hear from the Minister what precisely the tax concessions will be under the sections and what improvement has been brought about in respect of a taxpayer affected by these provisions compared with the position before their introduction, in other words, what tax he or she will be liable for this year as compared with last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware &mdash;because the Deputy always took a very keen interest in this matter: he has raised it every year on the Finance Bill&mdash;the present position is that an old person can get the maximum relief, that is, one-fourth, if his total income happens to be £600.  He gets one-fourth of the total income up to £600 but when he goes beyond £600 it begins to tail off again and when he comes to about £860 of total income under the existing law, he gets no relief at all.  The Deputy, last year, was pressing that it was very unfair that we should tail it off, as it were. So, I thought it better to do away with that tailing off business this year and this means now that a person drawing unearned income, it does not matter about the amount, will get relief on the first £600 as if it were earned income, that is, one-fourth relief of the first £600.  In addition to that, a person over 65 might have certain investment income and he might also have earned income.  For instance, he could have a pension which would be regarded as the same as earned income.  He could now, under this clause, get relief on £600 of unearned income and relief on £1,400 of earned income, so that he would get the full relief that is due to the ordinary working person of £500 altogether.  That is what the section amounts to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before section 4 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;4. (1) An individual who is a widow and who has the charge and care of any child of hers and who, in the manner prescribed by the Income Tax Acts makes a claim in that behalf and makes a return in the prescribed form of her total income, <Col N="52" /> shall for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of her assessable income for the purpose of income tax be allowed a deduction from the amount of her total income whether earned or unearned of a sum equal to one-fourth of the amount of that income subject to a maximum deduction of £500.</P>
    <P>(2) In this section the expression `child' means a child in respect of whom a deduction is allowed under section 21 of the Finance Act, 1920 as subsequently amended.</P>
    <P>(3) Any deduction or relief under subsection (1) of this section shall be in substitution for and not in addition to the deduction under section 16 of the Finance Act, 1920 as subsequently amended.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I say that I welcome the more liberal approach the Minister is taking this year in respect of old persons in receipt of unearned income and in respect of other persons in receipt of small investment incomes?  &ldquo;Small&rdquo; is the operative word because, of course, the concession in section 3 is confined to those whose investment income does not exceed £450.  My amendment caters for a certain anomaly in the new state of things.  It caters for what I believe to be an oversight on the Minister's part and I hope he will accept the amendment accordingly.  We can all agree that perhaps the hardest hit individual by inflation is the widow with a family of small children, who is unable to go out to work and who is totally dependent on the means of livelihood which her deceased husband has left.</P>
    <P>If her deceased husband were fortunate enough to be in employment which provided his widow with a pension, she would receive earned income relief on that pension up to £2,000.  This amendment is designed to grant the equivalent of earned income relief to a widow in receipt of an income provided for her by her late husband, not being a pension, in other words, the widow of a selfemployed business man or professional person.  She may be left capital or an insurance policy.  The man who could cover himself for £3,000, £4,000 or <Col N="53" /> £5,000 probably considered he was doing well by his widow and family.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate position we are in now is that a widow with a family of small children with a capital of £5,000, £10,000 or £15,000 will be hard set to raise those children, to educate them and provide for them.  I am sure the Minister will agree that a widow with fatherless children is not a proper subject for taxation.  The Minister, as I said, has been relatively liberal to old people over 65 by granting them the equivalent to this allowance on earned income.  I am now asking him to do the same for the widow with small children who has no means of increasing her income.</P>
    <P>A widow with four children, as matters stand at present, is liable to income tax at the full standard rate on the full amount of her income of £739. In other words, if she has £800 a year investment income provided for her by her husband, or if she has actually bought an investment up to £800 out of money left to her by her husband, she is liable to income tax at the standard rate.  That is a state of affairs which should be rectified.  It is a situation which creates hardship on the most hard-pressed section of the community. I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Byrne's amendment.  It seems to me that the case he has made is an unanswerable one which follows exactly the same pattern that the Minister has laid down now in relation to sections 2 and 3.  The fact that he is extending only to some of those sections the relief that was first brought in, as far as I remember, in the Finance Act, 1951, is hardly an argument against the case being made by Deputy Byrne.</P>
      <P>Every one of us must have very considerable knowledge of the difficulties in which widows find themselves in the event of the early and untimely death of the breadwinner. The case Deputy Byrne has made for these people is one which deserves most serious and favourable consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered the case for widows alone&mdash;but it was pointed out to me by my advisers that you might have just as hard a case put up in respect of a single person.  The case was put, as a very deserving one, of a daughter who has looked after her mother or father.  The parent died at a rather old age, leaving the daughter at the age of 50 or 60 years, without training for any type of work.  She was left with a rather small income.  The father's pension had died with him and he had very little money to leave.  The daughter would have perhaps £400 or £500 a year out of investments.  Her case would be as deserving as the widow's case.  For that reason, I made section 3 applicable to persons under 65 years of age.  If they are over 65 years of age, they come under section 2.  The provisions of section 3 apply to widows and single people.</P>
      <P>It is a new section and a new idea. An estimate was given of the cost but we have no idea whether the section, as drawn up, will include only those we have in mind.  Sometimes as Deputies are aware, these provisions cost very much more than is anticipated.</P>

      <P>Perhaps so.  I would make a plea to Deputies that we should give this a year's trial.  I have no doubt it will be improved as time goes on but I suggest it is better to see how it works out for a year.  We do not know how many sections of the people we should cover or whether it would be advisable to make any difference between widows and single people or not.  We do not know whether we might go so far, if it were not going to cost too much, as to put all into the same category under section 2 and have no distinction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before section 7 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In connection with any assessment to income tax where a person proves that he has incurred expense on himself or on any dependant arising out of disability or illness which is serious and likely to be permanent there shall be deducted from the income to be assessed the vouched expenses so incurred in excess of £50 per annum per person and up to a maximum of £300 per annum per person.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This relates to proposed concessions in respect of medical expenses for chronic invalids, persons who are likely to be permanent invalids, to provide them with the modest expenses of their illness or to provide the taxpayer with an allowance for the modest expenses of his dependant's illness.  The wording is exactly that recommended in the Seventh Report of the Income Tax Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an unanswerable claim for an allowance such as this.  It is an old maxim of the law that equity is a stranger to income tax.  It seems from our discussion here this afternoon that the Minister too readily accepts that maxim.  In regard to personal allowances and reliefs, he said a few moments ago that if you increase them it only means you have to raise the standard rate of income tax in order to bear the cost of the increased allowances and that your last case will be worse than your first.  That is not true, if you make of income tax a more equitable levy, if you remove from its scope persons not proper subjects for taxation&mdash;invalids or a man whose wife is a permanent invalid or whose children are incurably <Col N="57" /> ill.  He is entitled, equitably, morally, and justly to the expenses of his illness.</P>
    <P>A year ago we had a protracted discussion on this same amendment. The Minister was subjected to arguments from all sides of the House in favour of it.  Indeed, at least one of his own backbenchers made the case that the terms of my amendment were not sufficiently liberal or generous.  I concede that might well be the case.  I have deliberately chosen the verbiage recommended by the Commission. That recommendation was to grant an allowance to taxpayers in respect of the expenses of serious and permanent illness up to a total of £300.  That had to be vouched for and proved.</P>
    <P>This is an allowance which would be simple to administer.  I am sadly disappointed that in the course of a full year the Minister has been unable to study this matter and produce a satisfactory solution.  In reply to a Parliamentary question of mine a few weeks ago he indicated research was still going on.  What sort of research? It is a simple issue capable of a ready solution a solution which has been found for the Minister by his own Commission, or rather by Deputy Sweetman's Commission.</P>
    <P>Protracted delays in matters such as this are extremely undesirable.  Within the past 12 months incurable invalids have died in hardship by reason of the relative burden of medical expenses on their incomes.  I do not think there is any more to be said on the amendment at this stage.  I appeal to the Minister again to give way to his own decent instincts and forget about doctrinaire arguments in these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Byrne.  We had a protracted discussion last year.  The things that were said then still stand.  Nothing can be added to them.  The most dreadful misfortune that can occur in any family is the impact of serious illness.  Indeed, many families have undergone great privation because of the cost of illness. Children's futures have been prejudiced by the loss of the moneys needed for <Col N="58" /> their education.  There are sufficient things wrong with the misfortune of grave illness&mdash;the great fears and worry which accompany it&mdash;without having it added to by taxing the smaller remnant of the income that remains. This would be a very civilised amendment to our tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne is correct in saying he framed his amendment on the wording of the Income Tax Commission. Therefore, I must accept that the Commission made a recommendation of this kind.  It was considered by the Government.  The Government said at the time that they would examine this matter, see if it were administratively practical and, at the same time, if it could be confined to the cases outlined in the recommendation. It is an extremely difficult matter. In last year's debate Deputy J.A. Costello said a draftsman would probably draft an amendment of this kind in half an hour.  He was pleading that it should be incorporated in last year's Finance Bill.  I have no doubt a draftsman could do so, but we do not know what repercussions it might have.  We can only say that in countries where this type of amendment has been adopted it has proved much more costly than expected.  I asked for an estimate of what it might be here on the same basis.  If the cost here were of the same proportions, it would cost £3 million or £4 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Australians will tell you that figure is true.  We could probably draw the conditions more tightly and we might be able to cut it down.  It was mentioned on the last occasion that this amendment, if adopted, might damage the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme.  If a man were able to calculate &ldquo;If I spend £100 on medical <Col N="59" /> expenses.  I am going to get such-and-such relief&rdquo;, that would be almost as good as the Voluntary Health could do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are speaking of incurable illness.  Such people are not accepted by the Voluntary Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall come to that. That might injure the Voluntary Health Scheme.  That necessitated certain discussions with the Voluntary Health Board, which have been going on.  It would be a far simpler scheme if we could say that a person had a certificate from the Voluntary Health people that they would not be accepted.  But the Voluntary Health people have informed me, through my officials, that they sometimes take on a person in a limited way.  For instance, a person suffering from diabetes.  They say: &ldquo;We will take you on for anything except something arising out of diabetes.&rdquo; That makes it extremely difficult for the Revenue Commissioners to cover a contingency of that kind.</P>
      <P>The only proper way of dealing with this matter is through a Health Act. A committee of the Oireachtas are at present considering existing health legislation.  Presumably, they will make recommendations.  If those recommendations should include better relief in cases of expensive illness and hospital treatment, the position would be fairly well covered and we would not be called on to deal with this matter again.  The Deputy's amendment refers to expenses of more than £50 and up to a limit of £300.  So far as domiciliary treatment is concerned, it is unlikely that any family would have higher expenses than £50 a year.  I am sure what the Deputy has in mind and what we have in mind are the expenses incurred in hospital treatment and special treatment of that kind.  I take it that the Oireachtas Committee would be inclined to extend services rather than restrict them.  If they do extend them, they will probably extend them to other groups of people.  That would be a more satisfactory way of dealing with this than through income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> The example was given to me of a man with a wife and three children earning £1,450 a year.  Under this amendment, if he were unfortunate enough to have high medical expenses, he would get a good relief.  But if there was another man beside him with a wife and six children, he would get nothing at all because he would not be paying income tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But if he had nothing, he would get it from the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think he would. That appears to me to prove the case that income tax is not the way to deal with this.  Those not paying income tax will not get any relief.  A married couple with no children paying income tax on a fairly low income will benefit, but the other person will not.  The argument generally would point in the direction that it should be done through health legislation and not through income tax legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Judging by the present rate of progress of our Health Committee&mdash;without any disrespect to it&mdash; if Deputy Byrne is to wait for its recommendations in order to get some amelioration for his present problem, he will have to wait a long time.  I cannot help feeling some sympathy for his sense of urgency in pressing the Minister, from whom we are much more likely to get rapid action.  I agree with the Minister that this might not be a satisfactory way of dealing with this problem, if we are to take it as a final solution, but, as an interim solution, there is something to be said for it.  The solution the Minister hopes for from the Parliamentary Committee&mdash;at least, I hope he hopes for it&mdash;is the one I would like to see: sufficient extension of our health services to see that nobody was unduly burdened by illness, whether it is prolonged or brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot in the Minister's argument regarding the possible cost of this.  I have not given the matter any great consideration.  He gave us this example of Australia and the high percentage of the national income which such a remission costs the Government <Col N="61" /> there.  I do not think that is a fair figure.  A high percentage of our people are already receiving services from the State.  Therefore, I presume they would be excluded and that would reduce very considerably the number of people who would be likely to benefit from Deputy Byrne's amendment.  I think the apparent fallacy in the Australian figures might be that in a fee-for-service type of medical service you would have the total medical bill being assessed for income tax purposes. The total medical bill in such circumstances where you have fee for service or some form of direct contribution, would be a very considerable medical bill.  Only a small percentage of our people would be covered, and it is likely the number would not be so worrying as the Minister seems to think it would be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne's amendment includes a proviso which is, if he will forgive my saying so, rather loose.  I think the Minister would find himself in difficulties with it.  The amendment says: &ldquo; ... arising out of disability or illness which is serious and likely to be permanent ... &rdquo; We all know the variations there could be in the likelihood of a person being permanently ill.  The courts are full of examples of people who are likely to be permanently disabled. There is the whole business of compensation and a cure following the award of damages.  There is inaccurate certification, sympathetic certification, and so on.  It would probably be quite different if we could define a block of illnesses in which it was likely that there would be permanent disability or permanent illness.  If it is possible to be quite sure that there will be permanent disability, or permanent illness, Deputy Byrne's case is a good one because it reduces very considerably&mdash; even more than the reduction I have made&mdash;the number of people who would be asking for remission of taxation under this amendment.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with the amendment, as must be obvious.  No real solution is possible until people have no direct contribution to make but, in the interim, we should try to mitigate the burden, which is a real burden, particularly where there is <Col N="62" /> permanent disability and where a person is permanently out of work and unable to earn.  He should get every assistance to ease his already heavy burden.  I ask the Minister to see if there is some way in which the tiny group to which Deputy Byrne appears to me to be referring could be helped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a sad reflection on our State institutions that we should have to plead on the Finance Bill each year for a section of the community who deserve some relief, particularly when giving that relief would cost the Exchequer very little.  If there is any merit at all in direct taxation of the kind with which we are dealing in these sections, it is that it is taxation on that portion of a person's income in respect of which he can exercise free will in its spending.  One cannot exercise free will over the spending of income which has to be expended for the preservation of life, the relief of pain or the amelioration of disability.  That is a form of compelling expenditure, and it seems entirely wrong that we should tax expenses which accrue by reason of human frailty, illness or disability to which any of us might succumb.  That is the principle underlying Deputy Byrne's amendment.  As we have said on several occasions, it does not suffice to say that because we cannot save every one who is drowning, we will save no one.</P>
      <P>I can hear protests being raised and resistance being offered to suggestions that this relief be given in general health measures because of the cost it would entail.  The fact that this would not be of benefit to those who are not paying income tax seems to be no justification for refusing it to those who are paying income tax, or may be called upon to pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of conscious effort is being made at present to alter the system of rates because of the fact that we are aware that people are compelled to pay fixed rates relating to premises although their means may be such that it imposes undue strain upon them to pay the particular rate.  That applies particularly where there are elderly people living in family homes which the children have left, and from <Col N="63" /> which the breadwinner has departed to another world.</P>
    <P>The disability or permanent illness of which Deputy Byrne speaks here can create a similar situation in which, because of the high cost of medical expenses, the taxpayer is not in a position without further undue strain, to pay the tax levied on him or her. We are well aware that by reason of the fact people pay taxation, they are classified as persons who are denied various health benefits which are available to others.  The Minister would be taking a step in the right direction, a step towards helping a section of the community who are deserving of some relief, if in this small regard he would provide exemption from income tax in respect of necessary medical expenses for people who are seriously or permanently ill or disabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has completely flabbergasted me with his quotation of the percentage cost in Australia of a similar relief.  I would not have expected £3 million here to be in the same proportion as £35 million in Australia.  However, we have all had experience of the fact that in trying to compare the tax structure in one country with the tax structure in another, it is very easy to fall into the trap of not comparing like with like. There must be some special considerations in Australia&mdash;perhaps the immense distances; I do not know&mdash; whereby medical expenses are so high. There may be some situation in Australia in which the agricultural community may be taxable on a schedule D basis.  I do not know.</P>

      <P>That would make a considerable difference.  Was allowance made for that in the statistical comparison the Minister made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I heard the Minister correctly&mdash; if I did not, I should be glad if he would correct me&mdash;it would cost £3 million in income tax to allow medical expenses in excess of £50 and up to a maximum of £300 a year.  Let us <Col N="64" /> examine that.  It means that, if it is to cost £3 million, at 6/4d. in the £, the Minister is estimating that £9 million worth of medical expenses are incurred every year here in excess of £50 a year and not in excess of £300 a year for any one taxable person.  I cannot believe that that figure could stand up.  It does not make sense or if it does, if it is a fact, then I am in the wrong profession, the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Malley, is in the wrong profession and the Minister is in the right profession if there is as much as £9 million spent on medical expenses in that narrow band.</P>
    <P>There must be some break in the comparative statistics.  It just could not be.  I admit frankly that the £9 million need not necessarily be right because the Minister might be taking surtax into account as well in his estimate.  I do not know whether he is or not.  I cannot remember at the moment whether the Australians have one composite tax for income tax and super tax.  If they have a composite tax, then the Minister is entitled to take it into account here, having regard to the provision for surtax allowances.  But this is only, first of all, an assessment on illness arising out of disability or illness which is serious or is likely to be permanent. As far as I can recollect&mdash;it is some time since I read it&mdash;the Australian medical expenses allowances do not say &ldquo;illness that is serious or likely to be permanent&rdquo;.  They provide for any type of illness in excess of a certain sum.  My recollection is that there is a lump sum in respect of an individual illness below which you cannot add in to your £50 for the year.  In other words, if you get a doctor for your child who has a cold, that particular guinea cannot go in to the total of £50.  From my recollection, there is no restriction in the Australian limit to disability or illness which is serious or likely to be permanent.</P>
    <P>It is not an exact method of making a computation but we can look around and make a shot at it.  Take 100 average taxpayers who we know are claiming and, of those 100, how many have a case in respect of which the disability is serious and likely to be <Col N="65" /> permanent?  Having got that from the point of view of an average, we can consider the position for expenses over £50 a year and under £300 a year, that is £250 a year expenses, and take the numbers by reference to the £9 million I mentioned.  I am trying to recollect the latest figure published for the number of income tax payers.  Was it 21,000?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>400,000.  The number of surtax payers was 5,000 or 6,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes the case much better from my point of view and much worse from the Minister's point of view, because there would be the 5,000 surtax payers and the 400,000 income tax payers and of those probably not more than 50 per cent would be right up to the top.  The figure of 50 per cent would be a fair one.  That means divided between 250,000 people, pairs, approximately, £9 million would be spent on illness that is serious or likely to be permanent and in excess of £50 and not in excess of £300 a year.  The figures do not stand up to examination at all.  I venture to say that one income tax payer out of every 100 might have a dependant within the terms of this amendment.  There must be some very vast difference between the computation as it is made in Australia and the manner in which our tax is computed here.  Does the Minister agree that one per cent is a reasonable estimate of the number of claims that are likely to arise per the total income tax payers for illness that is serious or likely to be permanent? I do not think it is an under-estimation. One can think around one's friends and neighbours and make a shot at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supposing it was one per cent, then one per cent of 400,000 is 4,000&mdash; 4,000 pairs.  Supposing they went right up to the maximum of £250, then that is £1 million tax assessment, not an income tax liability, but £1 million tax assessment, and that would be approximately £350,000 tax liability.  That is assuming all of the 400,000 taxpayers went on paying tax in such a way that they had the whole of this margin over and above the allowances.  Of course they would not.  Fifty per cent would <Col N="66" /> be a much fairer basis.  It would be much fairer to say that 50 per cent of the claims would be of such a taxable income nature that only one-half of the medical expenses clause would come in charge.</P>
    <P>That comes back to £500,000 as a tax assessment and to a tax liability of about £160,000.  I will give the Minister the extra £40,000 for his loss on surtax because there will be a surtax loss as well.  I think I am being very generous to him in doing that.  There is a net cost of £200,000 and the Minister has said that the cost would be £3 million. May I make this suggestion to the Minister?  The figures are so obviously at variance with what appears rational that between now and the Report Stage of this Bill, which will be dealt with on this day fortnight, the Minister might issue a short&mdash;one single sheet of foolscap&mdash;White Paper to Deputies on this matter explaining how the figures are computed, how he got his estimate of £3 million, and pointing out where is the fallacy in the figures I have tried to calculate while on my feet.</P>

      <P>I do not want these figures to be completely misunderstood. I said I did make inquiries in regard to how this scheme is working in other countries.  I mentioned that Australia has a very expensive scheme and I did say later that we could adopt a very much more restricted scheme here.  I am quite sure I did not imply that Deputy Byrne's amendment would cost £3 million or £4 million.  I said it would cost £3 million or £4 million on the same proportion as Australia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I am a little worried about one type of compensation. I am not quite clear whether it is covered.  Supposing a person is in employment and is dismissed from that employment; he takes an action for wrongful dismissal and that action is compromised by the firm concerned paying the man compensation.  The dismissal stands because obviously once matters get to the stage of an action for wrongful dismissal, there is no use hoping to have any future employment with any sort of amicable relationship.  The action is compromised by the claim for wrongful dismissal being dropped in consideration of a payment of a sum for damages without acknowledgment of liability. I am a little inclined to think that might be caught for tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wrong that damages for a genuine action for wrongful dismissal should be caught. If somebody is dismissed wrongfully and takes an action for damages for wrongful dismissal, while it might be open to him to take an action by way of <i>mandamus</i> for reinstatement, it is not a practical proposition.  If there are formal court proceedings and even supposing the claimant goes on to the judge and damages are given for wrongful dismissal, why should these damages be open to tax under this section?  What this section was intended to cover, and properly intended to cover, is the type of case where a person who is in employment wants to get a lump sum by way of capital and agrees to relinquish his employment and to get compensation for loss of office, so to speak and, having got that compensation, comes along the following <Col N="69" /> week and is re-employed.  It is perfectly proper the Minister should stop that gap, but in the other case it is not right that tax should have to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will probably see the reason for including wrongful dismissal: there is the danger that it could be arranged.  I do not know whether that danger could be overcome or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see it could be arranged if there are no court proceedings.  However, where the judgment of a court is given for damages, it should be considered in a different light.  People will not go right up to judgment in a court, with all the publicity that it involves, merely for the purpose of dodging tax.  If the Minister would consider that between now and the Report Stage, I should be happy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this section. The Minister has begun to see a glimmer of light in regard to Schedule A taxation.  To some extent he has taken the wind out of my sails, I must say, as an ardent critic of the Schedule A theory.  He is removing the more absurd features of Schedule A taxation in this section which provides that in respect of Schedule A tax raised on companies, Schedule A will not effectively be assessed on them.  The Minister will not lose anything at all by this action because the tax being paid on companies' profits under Schedule D will be correspondingly increased.  In other words, the farcical situation which has existed for so many years of one set of clerks raising Schedule A assessments and advising them to another section so that the latter can discharge them will cease.  There will be a considerable saving in administrative expenses arising out of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his good sense.  I wish he would go further <Col N="70" /> and I would ask him if it is true that by reason of this particular provision, the only people now effectively paying tax under Schedule A will in the future be residential occupiers of their homes.</P>

Or is it intended to cover the type of tax like the deduction that was formerly allowed for under Schedule A and is now thrown into Schedule D? What are the various types of cases it is intended to cover?

That creates a certain amount of trouble, both for the tenant and the Revenue Commissioners.  It would be much simpler if, in estates of that kind where there are large numbers of non-income tax payers, the inspector went to the landlord and said: &ldquo;If you give me the list, I will serve notice on those tenants to pay the full ground rent to you and we will serve the whole income tax bill on you and get it in that way.&rdquo;</P>

In fact, it was that very thing that made the Minister pass the turnover tax when he said that as a result of the failure of the traditional means of revenue, he had to impose the turnover tax on the essential food, fuel, and clothing of the people.  Now he comes back to the attack again in relation to beer, and in this section seeks to impose the increases he announced in the Budget.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>Before section 21 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 1 (4) (d) of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952, is hereby amended by the insertion of the words `including machinery used in a quarry or pit solely for the purpose of raising material for the construction or repair of roads'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a matter to which I referred on Second Reading.  It seems to me quite extraordinary that there are some of the exemptions from road taxation in relation to the construction of roads which do not apply to the type of vehicle I have in mind here.  I think I am right in saying that mobile tar tankers, tar sprayers, rollers, bulldozers, graders, excavators, low loaders&mdash;all those vehicles used for the purpose of road construction, if they are used only for the purpose of road construction&mdash;are exempt from road tax.  On the other hand, because a compressor is carried on a vehicle and does nothing at all except to go from quarry to quarry raising road material, that vehicle carrying that compressor is, nevertheless, taxable on the basis of £1 per horsepower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that the differential is quite unfair and it is to remedy that that this amendment is introduced.  I accept, of course, that, if the vehicle in question is used for any purpose other than road construction, directly or indirectly, through the raising of road material, it should be liable; but, where the vehicle is used solely for the purpose of carrying a compressor or a pulveriser from one <Col N="82" /> quarry to another, then it seems to me entirely wrong that it should be so liable.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Jones resumes, there is one matter, Sir, I should like to mention.  In moving that the motion be referred back, I mentioned that the commencing salary of a secondary teacher was £950.  That was a mistake.  It should have been £670.  I just want to correct it now for the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on the last occasion, I mentioned some points in regard to primary education upon which I felt comment ought to be made.  The Minister has announced the project for comprehensive schools and, according to his statement, these comprehensive schools will be sited in the beginning in the main along the western seaboard.  I hope it is not intended to confine comprehensive schools solely to that area.  In every constituency there are areas in which the people would welcome comprehensive schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years there has been a great deal of talk with regard to the raising of the school-leaving age and the reason given as to why it is not practicable to raise the school-leaving age at the moment is that there are not sufficient teachers available to enable it to be done.  In the comprehensive schools contemplated, and in the sphere of vocational education, there is immediate opportunity available for the education of girls and youths up <Col N="83" /> to and including the age when they would normally part, as is intended under this comprehensive scheme.  As I understand the scheme, the intention is to take the pupil from the primary past the intermediate stage.  That stage would have a programme so adapted that the successful student could branch off either to vocational education or the ordinary secondary leaving certificate type of education, and thereafter either to higher technological or university education.</P>
    <P>A number of graduates leaving the universities at the moment have to find opportunity abroad.  I think we have a sufficient number of these people who would be able to educate a much larger number of children here at home.  What we do need is a more rapid spread, in the first instance, of vocational schools. I cannot understand why vocational education has to be limited because vocational schools are not being built. I take it each committee has a programme of school building laid out for itself.  Some years ago in Limerick, the vocational education committee picked out a number of places where it was felt vocational schools ought to be sited.  I take it the schools were being sited in relation to the primary schools since these would feed the material to the vocational schools.  Is there any reason why the Minister should not press the vocational committees to proceed more quickly with the erection of these schools?</P>
    <P>The position at the moment is that one or two schools are built in the area under the jurisdiction of the committee. They may only be commenced and, in some cases, they are not even commenced in the year.  Is there any good reason why towns of a reasonable size, or areas in which there is a large concentration of schools should have to wait for the provision of vocational schools?  Everybody is agreed that it is most desirable that the education of our children should not end at 14 years of age.  If the Minister would use his good offices and also obtain the necessary financial help to enable the schools to be built, the raising of the school leaving age need no longer be put on the long finger.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="84" /> In these days there is continuation education as well as education leading to a trade or vocation.  It is essential that we should expand vocational education now in order to have the necessary material to feed into the technological colleges at a later date.  If we are really serious as to the importance of education, I cannot see any good reason why there should not be a spread of the smaller type of secondary schools in the smaller towns and larger villages.  At a meeting in Limerick recently in connection with the university project, it was pointed out that there have grown up within the space of ten or 12 years no fewer than 29 schools providing full-time courses in secondary education up to leaving certificate standard.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I am at a loss to understand why the grants should be confined to the larger type of school and I am disappointed that that should be the policy.  If we want to encourage the spread of secondary education, I want to impress on the Minister that we shall not do it if we depend on purely residential schools.  I would suggest that we should encourage the smaller type of school and I am sure the Minister's officials have informed him that these schools are doing excellent work.  The results every year speak highly for the work done in these schools.  These schools need not be confined to any region. They would provide an opportunity for groups of graduates to establish such schools.  The reduction in the number of pupils necessary to qualify for the employment of another teacher is very welcome.  It could be most helpful in the establishment of these smaller schools.  People who invest their money, who may even have to seek accommodation for the establishment of such a school, are entitled, I think, to the same type of assistance in regard to the provision of secondary education in these scattered corners of the country.  I do not now mean scattered in one particular region, but scattered in every region.</P>
    <P>How many graduates leave our universities every year?  What happens to them?  A small number obtain employment in their own <Col N="85" /> country.  A large number seek employment abroad.  At the same time there is a lack of educational facilities for numbers of prospective pupils. If we are in earnest, there is no reason why we should not foster this development, thereby providing an opportunity for more graduates to engage in the education of their own nationals, obtaining a modest return for their efforts.  If the grants are confined in the main to residential schools, the result will be to deprive large numbers of children of secondary education. With regard to day schools in the larger centres of population, there is a tendency to centralise education and there is, therefore, a certain amount of cramming. The smaller school would play a very intrinsic part because of a much more personal link between teacher and pupil.  I do not think we need pass an Act raising the school-leaving age.  I think all we need do is encourage a more rapid spread of vocational schools and small secondary schools in the smaller centres of population.</P>
    <P>The intention with regard to the comprehensive school is to have pupils advance on a common programme to an examination and then stream them off in different directions.  I suggest to the Minister that there is an analogy here from his Department applicable to the case made many times for university training for teachers.  Is there any good reason why primary teachers should not avail of university education in those subjects common to both types of teaching?  Method instruction could be given separately.  The fact that students can be kept in comprehensive schools for a number of years and then sent on their separate ways is a good analogy in the case of the two types of teaching.  Students entering the training colleges are carefully screened.  They are of a very high standard, requiring four or five honours, followed by an interview, before they are accepted in the training college. These should make excellent university material.  They should have the opportunity of mixing with the other faculties in studies common to both types of teacher and methods of education could be dealt with, as they have been up to this, in the training colleges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" /> With regard to universities, I trust I shall be pardoned for mentioning Limerick in this connection.  Limerick has a long history of seeking university status.  Submissions were made to the Commission on Higher Education, all-compelling submissions.  I am sure the Minister is aware of them.  In the environs of Limerick, and within 30 miles of it, there are large numbers of secondary pupils leaving the secondary schools each year.  Only a minute fraction can proceed to university education. At the same time, there is a wealth of goodwill for university education, if such were available to them closer to home.</P>
    <P>It is nationally known that the universities in Dublin, Cork and Galway are overcrowded.  The present building programme which is proceeding in Dublin, the extension to the college in Cork, and the extension to the college in Galway, are not sufficient to meet the needs of university education in those centres.  Indeed, very often in some faculties it is found that the overcrowding which exists is a constant hindrance to people who wish to pursue the different courses.  Therefore, the authorities, both the universities and at Government level, have been giving thought to the question of an extension in the university facilities.</P>
    <P>Why should there not be a foundation in Limerick?  There are more than 7,000 pupils in the secondary schools within 30 miles of Limerick.  If you extend that radius slightly, there are over a further 4,500 pupils available from which to draw for a university.  If we have now reached the stage that in Dublin the student body numbers more than 7,000, in Cork, 2,000, and over, and in Galway somewhere in the region of 1,800, that indicates the rapid growth of the desire for university education.  That, combined with the rapid growth in secondary education and the desire for secondary education, immediately puts the problem to the Minister of the necessity for an extension in the university facilities.</P>
    <P>Surely Limerick has a claim for the establishment of a constituent college? Numbers of proposals have been made, but numbers of reasons have been given <Col N="87" /> as to why Limerick cannot have one.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the submission made by the Limerick University Project Committee in which the various objections were dealt with step by step.  This is not a foible on the part of the people of that area.  It is not something they thought up for the lack of something to do.  It is a real desire on the part of thinking people within that area.  If the Shannon area is to become the centre of expansion which it seems to be becoming, then I suggest that Limerick is a logical centre for the establishment of a university.</P>
    <P>To link that up with the point I made in regard to teachers, in Limerick there is one of the largest training colleges for ladies in the country.  A few years ago, that college had to be extended in a very large way to accommodate the extra number of students who were admitted to its halls. That is a foundation on which a university might be built, even if, at the beginning, with only limited academic facilities.  There are between 300 and 400 students there.  I do not know the exact figure.  There are also approximately 7,500 secondary school pupils within a radius of 30 miles, and a further 4,500 pupils if you extend the perimeter.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest that there are excellent grounds for the demand from Limerick for the establishment of a university.  Here, and in the other colleges, an expensive and extensive building programme is going on because of overcrowding.  Can the Minister say absolutely that even this new building programme will provide for all the needs for university education in either Dublin or Cork.  If there is to be a further extension of university building, I want to suggest quite seriously to the House, to the Minister, and, indeed, to the Commission on Higher Education that there is an unanswerable case for a university in Limerick.</P>
    <P>The graduates in that area who have established secondary schools there to the extent of 29, have shown that they realise first and foremost the importance of providing secondary school <Col N="88" /> facilities for the pupils.  The pupils in those schools have shown in their numbers, and in their attainments at examinations, that they are of a calibre to benefit by higher education. Consequently, there is an obligation on those who guide policy to take serious heed of this fact, and bring to the notice of whoever is responsible the need for a fourth constituent college of National University, and for its being sited in Limerick.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the faculty of Agriculture in Dublin has had to move outside the city for practical reasons.  I want to suggest that the people in the southern part of the country, which is certainly a large agricultural area with a vast dairying potential, as is instanced by the facilities which have been made available in Cork and very widely availed of over the years, and also the college at Copsewood, have indicated that they are alive and awake to the importance of this type of education.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has no desire to oppose the expressed wishes of the people for a university in that area. It would be available to North Kerry, Limerick, North Tipperary and Clare and bring to those areas a greater impetus to the spread of education.  Everybody admits at present that education is one of the vital forces in any country and I hope the Minister and, under the Minister's guidance, the Department will successfully move ahead with the expansion of education of all types. The need at present is particularly great in regard to the spread of vocational education and the greater spread of secondary education and the use of the grant system to encourage the formation of the smaller types of schools where successful secondary education can be obtained.</P>
    <P>If we desire to face the problem, we must realise it is a question of investing in education.  It is perhaps one of those types of investment where the return is not seen so readily or so rapidly in the mere material sense, but the vast majority of the young people who attend the primary schools in such large numbers and who are leaving them year after year are entitled to <Col N="89" /> facilities for higher education and to higher education without any compulsion. I do not think it will be any great solution to raise the school-leaving age and make it compulsory to attend school beyond the present age. There is no necessity to do so because wherever the facilities have been available, they have been availed of by the schoolgoing population.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his attempts to do this.  I know he will have to fight his own battle with the Department of Finance for the necessary moneys but I know he is keenly interested in the spread of education and I feel he will not be found wanting in this matter.  I appeal to him to use whatever influence he may have, whatever powers of persuasion he may have, with the authorities in regard to this matter of the final capping of the educational effort of people in the southern area which I represent, comprised of four county areas continguous to Limerick, and that the decision will be taken to give to the fourth city in the country the university to which it is entitled and which it has long sought.</P>

      <P>Is ceart breis airgid a chaitheamh ar oideachas.  Mura ndeintear é sin ní bheidh aon dul chun cinn ann maidir le cúrsaí oideachais ar bith.  Le blianta anuas, tá feabhas mór tagtha ar scéal an oideachais ach ba cheart go mbeadh idirdhealú idir gach brainse oideachais &mdash; bun-oideachas, meán-oideachas agus oideachas iolscoile&mdash;i dtreo is ná beadh aon chur amú airgid nó aimsire ann.</P>
      <P>Go dtí seo ní raibh sin ann.  Chítear dom go bhfuil an tAire agus an Roinn ag iarraidh an scéal sin a leigheas.  Is minic roimhe seo nuair a bheadh caighdeán maith ag páiste sa bhunscoil agus ansin dul ar aghaidh go dtí an meánscoil agus as sin go dtí an iolscoil ná beadh aon leanúnachas san gcóras oideachais.  Is cailliúint mhór í sin don mhúinteoir, don pháiste agus don tír fosta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir le bun-oideachas is dóigh liom go bhfuil dul chun cinn déanta thar mar a deineadh sna blianta roimhe seo&mdash;go háirithe le déanaí.  Do <Col N="90" /> tógadh a lán scoileanna nua agus feabhsaíodh na sean-scoileanna chomh maith.  Nuair a bheidh siad go léir deisithe beidh seans níos fearr ag na páistí deagh-oideachas d'fháil mar tá sé ró-dheacair do pháistí obair fhónta a dhéanamh i scoileanna nach bhfuil slacht maith orthu agus nach bhfuil uisce reatha, aibhléis, faichí imeartha agus mar sin de iontu.  Tá súil againn nach fada uainn an lá nuair a bheidh ár mbunscoileanna go léir mar sin. Tá an tAire ag déanamh a dhíchill chun an scéal a dhéanamh amhlaidh.</P>
    <P>Tá biseach mór tagtha ar an gcóimheas idir líon na ndaltaí scoile agus líon na múinteoirí.  Do hoileadh 664 múinteoirí sa bhreis anuraidh chun an cheist sin a réiteach.  Tá coláiste oiliúna nua á thógáil i nDrom Connrach agus ceann nua de chuid Eaglais na hÉireann á chur ar fáil fosta.  Is mór an dul chun cinn é sin agus tá súil agam nach fada uainn an lá nuair a bheidh cóimheas níos fearr idir an méid daltaí agus múinteoirí ionnas go mbeidh oideachas níos fearr le fáil ag na páistí uilig.  Go dtí seo i gcuid des na ranganna ins na cathracha móra, go mór mhór, bhí suas le 70 nó 80 páiste le teagasc ag múinteoir amháin, agus amuigh ins na scoileanna beaga ar fud na tíre bhí seacht nó ocht ranganna le teagasc ag múinteoir amháin fosta.  Idir an dá rud sin, sílim nach raibh an t-oideachas is fearr á chur ar fáil do na daltaí scoile sin.</P>
    <P>Is áthas liom a fheiceál go bhfuil an Roinn ag iarraidh rud éigin a dhéanamh mar gheall ar na páistí lagintinneacha. Go dtí seo níor bhac na tuismitheoirí ná na múinteoirí leo mar ní raibh aon spás ná aon córas tréineála acu dóibh.  Anois le cúig bliana anuas, do réir óráid an Aire, tá scoileanna curtha ar bun chun freastail ar pháistí den chineál sin.  Tá 37 scoileanna bunaithe do pháistí go bhfuil galair nó aicíd nó machall meabhrach ag cur isteach ortha.  Is mór an chéim ar aghaidh é sin.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an clár oibre ins na bunscoileanna, measaim go bhfuil sé ceart go leor.  Bhí an Teachta Ó Domhnaill ag moladh ábhair breise a chur ar siúl mar ghleacaíocht nó eolas ar nádúir.  Is fuirist do mhúinteoirí é sin <Col N="91" /> a dhéanamh.  Go minic múineann siad gleacaíocht do na páisti agus iad ag siúl isteach ón clós, cionnus máirseáil a dhéanamh, agus mar sin de.  Mar gheall ar eolas nádúir, gheibheann siad téacs leabhra mar ábhar léitheoireachta chun é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir go mbeadh an Roinn in ann córas níos fearr a ghlacadh maidir le téacs leabhra a cheapadh.  Uaireanta bíonn téacs leabhar orduithe do bhliain amháin agus ceann eile ag teastáil don bhliain in a dhiaidh sin. Ba cheart go mbeadh leabhar caighdeánach ar fáil ionnus nach mbeadh gá le leabhra a athrú ró-mhinic.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cúis na Gaeilge, sílim go bhfuil teagasc na Gaeilge ag dul ar aghaidh go breá ins na bunscoileanna. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil gearán ar bith ag na tuismitheoirí ná ag na páistí faoi sin.  Tá's agam go ndeineann cuid des na meánscoileanna a ndícheall i dtaobh labhairt na Gaeilge agus go múineann a lán aca na hábhair go léir i nGaeilge, agus sé mo bharúil gurb iad sin na scoileanna is fearr in Éirinn.  Ní hé amháin gurb é mo bharúil é ach tá an méid sin le feiceál i dtorthaí na scrúdú. Gheibheann siad na scoláireachtaí gach bliain beagnach.  Pé scéal é, is fíor le rá i dtaobh cuid eile des na meánscoileanna, nach bhfuil an meas ceart aca ar an nGaeilg.</P>
    <P>Nuair a theipeann ar daltaí ins na meánscoileanna scrúdú a shárú, cuirtear an milleán go minic ar an nGaeilg.  An bhliain seo caite níor theip ach a dó fén gcéad i nGaeilg ins na scrúdaithe.  Theip a sé fén gcéad i mBéarla agus a deich fén gcéad i bhFraincis.  Cruthaíonn sé sin nach í an Ghaeilg an chúis gur theip ar a lán daltaí ins na scrúdaithe sin. Is dóigh liom go ndeineann cuid des na tuismitheoirí leithscéal de sin nuair a theipeann ar a bpáistí féin. B'fhéidir nach ceart do na pháistí sin bheith i meánscoil mar nach bhfuil caighdéán oideachais árd go leor aca chun an cúrsa sin a leanúint mar sin, agus go mbeadh sé níos fearr dóibh bheith ag obair ins na páirceanna nó áit éigin eile.  Ar aon chaoi, ní ceart an milleán a chur ar an nGaeilg.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> Is áthas liom go gcaithfidh micléinn dul fé scrúdú i labhairt na Gaeilge chun an mean teastas nó an árd teastas a bhaint amach.  Níor thuigeas riamh an chiall le hárd teastas a thabhairt do dhuine gurb éigean dó admháil nach raibh sé ábalta an Ghaeilge a labhairt.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na hábair a múintear ins na meánscoileanna, ní dóigh liom go bhfuil go leor ábhair á múineadh ionta.  Go minic nuair a freastalaíonn macléinn ar an meánscoil go dteastaíonn uaidh, cur i gcás, dul le múinteoireacht, nuair a thagann sé don árd tisméireachta ní bhíonn na hábair déanta aige a theastaíonn uaidh agus ní bhíonn ar a chumas dul le múinteoireacht mar sin.</P>
    <P>Dul chun cinn mór na hábhair atá á léiriú ar Telefís Éireann i láthair na huaire agus atá le feiceál ins na meánscoileanna. Tá súil agam go leathnófar na cláracha ar Telefís Éireann ionus go mbeidh siad le feiceál ní amháin ins na meánscoileanna ach ins na ceardscoileanna agus na bunscoileanna. Os rud é go bhfuil tionchur mór ag Telefís Éireann, tá súil agam go mbainfidh na múinteoirí ar na cláracha a craoltar úsáid as Gaeilg san teagasc a bhíonn ar siúl acu.</P>
    <P>Mar gheall ar na ceardscoileanna, roimhe seo bhí sort éirí in áirde ag na meánscoileanna thar na ceardscoileanna. Bhí sort riail ann nach bhféadfadh an páiste dul ón bunscoil don cheardscoil go dtí gur raibh 13 bliana slánuithe aige, ach níl riail den tsort sin ag baint leis na meánscoileanna. Ba cheart go mbeadh cead ag na tuismitheoirí dalta a chur isteach sa cheardscoil pé am is mian leo, go mbíonn an cúrsa críochnaithe acu sa bhunscoil.  Ní hionann sin agus a rá go bhfuilimíd ag iarraidh na páisti a thabhairt amach as na bunscoileanna. ró-luath nó ag iarraidh a chur i gcéill go bhfuil meánscoileanna níos tábhachtaí ná na ceárdscoileanna.</P>
    <P>Tá moladh mór ag dul don Aire as ucht adubhairt sé mar gheall ar an meánteistiméireacht agus an árdteistiméireacht sna ceárdscoileanna. Dul chun cinn an-mhór é sin chun deireadh a chur le h-éirí in áirde.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na coláistí teicniciúla ar a labhair an tAire le déanaí, ní dubhairt sé rud ar bith mar gheall ar <Col N="93" /> cheann a bhunú ins an chontae seo againne.  Táim ag iarraidh air é sin a scrúdú anois.  Táimíd ag súil go mbeidh sé ar chumas an Aire ceann amháin dena coláistí sin a bheith againn mar níl ceann idir an contae seo againne agus Sligeach nó Dún Dealgan.</P>
    <P>Tá an-spéis agam ins na scoileanna coimseacha.  Tá an-ghá leo siúd, go mór mhór im chontae féin.  Is doilig liom a rá nuair a d'fhiafraigh mé cúpla bliain ó shoin cé mhéid meánscoileanna a bhí in gach contae in Éirinn gurb é mo chontae féin an contae is gainne ar fad orthu.  Tá scoláirí ógá mo pharóiste féin suas le 36 míle ó mheánscoil ar bith.  Tá cuid den chontae lán de locha agus sléibhte agus tá sé an-dheacair dona páistí dul go meánscoil.  Ar an ábhar sin, táim ag súil nach fada go mbeidh ceann dena scoileanna coimseacha im chontae féin.  Tá anmheas againn ar oideachas agus ní ceart go mbeadh 29 scoileanna i gContae Luimní agus gan ach cúpla ceann againn i gCabhán.</P>
    <P>Níl a fhios agam an mbeadh sé ar chumas an Aire rud éigin a dhéanamh mar gheall ar chóras taistil a sholatháir dona meánscoileanna agus na ceardscoileanna.  Sílim gur ceart go mbeadh córas taistil againn chun go mbeadh na páistí ábalta freastal ar na scoileanna anois.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile ann gur mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh dó.  Maidir le scoláireachtaí, sílim gur ceart go mbeadh ar chumas na bpáistí glacadh leis na scoláireachtaí sin i scoil ar bith ins an tír.  Ní ceart iachall a chur ar thuismitheoirí nó ar pháistí freastal ar scoil ar bith ach ar an gceann a oireann dóibh féin.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh don scéim a bhí againn i gContae an Chábháin an bhliain seo caite.  Do chuireamar scéim ar bun chun cabhrú le tuismitheoirí nó le dáltaí meánscoileanna nó ceardscoileanna dul go dtí ollscoil agus céim a bhaint amach dóibh féin, agus go gcuirfí an t-airgead ar fáil dóibh tré iasacht ón gcomhairle chontae.  Rinne an tAire tagairt do seo an bhliain seo caite agus ón méid adubhairt sé tuigeadh dom gur mhol sé an scéim.  Ar aon chuma, bhí an <Col N="94" /> chomhairle chontae lán-tsásta leis, mar dob eol dóibh go léir gur beag an caoi atá againn i gContae an Chábháin dul go dtí an ollscoil.  Bheadh a lán tuismitheoirí sásta a gcuid páistí a chur chun na h-ollscoile ach an t-airgead a bheith acu.  Ba mhaith liom dá ndéanfadh an tAire scrúdú ar an scéim atá againn i gContae an Chábháin arís agus más féidir leis glacadh lei.</P>
    <P>Tá sár-obair déanta ag an Aire ó ceapadh é mar Aire Oideachais.  Tá árd-mheas ag na múinteoirí agus ag na tuismitheoirí air.  Tá caighdeán an oideachais sa tír seo ar fheabhas.  Tá a fhios agam fosta go dtuigeann an tAire nach féidir leis an dtír dul chun cinn a dhéanamh gan oideachas fónta a bheith le fáil ag na páistí.  Sin é an fáth go bhfuil sé beartaithe aige aois fhágáil na scoile a árdú go dtí 15 bliana.  Cheanna féin, tá nios mó páistí ós cionn 14 bliana ag freastal ar na meánscoileanna agus na ceárdscoileanna ná mar atá i dtír ar bith eile san Eoraip.  Ní h-aon mhaith an aois a árdú muna bhfuil dóithin múinteoirí ann chun na ranganna a mhúineadh. Táimíd sásta leis an iarracht atá déanta ag an Aire chun múinteoirí oilte a sholáthair.</P>
    <P>Mar a dubhairt mé i dtosach, tá feabhas mór tagtha ar an scéal le cúig bliain anuas.  Is mór an tairbhe atá le baint ag an aos óg ar fud na tíre uilig as an méid atá déanta ag an Aire atá anois againn.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Finance Bill, 1964&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment :</P>
    <P>Before section 21 to insert a new section as follows :</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 1 (4) (d) of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952, is hereby amended by the insertion of the words `including machinery used in a quarry or pit solely for the purpose of raising material for the construction or repair of roads'.&rdquo;&mdash; (Deputy Sweetman.)</P>
    <Col N="95" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I was dealing with this amendment, which seeks to exempt from road duty vehicles which are used in quarries or pit solely for the purpose of raising material for the construction of roads.  I wish to make it quite clear that it is machinery and vehicles carrying that machinery used solely for the purpose of raising of material for road construction I have in mind.  If, one day during the year, the vehicle carries machinery used for any other purpose than raising material for roads for that one day, then the exemption would cease to have application and the normal duty would be payable.</P>
      <P>The present situation is that mobile tar tankers, tar sprayers, loaders, bulldozers, graders, excavators&mdash;all that type of travelling machinery&mdash;are exempt from this tax, but because a stone-crusher or a compressor may be mounted on a vehicle, the vehicle carrying that stone-crusher, and doing nothing else, and the stone-crusher, which does nothing else except raise road materials, are liable.</P>
      <P>I understand further that if a compressor or a crusher were put on a low loader, the low loader carrying it would not be liable.  Because it is put on a lorry chassis, it is liable, whether it is a lorry or an articulated vehicle. If it is carried by a low loader it would not be liable, but because it is on an ordinary lorry, it is liable.  That is not fair.  It seems to me contrary not merely to what was the intention of the section but also to commonsense. When I say it is contrary to the commonsense of the section, I am not indicating any argument on the interpretation of the original section.  It seems to be a contradiction in terms that something used for the purpose of road construction in this way should be liable to road tax.  The two things are not compatible.  As the big tanker carrying the tar is exempt, so should the vehicle mentioned in my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is seeking to introduce a new principle by asking for the inclusion of this type of vehicle. <Col N="96" /> As far as the motor taxation code goes, the use to which any vehicle may be put while off the public road is not relevant and is not a factor we can take into account in determining the liability or non-liability for duty of the vehicle.  The fact that off-the-road operations are related to roadmaking materials cannot be accepted as relevant to the various exceptions made for motor taxation purposes.  The lorry on which the machine is carried is a road vehicle which might possibly be used for other purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It could not be.  It has got a specially built-on body for those compressors and crushers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The exceptions given do not relate to the materials produced in quarries and pits.  They relate entirely to the construction and making of roads, not to the materials used.  It could be held that the machines producing materials in the quarries are not used exclusively for roadmaking but for building and other purposes.  Seeking to have this type of vehicle included in the list of exclusions would be departing from the list already in existence.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned some of those which are excluded.  They include vehicles kept by a local authority exclusively for fire brigade operations, vehicles used for the transport of road construction machinery for no other purpose than the repair of roads.  That is the one I am relying on in particular&mdash;the vehicle that might be used to transport a machine or to transport itself but which is used exclusively for the repair and construction of roads.  In no part of the Bill relating to those things excluded is the manufacture of road materials mentioned.  Therefore, the Deputy's proposal would widen the list of exclusions, perhaps inadvisedly and unnecessarily.  The vehicle mentioned by the Deputy is subject to a favourable rate of tax&mdash;£1 per horse power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be a very heavy vehicle to carry these machines. In one case, I know the rate of tax will be £75 per year, though the <Col N="97" /> vehicle will make not more than 12 journeys during the year&mdash;it will spend a month in a quarry and then travel on.  It seems wrong that a tax of £75 should be payable in respect of that vehicle since it is so constructed that it can be used only for that purpose. A bulldozer can be used for the purpose of making a road.  If the Minister drives along the Naas road, he will see bulldozers at work there.  A bulldozer can also be used for building, but the vehicle that carries the bulldozer, so long as the bulldozer is used only for the making of roads, is free.</P>
      <P>It is exactly the same principle I am asking the Minister to accept in this amendment.  I am not indicating how the taxation authorities will satisfy themselves that a vehicle that carries a bulldozer is carrying such a bulldozer only for the building of roads.  They do exempt vehicles carrying bulldozers when it is for road construction and therefore it should not be beyond the wit of the draftsman to cover exactly the same principle in this.</P>
      <P>The person concerned, the owner of the vehicle, must satisfy the taxation authority that it is used solely in relation to road construction by raising materials in this way.  Without materials raised in this way, roads will be made only from individual very large quarries.  All the type of machinery I have in Kildare is not suitable perhaps in parts of the West. The pattern of road construction, particularly in the West, is to endeavour as far as possible to raise economically a variety of quarries round a particular county.  So long as the Minister has this provision here, which is now being enforced in a particular way, it will not be possible to have that type of construction any more.  The effect of it will be that the smaller quarries will have to close and there will be pockets of unemployment in consequence of which the Minister will have to pay far more than the amount that is involved here in the duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could understand the case made against me if a bulldozer could be used only for the purpose of making roads but obviously it can be used for <Col N="98" /> many other purposes: the Minister understands that.  Yet so long as the machine that carries that bulldozer is used for roads it is free.  If that is so, there is an easy method of dealing with this same analogy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>Before section 23 in Part III to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In respect of Estate Duty there shall be deducted from the net value of the property passing on the death of a father to his widow or to his children the sum of £2,000 in respect of each child of his under the age of 16 years before calculating the principal value of the estate liable to estate duty.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to alter the present scale of estate duty, the system of taxation levied on capital at death.  The scale of estate duty, originally in the Finance Act, 1894, has been altered from time to time in respect of rate but, basically, <Col N="99" /> as far as its fundamental structure is concerned and the principles upon which it is based, the system has remained unaltered since drafted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I have tabled this amendment in order to draw the attention of the Minister to the position in this country as it applies to the family man.  We are a nation who cherish, our large families.  Our country accords a special place to the family in our Constitution as the basic unit of society.  It seems to me that it is very right and proper that we should keep that fact very much to the forefront in matters of taxation as in other matters.</P>
    <P>The average family in Britain is something like 1.3 children.  The average father who dies there leaves a small family of 1.3 children and a widow.  In this country, the average family is five or six children.  In the past three months, I have heard of no fewer than three friends and acquaintances of mine who were cut off in their prime, leaving large families of young children.  They were men who wisely had covered themselves by insurance and there is, thank God, a certain capital sum available to the widow in these cases.  In one case, there is a sum of about £20,000 available to bring up no fewer than seven children under nine years of age.  But the State is having its crack at that capital sum.</P>
    <P>We have death duties which yield £3 million of which estate duty yields about £2 million.  To the extent that that tax is levied on the capital fund left by fathers for the upbringing and education of their family of young children, it seems to me that such estates are improper subjects for taxation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman pointed out last week that in many countries of continental Europe a system of family relief is granted in respect of estate duties.  I never tire here of making the case that British laws can be very unsuited to our circumstances.  I suggest to the Minister that in no respect is that more manifest than in this <Col N="100" /> matter of death duties which taxes the estate of a father with a family of small children in the same way as it taxes the single person.</P>
    <P>One sometimes hears the case made that estate duties in this country are not as heavy as in Britain.  That is partly true.  In estates ranging between £8,000 and £20,000 the duties here are exactly the same as they are in Britain. In days of rapid inflation, a capital sum of £20,000 left to the widow of a family will provide an annual income of less than £1,000 and every £ taken out of that capital fund is making it more difficult for the unfortunate widow to meet the trials and tribulations of her state in life.  The duty levied on an estate of £20,000 here is £2,400.  No relief whatever is given for the family circumstances of the deceased person.  I appreciate that my amendment, as drafted, is technically imperfect but it gives the opportunity of drawing this matter to the Minister's attention.  Very probably he may not be fully aware of it and therefore I ask him to address himself to this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne's amendment illustrates his concern and the concern of the Fine Gael Party for the standard of families.  The object of the amendment is to preserve for the children of a deceased father the standard of comfort and opportunity which would have been theirs if the father had lived.  It is next to impossible for us to replace, no matter what State aid we may give, the position of father but the least we can do is to see that the State does not step in to take away from a family some provision which the father in his lifetime had put aside so that if he were taken away while the family were young, there would be some fund there to provide them with something like the same opportunity as would have been theirs if he had been alive and earning an income for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only criticism of this amendment that is valid is that it does not go far enough but Deputy Byrne, like the other members of the Fine Gael Party, is well aware of the many pressures on State funds by reason of the great improvements sought.  We do not <Col N="101" /> want to ask for the impossible but we ask that where there are children of tender years up to 16, £2,000 be left as a sum untouchable by the State in respect of each.  When one considers the cost of maintaining a child and the cost of school and university fees, the sum we ask to be taken into account is small compared with the many demands which could be made upon it.  The income which could be derived from £2,000 would be insufficient to meet the annual outgoings on those children and therefore I would ask the Minister to meet us on this.</P>
    <P>We should like the Minister to indicate, if possible, what he considers the cost of meeting this case would be.  I suspect the cost would be negligible. The number of families that could benefit by this provision would not be very great but the degree to which they could benefit would be very great to them.  On that account we think it is worthy of the Minister's sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked about this some time ago and I was not able to get any fair idea of the cost of such a proposal.  What Deputy Ryan said in concluding is hardly a logical statement, when he said that the concession would be a big benefit to those who would receive it and would cost the State very little.  It is hard to see how that could be true.  However, I think I know what he means.</P>
      <P>Returning to the question of children, where a man dies and leaves a widow and children, the children and the widow are fairly well treated under the present law.  First the estate duty comes out of the residue.  If there is no residuary legatee, I suppose it is taken from the estate before it is divided between the widow and children.  Having gone so far, the succession duty or the other duty which is also chargeable in some cases, is very low for a widow and children.  If the estate is under £15,000, there is no succession duty at all.  Even a minor child who inherits less than £2,000 is free of succession duty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting this in my own way and I am saying that widows and children are not too badly treated at present.  On an estate of up to £15,000&mdash;it may be more, with £2,000 for each of the children, it might be £25,000&mdash;there is comparatively little duty charged because they are not charged succession duty at all.  Even if they were above that amount, they would be charged only one per cent. Deputies will be aware that the duty is only one per cent where you have a wife and children or a father or mother. If it is a brother or sister or descendants of a brother or sister, the charge is five per cent and for others ten per cent.  There is good treatment under the present law for widows and children.</P>
      <P>I do not know if I can say much more at the moment.  I was asked some time ago by, I think, Deputy Byrne and I was unable to make any estimate of what this might cost.  I suppose if we got some time, we might be able to make an estimate.  It is not altogether the cost but it is so much out of line with the general theory underlying estate duty and succession duty that it would be an entirely new principle which we are not sure should be introduced as it is difficult to see where it might lead us.  Therefore, I must oppose the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that the pattern of death duties here is built more according to the pattern of the British death duties than to the pattern of other continental countries of which I spoke the other day, but let us be clear where the divergence occurs.  It occurs in that the very duties of which the Minister has been speaking and on which he relies have been abolished in Britain where there is no legacy and no succession duty.  It seems hardly logical to rely on that part of the pattern when it has gone over there.  We must make up our minds in the time ahead&mdash;on this subject, I do not want to be wrong in my facts&mdash;first, whether we are to keep <Col N="103" /> death duties as a means of capital adjustment in their existing forms or if we are to keep them on the British pattern.  Then I think we should go the whole way on the British pattern and abolish legacy and succession duties.  We must make up our minds whether we are going over to the continental pattern of which I spoke the other day where emphasis is not so much on the amount of property a person leaves but on whether the person leaves the property to his immediate family or outside it.</P>
      <P>The emphasis in the Common Market countries particularly&mdash;I admit that outside those I know little about the European pattern&mdash;is to a small degree on the total estate a man leaves but to a very high degree on whether he leaves it to his immediate family or to those further away from him by relationship.  There is, of course, no distinction on the continent between estate duty, on the one hand, and succession and legacy duty, on the other. There is one amalgamated death duty in the countries of which I spoke the other day, entirely based on one rate for those within a certain degree of relationship, the widow or the widower and the children and grandchildren on the one hand and those to a greater degree outside on the other hand. Frankly, if one is going to keep death duties at all&mdash;I see objections to their complete and total remission&mdash;I would prefer the continental system so long as I could find a method of tying that in with our double taxation and relief arrangements with Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a combination of estate duty on the whole property and a varied duty according to the relationship of the person to whom the estate is left.  The variation is from 1 to 10 per cent, which is a very big variation.  We could, I suppose, consider, as Deputy Sweetman says, going over this one to ten per cent&mdash;making that a bit higher, and dropping estate duty or, like the British, drop the succession and legacy duty and increase the estate duty to make up for their loss.  We have on the one side the British, entirely estate duty, and the <Col N="104" /> continental system, which is like our succession or legacy duty, but we have both.  I think the system we have is not too bad from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I find the Minister's line somewhat exasperating. We should not concern ourselves with either the British system or the continental system.  I believe the continental system is far more favourable to the large family than is the British one.  The Minister has quoted rates of legacy and succession duty of up to 10 per cent.  This amendment deals with estate duty. If a family man in this country dies and leaves an estate valued for probate purposes at £18,000 the rate of duty applied to that is 12 per cent.  I know of an estate of about £20,000 which includes the value in a substantial amount of the deceased's private residence in which his family have to reside.  The estate is about £20,000 and there is £2,400 estate duty.  That is money taken from small children and an unfortunate widow who will be hard pressed to bring up those children in the manner in which her late husband hoped she would be able to do by reason of his prudence in covering himself for a very substantial sum of insurance.</P>
      <P>Let us have regard to the fact that this is a Catholic country, that we pride ourselves on our large families, that the large family has a special place in our Constitution.  If we do that, we will act accordingly.</P>

    <P>Part III of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956, shall apply as if the product had been exported out of the State by the company, and any amount receivable by the company from the sale of the product to the Board shall be deemed for the purposes of that Part of that Act to be an amount receivable from the sale of goods so exported.</P>

It is provided there that they will continue to enjoy whatever relief they would have got from exports if they had exported them directly rather than through the Board. I omitted to include in that certain dairy produce companies that may be in the same position in case the Milk Board might take over the central exportation of certain commodities, as they, I think, intend to do, in the future.

      <P>I thought myself that sections 8 and 9 were very complicated. I came to the conclusion that the Schedule was more or less the same as section 9.  When I got the explanation of the lot, I came to the conclusion it was better to go back to the Explanatory Memorandum, because it is terse and uncomplicated.</P>

      <P>Nuair a bhí mé ag cur síos ar an Meastachán seo ó chianaibh, dubhairt mé go rabhas sásta leis an dul chun cinn atá déanta maidir le cúrsaí oideachais.  Tuigtear dom go maith go bhfuil sé deacair feabhas a chur ar chóras ar bith oideachais go tapaidh. Tá a fhios agam go maith go bhfuil Aire gníomhach againn ach beidh airgead de dhith fosta.  Fuair na múinteoirí breis tuarastail agus cuireadh deontaisí breise ar fáil dona meánmhúinteoirí. Chomh maith leis sin cuireadh níos mó airgid ar fáil chun cabhrú leis na bunscoileanna agus na coláistí oiliúna.  Chun dul chun cinn <Col N="110" /> níos fearr a dhéanamh, tá orainn breis airgid a sholáthair fosta.  Tá sin fíorriachtanach.</P>
      <P>Ní féidir leis an dtír seo dul chun cinn a dhéanamh muna mbíonn oideachas maith le fáil agus muna mbíonn seans maith ag aos óg na tíre an-oideachas ar fad d'fháil, idir bhun-oideachas, meán-oideachas agus oideachas ollscoile.</P>

      <P>I have not very much to say because the Minister had an Estimate before us a short time ago. I have here the Official Report for Thursday, 14th May, when the Minister introduced his Estimate.  The Minister was very kind.  He gave us a translation but, in the Official Report, the Minister's speech is in Irish only. I have no objection to its appearing in Irish but it is only fair, I think, to 95 per cent of Deputies, including myself, that it should also appear in English.  I just draw your attention to that, Sir.</P>
      <P>We appreciate the Minister's action in relation to Waterford constituency, which I have the honour to represent, and the college of technology.  It is a breath of fresh air to me to have a Fianna Fáil Minister mention my constituency when there is something going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not got it yet, but it was nice to hear it mentioned. I have looked into the eyes of Fianna Fáil Ministers across the floor of this House and they have given me <Col N="111" /> assurances that they were going to do things, including the present Taoiseach and, of course, the Minister for Transport and Power.  But they never had any intention of doing anything.  I have no doubt, however, that the present Minister for Education will do what he said.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a word now about this dispute which is still dragging on between the secondary teachers and the Minister and his Department. As far as I can remember, the history of the dispute is that both the primary teachers and the secondary teachers were going to arbitration.  The result of that arbitration for the primary teachers came out first some time last year.  Evidently the primary teachers were not satisfied and they began to fill up their war chest with the idea of going on strike.  They have a very good organisation and they are very businesslike. Time was in their favour, too, because it was coming towards the end of the year and the Government were doubtfully facing two by-elections. It would not be a good thing to antagonise the primary teachers and the Government, in their wisdom, said: &ldquo;All right; we will give you the benefit of conciliation.'  And they did.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>You can bet your life he will not.  In any case I prefer <Col N="112" /> the Minister to answer me.  I know he will.  The secondary teachers then were not satisfied with their award because it brought the primary teachers up nearer to them than they were before. I have nothing to say to that.  That is their business.  The secondary teachers, however, decided they would go to war.  Time was not so favourable to them and perhaps their tactics were not the best because, as a constituent of mine said to me, they put the Minister in a wonderful position.  If a man is being attacked, he can always say: &ldquo;Hit me now with the child in my arms&rdquo;.  The Minister for Education was in a wonderfully strong position because he could say: &ldquo;Hit me now with 20,000 children in my arms&rdquo;.  I am saying nothing to the Minister about that.  He was a good tactician.  Time was in his favour.  But it was rather tough on the secondary teachers.  I am going to stick my neck out now and say that, if their tactics had been a little better and if they had said, when the pressure was rising against them in the early stages, that their first duty was to the children and they would supervise and mark the examinations, they would have got a great deal of public support.  That is my interpretation anyway.</P>
      <P>The Minister must go on running his Department.  Next September the schools will reopen and the boys and girls will move up into new classes. The secondary teachers are entitled to be treated in the same manner as the primary teachers.  They are not satisfied with the award and they should be allowed to appeal in the same way as the primary teachers were.  I put that seriously to the Minister.  I will say no more about it.  I leave it to him. He is a very reasonable man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that, though the Minister's brief was in Irish, there is no mention of the language in the translation. Many of my constituents are staunch protagonists of the language.  I have asked them what they think about the language and the future.  It is amazing the number who have said that all children are taught a language, irrespective of whether they are born in Tibet or in Ireland.  They first learn to speak the language; then they learn to <Col N="113" /> read it; then they learn to write it.  The idea put to me is that it would be a great improvement if English-speaking children had a course of concentrated oral Irish for a good many terms in the first years at school.  Then, in due time, they could learn to read it and to write it.  I think that idea worthy of consideration. I have no experience of teaching a language and I have no intention of putting forward my own opinion here but, when I hear responsible, successful teachers, some of them specialist Irish teachers, putting forward this view, I think it is only right I should pass it on to the Minister for examination.</P>
    <P>On this Estimate, I always refer to discipline in the schools.  We have a wave of over-benevolence in the world, if I may put it that way; all over the world you have people who say you must not correct a child; or, if a child is slapped, they describe that as brutality, not punishment.  We should have trust in all the teachers of Ireland and should give them discretion.  They should be defended in this House, too. I am not chiding the Minister for this, but I remember a pamphlet which was published and distributed about punishment in the schools.  It was really libellous on all the teachers in the country. It was a scandalous affair, and I was very sorry that Dáil Éireann did not defend the teachers of Ireland more fiercely than they did.  It was just passed over.  A wave of violence comes along from time to time and people say it happens because children are not being taught anything in the schools.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point that I think there is something lacking in the homes.  There should be better parent-teacher relations.  I know this is a difficult task I am giving the Minister, but I cannot see any other way out of it.  At the same time, I do not consider all the younger generation Teddyboys or blackguards.  I consider that only about three per cent can be called juvenile delinquents.  We hear a lot from them, but we do not hear so much from the other 97 per cent who are decent boys and girls.  As I say, we hear very often from the delinquents. The Minister should have that problem examined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> Parent-teacher relations could be organised through a body like the Irish Countrywomen's Association, Macra na Feirme, or the various other organisations in rural areas.  The threat that they can be punished should always be over boys and girls if the teachers are to have a grip on the classes.  It is fine that that should be.  Through the Ministers inspectors, it should also be made known in the schools that some of the old-fashioned discipline and old-fashioned customs which were current in the schools but are now dying out will be restored.  It used to be the custom when a stranger walked into a classroom&mdash;whether a priest or a lay visitor&mdash;for the pupils to stand up. That still happens in a number of schools, but it does not happen in a number of others.</P>
    <P>Good-mannered customs such as that should not be allowed to die out. One evening I saw a television programme on which some teachers were talking about their experiences.  I was very impressed by them and I thought they were a very fine type of people.  I was horrified when one person said that children were being sent to school who did not know how to bless themselves or say their prayers.  I do not blame the Minister for that, but perhaps better parent-teacher relationship could do something about it.</P>
    <P>In regard to vocational education, in Waterford city we have a very fine building.  We also have an extension which was built about eight or nine years ago.  We were very lucky in that two fine Georgian houses became vacant on the Mall and we were able to get them at the right price, as the saying is.  In fact, we got them for practically nothing except that we had to pay the rent.  There are many towns and villages in Ireland with fine Georgian houses which are very hard to heat because the rooms are so big, but they would be splendid as classrooms in technical schools with modern heating.</P>
    <P>I am sold on the idea of vocational education and colleges of technology. For nearly 20 years, we have brought technicians or technologists into the vocational schools to give lectures to students who had made up their minds <Col N="115" /> to work in the various factories.  When we started the Waterford Iron Foundry, we erected a furnace, and the experts gave specialised courses to the boys in the theory of smelting iron and steel, castings and so on.  After a short time, they were shown how to make moulds and how the castings should run.  The art class was combined with the engineering class and they were taught precision drawing, how to make micrometer measurements, and so on. When they entered the factory, they had the theory, and in a matter of a few months, they were earning real money.</P>
    <P>The same applied to the Waterford Glass Factory.  As a matter of fact, so far as the shops are concerned, the glass factory recruit workers from the technical school.  The boys have taken classes in glass-processing and so on, and they can start immediately as they have the theory and the practice, from courses of lectures and text books.  The same applied also to ACEC.  They make transformers and high precision electric goods which are sold in all parts of the world, including Africa, India and South America.  That is an industry of which we can be proud.</P>
    <P>The Allied Irish Foundries are selling their products in Glasgow and I should like to point out that it is a great tribute that they can sell them in Glasgow because there they have the Carron Foundry which is the greatest iron foundry in Great Britain. That is also something of which we can be very proud.  The boys in our foundry were recruited from the vocational school.  The same thing occurred with the National Board and Paper Mill and the Munster Chipboard Company. The promoters of these industries were able to tell the chief executive officer what they wanted, that they wanted certain specialised courses and that they would supply the technicians to give the lectures. That was necessary at the time because nobody here had got around to thinking that we should do this ourselves.</P>
    <P>At the same time, when we have these schools of technology, and the sooner the better, it would be a good thing to follow that policy.  I think the <Col N="116" /> definition is that a technician is a man who has served his time to the business and the technologist knows the same thing but has taken out a university degree.  You have these men teaching in the schools as specialists and it would be a good thing for the Department to say to the men employed by them: &ldquo;Here is a good industry which is going to make such an article in County Clare and we have been in touch with the people who are going to erect this factory and they have Mr. So-and-So and Mr. So-and-So and we would be glad if you would arrange a series of lectures in conjunction with these men.&rdquo; I do not think we could do enough of this sort of thing.</P>
    <P>I have had experience in England of the great care they take&mdash;this might have something to do with their examination system&mdash;in finding boys for specialised training.  There are some great burses or funds in England, and as often as not, the people operating these funds take it on themselves to direct the education of very bright boys.  This would not necessarily mean that they had been bright in school, that they had got 98 per cent in examinations, but it might happen that one of these boys at the age of 12 or 13 might have been able to make a radio for himself, that he had that skill in his hands.  As far as his English, or as far as business methods or anything else would be concerned he might not be able to get 30 per cent in an examination but they take such a boy and give him special attention, and at the age of 15 or 16, he would know more than an electrician who is out of his time and perhaps has spent four or five years in the job.</P>
    <P>I have seen young fellows coming from places where there was no tradition of industry or industrial work such as precision tool-making or anything like that, and these young fellows would have a skill which they had discovered in themselves.  I know of one young fellow from a backward place and there was no kind of stationary engines which he could not fix to the correct timing and so on if it went out of order.  He was only 14.  We have many such boys in the country <Col N="117" /> and it should be possible to have a report made through the teacher that there is such a young boy with exceptional skill in a certain line in such a school.  You might find another Ferguson or a Ford or a Walter Chrysler.  These are the people we are short of.  If you find one of these and he comes up with great engineering gifts, then this is the kind of boy who, when he becomes a man, could build up a great industry.  He could do more to build it up than a £1 million Government grant.  I would ask the Minister not to lose sight of that.</P>
    <P>Lastly I would say to the Minister in regard to building schools&mdash;I mentioned this on the Vote for the Office of Public Works&mdash;that usually when a school is built, it is called after one of our saints or perhaps it might be called after Our Lady, but I would suggest to the Minister that he and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance should get together and say: &ldquo;Here is a school which we are building to Saint Kieran and there should be a statue or a mural or a painting erected to that Saint at the school.&rdquo;  This should be advertised among Irish sculptors and artists so that they would produce a work of art to be put outside the school or into the wall of the school or in the hall of the school.  That would be a great thing for Irish artists and in years to come people would say: &ldquo;These fellows in the sixties were not so bad after all; look at the beautiful works of art they left us.&rdquo;  I have spoken about this on about three occasions and I should like to remind the Minister about it again because it would be something that would perpetuate his name for all time.</P>

      <P>Sílim go nglacann gach duine leis anois gurb é an Meastachán seo an Meastachán is tábhachtaí a thagann os comhair na Dála.  Tá seo fíor mar feictear dúinn nach dtig dul chun cinn ar bith a bheith againn anois gan oideachas agus baineann sé seo go mór le talmhaíocht, le déantúsaíocht agus le gnéithe eacnamaíochta eile de chuid an Stáit.  Bhí an t-am ann nár aontaíodh leis an bharúil seo ach tá an ré sin thart <Col N="118" /> agus i láthair na h-uaire tuigeann gach duine a bhfuil suim aige i gcúrsaí eacnamaíochta an tábhacht atá leis agus ar an ábhar sin tá áthas orainn go bhfuil sé beartaithe ag an Rialtas agus ag an Aire níos mó airgid a chaitheamh ar oideachas ins an bhliain atá romhainn.</P>
      <P>Tá sé beartaithe ag an Rialtas an aois a mbeidh sé ceadaithe ag páiste deireadh a chur lena scolaíocht a ardú go cúig bliana déag, agus go bhfuil scaifte mór dár ndaoine óga ag fáil oideachais go dtí an aois sin faoi láthair is maith an rud é an ardú aoise a bheith ann go h-oifigiúil.  Sé an fáth go bhfuil sé seo a dhíth ná de réir mar atá an fhorbairt tionscail a gabháil ar aghaidh fé mar atá sé fé látháir beidh an dúil ag na daoine óga an scoil a fhágáil chomh luath agus is féidir obair agus páigh a fháil ins na monarcain.  Tá seo le feicéail i mo Dháil cheantair féin fé láthair, agus ar an dóigh sin, caillfidh an duine óg an seans a bheadh aige an scil agus an ceárd a thiocfadh leis a fháil dá bhfanfadh sé fada go leor sa gceárdscoil agus is cuma caidé an rud a dheineadh sé bheadh sé íontach deacair air teacht ar an scil seo i ndhiaidh dó toiseacht ag obair i monarcan.</P>
      <P>Ag tagairt arís don ardú aoise seo, tá sé so-fheicte nach dtiocfadh leat an riail úr seo a chur i bhfeidhm muna mbeadh dóthain múinteoirí ar fáil. Ar an ábhar sin, tá áthas orm go bhfuil aigne an Aire dírithe ar an deacracht seo agus go bhfuil siad fé láthair ag cur leis an Coláiste Oiliúna atá i nDrom Connrach, Coláiste Phádraig.  Beidh i bhfad níos mó múinteoirí ar fáil nuair a bheidh an coláiste seo réidh agus dá bhrí sin, tiocfaidh linn an méid scoláirí atá ins na ranganna a ísliú.</P>
      <P>Tá áthas orm freisin a fheiceáil na scoileanna úra á dtógáil ar fud na tíre. Sílim nár tógadh an oiread scoileanna le blianta fada agus a tógadh anuraidh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I láthair na huaire tá tábhacht an-mhór leis na ceárdscoileanna agus tá a rian sin le feiceáil againn féin ins na Dáil cheantair.  Nuair a thagann duine ó thír iasachta chun monarchain a chur ar bun isí an chéad cheist a chuireann sé ná: &ldquo;An dtig leis na <Col N="119" /> daoine óga a bhéas ag obair ins an monarchain scolaíocht teicniciúil a fháil?&rdquo;  Mar sin tá sé íontach tábhachtach go mbeadh na scoileanna sin againn.  Tá sé tábhachtach chomh maith go mbeadh againn na múinteoirí a thig leo an oiliúint teicniciúil sin a thabhairt dona páistí.  Tá sé íontach doiligh múinteoirí ceárdscoile d'fháil. Sílim féin gurb é cuid den fháth atá le sin go bhfuil na ceárdscoileanna ag iomaíocht fé láthair le déantúsaíocht chun na daoine oilte a fháil.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil airgead níos fearr le fáil ins na monarcain ag daoine atá oilte agus gur fearr leo dul isteach ins na monarcain ná dul le múinteoireacht.</P>
    <P>Tá áthas mór orm a fheiceáil go bhfuil sé socraithe ag an Roinn coláiste teicneolaíochta a chur ar fáil i nDún Dealgan.  Tá coláiste mar seo a dhíth go géar agus bhí sé ciallmhar í a bhunú in áit a bhfuil cuid mhór déantúsaí agus daonradh trom.</P>
    <P>Tá tús curtha leis an obair le h-oideachas a thabhairt dona páistí lag-inntineacha.  Níl mórán déanta go fóill san ghné seo den oideachas, ach tá aire an phobail á dhíriú air anois agus de réir a chéile bhéarfaidh an Stát níos mó cuidiú dó.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuilimíd ag fanacht ar thuairisc ó Choimisiún atá ag amharc isteach sa cheist seo agus ba mhaith liom dá dtiocfaidh leis an Choimisiún an tuairisc seo a chur ar fáil go luath, ach ní h-ionann sin is a rá nach bhfuil rud ar bith á dhéanamh fé láthair le cuidiú a thabhairt do chuid, ar a laghad, de na páistí seo.</P>
    <P>I mo Dháil cheantair féin tá obair mhór á déanamh ag na Bráithre Eoin le Dia.  Tá scoil acu ins an ospidéal atá acu i nDromcarad agus tá múinteoirí oilte ag obair ann.  Ba mhaith liom dá dtiocfadh leis an Roinn na múinteoirí seo a aithint fiú amháin in ospidéal in a bhfuil páistí lag-inntineacha is déine tinnis.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuiltear ag fanacht ar thuairisc an Choimisiúin le cinnteacht a dhéanamh de cé hiad na páistí a bheadh faoin Roinn Sláinte agus cé hiad na páistí a bheadh faoin Roinn Oideachais, ach má shíleann na daoine atá i mbun na n-ospidéal seo <Col N="120" /> go mbaineann páistí tairbhe as an teagasc a fhaghann siad, agus ní bheadh múinteoirí fostaithe acu muna síleadh siad sin, ba cheart don Roinn Oideachais na múinteoirí sin d'aithint.</P>
    <P>Tá sé cinnte go mbeidh cuid de na páistí lág-intinneacha seo faoi chúram na Roinne seo, agus ba mhaith liom a iarraidh ar an Aire pleananna a bheith réidh aige don saghas cúraim agus oibre a bheadh foiritineach do na páistí seo in dhiaidh dófa a bheith oilte chomh fada agus is féidir é a dhéanamh.  Sin, sílim, ceann dos na fadhbanna is mó atá le réiteach againn fé láthair.  Ní socrú ar bith é na daoine óga a chur isteach in ospidéal meabharghalair. Níl an galar sin orthu agus cailleann na daoine óga seo an oiliúint uilig a fhaghann siad taobh istigh de bhliain.  Is ceart a fháil amach caidé an obair a thig leo a dhéanamh gan stró, obair mar seo a chur ar fáil dófa agus tithe maithe, slachtmhar, compordúil a bheith ann dófa fosta.</P>
    <P>Tá obair mhór a dhéanamh san ghné seo den oideachas fosta i ndá scoil, ceann acu i nDún Dealgan agus ceann acu i nDroichead Átha.  Tá an Roinn seo ag cuidiú leis an obair seo. Táimuid buíoch, ach sílim gur ceart i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh agus beidh mé ag súil le seo in dhiaidh tuaraisc an Choimisiúin a bheith ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Ag tagairt arís do mhúinteoirí agus an ollscoil sílim go bhfuil sé in am againn aon aicme amháin múinteoirí a bheith againn in ionad trí cinn mar atá fé láthair.  Muna raibh ann ach aicme amháin múinteoirí bheadh sé in a chuidiú ní hamháin do na múinteoirí féin ach go mór mhór do na páistí fosta, mar bheadh dul chun cinn níos ré in a gcuid oibre.  Sílim féin go bhfuil sé so-fheicse, fé láthair, chomh tabhachtach agus tá sé gan ach aon aicme múinteoirí amháin a bheith againn.</P>
    <P>Rinne mé tagairt anuraidh do cheist an pháipéir úd <i>Amárach.</i>  Ba mhaith liom arís dá scrúdódh an tAire an rud seo.  Má táimid chun na Gaeltachta a choinneál beo caithfimid cabhrú le muinntir na Gaeltachta.  Tá aithne mhaith agam ar an nGaeltacht agus tá fhios agam go mbíonn ar mhuinntir <Col N="121" /> na Gaeltachta na páipéirí Béarla a léamh leis an nuacht áitiúil a fháil. Má leantar de sin, Béarla a bhéas ag na daoine sa deireadh.  B'fhéidir ná fuil an tAire sásta leis an crut atá ar <i>Amárach</i> fé láthair ach sílim gur ceart scrúdú a dhéanamh ar an cheist sin agus sílim go dtiocfadh socrú fóntach a dhéanamh fá dtaobh den cheist uilig.</P>
    <P>Because of the fact that probably every Deputy who speaks on this Estimate speaks about the Irish language, the Minister tends to be looked upon as the Minister for the Irish language as well as the Minister for Education.  Although I must admit that those two matters must have some association, their close association is not, in general, a good thing because it tends to associate the Irish language with the school, and with the school only, in the minds of our people. Those of us who are anxious about the revival of the Irish language realise that if we are to be dependent on the school only our hopes of the revival as we would like to have it are not too bright.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that the school in the non-Gaeltacht areas must be the foundation.  Obviously, the language must be taught if it is to be learned and it must be learned if it is to be spoken and if the people are to have an interest in it.  I should like to stress that, in case somebody misquotes me.  An Coimisiún um Athbheochan na Gaeilge dealt with the main aspects of the revival of the Irish language.  Their report is an exceptionally fine production.  Many of us who are interested in the revival of the language have long been thinking along the lines advocated in the report.</P>
    <P>There are two main aspects to the revival: first, the school aspect and secondly, the aspect outside the school. We are presently re-examining these two aspects and we are once again reconsidering the whole matter and endeavouring to find for ourselves the best methods to advance our aim, which is to have the language spoken again by all our people.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned on the last occasion on which I spoke on this matter, the three main objections put forward by <Col N="122" /> those who are opposed to the revival of the language or who have different ideas on it from mine, are, firstly, that we are introducing our children to the Irish language at too young an age; secondly, that we were teaching our children through the medium of Irish where Irish was not the vernacular, and, thirdly, that the teaching of the Irish language was damaging the education of our children and causing psychological difficulties.  The educational experts who met in Hamburg a few years ago under the auspices of OECD effectively dealt with these objections and showed that these objections must have been common objections where a second language was being taught because, otherwise, they would not have spent so much time dealing with them.  The experts showed that instead of doing harm the introduction of the language to children at a very early age and teaching through the medium of Irish were not only not harmful but a distinct advantage and that the teaching of the language was a very considerable help educationally.</P>
    <P>While I agree with their findings&mdash; from my own experience, I know their findings are correct&mdash;and while I agree we have succeeded in teaching the language to our children to such an extent that it would be most unwise to shout a secret in Irish in any town or village where children were congregated, nevertheless I must ask myself what our aim is and how successful we have been in achieving it.  The aim is, of course, that we would have the Irish language spoken.  In this, I am afraid we must admit we have not been as successful as we would like to be. We have been successful in having the language taught, in having our children understand it, but we have not yet succeeded in having them speak it to the extent we would like.</P>
    <P>If we have not succeeded in having the language spoken as we would like it, and at the same time, as the fundamental principle underlying the teaching of a second language is correct, then there must be something wrong.</P>
    <P>I feel that what is wrong is the insistence of the Department down through the years on stressing too much <Col N="123" /> certain aspects which are not conducive to the speaking of the language. Our aim was to produce Irish speakers and the methods we have been using, if followed to their logical conclusion, would be more likely to produce Irish scholars.  For example, I feel we had too much reading and writing in the national schools and that, because of this, the child is subjected to constant correction in relation to aspects of this matter which have little to do with the spoken language.</P>
    <P>When a child is constantly being corrected in his spelling, in his reading and his writing, in his grammar, it is understandable that after six or seven years of this, it is bound to be psychologically impossible for him to speak the language after school unless he is word perfect in it and, of course, as children of 13 and 14 years are not word perfect, the result is they do not speak it at all.</P>
    <P>We are asked by those in authority and those interested in the revival of the language to speak Irish, whether it is broken Irish or not.  I believe in this.  I believe it is not possible to revive the language unless we adopt this method of speaking Irish, whether it is good Irish or not.  That is how the English language was imposed on us in earlier times.  It is difficult for the child, when his memory of the Irish language is the number of times he was corrected for a variety of errors during his most impressionable years, to speak broken Irish.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the question arises of what are we to do.  Obviously we must now clarify exactly what we want done.  We must clarify for the teacher exactly what we want him to do.  At the present time there is a reappraisal of our methods because of the report of the Commission, and I think that when we are deciding what we should do as the result of this, we should go as far as we believe to be desirable, even if it means knocking over some of the things we held sacred as regards language teaching. I would suggest we eliminate writing in Irish from the school programme to about the fifth class except, perhaps, <Col N="124" /> in the form of transcription which would give the child some idea of writing the language.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in fifth and sixth classes we should teach the children to write simple letters.  I do not think we would have anything to lose by adopting this method.  In our present method it is an aspect of our efforts at revival from which we gained nothing. I suggest further that the vocabulary taught to the children should bear close relationship to the vocabulary of a child in English, or in Irish in the Gaeltacht, in that age group.</P>
    <P>Our problem up to now was to know what that vocabulary was.  When we have got the report of An tAthar Colum Ó hUallacháin we will know what we want and what is expected. I should like to congratulate the Minister for having appointed An tAthar Ó hUallacháin to this important branch of the work.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Irish readers, I feel they should be scientifically graded, particularly having regard to the day and age in which we are living. They should include the vocabulary for the particular age group, with simple forms of grammar, tenses and so on.  I feel that there is no need to introduce reading before third or fourth class.  In the lower classes we should concentrate on simple sentences and rhymes dealing with the child's own life at home.</P>
    <P>I would agree that the ordinary normal language of the school should be Irish.  From experience of teaching the lower divisions, I can say that the child has absolutely no difficulty in following conversation, orders etc. in the Irish language from a very young age.  It is a sensible thing to teach a child the language as young as possible because the child learns his home language at a very young age and the same will apply to the learning of a new language.</P>
    <P>I would do away with formal grammar in the national schools.  The amount of time spent on explaining an tuiseal geinideach, an tuiseal tabharach and the various tenses is pure waste.  At the moment, in the <Col N="125" /> sixth class we have the primary certificate examination and in the papers children must answer questions on analysis and, to a certain extent, parsing.  These are some of the things which give the child the impression of drudgery being attached to the learning of the language.  If we eliminated some of the things I have mentioned and concentrated on oral work we would gain considerably from the point of view of speaking the language.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to say a few words about Fine Gael policy on the language.  We are constantly being told by them that they would remove compulsion from the teaching of the language.  The programme they are putting before the people, if one can call it a programme, is full of inconsistencies.  They say they will do away with compulsion.  If one is to teach in the school at all, there must be compulson because there is compulsion in the teaching of every subject in the school.  Compulsory Irish is a term which is abused at the present time by many people for one reason or another.  It is intended as a term of abuse.  It is long after time we got rid of this phrase &ldquo;compulsory Irish&rdquo; because it really means nothing.  If we put the word &ldquo;compulsory&rdquo; with other words, it is a virtue; if we talk about &ldquo;compulsory education&rdquo;, it is a virtue.  Nobody would dream of suggesting that we should not have compulsory education.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by the Fine Gael Party that the leaving certificate should be awarded to a student, whether or not he passes in Irish.  The problem there is that if you agree to this, some schools will drop Irish altogether. Other schools will select certain pupils to do the Irish paper and the remainder of the pupils will not have Irish as a subject at all.  The result will be that we shall end up in very much the same position as that which now exists in the Six Counties where only seven per cent of the children there learn Irish.</P>
    <P>Suppose certain students decide to do teaching, to go into the training college.  Suppose some of these boys <Col N="126" /> and girls did not take Irish under the system envisaged by Fine Gael.  These boys and girls, could, if their marks were high enough, get into the training college and pass through it, and would then be expected to teach Irish in the schools when they could not speak Irish themselves.  The only alternative would be to compel would-be teachers to learn Irish and that, of course, would be compulsion.</P>
    <P>Take the aspect of the Irish outside the school.  The second main reason why the language is not spoken much more frequently is that, when the child leaves school, he becomes immersed in a sea of Béarla.  He comes to associate the Irish language with the school and with the school only.  A greater effort must be made to Gaelicise our everyday life, to get more Irish in newspapers, more Irish in advertisements, more Irish in the shops.  Some business premises and shops exhibit notices to the effect that business can be transacted there through the medium of Irish where they have the personnel capable of doing it.  In most of the shops in Dublin, they are capable of doing it but only in a very few of them is there a notice to that effect.</P>
    <P>I need not go into the various suggestions in relation to this matter put forward by the Coimisiúin Um Aithbheochan na Gaeilge but some of them are excellent.  We should endeavour to unite the effort outside the school with the effort in the schools.  We must endeavour to show the children that Irish is a living language.  We must endeavour to show them that it is our own language and a national heritage. We must endeavour to show them that it is most important for the future of our nationhood that the Irish language be revived.  It is really part of ourselves and it would be a shocking thing if in this generation, with the means to keep the language alive, we should let it die.  It is pretty obvious that, unless we of this generation make an honest and sincere effort to revive the language, after our day, hope will be gone.</P>
    <P>There are many ways in which we can show our young people that Irish is a living language.  Wherever possible, <Col N="127" /> we can speak it ourselves.  We can encourage them to visit the Gaeltacht. That is about the best method because they can see people there at work in the fields and in the houses and going about their ordinary everyday task while speaking nothing but Irish. Possibly for the first time in their lives, they will find that the Irish language is not something associated with the school but is part of a living nation. In this House and outside it, we should endeavour to co-operate with each other in our efforts to revive the language.</P>
    <P>Anything I have said in criticism of any other policy is sincere and, I hope, constructive criticism.  I do not believe in making the Irish language a partisan issue.  It is much too important for that, and if we do make it a partisan issue, our efforts for its revival will fail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish merely to refer to the Irish language.  We have failed in the revival of the language under the policy carried out during the past 40 years.  Speaking against myself, I may say that 42 years ago I had the gold Fáinne.  I did not learn my Gaelic in school.  I learned it in an internment camp when our former President, Mr. S.T. O'Kelly, decided to teach a group of us the language.  It was resolved that we would meet for a period during the day and speak only Gaelic. We used the expression &ldquo;cuir Gaeilge ar sin&rdquo; and we learned to grasp the language.  Mr. O'Kelly did not give me my Fáinne on the first or even second occasion but eventually I got it.  With my departure to America, my Gaeilge departed, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 15 years ago, my children were playing in the garden on a fine summer evening.  I noted that they were speaking in Gaelic and suddenly it came back to me.  Speaking as a parent, I think teachers must depend quite a lot on the homework of their pupils.  It is a great help to children who are not so brilliant in the classroom. It is important, however, to bear in mind that the mother tongue is not Gaelic.  The mother tongue, in my view, is the language spoken in the <Col N="128" /> home.  I think the display of the Fáinne has done more harm to the revival of the language but I think the introduction of An Nasc, for which I can claim some responsibility, was a good idea.  A person need not have beautiful grammatical Gaelic because I believe bad Gaelic is better than none at all.  During the years, and in the immediate past, a pupil who failed in oral or written Irish in the leaving certificate or primary certificate probably evoked a disgust for Irish in his parents.  We are not helping the language; we are even making the children hate it by using present methods.  I sincerely hope that in the next ten or 20 years the Gaelic language will have taken its proper place in the country.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be misunderstood. I really deplore the teaching methods. I must respect a teacher, as it is his job to teach, but I do not think teaching through the medium of Irish will ever succeed.  It is a very difficult language with no ambiguity.  Consequently, the number of irregular verbs is great and it is a subject that must be presented to the children without anything else to cause confusion, such as grammatical or mathematical terms. I trust there will be a new approach and that a child, in passing out at school, will not be penalised in the language.</P>
    <P>If one put one's name in Gaelic over a shop 44 years ago, one was arrested and then people were attending night-time classes learning a few idiomatic expressions such as &ldquo;Dia 's Muire dhuit&rdquo; and &ldquo;Conas tá tú?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position is changed now.  It is not sufficient just to try to drive it down the throat of the child.  Perhaps I should not use that expression.  Everything is difficult for a child and I agree with the previous speaker that there is a necessary element of compulsion for all subjects that are to be taught.  But there should be an appeal in it also.  If in games there was an extra quarter of an hour for play during school hours with a proviso that boys could not play football unless they spoke Irish, that could help.</P>
    <P>The language is very much alive but it is the approach that is wrong.  I have <Col N="129" /> every sympathy with the teacher trying to teach Algebra or any other subject through the medium of Irish.  &ldquo;Aids to Irish Competition&rdquo; was more or less all your Irish 42 years ago with perhaps &ldquo;Jimín Mháire Thadhg&rdquo;.  I hope the Minister will not only accept our suggestion but go one better.  We have rooms in the basement here where some of the enthusiasts, the fáinneoirí, could give an hour to the Irish language at night and endeavour to bring it back into this House, for example.</P>
    <P>There is much more credit due to those who acquired the language in the difficult way than to those who came to the House as native speakers.  Not only is it to the credit of the present Minister but also of past Ministers for Education that the countryside has been transformed by the many new schools provided.  Even the great United States, with all their progress, have no language of their own.  How proud, therefore, we should be of ours.  I hope every incentive will be given by the Minister to the pupils so that it will be carried home and so that there will be the added help of the mother and father endeavouring to help in the interests of their children.  They cannot help if there is a conflict of approach. That is something I think could be overcome without the expenditure of any great amount of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I liked Deputy Faulkner's speech and I found his references to my Party interesting because the members of Fine Gael hold a multitude of views.  In fact, Fine Gael hold a multitude of views about many things, and I assume the Fianna Fáil Party are in a somewhat similar position, with diverse views in their ranks.  Deputy Faulkner is probably in the Fianna Fáil Party what I am in mine, about midway between both extremes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to remind him that my Party, under its first name Cumann na nGaedheal, began all this.  If they fashioned the instruments through which the language should be restored too severely, we must accept the blame for it.  I suspect that the present Leader of the Fine Gael Party is more adept at Irish than the present Leader of the <Col N="130" /> Fianna Fáil party so that if it is a matter of the Parties having discussions about it, there is nothing between them except some honest confusion and doubt about what we have been doing and whether we have been doing it well.</P>
    <P>If I can interpret Fine Gael policy &mdash;and I suppose I should&mdash;it is that we want to increase the incentive and decrease not only the use of compulsion but even the suggestion that there is compulsion.  I agree that to talk about any subject and use the word &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; is ridiculous in application to education because in all important subjects you must have a certain compulsion but yet we must avoid something that seems to have appeared in the last two generations, an active dislike for the language.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree with any of the methods being used but I listened with interest to an educationist like Deputy Faulkner talking about where he thinks we have gone wrong.  My disagreement lies at a much later stage in life and society when I think no technical appointment should be dependent upon a knowledge of the language.  No skilled person, a technician of any kind, a doctor or an engineer, should require a degree of knowledge of the language which would enable him to defeat a person more fully equipped in technical knowledge. I think we have gone wrong there.  I believe Deputy Faulkner's frank admission of the failure in detail should be listened to because he is quite obviously sincere and he does worry about the results.  We should listen to it.  I believe that we in this generation have not got the right to take any steps to discard the language. Neither have we the right to be incompetent in the methods which we used to restore it.</P>
    <P>There is a very unusual atmosphere in the House debating the Minister's Estimates so very shortly after the Minister brought in his last set of Estimates.  It seems only a few weeks since we had this before us and all the things we said then equally apply today. It does indicate the disadvantage to the House in letting Government business run out of its proper time.  It <Col N="131" /> seemed to be too late last year and it seems to be too early this year.  That telescoping of time prevents us from having a fair picture, obscures the picture of what is being done and what is proposed to be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted figures in comparison with the past to indicate the Government's interest in education as expressed in terms of money and, roughly, over the period he quoted the present figure is £25 million as against £16 million then, an increase of something over 50 per cent, although the Budget estimates for the entire Government service are 100 per cent up.  If the cost of running the State is doubled, the Education Estimate should be doubled also if we are as sincere as we say we are about the need to devote a great portion of our wealth to education Even if we add the promised Supplementary Budget which the Minister requires for increased salaries, the Estimate is still not maintaining its place in the pattern of State expenditure.</P>
    <P>I believe that in inflationary conditions such as we have now, and which none will deny that we have now, any comparison should be of proportions of the whole.  It is only reliable when you use that kind of equation.  If you use the money equation, it is false.  On this basis, we are spending less of our whole Budget on education than we spent in the '30's.  We are spending a smaller proportion of the whole and I think the needs of the nation require that a much a larger proportion of Government income should be devoted to education because what was good enough in the '30's is not good enough today.</P>
    <P>In primary, secondary and university education we have the weapons which we must sharpen and make more competent so that the generation who are now coming can do the nation's work in future.  There is one complete section of education, that is, vocational and technological education, which must be refashioned completely.</P>
    <P>The Minister evinced great awareness of this last year but there are no proposals in this year's speech of his. <Col N="132" /> The Minister should beware of paper planning because an ounce of achievement is worth a ton of paper.  I should like to know what practical things have been done to turn his glowing proposals of last year, and which were referred to by one speaker as the banner headlines, into bricks and mortar.  What consultation has he had with educationalists and with those who run the existing institutions?</P>
    <P>I am not talking as a politician when I say to the Minister that his time is short because all our time is short. The fruitful years are very quickly over.  The Minister will find his greatest difficulty is the overcoming of inertia, not his own inertia alone, but the inertia of institutions and vested interest.  Ordinary men can hold office but it takes more than an ordinary man to effect change and to get something done.  The Minister ought to keep his eye on the clock&mdash;and I do not make reference to the late hour at which I intervene in this debate.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the Minister's current headache is this dispute with the secondary teachers and I am sure it is a source of distracting worry to him. I hesitate to make any comment about it because I can feel the difficulties in the situation.  It is a very tricky subject and I do not want to add to his difficulties.</P>
    <P>Of course, the kernel of the dispute is status and that is a very prickly subject always.  It is very easy to ridicule the secondary teachers on this issue and it is very difficult for them to keep on asserting it but it is the kind of thing that affects all human beings.  It was very distasteful to divide people on an issue such as this but it is a very easy thing to do.  The Minister should resist the temptation to do so.  He should be very careful not to use this easy weapon to depress the secondary teachers' salaries in relation to other salaries.  The differential has always existed.  It has been narrowed and is now diminishing. The reasons for it are, I am assuming, traditional.  They state that they undergo longer training and require higher qualification.  The ultimate result, if it is going to be a happy result, should see the old pattern restored, reconstituted, <Col N="133" /> and the sooner it is done the better because nobody can win this battle and least of all the Minister and the children.  It should be ended now.</P>
    <P>I want to say that restoring this differential&mdash;which means, of course, appealing to the Minister for Finance to help you&mdash;does not depress the salaries of other groups of teachers. I do not have to say to the Minister, because I am sure he has learned it after his three or four years in Marlboro Street, that teachers bring attitudes and habits from the classroom and it makes them a difficult category to deal with.  They have a habit of instructing us all.  We will just have to make allowance for them because generally they are dedicated people and very often friends of their pupils for life.</P>
    <P>In the past, the teacher, particularly the secondary teacher, had position and respect without very great rewards. Now the rewards have improved and this kind of setback, this present dispute, makes them uncomfortable and puts them in a role that I am sure is very distasteful to them.  We should try to settle now because we want them badly now, not because of the forthcoming examinations, but we want this atmosphere removed from the schoolroom because I believe that secondary education is of vital importance and that is why the teaching staffs at this juncture should be well satisfied. Equally important, of course, is vocational education and technical education. All post-primary education is important.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion that this estimate was before the House one Deputy said he felt secondary education was an encouragement to snobbery.  Of course, that is absolute distortion.  The kind of snobbery the Deputy referred to probably comes from about one per cent of the secondary schools but the remainder of our secondary students are products of very low-priced schools, generally run by religious.  The end products are our most important citizens and the more we have of them the better.  They run our businesses, industries and professions.  They run our trade unions.  We would be very poor without them.  We can never sufficiently <Col N="134" /> reward those men, those religious, who have been undertaking this work of secondary teaching over the last century.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased proposals of expenditure in regard to secondary education, increased capitation grants, but particularly the increased buildings grants.  This is an overdue thing because many of our secondary schools, particularly those run by the Orders, are virtually in a state of collapse. The only fear I have is that they are all so desperately in need of restoration, rebuilding and expansion that the clamour for grants will become too great and the queue will be a long one.  I hope the proper priorities are established.  Let the well-to-do ones wait if you can, but make sure the very poor ones in the small towns get a break.  I think the Minister might lower the figure he suggested of pupil rolls for grants.</P>
    <P>We cannot overestimate the importance of secondary education.  Our success in the future will be decided by the men and women coming from these schools.  I want to refute what was said here about their being places where snobbery is produced.  There is absolutely no class involved in this matter.  The only class involved is that imposed by brains sharpened up by good education.  We should hear no more about it.  We have trouble enough without inventing a class struggle.  There is no great difference in wealth between any of us in Ireland. I know men from the poorest homes in my native city who are now running great businesses and institutions in Ireland.  The system that accomplished that is worthy of the utmost regard and we should not spoil it by allowing a bad spirit to develop among the teaching personnel.</P>
    <P>We have great leeway to make up. In the current issue of <i>Studies</i>, an article by Thornley gives the figure for seven or eight years ago&mdash;I am sure it has not changed much&mdash;of the proportion of Irish children from 15 to 19 years of age who move into secondary, vocational or technical schools.  He says it is 36 per cent.  He quotes a figure for Northern Ireland of 75 per cent and for Great Britain <Col N="135" /> of 88 per cent.  If these figures are true, they show a startling contrast. They will have to change.  That is the Minister's task.  The so-called banner heading proposals he made last year indicate his mind is moving in the right direction.  I had hoped we would have heard something about them in his speech, that after consultation with all the interests involved&mdash; school owners, managers, teachers and local authorities&mdash;he would have made firm proposals.  The Minister for Finance would have to be harnessed to the job also.  I want the Minister to remember the clock is ticking away. I should like to see him do it before he goes out of office.  He is the first Minister his Party has produced from whom I get any hope.</P>
    <P>The need for expansion in vocational education is not denied by anybody. The old concept of vocational education has gone for good.  It is now more than hobby training and a smartening up of the local carpenter. It provides very advanced training in techniques of an advanced kind in the trades and crafts.  In many respects it moves into fields of the most modern technology.  The existing difficulties are buildings and staff.  I want to speak about the city of Cork from my own knowledge.  There we run five schools, including a school of music and a school of art.  We have a large pupil roll.  We have a continuing and growing demand for those courses, particularly in science, engineering and technical crafts.  I have spoken before, on the occasion of the Minister's last Estimate, on the collection of nondescript buildings in which we carry on this training.  We are continually squeezing in pupils, although we expend almost £200,000 a year on the scheme.  That is necessary because of Cork's growing industrial activity and its potential in that regard.  I use the word &ldquo;potential&rdquo; advisedly, because the growth is obvious.  You cannot take classes of this kind off the peg. The future needs must be anticipated.</P>
    <P>We have made the case for the provision of a major technical college to relieve the pressure.  The Department <Col N="136" /> now should indicate its assent in principle to the proposal.  If there is temporary money difficulty &mdash; and there was never a Government without money difficulty&mdash;let us be assured of a reasonable priority in this matter so that all the delaying detail that always takes place when final assent is given may be dealt with in the interim period.  This is Cork's number one need and that is why I mark it urgent. Some millions have been spent in Dublin for this purpose in recent years although the proportionate industrial growth in Cork is greater.  I want the Minister to bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>One of our difficulties is getting teachers for advanced subjects.  The Department should consult with the universities on this matter.  Perhaps some adjustment of salaries may be needed if we are to get the men.  If we want the best students, we must have the best teachers.  The Minister may, but I will not, see the result of all this. It is a result well worth building up for.  This kind of investment in money and men is necessary now.  It should be the number one subject.  If the Minister had been in the House last week, he might have heard that the expenditure on the Naas road is close on £200,000 per mile.  I leave that thought with him in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is one detail about the Cork scheme not requiring money.  For five years the Cork Vocational Committee have run a school for architects.  It has been very successful.  We provide a three-year course in which the students are taken as far as the intermediate standard.  From that they move either to offices or universities and complete the course.  The first course has been completed and every student is now in professional employment earning very high money in Ireland, Great Britain or America.  The second course is coming to its end.  It seems to be equally promising.  The Department are withholding the permission essential to begin the third course next session.  I do not know why.  The course costs almost nothing.  It is self-supporting. If it stops, parents must send their children to Dublin or to Great Britain to be professionally taught.  The costs could be prohibitive for poor families, <Col N="137" /> and clever children might have to take up some other way of life&mdash;children who might have a gift for this profession. The results have been very good.  I venture to say that the results per class are better than in any of the schools in Dublin.  Is it centralisation? I do not think it can be.  We will have to get a decision about it at once and I should like the Minister to refer to it in his closing speech.</P>
    <P>Are there sufficient hotel training courses?  I am continually being asked about this.  I should like a reference to it by the Minister.  I am very satisfied with the increase in scholarships.  I am one of those who believe there should be no means test because I regard a scholarship as recognition of a child's ability.  It is a great reward for a child to be given a scholarship.  The money is not nearly so important as the stimulus provided to get on in life.  The proportion of no-means test scholarships in the local authority to which I am attached is, I think, too low and we should move it up a bit.</P>
    <P>Another curious subject I had been asked to raise here is the position of young Irish men and women teachers who go to teach in African countries. I believe the Minister has already heard about this.  I regard this as a great 20th century work.  These teachers generally teach with missionary foundations and they help mankind in general.  In particular, they help Ireland in doing this work.  Is there a hitch about recognition of this service when these young people return to work here?  If there is, it is something we should attend to.  They spend enough, I think, in giving five, six or eight years in helping these people in tropical climates to emerge from darkness. We should thank them rather than penalise them.  We should certainly not show ingratitude and we should confer on them the same addition of service they would have earned had they continued to work here in much more comfortable circumstances.</P>
    <P>It has often struck me that there are other things we could do in this matter of helping emergent countries. We are at the moment engaged in the praiseworthy work of bringing personnel <Col N="138" /> from these foreign countries, Africa in particular, for training in the art of government and administration. I refer particularly to the development of Northern Rhodesia.  I think that is a splendid thing.  I wonder could secondary schools be helped occasionally to bring students here. There are other empires than the ones we traditionally hear about and we, by history and tradition, are very fitted, I think, for this work.</P>
    <P>I shall leave education alone now and speak about the National Gallery. I have considerable hopes for the new director because he seems to have a knack of having very good public relations in art matters, and that is as important as anything else.  The Charlemont Gallery, and the public interest in that Gallery, is a tribute to him.  From what we can see, there is a fine collection in the National Gallery&mdash;from what we can see.  I have raised this for some years past now. I want to find out what we have there. Will somebody tell me?  I want to find out about plans for the extension to which reference was made.  Where will the extension be?  Who is designing it? These things are of interest to us all. I should like to see a catalogue of the works because I am pretty sure we have some fine things.  I am also pretty sure we have some rubbish.  Maybe we have more rubbish than fine work and really do not want a great deal more space.  Someone should examine what is in store as well as on the walls and discard what is not good enough. Even if we get only a mimeographed catalogue it will be valuable.</P>
    <P>I have asked before to be informed about the policy pursued by the governors.  Are they attempting to build schools of painting?  I should like to know what their proposals are It is a very bad time for galleries to get into the market.  I suspect one of the things the new director will do will be to fix attention on the Gallery by invitation exhibitions.  I envy the citizens of Dublin the treasures they have on their doorstep.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what progress has been made with the legislation passed through the House to make provision <Col N="139" /> for lending pictures.  How much lending has been done?  Has the lending been hampered by the charges embodied in that legislation?  Is the insurance provision too high?  I should like the Minister to answer the question I asked last year about the insurance of the Gallery itself and the works there.  Can we possibly carry it if we relate it to present day values? Can we bear it if we try to value these pictures at the prices some of them might fetch on international markets? I think we should seriously consider carrying that risk ourselves because, if the cover we have does not bear any relation to current values, it seems ridiculous to waste money in premiums.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the new director and the governors that they might run a series of lectures on TV, as the BBC with Clarke, taking various schools from the Gallery and letting the people see them on the television screen and learn the kind of property they own. These programmes would, I think, whet the public interest in the Gallery.  I should like to know how the sales of reproductions are going on and where the reproduction is done.  Is the printing facility available in the city for that work?  The modern method of reproducing great works of art through the lantern slide is very cheap and these reproductions are a great attraction to visitors to foreign galleries who go home with a dozen lantern slides of the famous works they have seen.</P>
    <P>In addition to ordinary educational responsibilities, the Minister is also responsible for the graces of living, music and art.  His work, if it is well done, will add to the richness of life here.  It is, of course, part of real education and he will add a great deal of grace to the educational machine by ending this irritating dispute with the teachers.  As I said earlier, we would all gain by that&mdash;the children, the teachers and the Minister.  The Minister's task is to ensure that our children reach and move through adolescence as something more than examination passers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> Character is, I think, more important than skill.  Well contented, properly rewarded teachers can endorse and support the efforts of parents in the forming of character.  Courtesy and civic responsibility are acquired involuntarily from good precept and example.  On the whole, I suppose the young people are reasonably good. Whatever relationship exists between the occurrences at Clonmel recently and similar occurrences at the seaside resorts in Great Britain, these must be attributed to some relaxation in guidance either in the home or in the school.  I think it is the duty of all of us to ensure that such ugly occurrences are so rare as to be remarkable.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of debate by people who want to protect children from firm teachers.  I remember a debate in the Seanad some years ago during which I asked the mover if there was any chance of starting a society to protect the teachers and people like him from the children. There has been a tendency during the last few generations to believe we come into this world without any original sin.  Certainly these outbreaks in Clonmel and Great Britain, concerted outbreaks of savage destruction and the calculated outraging of all civilised conduct, are a very frightening development.  It must emerge from some dreadful vacuum in the minds and lives of these young people.  That, of course, is an indictment on all of us, teacher and parent.  We have not reached the British level yet, but Clonmel is a symptom and I think we would do well to heed it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>The demand for increased secondary and university education for every boy and girl is a very easy and a very attractive one to make. On the face of it, and in view of the ever-growing admiration for the welfare State, to me there does not seem to be much we can say against it, but there are aspects which we would do well to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, there is the question of cost.  It is questionable if, with the best will in the world, the Government can embark upon the colossal project of providing every boy and girl in the State with free secondary education. <Col N="141" /> To my mind, the time may come perhaps when the overall increase in the national wealth, and the consequent prosperity of our people, will make that project a practical and feasible one.  In the meantime, much can be done to ensure that the greatest possible number of boys and girls are given every possible educational opportunity.</P>
    <P>The State can play its part by increasing the various grants and bonuses at present payable to the managers of secondary schools, and so enable them to reduce their fees.  More scholarships could be provided not only by the State, but by the municipal authorities, and by private interests. There are many industrial and commercial enterprises which are enjoying the fruits of Irish progress, and their presence here is an expression of confidence in the country's future.  How better can they renew and extend that confidence than by investing in the country's youth?  The boys and girls which those concerns could help to secondary schools or university, or both, are the men and women of the future upon whom well may depend the successful continuance of Ireland's economic growth.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that the State will take over an ever-increasing share in the responsibility for education.  Let us not be deluded into the belief that State-subsidised education is the panacea for all our intellectual, social and cultural problems.  State control in this vital element of our lives can be a two-edged weapon.  With one edge we can cut away the economic barriers, but there is another equally sharp edge which, in the wrong hands, could do incalculable damage to many of the principles which we in Ireland hold very dear.  Those are Christian principles, and in them are enshrined the laws of charity, brotherhood and our dependence upon God.  We cannot, perhaps, visualise any group of Deputies abusing the power which State-controlled education might give them, but the danger inherent in such a system exists, nevertheless, and we should be slow in introducing it.</P>
    <P>It also seems to me that in the demand for compulsory raising of the <Col N="142" /> school leaving age we are presented with something of a paradox.  On the one hand, we have the psychologists and psychiatrists, and all the alleged experts in human behaviour, telling us that our children are now developing at a much faster rate than previous generations, that they are reaching the age of reason and manhood and womanhood at a much earlier age than did the children of, say, 30 or 40 years ago.  To my mind, that would seem to be a good reason for leaving the school leaving age as it is at present, if not for reducing it.</P>
    <P>Another good reason why we should think carefully before raising the school leaving age is that with the increase in family incomes, more and more children are attending secondary and vocational schools because parents can now afford to sent them.  Our secondary schools are full to capacity, and our need now is for more schools. The Government are taking the reasonable and correct course in arranging legislation whereby grants can be given to existing bodies towards the erection of new schools.</P>
    <P>It also seems to me that parents can be induced by the provision of adequate family income to send their children voluntarily to vocational or secondary schools and universities. Very soon the problem of raising the school-leaving age will have been solved in a manner in keeping with our traditions of independence and individual dignity.  In that way our secondary schools will be enabled to preserve their independence&mdash;an independence which it might be unwise to take from them in view of the colossal contribution which the schools have made towards the development of the youth of the country over the years.</P>
    <P>In the field of university education, there appears to be a need for more facilities for the practical study of atomic energy.  Students in the faculty of science are at a disadvantage in this respect.  Modern science seems to be centred around the splitting of the atom and the use of the tremendous energy thus released.  Students in this field are handicapped by the lack of the necessary facilities for atomic <Col N="143" /> research and the need for a nuclear reactor which would give our young scientists practical experience in their chosen field.  Possibly the cost might be prohibitive at the moment, but perhaps the Minister could examine the possibility of enlisting the aid of one of the international organisations which are prepared to help in the advancement of science.  It might, for instance, be possible to provide in the new science building in Belfield a small nuclear reactor similar to the one provided recently in Cork.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the increase in the grant-in-aid to the Royal Irish Academy of Music in Westland Row. That academy has done, and is doing, tremendous work in the teaching and spreading of an appreciation of the great art of music.  In order to attract the greatest possible number of pupils the fees must be kept to a minimum. The hard economic fact must be faced that the academy cannot pay its way without some form of grant.  In fact, an organisation such as this could hardly be expected to pay its way, devoted as it is to the cultural advancement of our people.  It is no less than justice that the academy should share in whatever economic progress the country may achieve.</P>
    <P>I should like to support the recommendation made by Deputy Colley, speaking on the Estimate last year, for greater co-operation between parents and teachers.  Too often the blame for unmannerly or unworthy behaviour of children is placed on the teacher when in fact the first cause could be the home.  Discussion between parent and teacher, at an early stage of the child's school life, could go a long way towards producing a better type of citizen.  Such co-operation could also help in forming a decision as to the direction in which a child's best interest lies.  It would also lead to the realisation of the idea of the school being an extension of the home and help to make the home what it should be, that is, the best school of all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the last week, a matter has been brought to my notice which I should like to draw <Col N="144" /> to the Minister's attention.  I do not know enough about the individual concerned to know if he is a good or bad teacher but the principle is one which needs attention.  In a school not five miles from Dublin within the past few weeks, the headmaster called on all pupils to subscribe or obtain from their parents three shillings for the purpose of purchasing a motor mower to cut the grass surrounding the school.  One applauds the idea of keeping school surroundings tidy and one would like to see that done more frequently because in some of the modern schools in which landscaping has been carried out, the care leaves a great deal to be desired.  It is a bad example to the parents and children.</P>
      <P>In the school in question, like most national schools, the children are of poor parents and to many of the parents a levy of 3/- is a luxury in which they could not indulge and some children may find themselves put in an awkward position <i>vis-à-vis</i> other children and will to some extent feel in an inferior position.  Perhaps a teacher who is not well disposed to those who do not subscribe to such a fund may involuntarily take it out on the children.  In this instance, when some children did not obtain the money from their parents, either because the parents did not pay it or could not afford it, the teacher called aside the children who had not paid the 3/- and inquired of them if they had any personal savings in a money box, in the post office or elsewhere, and those children who admitted they had were charged with taking out of their savings 3/- for the motor mower.</P>
      <P>I cannot think of any better way to discourage children from saving than to have a teacher raid their money boxes even for a laudable purpose.  It is the kind of thing that would encourage children to be dishonest and not admit that they had savings.  I propose to make some further inquiries into the matter and I hope having raised it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, if the opportunity arises.  I have not mentioned any names.  I have been told this by the mother of a child attending the school. It would be unfair to pillory the individual concerned because I am told that the headmaster is a very good headmaster and I should not like to pillory him.  The principle is wrong and my own view&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister on more occasions than one has declined to state the findings of his particular inquiries because of the undesirability of pillorying individual teachers.  I can understand that&mdash;it would create bad relations between the teacher and the parents and the children, and would be very bad for discipline, and in the long run bad for the children.  I will make further inquiries and communicate with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to an aspect of school life in Dublin which is undesirable and that is what I might call the commercialisation of schools.  It appears that some salesmen have access to school rolls and get the names of parents of children attending the school for the purpose of canvassing the homes for the sale of encyclopaediae and other items which might attract parents to part with some of their hard-earned money in the interests of their children.  Not infrequently, these salesmen attend the schools during school hours for the purpose of canvassing and of distributing their wares and advertising matter and the <Col N="146" /> children return home from time to time seeking funds for the purchase of some of these items being advertised in the school.  Again we have the position that the children who are denied the money go to school feeling in an inferior position <i>vis-à-vis</i> children who are given the money.  This is undesirable. Where we acknowledge the right of children to free primary education, we should not allow these State-subsidised institutions to be used for private commercial purposes.  I hope the Minister, if he has not already done so, will direct his attention to this and ask the teachers involved to desist from this practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBarron" hpid="Mr. Barron Mr. Barron">

      <P>Is it not a matter for the manager of the school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a matter for the manager, the time has come to say that the manager may not be allowed to do this because he is accepting public funds.  In some case, the managers could not care less.  While we all acknowledge the virtue of the managerial system, it is undesirable to allow these abuses to exist simply because we accept the wisdom of the managerial system and acknowledge it as possibly a virtue over direct State control.</P>
      <P>That brings me to another matter which the Minister from time to time has said is a matter for the manager and not for him.  In many parishes in Dublin where there are schools run by religious orders, by lay teachers and under the managerial or parochial authorities, you have children from the one family, boys and girls, attending different schools, with different hours and different lunch times.  Where children are of tender years, this imposes undue hardship on the mother who has to bring the children to school and home again.  I have asked for uniformity of hours in this connection and the Minister has said he was not prepared to interfere but it has reached crisis proportions in some cases.</P>
