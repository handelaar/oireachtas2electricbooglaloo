      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition have always been very reasonable in their approach to a very urgent and extremely important matter of national importance such as this.  That is why I am very anxious to contrast the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party when in opposition and the approach by Fine Gael in opposition to such a matter.</P>
      <P>It is on record, and it is no harm to have it placed on record again, that the Fine Gael Party have always and always will put the national interests before Party interests.  That is why the Taoiseach and the Government have the support and co-operation and, indeed, the goodwill and good wishes of all sides of this House in any serious efforts they may make to offset the very serious effect which the British levy will have on Irish industry.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, we had the announcement from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the steps the Government have taken and will take in this very important matter.  Not alone does the existence of many of our industries depend completely on the attitude of the Government but the economic existence of large numbers of our workers employed in all branches of Irish industry depends on it, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> We see that the Government have considered this matter since their talks with the British Government.  I cannot help wondering why the Government did not give some serious thought to this problem before they went to Britain in order to have their case fully prepared for submission to the British Government.  It is not correct that the Government had no idea that a levy of this character would be imposed because any Government faced with a balance of payments problem such as Britain was faced with was sure to give consideration to the question of a levy of this character.  In view of the concessions we gave to Britain in regard to imports when we were faced with similar balance of payments difficulties in 1956 I would have expected that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Taoiseach would certainly leave nothing undone and would use all their negotiating ability to endeavour to see that the British would give us the same treatment now.</P>
    <P>It may be said that the British gave no notice of their intention to impose the levy.  It is really worthy of note that in the Council of Europe a resolution was passed registering a protest against the hasty introduction, without notice, of the levy and that whilst there were a large number of abstentions there was not a single vote in the Council of Europe approving of Britain's action.</P>
    <P>The British market is the one most convenient to us.  Not alone is Britain our nearest neighbour but we have what we can describe as a guaranteed market within a stone's throw of us. That is why I feel that no matter what steps we may take, it should be the aim of any Irish Government to cultivate, as far as possible, the extension and expansion of trade with Britain by every means.  When we see that the principal export market for most of our industries is in the United Kingdom and when industrialists tell us there is still ample scope for tremendous expansion there, that is good reason why we should have frequent consultation if not at ministerial level, certainly at senior civil service level, <Col N="788" /> with the British Government so that the situation may be reviewed at least every six months.</P>
    <P>In recent days the Government have had to consider what line of action they propose to take to minimise the effects of this levy on Irish industry. Any steps they take are welcome but let us hope these steps will be farseeing, feasible and practicable.  One of the proposed steps is the payment of market development grants to cover 50 per cent of the extra cost of the levy. That will be welcomed in itself by manufacturers and will considerably help towards offsetting the effects of the levy, but more important is the guarantee from the Government that they have decided to postpone next year's 10 per cent reduction in import duty.  That was stated by the Taoiseach and reinforced by the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Many branches of Irish industry, such as textiles and cloth generally, are worried about their position because I feel those industries are not sufficiently geared up to meet a further 10 per cent reduction in import duty.</P>
    <P>Another step to be taken by the Government is to request new trade discussions with the British Government at ministerial level.  We should like to hear from the Taoiseach whether a subcommittee of the Government are preparing the plans and programme for those talks.  No responsible Prime Minister or Minister for Industry and Commerce will go to meet the British Prime Minister or President of the Board of Trade without having their plans prepared and based on facts that will stand examination and be ready for the consideration of their opposite numbers in Britain.  The time is ripe for such serious consultation with the British Government and the time has come when we must consider our position in regard to Britain, not for the time being but for the long-term.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Government have any long-term policy to deal with the stabilisation of our industries, the finding of new markets, the extension and expansion of existing markets and I wonder if they consider that Córas Tráchtála have given the results <Col N="789" /> in that regard that were expected when this body was established.  Because of our geographical position in close proximity to Britain one would expect that the closest possible measure of co-operation would exist between the two countries in trade matters and that neither our Government nor the British Government would take hasty decisions detrimental to each other.  One cannot help feeling that in recent years there must be some great loss of contact between the two countries because while the agreements that were made in the past by the Cumann na nGaedheal and the inter-Party Governments reflected great credit, it must be admitted, much as we do not like it and much as we on this side sympathise with the sincere efforts of this Government, that there has been a high degree of failure in the talks that have taken place between the British and the members of our Fianna Fáil Governments.  Nobody knows why, whether it is because the Fianna Fáil people have not got the same negotiating ability, whether they do not present a case based on facts and commonsense or whether it is that they are easily brow-beaten by the eloquence of the other side, they always seem to come out with nothing or they go in with something and come out with less.  We have had that experience.</P>
    <P>Unless the Government are going to negotiate on the basis of getting something, of giving something to gain something, they will not succeed.  In all discussions and negotiations of the kind we envisage, there must be give and take.  In the past so far as Fianna Fáil were concerned, our experience always was that the British seemed to be taking all and giving nothing.  In recent times we had the sad spectacle of the Danes wiping our eye at considerable financial loss to us in a very important section of the British market while none of our Ministers at the time, particularly the Taoiseach, seemed to express alarm at it.  But the moment a levy is clamped on without notice, there seems to be panic&mdash;may we so describe it &mdash; within the ranks of the Government.  Within the past few days, the Government have given the impression that panic has existed, and that once again the Fianna Fáil Party <Col N="790" /> appear to be, on the surface, the saviours of Irish industry and the saviours of the medium of employment of tens of thousands of industrial workers in this country.  I hope and trust that the Government will be honest in their approach to this matter and realise that our industrial workers and our manufacturers know very well that they can compete with the very best in the world.  The reason they can compete with the best in the world is that they can produce as good a quality article for export to Britain, or indeed, for export to any other country as can be exported by the best.</P>
    <P>I wonder will a Buy Irish campaign be in any way helpful to the kind of industries which we have that are already fully catered for in the home market or where the export market is entirely and completely essential for our own business?  Last night I referred to how sad it is for us, after 40 years of native Government, to have to ask our people to be so fully patriotic as to buy Irish. Do we not all know Irish industry in this country has come to stay?  Do we not all know that there are tens of thousands of skilled industrial workers, thousands of industrial operatives and thousands of homes with wives and families depending entirely on the output of industry and on the employment which industry is giving and that it ought not be necessary to appeal to the patriotic sense of the people?</P>
    <P>I suppose in the times we are living in that that is necessary because we Irish seem to have a poor opinion of what we can do ourselves and we seem to have a high opinion of what foreigners can do, even though it may be far from the quality of what we can do ourselves.  Now that the Government are making an appeal to the general public, local authorities, retailers and wholesalers to push forward the sale of Irish goods in every possible way, realising that such a campaign is necessary in present circumstances, they ought not spare money on the campaign if they think it can bring beneficial results.</P>
    <P>It is only right to say on an occasion such as this that the Buy Irish campaign seems to arise only when <Col N="791" /> there are difficulties in our export market and it is only right to pay tribute, as the Taoiseach has done, or as the Minister for Industry and Commerce or somebody else did last night, to the voluntary work that has been carried on over the years since 1906 by the Irish Agricultural Development Association here.  They embarked upon their own scheme and plan to push forward the sale of Irish industries.  I wonder whether they, or other organisations like them, over the years, have been given credit for pushing the sale of Irish goods?  It is only when some kind of temporary difficulty like the present arises that one realises the work these organisations have been doing very patriotically down the years for pushing the sale of Irish goods.</P>
    <P>Another step which the Government propose to take is the provision of more money for Córas Tráchtála to seek new markets.  I wonder are the Government quite satisfied beyond the shadow of a doubt that Córas Tráchtála, at the present time, and as presently organised, are really worth the extra cost?  An opportunity should be given frequently to this House to discuss the activities of Córas Tráchtála. I am quite satisfied that Córas Tráchtála activities in the USA and Canada leave a lot to be desired.  Now that we are going to enter into consultations with the British, it is high time the Government examined the whole question, apart entirely from our markets in the United Kingdom and that we approach this matter from an economic point of view as to what is the best means of providing new markets for all that we can produce.</P>
    <P>Our export market to Germany has considerably improved.  I want to ask to what extent are Córas Tráchtála responsible for that?  Our exports to France have improved in some spheres. That is why I should like the Minister for Industry and Commerce to examine whether it might not be necessary to establish, apart entirely from Córas Tráchtála, trade commissioners with practical knowledge of buying and selling and practical knowledge of the quality of Irish goods and who would be good salesmen.  We may <Col N="792" /> have highly qualified civil servants who know their job.  We are all proud to say that the Civil Service in this country is as good as any Civil Service in the world.  They are highly trained and know their job well but I wonder whether we have the best possible salesmen in the world for pushing our goods in foreign lands?</P>
    <P>Many new States have come into existence in recent years.  We know transport difficulties, freight charges, cost of transport and many other items come into consideration.  Those are matters which can be ironed out at Government level.  Have we the salesmen to do that and are we satisfied that the full extent of the Irish market in Britain has been explored?  I believe we could export as much more to Britain and the USA.  We could have a very valuable export trade with Canada and we could have very valuable export markets with many countries where no effort has been made by the Government to develop and seek those markets.  If Córas Tráchtála are prepared to spend large sums of money on staff and office equipment, the Minister for Industry and Commerce should send for that body and say to them: &ldquo;It is your job to recruit efficient staff and practical salesmen who can go to these countries and solicit good markets for what we produce&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We slip up badly in our salesmanship.  We are very bad sellers of good articles abroad.  The time has come for the Government to review all this and if Córas Tráchtála are to go out of existence, let them be replaced by something more practical, something which will give quicker and better results.  I am sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce is most certainly aware of the many complaints that have come from time to time about the lack of organisation abroad on the part of Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>On the contrary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so.  I propose to give the Minister for Industry and Commerce the name of one of the most outstanding businessmen who is owner of a chain of stores <Col N="793" /> at Jackson Heights in New York.  He has made repeated applications for assistance to get certain commodities into his stores in New York.  He goes on to say that the whole business of Córas Tráchtála is bound up in volumes of red tape.  Until such time as the red tape is cut completely, he is unable to ship out all he wants to put into his window.  That is a complaint by a trader in the USA which I feel is justified.  He wants to sell Irish goods, and has a market for Irish goods.  For example, when he put frozen fish from Killybegs and the products of Clover Meats into his window, he found that his stores were invaded.  In 24 hours all the Irish products were bought up and he could be given no guarantee as to when he could get more supplies, or any guarantee as to when any supplies would be available to him.  He was told it might be in three, six or nine months' time.</P>
      <P>We must produce so that we can put the quantity into the markets as well as the quality.  If the shoppers in the United States, in Britain, or anywhere else, see an Irish article on the market and find that it is of good quality, they will want to go back and repurchase.  But where do they find themselves if they are told there may not be supplies for two, three or six months, or perhaps there is doubt as to whether there will be any more available?  That is bad.  There are files and records in the Minister's office giving concrete evidence that there are many merchants in the United States and elsewhere who are anxious to press the sale of Irish goods but they cannot get them.  There is no continuity of supply.  There is long delay in meeting the orders and the whole affair, they say, is unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who is responsible?  The Minister may say he is not and that there is a board known as Córas Tráchtála.  I do not want to sound a note which would make a bad position worse at the present time.  Very shortly I shall avail of ten or 15 minutes of the Minister's valuable time for the purpose of passing over to him information I have which I should be glad to have examined, in relation to certain administrative <Col N="794" /> functions of Córas Tráchtála abroad.  I do not think they are in the best interests of the promotion of Irish-manufactured articles abroad.  I repeat that there is too much red tape, which must be cut out and delay in orders avoided.  There must be continuity of supply and orders must be always in advance so as to keep up continuity of supply.</P>
    <P>That position is unsatisfactory.  I am not satisfied with Córas Tráchtála in their present form.  Nobody can say there have been no achievements. There undoubtedly have been achievements, but have they been up to our expectations?  Have the achievements of Córas Tráchtála warranted the expenditure on them and have Córas Tráchtála discovered the new and desirable markets we require for our exports?</P>
    <P>I have wondered why our embassies abroad have not been utilised to a greater extent as trading offices.  I am satisfied there are underdeveloped markets in France, America, Canada, Germany and in many other European countries and we could be squeezed out of those markets because of lack of initiative on our part.  That is why I hope and trust an effort will be made to assist industrialists over the difficult period which they are now facing.</P>
    <P>It was said here last night that it may be possible to call on industrialists to cut their profits.  Manufacturers and industrialists cannot cut their profits any further.  I see in this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> a statement published by the President of the Federation of Irish Industries indicating that industrialists want more tax incentives. I quote from the statement:</P>
    <P>The Government's main proposal is to remove half the loss to exporters arising from the surcharges. These should enable the majority of exporters to continue their export business to Britain provided that in most cases they are willing to do so at no profit, or even at some loss. Assuming that the surcharges do not remain for long, most exporters will wish to do this in order to protect markets in which they have already invested so heavily in recent years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" /> The Federation hopes that in doing so, they will have the full support of their employees in reducing costs and increasing productivity and the co-operation of traders and the public.</P>
    <P>The Federation is, however, disappointed that the Government has not announced immediately its acceptance of proposals which the Federation made to it for further export tax incentives.  These would have encouraged the more enterprising exporters, not only to continue their development work in Britain, but to intensify their efforts in other markets.  While the Federation welcomes the increase in Córas Tráchtála's funds, it feels that it is not a satisfactory substitute for the direct incentives which it advocated.</P>
    <P>That statement issued by the Federation expresses a certain amount of disappointment with the announcement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Taoiseach as to their whole approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to make special reference to the first paragraph in which they say that: &ldquo;Assuming that the surcharges do not remain for long, most exporters will wish to do this in order to protect markets in which they have already invested so heavily in recent years&rdquo;.  How will they be helped to do that?  It is only by concessions.  Are we quite satisfied that the stepping-stone concessions, as we could describe them, which the Government announced yesterday, are sufficiently satisfactory to meet the reasonable request of the industrialists for more tax incentives?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a complete remission of taxation on export profits. How can you improve on complete remission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we can, when we see that industrialists were sufficiently enterprising to invest their own money in protecting their markets.  Many of them have invested in the development and opening of new markets.  That is why I have before me the proposals which the Federation of Irish Industries put <Col N="796" /> forward to the Minister.  The Federation are a body of level-headed, sound and keen commonsense industrialists and businessmen who would not make an unreasonable request and who would ask for nothing but what they feel is justified in the interests of Irish industry and also in the interests of putting a saleable commodity into our export markets.  In addition to that, it is a guarantee that they can run their industries efficiently and in competition with the world's best and that they will have some margin of profit for themselves.</P>
      <P>Now, we are asking our people to be patriotic in the sense of buying Irish.  They will not lose anything by being patriotic and buying Irish.  Are we going to ask our industrialists to work at a loss or cut down their small profits?  I do not believe those people have any great profit.  Many of them pump their profits back into their industries, into expansion and improvement, into benefits for their workers such as pension and health schemes, recreation halls, proper dining rooms and canteens.  Those experienced industrialists cannot be expected to be satisfied with the tag of &ldquo;sincere Irishmen&rdquo;.  The day has definitely gone when £ s. d. did not form a big part of the patriot in all of us.  Nobody now does anything for nothing.  It is all a matter of what one will get out of it, and how soon.</P>
      <P>I must say it is not typical of the Irish make-up, but we now must deal with the hard-hearted, hard-minded businessmen of Britain, America and other countries who will do nothing for nothing.  Are we to ask our businessmen to be good Irish patriots, to run their businesses on a small profit margin or even at a loss in order to help us out of this difficulty?  I again advise the Minister to reconsider the proposals of the Federation of Irish Industries.  They are sensible, intelligent proposals and I advise him to put them into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will our wholesalers and retailers respond to our appeal to press the sale of Irish goods?  I think they will, but will the Government do anything to assist them?  If wholesalers or retailers can prove to the Government's satisfaction <Col N="797" /> that they can increase sales of Irish goods, is there any bonus which can be provided to compensate them for their efforts and energies?  It is not good enough to appeal to their patriotic instincts.  They should be given some financial assistance, either by way of rebate of income tax or refund of turnover tax.  That is the way we can encourage our industrialists to embark with energy and effect on this campaign to push the sale of Irish goods.</P>
    <P>So far in the debate little comment has been made or serious thought given to the Taoiseach's reference to our balance of payments problem.  If we have a balance of payments problem, it is the duty of this Government to rectify it by taking immediate steps so that the incoming Government in 1966 will not have to face a nasty mess, so that the new Government in 1966 will not be faced with the mess the Conservatives left for the Labour Party in Britain.  The Conservatives knew there was a balance of payments problem in Britain because Mr. Maudling was able to comment on it long before the election, but they knew it was good politics to leave a mess for the Labour Government to tackle.</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach see the writing on the wall for Fianna Fáil and is he deliberately refusing to rectify our balance of payments position?  I suggest the Taoiseach is saying: &ldquo;We are going out in the next election and let us leave a right mess for the lads coming after us to rectify.  While they are rectifying it, we can go into the country and pose as the saviours of the Irish economy as we did in 1956&rdquo;.  I have not got the figures before me, but Fianna Fáil have a very slender majority in this House.  What they want is an overall majority.  They are never satisfied if they have to play the bobtail game; they do not want a bag of rags hanging after them to keep them in office.  They are always anxious to shake off the rag-bag.</P>
    <P>What the Taoiseach may have in mind is to allow the £40 million balance of payments to become a real problem by permitting it to mount up still further without taking any action. <Col N="798" /> He knows he is going out and the least said now, or done, about this problem, the better he will be able to say in 1966: &ldquo;We left the country in a sound position&rdquo;.  Then, when the incoming Government begin to tackle the problem by the imposition of taxation, levies, quota restrictions and other devices, the Taoiseach can go out to the country as he did in 1956.  That cock has crowed before but it will not crow again.  People will not fall for it. It is now the Government's job, their duty, immediately to clear up this balance of payments difficulty.</P>
    <P>What steps must be taken to deal with it?  Shall we endeavour to reduce imports, impose levies or quota restictions?  What are we to do and when? To reduce imports, to impose new levies or to enter on a programme of quota restrictions would impose hardship on our people.  Now that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has introduced a supplementary Budget, can it be that we may have a similar Budget in the near future?</P>
    <P>I understand there will not be a very substantial sum spent on the Buy Irish campaign.  I beg of the Government not to tinker with the situation.  Unless they are prepared to do the job well, they should not do it at all.  A job well done is permanent.  To tinker with it in a half-hearted manner will not be very profitable in the long run.</P>
    <P>If money has to be raised for the purposes of this Estimate and in order to rectify the balance of payments problem, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when replying to the debate this evening should give the general public some indication as to what the Government have in mind.  Will there be additional levies imposed to meet the balance of payments problem?  Are the Government about to embark on a programme of quota restrictions?  What means will the Government take to rectify what the Taoiseach feels is beginning to be a problem?</P>
    <P>I ask this question: Is it proposed, in order to find the funds necessary to meet this problem, to raise the turnover tax?  I shiver when I think of the weapon that is in the hands of <Col N="799" /> the Government in relation to the turnover tax and think that that is what the Government have in mind&mdash; what they previously described as the painless extraction of money from the pockets of the people.  The poor, the workers, the middle income group, people who have no trade union to fight for them or to defend them may be asked to foot the bill.  On the other hand, will we be faced with the position that the Government will follow the British example?  There was 6d. a gallon extra taxation imposed on petrol yesterday in Britain.  In that connection, it should be borne in mind that this country has the dearest motoring in the world.  If the Government attempt to increase the price of petrol it will mean considerable unemployment and will be a very severe hardship on thousands of people who must keep motorcars on the road for the conduct of their business.  What will be the subject of the new levies if, as the Taoiseach said yesterday, he must consider introducing a system of levies to meet our balance of payments problem?  I hope that if there are to be new levies imposed or any other measures taken to rectify the balance of payments problem, the members of Fianna Fáil will be as vocal in the matter as they were when they were on this side of the House and the inter-Party Government were faced with the same difficulties.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by paying a tribute to Irish industry in general, to the thousands of skilled workers in Irish industries, to the thousands of highly qualified operatives, all those engaged in the various branches of Irish industry, who have done so much to add distinction and credit to Irish manufacture and who have won the hearts of thousands of people far from here because of the high quality of the goods they are putting into export markets.</P>
    <P>Let us not leave this debate today without making an appeal to the Minister to tell the House and the country what the long-term policy of the Government is in relation to trade, exports <Col N="800" /> and employment.  We do not want a continuation of this temporary, patchwork policy which is being adopted to carry over from crisis to crisis or from panic to panic or from excitement to excitement.  We want to hear from the Government an indication of what their long-term policy is in the matter of trade, exports and employment.</P>
    <P>If funds are to be made available for the purposes of this Estimate, for the purpose of extending the grants for the expansion and extension of industries, those who will avail of the grants want to know what long-term programme the Government have in mind. The Government have not told us anything as to the nature of their long-term programme.  All those in the textile business, in the boot and shoe business, in the moquette business and other important export lines are expecting an indication of the Government's long-term programme.  Those engaged in industry feel that the Government are not laying sufficient emphasis on the importance of long-term policy in this regard.</P>
    <P>The situation with which they are now faced has brought our Government to their senses.  They have been bankrupt of long-term industrial policy.  They have had no plan for the expansion of export markets or marketing organisations.  The House that is being asked today to provide the money to meet this Estimate should demand an explanation from the Government.  It is not desirable that the Government should limp from crisis to crisis.  Irish industrialists should be reinforced with information in regard to long-term policy.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Government seem to be putting handcuffs on manufacturers, to be blindfolding industrialists.  Industrialists, handcuffed, blindfolded and with chains on their ankles, are merely told to go ahead and to do their best, to find their own way by probing in the dark.  Where thousands of pounds are invested in industry a system of probing in the dark will not do.  Where the fathers of large families are depending on industrial employment, such a policy will not do.  It will not do where there <Col N="801" /> is no alternative source of employment, in a situation where there is complete dependence in industrial zones on industrial employment.</P>
    <P>The lead must come from the Government.  It is the Government's responsibility.  It is not the duty of the Opposition to lead off in matters of this kind.  It is the duty of the Opposition to advise, to offer constructive criticism.  I put it to the House that the Government have not delivered the goods, that they have failed miserably, that they have slipped up in their talks, that their eyes have been wiped by the British Government, that the vast majority of Irish industrialists are aware of the plight to which bad planning, short-sightedness and lack of long-term planning have brought them. That is why for the future there must be clear thinking, long-term planning and, above all, the application of common sense, intelligence and superior negotiating ability.  These qualities seem to be lacking in the present Government.</P>
    <P>If the Government realise that they have failed miserably, as I believe they have, would they not say to themselves that they have done their best but that they are leading the country to disaster, that their efforts have not been successful?  Even though we all appreciate that they have done their best and cannot do any more, is it not time for them to pack up and admit that they cannot do any more, that they have done their best, that there is nothing more they can do?  In those circumstances, would they not say to themselves: &ldquo;We will pack it up and leave it to men with ability, foresight, determination and courage and, above all, with faith in Irish industry&rdquo;?  We must have faith in Irish industry.  I often doubt whether the Government really have faith in Irish industry, beyond getting a few miserable votes that a factory in an area is able to extract from the people.  I have often wondered whether the main consideration in establishing these industries was merely a sense of extracting votes from those who would derive a livelihood from them or whether they were genuinely and sincerely interested in the promotion of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> The time has come for a general review.  The time is fast approaching when the Government will be tested, when their sincerity will be tested, when their assessment of the value of the British market will be tested.  Above all, they will be asked to explain their great conversion to the British market because it is not so many years ago that it was the cry of the Taoiseach and his followers that the British market was gone, and gone for ever, thank God.  They were not singing that song when they were knocking at the door of No. 10 Downing Street, looking for concessions.  That is why I hope the Government have been taught a lesson, a lesson that will bring about a greater degree of intelligence and common sense in their approach to the matter of industrial exports and the maintenance in a satisfactory and healthy manner of Irish industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very attentively since yesterday.  For almost the first time in this House I felt heartened by the thought, when a national crisis, as it could be called, a national shock, came, of how quickly the Opposition Party said to the Government: &ldquo;We are behind you&rdquo;. At least yesterday evening that was the impression I got from the last speaker. He assured the House that his Party and, indeed, he was presumptuous enough to say he felt everyone in the House would be behind the Government on this Estimate.  However, that was somewhat marred by this morning's contribution because this morning instead of pursuing that thought of unified effort, he started to think along Party lines, future elections, and so forth, and that is a tragedy.</P>
      <P>The imposition of this surcharge has been a shock to industrialists.  In recent years the shock treatment for nervous disorders has been a great success.  I hope this shock given to us by the British Government will have the same successful results as those given in that other field of mental disorders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something wrong about this great wave of sympathy for industrialists.  This country is a Utopia for industrialists.  They have come here from everywhere.  They have been <Col N="803" /> told that as long as they produce 60 per cent for export, nothing will be taken from them for ten years.  They are given grants and advice.  What more does the last speaker want for industrialists?  I have no fear in the world that one industry will go to the wall.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition impressed me very much but I do not think this is a time to be worrying as to whom is the best negotiator and who goes over and comes back with more.  This is the acid test.  It is the first time these Irish industrialists have got a prod not to mind a shock. Czechs, Germans and people of every other nationality want to come here. I know that 15 per cent is no small thing but this 15 per cent is now being reduced by this measure to 7½ per cent. Anyone can get 5 per cent or 7½ per cent off anything.</P>
    <P>I would be perturbed if unemployment were to result from this situation but in view of the steps to be taken, I do not think that will happen.  However, it has been referred to this morning.  It is true what the last speaker said that those, particularly in the United States, who desire to buy and sell Irish goods have had no guarantee of a repetition of orders, whether it is shoes, food, garments or souvenirs.  We want warehouses, whether we build them or buy them, so that we can stock our goods in order to ensure continuity of supply. Córas Tráchtála were asked some years ago if they could procure warehouses.</P>
    <P>However, warehouses or, indeed, the additional trade with the United States, will not save us, but rather than being perturbed, I feel this is the right moment personally to say I have every confidence in this Government for the manner in which they have tackled this situation.  They have not wasted a minute.  It is said that they should have anticipated this move.  I would not say I have ever been a wonderful admirer of our neighbours but I certainly never anticipated that a trade treaty made by them would be broken.  There is no justification for that but let us accept <Col N="804" /> it and this little shock may be the greatest tonic to our industrialists.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is a serious problem and nothing could justify the loss of one week's employment in the present situation.  We are not even completely finished with the unrest in the building industry.  That is our second greatest industry.  The others are only trotting after it.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that controversy should arise on this.  I well remember after the commencement of the last war the present Government were in office and I returned to find a mass meeting at College Green at which both sides were on the same platform: all one; together we stand.  It will be a wonderful thing if we accept this situation in the same spirit.  This is not a time for Party politics or for the expression of disappointment in Government procedure.  I want to be as constructive as I can.  I am not pledging my allegiance to the Government or to the Opposition.  As to this expression, the bag of rags, I suppose I am one of those but if the desire to co-operate in a situation like this furthers loyalty, then I, for one, am very glad to be numbered in the bag of rags.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party believe that in times of national crisis it is essential there should be a closing of the ranks and both sides of this House should stand together in order to ensure that the nation comes out of the crisis as successfully as possible, irrespective of whether the crisis is big or small.  We believe the present crisis has been misinterpreted by the country.  The statements made by the Government and, in particular, by the Taoiseach have not helped in any way to lessen the fear that this crisis will affect the Irish economy in a big way. As far as we are concerned in the Labour Party we are prepared to co-operate to the full in any measures the Government may take in order to lessen the blow.  It is unfair, I think, for the Taoiseach to go around the country describing as a body blow something which he, better than anybody else, must know cannot really be any such thing.  It may be serious, but <Col N="805" /> only time will show that.  To use Deputy Corish's phrase, a clip in the ear may be a more apposite description.</P>
      <P>The British Government, whether they were right or wrong, and we hold no brief for the present British Government or any former British Government, in doing what they have done have, in fact, taken identical action against every other country and, therefore, <i>vis-à-vis</i> other countries the Irish position is no worse than it was before the imposition of this 15 per cent.  The only two things that can affect this country, as far as Britain are concerned, are (1) if Britain sets about producing goods which are at present imported from this country and (2) the people of Britain decide not to buy because of the imposition of the levy. If the levy were imposed solely on luxury goods there would definitely be a big cutting down.  It is not imposed on luxury goods.  It is imposed on everything except agricultural products.  I assume, therefore, that the people must continue to buy and the British people and all our own people who are over there will have to pay more for what they buy.</P>
      <P>The blow should not be as great here as some people try to prophesy it will be.  I do not know what their object is.  I do not know whether the idea is akin to something that used happen in the case of an old doctor down the country; when he first saw a patient he always told the patient he was dying and then, after a few days, the doctor cured him and he was, of course, the most wonderful doctor in the world.  If that is the idea here, then it is one which should not be tried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Wheeler of the Irish Exporters Association seems to think, and he should know, that this will not be such a big blow at all.  He says the Irish economy can stand the strain.  The Taoiseach and the Government propose to take steps to deal with any cases of hardship.  Now this is something in regard to which the Government and the Taoiseach must be very, very careful because we know that certain Irish industries have been making colossal profits.  I hope it is not suggested <Col N="806" /> that these people will be able to pick up the 50 per cent of the levy in the same way as those who are struggling to continue in existence because, if that were the proposal, it would simply mean the general taxpayer would be subsidising still further people who are already doing very well.  The last speaker suggested, if I interpret him correctly, that where an application is made for assistance someone should check to find out if such assistance is really needed.  That would be an excellent idea because we have had a situation arising time and time again in which people are prepared to shout very loudly if they think that, as a result of the shouting, they will get some form of subsidy.</P>
    <P>The Buy Irish campaign referred to by the Taoiseach is an excellent idea. He appeals in particular to State and semi-State bodies and to local authorities to buy Irish.  Is it not rather odd that the Taoiseach in a time of what he considers to be serious crisis should find it necessary to make such an appeal?  Should it not be part and parcel of the policy of State and semi-State bodies and local authorities, unless there are very extenuating circumstances, to buy the supplies they require in the home market?  Even if there is a difference in price, supplies should still be bought on the home market.</P>
    <P>It is utterly ridiculous that we should buy from countries abroad goods which are produced here.  Nevertheless that is done by some State and semi-State bodies and by local authorities. Simultaneously the State and local authorities have to give out, by way of social welfare benefits and assistance, more money than the difference between the Irish contract price and the contract price from the foreign country.  The general economy and the general finances of the country suffer as a result of this practice.  Nobody need say that it is not done.</P>
    <P>I am very glad the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is in the House because I have here a receipt for my telephone bill and, at the bottom, in very small print appears &ldquo;Printed in the USA&rdquo;.  This morning I ran into <Col N="807" /> someone who told me that within the last month a contract for approximately £13,000 worth of materials normally supplied by firms in this country has been placed with a firm in Scotland. Someone commented: &ldquo;Well, we could not know the British Government were going to impose this levy and how could you make provision or speculate and say we will take the necessary steps just in case anything happens&rdquo;.  I believe the necessary steps could have been taken.</P>
    <P>It was quite obvious the balance of payments position in Britain was wrong.  It was quite obvious the Tory Government would have taken the necessary steps were it not for the pending election.  No one can blame them for not taking steps.  They did what Governments normally do.  But we should have recognised the symptoms and a State Department which laid a contract for a substantial sum of money in another country to the detriment of an Irish firm were, in my opinion, doing a criminal act and should not now be allowed to get away with it.  These are two instances, this receipt printed in the USA and the contract for goods placed in Scotland.  How many hundreds of similar instances could be turned up if we checked?  Would it not make interesting replies to Parliamentary Questions finding out how many State Departments lay contracts for materials which are produced here with other countries?  We should not cod ourselves about these things.</P>
    <P>Now, when something happens, we start shouting &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo;.  Why have we not done that all the time?  We cannot blame the housewife who goes into a shop, with very little money in her purse, looking for the best value; she will buy something not manufactured here because she needs the pennies she saves.  Will anyone contend that the same applies to a Department of State and that a Department of State is justified in laying contracts in another country for goods which are produced here?  It is a disgraceful situation and it should not be allowed to continue.  If this does nothing more than bring home to the Government <Col N="808" /> and to State Departments that there is an onus on them to support Irish manufacture, thereby keeping Irish workers in employment, then this 15 per cent will have been a blessing in disguise.</P>
    <P>We have statistics which show that the economy has been booming.  It does not matter what politicians may say about these things from time to time, the facts are very plain.  Over the whole of manufacturing industry, production rose by 12.6 per cent in the first half of 1964.  People may say that is because of the extra people employed in industry but if you make a comparison with the first half of 1962 and the first half of 1963, you will find that the 1964 period was very much higher. The increase in the first half of 1962 was 4.4 per cent.  It shows that no matter what we may say the workers are pulling their weight.  This has, if you like, to be weighed against the number of people who have been brought into industry.  Production rose by 12.6 per cent in the first half of 1964 and on average, employment rose by 4.3 per cent.  That still leaves a rise of 8 per cent in productivity.  This should have a very great effect on the economy.  When we know that those are the facts, it is an impertinence for anybody to suggest that the workers &ldquo;had better look out&rdquo;, that they are not to look for any improvement in wages or conditions during this period.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach gave the solemn warning that he expected that the workers would not rock the boat. I noticed that he did not say anything about participation by the employers, by the people who actually get the big profits out of industry.  He did not suggest to them that they should not rock the boat or that they should pull their weight.  The bogey has always been the workers.  I did not like the implication that they should do it without action being taken by this Dáil.  I do not know exactly what he meant but the implication was there, that the workers should tie their present wages and present conditions and so avoid action by this Dáil.  That was the implication although they were not his exact words.  I hope I was wrong when I felt that the <Col N="809" /> Taoiseach was, very unnecessarily, stating that the Dáil would take steps, because we do not want that sort of thing.  We are offering co-operation but it has been the tradition of Irishmen down through the ages that while we will do something if we are asked for co-operation, we will not be bulldozed into it.  The Taoiseach and the Government would do very well to remember that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan referred to exports and how exports could be very much greater but that they were tied up.  I had two instances of this. Some years ago somebody asked me to introduce him to a firm which was a semi-State firm exporting their products.  He was prepared to get a one million dollar export order from the USA.  I discussed this with the head of the firm and I was informed that it would have to be done through their own agent.  The only reason this person wanted to place the order was that he felt if there was commission available, he was entitled to it.  But the agent, who could not get the order, would have to have the handling of it and get any cut that was going on the order.  Of course the order fell through and four years later there were headlines in the papers stating that the order had been secured by the company.  That was four years later. Recently there was a similar happening with regard to exports to Britain and in this instance the matter was shot down because it was said that it would be uneconomic.  Recently it was decided it was economic and there have been exports of this commodity to Britain.  This will mean a very big improvement for the workers in that industry.</P>
    <P>I quite agree that people in export industries do require a little shaking up.  Possibly they have a feeling that having travelled a certain distance, they are now secure and do not wish to put on the extra effort.  There should be a fresh approach to this particularly at present when we have discovered that putting all our eggs in one basket is not the right thing to do.  We might be able to get people responsible for exporting to have a fresh approach to this matter and see <Col N="810" /> if they cannot get markets, or see if the markets we are being offered could not be expanded, or if people who are responsible for channelling our exports are doing their job or if they have so many irons in the fire that they feel they cannot spare the time for what they consider small items.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to the excellent efforts being made by the people engaged in processing foods and to the fact that it was an example of what could be done.  We all know that.  It has been preached from the Labour benches that this is one way in which this country can do better than any country in Europe if we put our minds to it.  Lieutenant-General Costello has proved it can be done and we hope there will be a very big extension of this type of industry.  Let me just point out in regard to the statement made by the Taoiseach, and echoed by other people, that this crisis has shown us that we should have made a greater effort to get into the Common Market &mdash;as if the Common Market were going to be our saviour&mdash;that we should not forget that there is no 15 per cent levy on agricultural produce. What we want to sell on the Common Market is mainly agricultural produce. If we can get people to appreciate that, we might stop this nonsense about the Common Market.  It is only a red herring which I thought had disappeared, but which apparently is appearing again and being used for the purpose of confusing the issue. Incidentally, I was rather surprised to find that the first people shouting about body blows were the spokesmen, or those who claim to be the spokesmen, of the agricultural industry. They are not affected at all by the 15 per cent and why they should have felt they had to be in the van is something I could not understand.  Perhaps they do not understand themselves; otherwise they would not be saying what they are saying.</P>
    <P>We hope that not alone will we be able to continue with the expansion of existing industries but that new industries will be started, but let us get away from this idea of sending Ministers in State cars accompanied by half a dozen officials to officially open factories that <Col N="811" /> give employment to two men.  Some two or three years ago, there was a tremendous blow about a factory which was being opened and the Minister for Transport and Power went down and in his inimitable way, described what was going to be done there and what this meant to the area. I live a few miles away from this factory but because I was on the wrong side of the political fence, I was not made aware of the fact that the factory was being opened.  I now know that the two men employed there have been dismissed and the factory closed.  If there was a State grant involved, we would find that the cost of the whole transaction was a lot more than it should have been.</P>
    <P>This week the local paper stated that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has made another statement about a factory.  Deputy Faulkner from Louth knows about this.  He thinks it is going to start somewhere near Drogheda and the Minister thinks that it is going to start in Meath.  Deputy Faulkner is a personal friend of mine and the Minister knows as well as I do that if Deputy Faulkner can get it started in Louth, he will do so.  More luck to him if he can get away with it, but he cannot this time.  The Minister is aware, whether he says anything about it or not&mdash;we are not supposed to talk about these things&mdash;that the factory will be erected in Meath.  I hope the same thing will not happen again and we will not have people shouting about something of which they know very little.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to detain the House very much longer except to repeat what I said at the start.  We are prepared to co-operate with the Government to overcome the present difficulty.  We were rather surprised to hear a reference to our balance of payments deficit being around £40 million.  We understood it was around £30 million.  While high finance is supposed to be something only two or three people know anything about, it can be said that a figure of £30 million would not worry us very much, because we know there has been an <Col N="812" /> inflow of foreign capital into this country estimated at £30 million.  By adding £10 million to it yesterday, the Taoiseach was either stating a serious position or unnecessarily creating a scare.</P>
    <P>We hope that in the months to come the British Government will decide to do away with this levy.  We hope that in any future trade agreement made it will be specifically laid down that the agreement will remain binding whether or not other countries in a different position from ours are affected by any levy or tax.  Apparently, that was not done in this case.  This seems to be an agreement which could just as easily cover any other country as Ireland.</P>
    <P>We all regret the British Government have found it necessary to inflict this hardship on their nearest neighbours.  As the Taoiseach rightly said yesterday, we are one of Britain's best customers.  We hope that in the not too distant future the British Government may decide to give this country the preferential treatment we claim. Whether they do that or not, we in the Labour Party feel that the Irish economy can stand up to these things. We feel that the Irish workers will not let down either the Government or the people, provided they are given a fair deal and no attempt is made to coerce them by the Government or anybody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as my experience of Parliamentary proceedings here is concerned, yesterday was without doubt the gloomiest day I have ever seen.  It started off with a very depressing speech from a very depressed man&mdash;the Taoiseach.  There was no lifting of the gloom when the Minister for Industry and Commerce decided to intervene in the debate at a later stage.  Yesterday, my leader, Deputy Dillon asked for honesty in the discussion of these matters and in the handling of the problems that have arisen for us.  I wish that honest viewpoint had started earlier.  Just after the blow had fallen, when the 15 per cent levy had been announced, our two Ministers went to London.  The best the Taoiseach could say on his <Col N="813" /> emergence from the conference room in Downing Street was: &ldquo;One advantage was that uncertainty had been removed and we now knew what we are up against.&rdquo; Later he said: &ldquo;We now know how bad the thing is.&rdquo; That was the consolation offered through the Press.</P>
      <P>As I said, the depression had not even lifted yesterday.  His speech was a depressed speech and he himself was clearly a depressed person.  However, we are told by the Taoiseach that the British Cabinet Ministers, whom he met with his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, had been very much impressed by our arguments.  I gather from his remarks&mdash; I can supply the details if necessary&mdash; that he felt the British did not know how severe the blow was to us.  Also, apparently, they were not aware we were going to take badly the breach of an international agreement.</P>
      <P>I find it hard to believe that the members of the British Cabinet did not know how severe the 15 per cent levy was going to be, even on the limited quantity of goods on which it was being imposed.  They have their own statisticians.  They are not mathematically inefficient.  They can add and subtract and add a percentage.  It is incredible to me that this matter had not been fully considered and that, even appreciating our satisfactory trading relationship from the British angle, the British decided the 15 per cent was going on our industrial goods, as it is going on the goods of other people with whom they had treaty obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must have been appreciated that this was a breach of the agreement.  I do not think there has been any denial anywhere of that.  But yesterday the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that it was all very well now to talk with a certain amount of hind-sight&mdash;that nobody expected these levies.  Deputy Dillon asked yesterday if the consultations, which were supposed to be the valuable outcome of the arrangements the Taoiseach made in 1960, had taken place, and the answer came: &ldquo;Yes, frequently.&rdquo; In his speech yesterday the Minister for <Col N="814" /> Industry and Commerce confirmed that.  He said that they had had discussions.  I do not know whether it was completely between officials or whether it was Minister with Minister.  I gather it was the latter.  He did say that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had told himself, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the difficulties were there, that they were piling up and that something would have to be done about it.  I wonder did that not make our people think what would happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister thinks that nobody could have conceived that there would have been a breach of an international agreement.  I do not know.  I am not personally aware as to whether minutes were taken of the discussions which I attended myself in 1948.  I know there were notetakers present, but I do not remember ever seeing a printed minute of what happened at that conference.  I am quite sure recordings were made of it.  In any event, quite a number of civil servants crossed with Deputy John Costello, the then Taoiseach, and the group I belonged to in 1948.  Those civil servants must have a memory of what happened then.  I think anybody considering our position and being told by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Maudling, that the balance of payments difficulties were enormous and would have to be tackled by a Government sooner or later, the first thing that must have occurred to our people on hearing that was that the weaknesses of the 1938 Agreement, which in 1948 we tried to strengthen, would be used to our disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Possibly before this debate is over, if not, certainly on some other occasion, I want the Taoiseach, who was the architect of the 1938 Agreement, to explain to this House what I found it impossible to explain when I was put under cross-examination in 1948.  The Chancellor in those days, Sir Stafford Cripps, said very pointedly there were two clauses at balance in the 1938 Agreement.  &ldquo;There is the main clause where we demanded certain things, and there is the clause where your people attempted to demand certain things.&rdquo; Then he put into sharp contrast the phrases they had used.  The framework <Col N="815" /> of all this was a statement on the table, &ldquo;We know what we wanted and we got a phrase which guarded what we wanted.  Either your people did not know what you wanted, or you failed to record what you desired.  As far as our Governments are concerned, the United Kingdom agreed on goods which would enter the United Kingdom without customs duties.&rdquo; That ended the clause to our benefit.</P>
    <P>In the same document the Chancellor of the Exchequer was alert to point out that we were put on notice that the British had written in on their side that there were two things to guard against. One was customs duties and the other was quotas.  When we look at the 1948 agreement, we see that the British demanded and got free entry of goods into this country, without tariffs and without quotas.  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Dillon, myself and others, extemporised arguments &mdash; and some arguments that we really did not believe in&mdash;and said that entry free from customs duty meant free entry without quotas or customs and the answer was that the phrase was carried in the same document.  We were flanked by many civil servants during the 1948 negotiations and they must have known that the British had stressed very strongly that we were unguarded so far as quotas were concerned and all we had precluded was certain customs duties on certain parts of our goods.</P>
    <P>I have said before and I want to repeat that it was pointedly urged, and our attention was drawn to the fact, that there were two ways of interfering with our trade.  One was customs duties and the other was quotas.  We protected ourselves against one only, whereas in the same document three or four clauses down, the British had been at pains to protect themselves against customs duties and quotas.  If the British had decided to use a system of quotas instead of putting levies on, we would have objected because so far as we could in the 1948 agreement, we had held the door open for argument.</P>
    <P>If one reads the GATT arrangements, one discovers there that balance of payments considerations permit <Col N="816" /> quotas to be fixed.  If the British Government had had time, and if they had decided on a different programme, they could have avoided the situation they are in with their associates in GATT and EFTA.  They could have avoided the situation they are in with us by pushing open the door the present Taoiseach left swinging for the imposition of quotas upon our goods. They decided, in their wisdom, that the quota system was a bad one.  It could not be as swift as the attachment of the levies which do not require expensive administration machinery.  They could have avoided breaches of international agreements with the EFTA countries and at least the suspicion of a breach in the GATT negotiations.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Booth made light of this 15 per cent and said the picture was being painted black by people on this side of the House for Party purposes.  He said the Labour Government in England had made the situation look blacker than it was for Party political purposes.  I am aware that when the first hint of these levies was made public, the Tory Chancellor of the Exchequer said: &ldquo;If we left the Labour Government our problems, we left them our solutions.&rdquo; The Minister for Industry and Commerce can tell us that when he met the Tory Chancellor of the Exchequer some time before the vacation, he was told these difficulties about the balance of payments were mounting and something would have to be done.  If one reads the House of Commons debates, one finds that there is no great controversy in England about the levies as opposed to any other method of meeting the difficulties.  Clearly the Tories now in Opposition know the files reveal that they had projected exactly the same system as is now being operated by the Labour Government.</P>
    <P>I read in the paper that the President of the British Board of Trade, Mr. Jay, &ldquo;heard spokesmen of Britain's EFTA partners accuse her of causing a `crisis of confidence' in the group.  They described the import curb as `unfair play', `hitting below the belt', and a `flagrant disregard' of EFTA's rules.&rdquo; The President of the <Col N="817" /> Board of Trade is reported as having said:</P>
    <P>...it would not have been possible to exempt EFTA countries from the 15 per cent surcharge without also exempting British Commonwealth countries.  EFTA and the Commonwealth together made up half of Britain's imports and it was not possible to exempt both from the surcharge because this would put a greater burden on other countries and could also frustrate the aims of the surcharge.</P>
    <P>Mr. Jay said Britain was examining her EFTA partners' difficulties and would continue to consider what she could do to ease them. But she was unable to suggest any possibilities at present.</P>
    <P>I want these words to be noted by people who are inclined to think this is a very temporary matter.  We heard it said that it will last for only six months.  I tried to track down this phrase about the six months and I find the British have agreed that they will review the situation in six months.  In other words, they will have another look at it, but there is no promise whatever in regard to six months.</P>
    <P>The Swiss asked what value can be placed on international treaties if they are to be so flagrantly disregarded. The Director of the Federation of Danish Industries said: &ldquo;...if Britain insisted on this degree of economic sovereignty, other EFTA countries were bound to face up to the consequences of this unilateral action.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, for good or bad, the British have decided to operate along those lines.  Deputy Dillon told the House yesterday of discussions we had in regard to them.  It is true, as he said, that one junior member of the British Government with a reputation as an international lawyer was brought in and said very openly and frankly that so far as he understood the system with regard to the interpretation of treaties, every treaty had a special clause written in and if it was not written in, it was implied, that the treaty lasted only so long as circumstances did not fundamentally change.  We pointed out <Col N="818" /> that in international law text books that was ascribed to Russia in the Czarist days, and first made its appearance as an argument in connection with the interpretation of treaties when trouble arose over the neutralisation of the Black Sea.  It was claimed on behalf of Russia that every treaty has an escape clause and that, if circumstances changed, the treaty was no longer binding.  If one surveys international law textbooks of those days, we find there was a proud boast against that.  The British had the view that when treaties were made, they were meant to be kept and should be kept and that there was an obligation on those entering treaties to observe the terms of the treaties unless they could either renounce them, under whatever terms of renouncement there were, or could get the agreement of the other parties to the treaty that some fundamental change had occurred and that therefore the treaty had to be rearranged.</P>
    <P>I take the view, as expressed by a Swiss representative at a recent EFTA meeting: what value can be placed on international treaties that are so flagrantly disregarded&mdash;what value? That is the difficulty we are in for the future.  There is no doubt about it that what happened in Britain in regard to these surcharges must make people take a completely new view of international law.</P>
    <P>The British were the people who held with the western nations up to this that international treaties were more than mere contracts between individuals; that they might be frustrated here and there by impossibility of performance but that international treaties were on a different level and that these pacts were and ought to be observed.  Those champions of that attitude towards international treaties have now succumbed to circumstances. They have accepted that such difficulties as balance of payments difficulties create a new situation and that, in that new situation, a treaty can be broken not only without the agreement of but without consultation and even without prior notice to the other parties to such agreements.</P>
    <P>It is in those circumstances that we <Col N="819" /> have to view the statement made here by the Taoiseach yesterday.  He wants to have a new trade agreement.  It will not be worthwhile having a new trade agreement unless it provides for and encourages an expansion of trade.  I supose he will tell us at a later stage that it would be a good thing to write into any new trade treaty a clause that it is not to be abandoned, that it is to be kept.  If that is written in, that clause can be overridden by necessity.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look back and to see what the present Taoiseach said as Minister for Industry and Commerce when dealing with our agreement of 1948.  He asked himself three questions: (1) could a better agreement than what was being then discussed have been made; (2) were there any features of the agreement which were so objectionable as to call for its dismissal and (3) would it be better or worse if we had no general or comprehensive trade agreement in force with Great Britain under the circumstances then obtaining&mdash;should we have only temporary arrangements within its scope?  He answered all these questions in a way favourable to himself. He thought there were many objectionable features.  He thought a better trade agreement could have been made.  His suggestion to this House in August, 1948, was that if we had refused to accept the treaty a new and better one could be negotiated.  Finally, he expressed the point of view that as far as he was concerned he would rather have no treaty agreement and just let us have <i>ad hoc</i> temporary arrangements of a very limited scope.  He was not backed in that point of view by anybody.  His Leader in those days repudiated him.</P>
    <P>After two days' debate, the 1948 Trade Agreement was passed without a division being challenged.  The fear of the House in those days was that if the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, the present Taoiseach, got control of those matters again he would denounce the 1948 Trade Agreement and try to put something better in its place.</P>
    <P>The 1948 Trade Agreement lasted. It is still operating in a trading <Col N="820" /> association with Britain save for such minor adjustments as were made in 1960.  I do not know what the point of view of the Taoiseach is.  He thinks the British are rather sorry for having broken our agreement.  He tells the public that the British recognise that they have broken faith with us.  The best thing he can offer is that we can make a new agreement with those faithless people.  I do not know whether or not he hopes to write in a new negativing clause to the effect that whenever we make this treaty it will not be subject to sudden changes, even for balance of payments difficulties.</P>
    <P>I would ask that somewhere in the near future the Taoiseach would tell us why he failed to put in a clause equal to the one the British inserted in 1938.  They guarded against customs duties and quotas : we were content to guard against customs duties only.  We left the way open for the British, by quotas, to prohibit entry of our goods, not by making them dearer.  That was the situation that the British had while we can complain of their lack of faith in having broken this agreement.  But at least they made it clear that the situation they found when they came to Government was so serious that action of a decisive and quick type had to be taken and that it did not permit them to use the escape clause they had with us and other people with whom they had a trading association, namely, to have quota restrictions.  This matter was so urgent that they had to act quickly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth thinks that the Labour Government are making a bad picture worse and that it is only for political Party purposes.  The calculation with regard to the adverse balance of payments from Britain's point of view is £600 millions to £800 millions.  That sum will not be got rid of in six months' time.  I do not know whether the British will use that &ldquo;six months' time&rdquo;&mdash;a phrase which is floating around these discussions&mdash;as possibly the escape machinery for quota restrictions.  If they do, remember our position under the 1938 agreement, although we bettered some of those phrases and recorded our disagreement <Col N="821" /> with the British point of view in Clause I when we met them in 1948. One member of the new British Government has said, regarding that deficit of £600 million to £800 million, that it represents almost their entire reserves in the nature of hard currency. Yet people here take it light-heartedly. They think that this will be a levy of 15 per cent and that that is all.  They think it will be all over in six months' time and that we shall then resume our march wherever the marching is leading us.</P>
    <P>I do not know how bad our balance of payments situation is.  It is only when we get the details of it at the end of the financial year that we may be able to see whether it is really serious or whether some of it can be taken in our stride.  The new <i>Business News</i> supplement of the <i>Sunday Times</i> wrote quite favourably of our deputation.  It states that Ireland's case for special treatment is strong and points out that Éire's own economy is at a critical stage.  It says that our adverse balance of payments, in relation to GNP, is far worse than even the most pessimistic forecasts for Britain.  The article goes on to say that the successful policy of attracting foreign industries could be permanently damaged by a loss of confidence in Ireland's special relationship with Great Britain.</P>
    <P>That, of course, is the terrible difficulty that faces us in the future. Everybody recognised that we had a special arrangement.  The trade balance was in Britain's favour but we were good customers of each other and yet, in that situation there suddenly emerged this terrible crisis of the balance of payments difficulty and, facing that, the British had no scruple. They disregarded any obligation they had to us.  They could have gone through the door the Taoiseach left swinging open in regard to quotas but they did not take that way out.  Instead they introduced their levies, which are really customs duties.  Any foreign industrialist might have been tempted by what was regarded as our specially favourable position in the British market: such an industrialist will now think again.  He would have to consider <Col N="822" /> that international law has gone into a new phase in which an important nation originally sticking to treaties and upholding that slogan has now succumbed itself and, in the teeth of obligations to us, to their Commonwealth people, to GATT and EFTA, have decided on these surcharges.</P>
    <P>The future has to be clouded for many years by what has happened in the past fortnight.  Treaties are no longer sacred; they need no longer be kept.  If there are difficulties arising that make any fundamental changes&mdash; we do not know what changes&mdash;then, the treaty goes by the board and other parties to it will be informed afterwards, not even advised beforehand of what is going to happen.</P>
    <P>What is going to happen here?  We have had two suggestions made, one by the Minister for Transport and Power who thought that workers should do everything in their power to undo the effects of &ldquo;a totally unjustifiable increase of five per cent in labour costs&rdquo; arising from their ninth round wage increase.  When the Minister for Transport and Power is speaking of an unjustifiable increase of five per cent, I do not know if he knows this, but he is criticising an agreement made and approved by his leader.  I take that five per cent increase to mean the five per cent over two, or two and a half years for which this agreement was to run.  The Minister, as usual, turns his eye on the workers and they are to be appealed to and, as Deputy Tully said, the implication was that if they do not listen to that appeal, something worse will happen to them.</P>
    <P>The new Minister for Justice thinks it is time for the nation to come together.  He said people should join in an act of faith in the future of the country.  We should say that for the next 12 months no claim should be made except as a claim for Ireland, and Ireland in that connection is represented by the new Minister for Justice, and whatever he says is Ireland's claim should command everybody's support.  He speaks of responding to the challenge and said it was the test of any community.  If the <Col N="823" /> nation failed in this respect, it would not deserve to survive.  Then he spoke of the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; of the 15 per cent levies.  The Minister is a master of platitudes: he said problems are there to be solved.  He did not say but he hinted how he would solve this one when he said that we were very lucky in this country to have a tax system which would raise the revenue to keep Irish workers in industry.</P>
    <P>We were told two Budgets ago that all the ordinary sources of revenue had dried up or got to the point of diminishing return.  The Minister for Finance went back on that this year when he again attacked tobacco and beer but two years ago we had to fall down and adore the grand new tax, the turnover tax.  Apparently, another twist is to be given to that.  Out of curiosity, I looked at the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> statement of Receipts and Issues out of the Exchequer between 1st April, 1964 and 24th October.  That is the last one that came to my hand.  The return of tax and revenue yield shows the revenue is very buoyant.  People are being fleeced more and more by the impositions put on them in recent years but the turnover tax shows the biggest increase of all.  We get a £3? million increase in income tax; £2? million increase in excise; £1? million in customs and the turnover tax tops the lot at £7.6 million up to 24th October. It is running at a little more than £1 million a month.  It will certainly be £12, £13, or £14 million by the time we come to the end of the financial year.  It will be a scandal if there is any attempt to raise any further taxes from this community.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance did not really deny at the end of the Budget debate this year that he had at least £4 million to £5 million of what are ordinarily called &ldquo;Balances to be surrendered.&rdquo; It has been a feature of Budgets for years back that the Minister for Finance took cognisance of that and allowed £3 million or £4 million or £5 million for what was called over-taxation.  This year he did not allow anything for that.  He had enough money; he certainly had £4 <Col N="824" /> million and I believe he had £5 to £5½ million.  I recently saw where his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, complained that while he wanted certain moneys for social beneficiaries, he could not get them because the Minister for Finance had pledged the whole amount to the State service.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has never been notable for his views on State service, the garda, the Army and the teachers.  These are the people who, for years in the view of Fianna Fáil, should not get any increases in their remuneration.  Even in our time when we established the system of arbitration, the point was made many times that this made a very serious imposition on the taxpayers and for years, of course, Fianna Fáil had, in a grossly immoral way, refused to allow State personnel to get the benefits that industrial workers had got in the outside world.  However, the Minister for Social Welfare is annoyed that State servants have lifted so much of the extra revenue that came in that there is no more for the social beneficiaries. He could have doubled the old age pensions instead of giving the five per cent to State servants : that is all it was decided to give them, five per cent of what they were entitled to.  We could have given them the whole lot and that would be giving benefits to those who most deserved them.  The money given to those people could not have led directly to any increase in the balance of payments difficulty.  The people I am speaking of would have spent the extra money on foodstuffs or, perhaps, clothes, but they certainly would not be the people who would be directly responsible for any great imports. Indirectly, if they spend a lot of money in the shops, the shopkeepers might possibly import more goods.</P>
    <P>But there was plenty of money in hand and there still is, and I believe no matter how much we want to help the Government in the present situation&mdash; we are not objecting to what they are doing at the moment&mdash;we should certainly be very hostile to any suggestion that new moneys should be raised by taxes.</P>
    <P>I want to go back to the turnover <Col N="825" /> tax which showed an increase of £7.6 million and is still growing steadily with some four months to go.  Remember, on the statement of the Minister for Finance, three-quarters of that has arisen from taxes on food, fuel and clothes&mdash;three-quarters of what we get in.  That was the thought which was in the mind of the new Minister for Justice when he told us about this wonderful tax machine which will enable us to raise revenue for the help of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully spoke about the very affluent people in our community at the moment.  We are supposed to be living in an affluent society.  Sometimes I wonder who those people are.  I know people who are not affluent and they are the people one should seek to help at this particular time.  We are going to aid industry and business people. A new magazine <i>Business and Finance</i>, which was published recently, talks about one firm&mdash;I do not intend to mention it&mdash;and says that this firm's results one year were fabulous, outstanding and amazing and that their profits, free of tax, had come from a little over a quarter of a million to a little over a half a million&mdash;£267,000 had swivelled up to £516,000 in the last year.  After taxes had been paid, the difference was between £116,000 and £280,000.</P>
    <P>I should like to know who those affluent people are until I am told something about the distribution of that money.  It may not amount to much after a big number of shareholders are paid.  The increase in the profits of that firm rose from a bit over a quarter million pounds to a bit over half a million pounds.  They are among the people who are mainly a monopolistic concern here for the supply of certain goods to our people.  I do not believe they go into any export of goods at all.</P>
    <P>With regard to the help we have to give, I put down a number of questions for answer this week to find out how far we should help business, particularly those on the export side.  I asked, in particular, if the Minister for Finance would state his estimate of the value (1) in total since 1957 and to the nearest date and (2) year by <Col N="826" /> year since 1957, of the concessions made to firms producing or finishing goods for export by way of tax remissions or incentives of any kind.  I am told that the total since 1957 of the value of exports tax relief is £4 million.  Then I get the figures year by year which make up that £4 million : they are nil, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 1.2 and 1.1. That, from our point of view, is our sacrifice to the people who are exporting goods.  I am amazed the figure is not bigger than £4 million over five years.  I could not get any other information.  With regard to most of my other questions, I was told that the information was not available.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is always speaking here about firms who have come into this country with foreign capital.  I tried to find out whether these foreign firms coming in here were asked to put up any capital, what proportion was fixed capital and what proportion of working capital was provided by those foreign participants.  I am told the information requested is not available, and if it could be compiled at all, it would be only after a long and searching investigation.  The Minister did not consider that such an investigation would be warranted in view of the time and expense involved.  I asked the number of firms established in the State since 1957 completely by native investors or capitalists and I am told no information is available.  I also asked if the Minister would tell me his estimate of the value in total since 1957 to the nearest date of the concessions made to firms producing or finishing goods for export by way of rates remissions in whole or in part. I am told no information is available.</P>
    <P>Despite all this, we are helping those firms and it is suggested we are going to continue to give help to the firms coming into this country.  We do not know where we stand.  We do not know how much money those people have brought in and what proportion of the entire money involved is given by the State.  If the money supplied by the State is invested in fixed assets, it might be of some value, but, if not, it would disappear.  I also asked if there was any obligation on the firms who came in <Col N="827" /> here to train Irish workers.  I knew myself from sad experience, when we came to Government in 1948, that we had to tackle that problem.  We found our efforts were to some extent frustrated because the technical knowhow in regard to one State-sponsored concern was more or less a monopoly of foreign workers.  There had not been any training given to Irish workers.</P>
    <P>When the Shannon Scheme was going through, we imposed an obligation on the Germans that they would train workers to take their place.  There had been a considerable number of German technicians at the beginning. The result was, as a result of our endeavours, when the war came later on, the technical knowhow was in the possession of Irish nationals.  We got them trained by the Germans here.  The same thing happened, to a smaller extent, in the case of the Sugar Company.  I am told, in answer to my question, that there is no obligation imposed but that most of those people are keen on Irish labour or get them trained.  I am not talking about training.  It is a good thing to get them trained.  I am talking about Irish people being trained here.  I am told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that there is no obligation on those firms.</P>
    <P>I hope one of these days that we will have a full-dress debate on the point raised by Deputy Tully, that is, in regard to the European Economic Community.  There now seems to be on the Government side a change of attitude.  It has to be made quietly and cautiously because we have been talking a lot about applying for full membership.  We intend to persevere for full membership: we hope to get full membership and we have no fears of what full membership imposes.  I doubt every one of these assertions.  I would be horrified if full membership were granted to us in our present weak position.  I believe there are other ways in which we could lay a better foundation for better work in this country than running after this business of the Common Market, which only exists as far as General de Gaulle lets it exist <Col N="828" /> and which will probably be brought to a standstill one of these days.</P>
    <P>Suppose we get into the Common Market.  We have a programme of what is called economic expansion, which is built on our entry to the Common Market.  It is also built on the aim that we will get certain extra people into employment.  I just want to put in summary what I would like to put in great detail.  I take the economic statistics prepared for the 1964 Budget with the other table in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> I am dealing with this entirely on the employment side.  It has been pointed out that once you have a community to ills a prey, wealth accumulates and men decay. The Programme contemplates a great decay as far as our manpower is concerned.  If the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is looked at, one finds that by 1970, it is believed there will be 1,133,000 people in gainful occupation.  That is some 10,000 fewer than the number of people who were gainfully occupied in 1955.  It is just 12,000 under it.</P>
    <P>Supposing we get to the point that by 1970 there will be jobs for 1,133,000 people, do not forget that there will be a 15-year span as between 1955 and 1970.  The natural increase in our poulation is round about 26,000 a year.  It may not refer to those who will not require to look for gainful occupation.  There are a number of people who slip into the shoes of their fathers, or somebody who is a proprietor of a business.  It is a very weak calculation to say that only 20,000 will have to look for gainful occupation as they come to working age, whatever that may be.  Now, over 15 years, that is 300,000 people, and we are not providing a single job for these.  The hope is that by 1970 we will have the same number of jobs for gainfully occupied people, and other people, as there was in 1955, and 300,000 will either have to join the ranks of the unemployed here or take to the boats and go off to England and become emigrants.  That is what is called economic expansion.  If it is economic expansion, it has along with it a population expulsion and nobody can <Col N="829" /> boast of that.  That is our best hope and if we get into the EEC, that is what will happen.  In the meantime, we will have a new treaty with the faithless people who broke the treaties of 1938 and 1948, and that is the best the Taoiseach can hold out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to say much but I do think it necessary that two or three things should be said and in clear contra-distinction to each other.  Let me be quite clear, as Deputy Dillon was yesterday.  There are two very different things to be considered in relation to the levy that has been imposed.  One is the question of what we can do to assist the fundamental economic position of the country.  In relation to that, there has been, and there will be, a constructive approach with assistance towards any measures that are designed to help, whether promoted by the Government or anybody else.  The Taoiseach and the members of the Government can be assured that Fine Gael will not adopt the destructive line he and his colleagues adopted in 1956.  He can be absolutely assured that, so far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned, our approach to that aspect of this problem will be by constructive suggestions, constructive help and by solid backing to ensure that measures that may be taken for the good of the country as a whole will get every assistance possible from the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect to this problem which must be considered, that is, the aspect of how the levy came about and how it was allowed to come about. We all agree unanimously in this House that the action of the British Government in imposing a surcharge of 15 per cent is a breach of their specific treaty&mdash;a breach that must be deplored by everybody, indeed by the people on both sides of the Irish Sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the definite breach by the British Government of their solemn treaty obligations is a primary cause of the difficulties which we debated yesterday and today, it seems to me we must realise that their severity in their impact on Ireland is also caused by the personal failure of the Taoiseach <Col N="830" /> and his Government to be ready for any action that might be taken by the British in their balance of payments difficulties.  That is an entirely different matter from the question of remedying the difficulties by immediate plans.  In relation to that, the Taoiseach and his Ministers can expect to be criticised, not merely in this House but elsewhere, for their lamentable failure to live up to their responsibilities.  Everybody knew after the surcharge and when it was announced that the Taoiseach was going to England that he was going virtually on a wild goose chase and that it was a case of trying to lock the stable door after the horse had gone.</P>
    <P>The proper time for steps to be taken to see that the British Government were impressed by the particular circumstances of our trade relations with Great Britain was before anything was announced by Great Britain.  The Taoiseach has condemned himself out of his own mouth when he said he believed the British Government, the Prime Minister and other Ministers, were impressed by the arguments that had been put forward as to the special circumstances of our trade with Great Britain.  If the Taoiseach were able to impress the British Ministers with those special circumstances after the action was taken, surely to goodness if he had been carrying on his business in accordance with the arrangements made in 1960, he, his Ministers and his Government and our diplomatic arrangements would have seen to it that, before any action was taken by the British, they knew exactly where the special circumstances of trade between Ireland and Britain existed.</P>
    <P>As I say, we are not depending on speculation for the failure of the Taoiseach and his Government in this respect.  They have given chapter and verse for their failure.  It is all the more so because everybody has been shouting for some time that the British Labour Government proposed to take immediate action if they were elected. Newspaper correspondents on the other side were freely forecasting that there would be some type of customs duty imposed for the purpose of improving <Col N="831" /> the British balance of payments situation.</P>
    <P>The thing that shocked the people of this country, apart from the natural shock of the surcharge itself, was that it had apparently come on the Government as a complete and absolute surprise and that they had no plans whatsoever to deal with any action the British Government might take.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday even made it clear he had been warned there were likely to be difficulties in relation to Britain's balance of payments before the holiday recess, and yet the country was shattered by the lack of foresight, the lack of provision by the Irish Government.  All were completely stunned when action was taken in Britain.</P>
    <P>If there had been proper consultation before, if the Government had, before this action was taken, done what they allege they have done since&mdash; impressed the British Government&mdash;it would have been quite possible to have avoided the harmful consequences of the lamentable breach by the British of their solemn treaty obligations.  I am afraid things will never be the same again.  We will find ourselves in the situation where there will always be an uneasy feeling that this might occur again, and there will be no talk of a trade agreement again unless it is couched in a most solemn way which will not lend itself to a breach, as on this occasion, to solve temporary balance of payments difficulties or otherwise.</P>
    <P>That being so, it behoves us even more to fix our sights clearly on the objectives we should have in mind in relation to resolving the difficulties the surcharge has created.  The real problem we have got to face in relation to this surcharge is how we are to keep our export market in Britain.  The 50 per cent Market Development Grant, as it is called&mdash;it is, in fact, an export subsidy&mdash;is, of course, designed towards that, but my worry and anxiety is whether it is anything like enough or whether it will achieve that purpose. The detailed working out of it, admittedly, has not yet been put before <Col N="832" /> the House, and that is further evidence of the fact that the Government had no plans or preparations.  They are unable to give us anything more than a broad outline of the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is clear the Government do not realise that the retention of our export markets is the one thing we must try to achieve above all else, both from a short term and a long term point of view.  The campaign to buy Irish will not relieve in one iota our difficulties in relation to the export market under the conditions of the surcharge. It will, of course, assist if it is successful&mdash;we all hope it will be, and we on this side of the House will undoubtedly lend all the support we can to it&mdash;and will help to alleviate our own balance of payments problem.  However, it will not be of the slightest assistance in relation to the retention of markets in Britain by those people who have built up those markets with great toil and sweat during the years, in very many cases as a result of immense expenditure in money and effort.</P>
    <P>The retention of those export markets during the surcharge period, so that they will be there permanently after the surcharge has gone, is something which is absolutely essential for development of the Irish economy as a whole.  Frankly, I am disappointed to see that the only measure the Taoiseach is advocating designed towards that end is the 50 per cent Market Development Grant.  I agree with the President of the Federation of Irish Industries who stated last night, and whose statement was published in the newspapers this morning, that this was obviously an occasion when new tax incentives should have been developed and announced.</P>
    <P>I am not clear from the statement of the Taoiseach yesterday when he thinks the National Industrial Council will be in a position not merely to make their report&mdash;a preliminary report has to be made&mdash;but when the Government will be in a position to publicise that report and their decisions on it.  It is a matter of the first urgency that our sights should be trained on the inescapable fact that unless we retain our export markets, every other plan we have for expansion <Col N="833" /> in employment and in the standard of living will go by the board.  While the Buy Irish campaign will help our balance of payments situation, it could harm the retention of our export markets if the people are not told the truth, if they are led to believe that the Buy Irish campaign is an effective substitute for our export markets.  It is a corollary but not a substitute.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Government have only been able to introduce these two measures to meet what I regard as a serious situation, and that every person regards as serious, shows their complete lack of foresight.  I do not agree with the view expressed by Deputy Booth yesterday on the effect of the surcharge on Irish industry and on the economy as a whole.  I always try to avoid any comment on anybody which might appear to be a comment on his personal avocation, but it is evident that all of us, in our personal avocations, have a specialised knowledge of what transpires in that avocation.  I think Deputy Booth took advantage of his specialised knowledge in the motor assembly business, which is what one might call one of the protected industries, to make a general comment on our present situation.  It is entirely wrong that anybody should transfer the particular to the general in relation to this problem in the way I believe Deputy Booth did.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Taoiseach what other plans he has to meet this situation, because the plans he has announced do not go anything like far enough.  The Market Development Grant will be of some assistance but it will not train our sights, as I have said, on the vital necessity of keeping our export markets.  There have been in other countries, in Britain even, other tax incentives on the indirect taxation line. We have, of course, a very much greater tax incentive for exports than they have in Britain.  We had the range of income tax and corporation profits tax in the 1956 Act, improved, I admit, by the Minister for Finance in the Acts of 1957 and 1958.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, however, new circumstances need new measures.  In fact, I heard one industrialist saying <Col N="834" /> the other day that although he had gained very substantially from the change from the 1956 pattern of a remission of 50 per cent of tax on exports to the entire remission later on, he thought, on the whole, that it would have been a better national proposition if the incentive had been left at 50 per cent and that it could have been converted into 100 per cent remission on a crisis occasion such as this.  Be that as it may&mdash;I do not know&mdash; that was an individual expression of opinion and, I believe, an opinion expressed on that man's experience in his own particular branch of industry and it is, as I say, very rash to endeavour to transfer any argument from the particular to the general.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I would have preferred to hear the Government indicate that they were not merely going to provide a development grant for the retention of the existing markets but that they were going to provide considerable funds for the purpose of breaking into new aspects of development by existing industries already with the export sales set-up in Britain. There probably are some possibilities in that respect because, although the surcharge hits most of our exports in a very unpleasant way, at the same time, there may be cases in which it may be hitting other countries worse, where we have not an export at all at the moment and where there might be an opportunity for moving into the particular line concerned.</P>
    <P>The paucity of the new measures devised, the paucity of the new thoughts in relation to our exports, has shown that the Government were caught completely off balance by the action of the British and is, indeed, I am afraid, a lamentable criticism of them in office here.  But, at the same time, in criticising them as they are going to be criticised for that failure, I want it to be perfectly clear that that is an entirely different aspect from the aspect of what has got to be done and, in so far as that side of it is concerned, there will be no whispers put out by the Fine Gael Party on this occasion about Irish devaluation, as was done by Fianna Fáil and some of their <Col N="835" /> henchmen in 1956.  There will be no whispers by us of anything that will in any way at all hurt the economy but, on the contrary, we are going to stand solid to make quite clear that our criticism of measures will be constructive, designed to protect and even develop our export markets in the difficulties with which we are now faced.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Dillon began his speech yesterday, I was a trifle surprised by, although I welcomed, his initial announcement of his intention to deal with the matter before the Dáil in a constructive and noncontroversial way.  Unfortunately, he was not able for long to hold his balance on the heights of statesmanship and soon began to slide down again into the old groove with the monotonous reiteration of Party cliches and disparaging personal remarks. However, before he did begin his slide down to more familiar ground, he made two suggestions on which I propose to comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He suggested that we should put to the British Government a proposal that Irish products should be valued on entry into Great Britain, for the purpose of determining the amount of surcharge applicable to them, on the basis of deducting the value of British materials used in their manufacture. Deputy Dillon is probably not aware that this is a very old warhorse which has been in all the battles between ourselves and the British Government over the past ten years about the British method of applying to Irish industrial products the only permanent duty which now relates to them, and that is, the duty on man-made fibres.  I can say that the proposal was mentioned again during the course of our recent discussions with the British Ministers, and the representative of the Board of Trade intervened to say that it would be impracticable in operation.  I am afraid I could not argue the case with much enthusiasm because I recognised that it would, indeed, be very difficult to operate except perhaps in respect of a very limited range of commodities. <Col N="836" /> Deputy Dillon's second suggestion was that there should be a Government commission to investigate undesirable restrictive practices in industry.  I am against this.  To the extent that there are restrictive practices which are improperly and unduly inflating industrial costs, their elimination is now a matter of urgency.  The setting up of a Government commission would be seen to be something in the nature of a reprieve for these practices for the two or three years during which a commission of that kind would be carrying out investigations and preparing a report.  The elimination of costly restrictive practices is a matter which, in my view, can best be tackled at industry level through the industrial councils or, perhaps, even better still, at factory level where practical commonsense is most often to be found.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman and other Fine Gael speakers in this discussion have, of course, been saying that the Government should have foreseen all this.  Fine Gael are always able to foresee things after they have happened.  If we had foreseen the British intention to contravene their trade agreements, to impose these special charges on our industrial exports, what real difference would it have made?</P>
    <P>I mentioned here yesterday that the British Prime Minister in his statement to me during these discussions said that he had not realised, nor had his colleagues appreciated, the magnitude of the balance of payments problem that they were facing or the urgency of the need for action about it; but, of course, Fine Gael saw it all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon represented the intention to negotiate a new trade agreement as nothing more than a demonstration and of little practical value. It seems to me that he does not understand the situation very well.  The temporary charges are just a temporary nuisance.  The long-term damage which the British action could involve for us through the destruction of confidence in the continuity of tariff-free access to the British market for Irish industrial products could be far more serious in its implications for the industrial <Col N="837" /> development of this country and the fulfilment of our industrial development plans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>So he said yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The significance of a new agreement as I see it, provided we are able successfully to negotiate one, is that it would mean a reaffirmation in 1964 or 1965 of the special trade relationship which was set up by the Agreement of 1938.  This would go a great way to restoring confidence amongst prospective industrialists in the continued availability of the British market for their products provided they can produce them at prices which would make them competitive there.</P>
      <P>I should perhaps make it clear that there is no question of superseding the present Agreement by a new one unless it gives us advantages greater than the present Agreement provides.  In fairness to the British Ministers, I should say that the interest which they showed in the proposals which we had previously put forward seemed genuine and that they were anxious to get down soon to a real, practical examination of them or of any other possibilities that were put forward.  I hope to get these negotiations under way in the early future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish apparently felt obliged to offer some defence of the British Government for resorting to import levies, in handling their problems, as against other internal measures which they might have used.  Deputies are no doubt aware of the contrast which has been made in many international journals between the methods which have been adopted by the British Government and those that were successfully applied earlier by the Italian Government in precisely similar circumstances.  One significant consequence of the British action is that other countries in similar difficulties in the future are far less likely to listen to international exhortations to settle their problems by internal measures which do not involve exporting their difficulties to others.  The British Government may, indeed, have started something which they may live to <Col N="838" /> regret, they even more so than we, for Britain is still one of the great trading nations in the world and it is only by expanding exports in the context of a growing world trade that it can insure itself against a recurring series of economic crises.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish's sense of obligation to defend the British Government led him to seek to minimise the effect of their action on Irish industrial exports and he criticised the statements which I made immediately after the British announcement on the grounds that they tended to exaggerate the difficulties caused for us.  It is quite true that when I was speaking prior to the meeting on Thursday last with the British Prime Minister I had to keep in mind the wisdom of not weakening in any way the case which I had to make in London.  I may say that I did not expect that the outcome of those talks in London would be any different from what it turned out to be but I felt that it was necessary that they should take place so that any vain hopes that a mitigation of the impact of these special levies for our benefit could be immediately secured would be ended and so that, to the extent that it was within our power to do so, uncertainty about the position would be removed.</P>
    <P>Now that we know better where we stand we can appraise our problem in a fully realistic way.  It is true that the effect of the surcharges is serious and that it would be quite wrong to try to push it aside as of no great significance or as involving no great impediment to the continued growth of our industrial exports.  I believe, however, that the measures on which we have decided should prevent any deterioration in our industrial position provided these surcharges do not last too long. If it should seem that they are likely to continue for a protracted period without any further action being taken by the British Government to remedy their balance of payments situation, I would take this as an indication that there was a permanent weakness in the British economy with which the British Government were unable to cope.  This would require us to reexamine our economic development <Col N="839" /> policy in a fundamental way and would make more urgent the consideration of alternative policies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked yesterday for a more precise definition of our intentions regarding membership of the European Economic Community.  I do not think it is wise to be too precise in relation to a situation which contains so many uncertainties.  It is easy enough to say that our aims are, first, to acquire membership of the European Economic Community; secondly, to maintain and improve our trading relations with Great Britain; and thirdly, to acquire membership of the GATT; but it is clear these aims are not now completely compatible one with the other. Undue precision in the definition of these aims could operate to close avenues of negotiation which should be left open.  It is no harm to have and to be seen to have alternative courses to follow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish said that the effect of these British surcharges on our industrial laggards should be beneficial.  I made it clear yesterday that we intend to operate the new Market Development Grant scheme with this in mind. Unfortunately, however, the laggard industries and firms are those which are least likely to be involved in export business and consequently least affected by the British measures.  It is the most enterprising firms which have been pushing ahead with their exports and seeking every opportunity to expand their exports which are likely to be the hardest hit.  On the other hand, these are the firms which are most likely to be capable of surmounting their difficulties.</P>
    <P>The postponement of the tariff cut contemplated on January 1st next was a step which the Government took with doubt and hesitation.  It does not seem to us to be fully relevant to the problems resulting from the British surcharges and we fear that the postponement of this tariff cut may be seen as an excuse for relaxation by firms which are confining their operations to the home market, which are not energetic in the development of export business and have been making no effort to <Col N="840" /> expand beyond the limit of the opportunities created for them by our protective measures.</P>
    <P>I want again to make it clear that this decision to suspend the operation of that tariff cut is a temporary one only and it does not imply any change of our policy.  We are moving into a world trade situation, whether we like it or not, in which protection will cease to be an effective instrument of industrial policy.  Whether it is in the context of the GATT where negotiations for a 50 per cent cut in world tariffs are now beginning, or of membership of the EEC or of a new British agreement, we can expect to get wider possibilities for our exports only in circumstances in which the retention of our own high tariffs will not be practicable.  We cannot expect to secure from other countries greater export possibilities while refusing them trade opportunities here.  Ireland now depends for its life on exports and we cannot survive, much less improve our living standards as we desire, as a small island of protection in a free trade world.  A Federation of Irish Industries spokesman has expressed some disappointment that the announcement which I made yesterday did not embrace proposals for permanent tax changes.  First of all, I want to make is clear, if it is necessary to do so for the benefit of anybody without enough commonsense to understand it already, we cannot spend more money for the benefit of industry or anything else without more taxation.  That is a matter we shall have to consider at some future time.</P>
    <P>However, there has been consideration in progress for some time of the effectiveness of the tax inducements which we have offered to export development.  A committee of the National Industrial Economic Council has been working on this problem and has submitted a report containing a number of recommendations in this regard.  This report will be published probably next week or, if not, certainly in the very early future and action on the recommendations in that report will follow from its consideration by the Government.  I think it would have <Col N="841" /> been unwise to have rushed this consideration in advance of the publication of the report merely to have incorporated some additional decisions in the announcement I made yesterday.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman says the measures on which we have decided do not go far enough.  I admit we have not yet got a complete picture of the impact of these British surcharges on the circumstances of some industries.  On the basis of the information now available to us, I am satisfied they go far enough; but, in saying that, I do not want to suggest that these measures are final and inflexible.  Our aim is to maintain our industrial growth during this period of difficulty, to help industries to sustain at least their present level of activity and, where possible, to expand it, to prevent any decisions to slow down or avoid going on with plans for the extension of existing industries or the establishment of new ones, and to provide whatever reasonable help the Government can give to achieve this purpose, with the intention of ensuring that any measures we do adopt will be directed not merely to the easement of the immediate burden on industry but also to increasing its efficiency, so that, when the going becomes easier, our industrial growth can go ahead even more strongly than in the past.</P>
    <P>Apart from Deputy Sweetman, most of the other Deputies who spoke in this discussion yesterday and today appeared to agree with my contention that the measures proposed by the Government to meet the immediate situation are reasonable and adequate, and I should be surprised if they do not prove to be so, although I again emphasise the degree of flexibility in them and urge that any industry or any firm which does not consider that they are entirely appropriate to their circumstances should immediately come forward for discussion with the Minister for Industry and Commerce. They will find that our purpose is, while not providing any type of feather bedding to anybody, and striving all the time to achieve greater efficiency in production in every sector of the national economy, to help those who <Col N="842" /> are competent and able to help themselves as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask one question before we finish?  It is clear now, I think, that the British Government itself appreciates that what may at first appear to have been a level impost over all exporters entering the British market has, in fact, operated with exceptional severity against Ireland, both in respect of those special relations between the two countries and our special trading circumstances.  In that circumstance, although the Taoiseach has described as an &ldquo;ancient warhorse&rdquo; the suggestion I adumbrated to him today about the content of British raw materials in our exports to Great Britain, would he not think it worthwhile instituting consultations with the British Government, acknowledging that, while administratively it may create difficulties from which the British Government might recoil in normal circumstances, in these very present circumstances in some gesture from them to help us in our situation, this matter might not be further reviewed to see if, in a limited category at least of raw materials which may vitally affect some large exporters, a concession could be negotiated for the duration of the 15 per cent levy, both to end at the end of the levy, and the general question then to be re-examined on a quasi-permanent basis.</P>
      <P>Secondly, if I am correct, as I think I am, in believing the British Government to have a guilty conscience in regard to recent developments, does he think it proper&mdash;I think it is&mdash;to point out to the British Government that some compensatory gesture could be made by them without any prejudice to the principles on which they justify the 15 per cent levy?  If they were to make to us now the concession of abolishing the three months waiting period for store cattle on the British market and further facilitate exports from Ireland of livestock, carcase meat and bacon, as these three commodities &mdash;carcase meat, livestock and bacon&mdash; all come within the category of raw materials, or food, which the British Government have declared they do not intend to subject to the levy procedure.</P>

We have made other suggestions, which I do not want to enumerate, to the British Government which would ease the situation for us if they are thinking in terms of modifying the scope of their surcharge before reducing or eliminating it.  With regard to the second point, I completely disagree.  I would in no circumstances enter into an agreement with the British Government which appeared to imply on our part the acceptance of restrictions on our industrial growth in return for some benefit for our agricultural industry.  I am not going to argue this, but the Deputy has obviously not yet thought that one out.</P>

      <P>I do not want to argue, but I have thought this out clearly.  I predicate my suggestion with the suggestion that I believe the British Government realise that <i>vis-à-vis</i> ourselves this step has involved exceptional hardships.  There is no question of any <i>quid pro quo.</i> They have broken their agreement and no <i>quid pro quo</i> can alter that fact.  It is a fact and we have got to face it.  I do not think we should regard it as beneath ourselves to try to compensate our national economy, in so far as that may be possible for the duration of this difficult period, by reasonable concessions on the other side if these can be made without involving any acceptance by us of the propriety of what has been done, but, at the same time, recognising we have all got to live in the world together, and it could materially help if we could expand during this period of difficulty our export of processed agricultural goods, together with livestock.</P>

      <P>We were dealing with amendment No. 39a and I should like to draw attention to the relationship between sections 34 and 41 of this Bill, in case any Deputy should be puzzled by their being bracketed together.  We are seeking to amend two important sections in previous Acts dealing with the acquisition and resumption of land. Section 32 of the Land Act, 1933, dealt with the acquisition of untenanted land and section 39 of the Land Act 1939, dealt with the resumption of a tenanted holding.  Section 34 of the Bill introduces major changes in the first of these sections and section 41 introduces precisely parallel or cognate changes in the other.  It will be clear to Deputies that when we suggest an amendment in one, we must logically have a corresponding amendment in the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all, we have 15 amendments to the two sections but many of them are simply duplicates of one another for the reasons I have given and the whole 15 may be gathered into four distinct groups of closely related items.  I suggest therefore, with the permission of the Chair, the discussion on these amendments can be carried on in four parts: group (1), which comprises amendments Nos. 39a, 40b, 40c, 42, 42b, 42c, 43a and 43c, dealing with &ldquo;immediate neighbourhood&rdquo; and distance limits; group (2) which I would ask the House to consider when we come to them, consists of amendments Nos. 40 and 43, dealing with persons boating or fishing on lakes or rivers or on the sea; group (3), which I suggest can be taken, are Nos. 40a and 42a which deal with residence clauses; and group (4) consists of amendments Nos. 40d, 41 and <Col N="845" /> 43b which all deal with reasonable absences from home.</P>
    <P>Coming to the first group I have mentioned, that is, amendments Nos. 39a, 40b, 40c, 42, 42b, 42c, 43a, and 43c, these cover the immediate neighbourhood and distance limits.  Deputy Ryan's amendment suggests five miles. I have already said that in the existing Acts and in the Bill there are various uses of the phrases &ldquo;same locality&rdquo;, &ldquo;in the district&rdquo; and &ldquo;immediate neighbourhood&rdquo; and that these should be rationalised.  &ldquo;Congestion&rdquo;, &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; and &ldquo;residence&rdquo; should all be judged in the same way.  This may seem oversimple but we think it is the best way, and in amendment 40c, we have the definition of &ldquo;immediate neighbourhood&rdquo; as within a distance of three miles.  That is the difference between the amendment I have tabled and that tabled by Deputy Ryan which sets out five miles, but which as drafted, I suggested on the last debate, could mean that a man having a living in Ireland within five miles of a farm belonging to a brother in America could escape.</P>
    <P>On the question of distance, I know that it can be said that a well-equipped farmer could work a farm quite well from a distance of four or five miles but this is a matter for the Lay Commissioners to make reasonable exceptions and not victimise a working farmer.  I think I am meeting the reasonable arguments that have been made by providing a residence distance of three miles, and I ask Deputies to remember that, in the main, the section, when we come to it, is intended to deal not with the ordinary working farmer but with absentee owners, people who have acquired lands, some of them non-nationals, and who are living abroad.  It is to deal with these people, this class of person, that in the main these amendments are devised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask two questions on this.  It is rather difficult to differentiate different amendments from the general scheme. In relation to residence, it seems to me to differ unnecessarily in one aspect of the definition in the Bill and the definition that would exist normally in <Col N="846" /> the case of the Revenue Commissioners.  Surely we should accept that if a person is deemed to be permanently resident here by the Revenue Commissioners, and in consequence pays Irish tax, such deeming of residence by the Revenue Commissioners should also be a deeming of residence for the purpose of the Land Bill.  The two things are the same and it provides a readymade assessment of the position.  A person does not allow himself lightly to be classified a permanent resident here for revenue purposes because by so doing, he is accepting very heavy taxation implications.  It seems to me, therefore, that here we have got that readymade definition already for the particular case of residence and everybody is covered one way or another who has any land.  It seems to me you have got something that is satisfactory and has the benefit of an element of certainty and could therefore be taken into account in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Secondly, in relation to the question of residence and what I might call the family company, I do not understand how it is going to work because the Minister is providing that every single shareholder must be resident.  In the normal course, the person who is the tenant for life had some shares and the person who is the remainder man had some other shares.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the appropriate method of dealing with that is to provide that, so long as the person who is the tenant for life is resident there, that fulfils the residence qualification required by the Land Acts.  Otherwise, I cannot see how you can manage to deal with the case of a man who is genuinely living here but who many years ago, for a variety of reasons, put his affairs into a family company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know one case where a very large sum is paid out in wages in excess of the profits of the land.  That estate is kept alive by substantial other moneys.  There is a substantial amount of employment generated in the neighbourhood and paid for in the neighbourhood.  The trustees are the shareholders.  The tenant for life lives there and is deemed to be permanently resident for income tax purposes.  However, her daughter is <Col N="847" /> married away.  Naturally, I presume she will not come back until the father and mother have gone to their reward, because there is not room for her to live in with the in-laws. Yet, as I understand the group of amendments the Minister has put forward, that particular case is going to be hit.  It does not seem to be reasonable.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree with me when I say it is wrong to provide that residence for the Land Acts will mean one thing and residence for tax purposes another thing.  If you have the two together it is much better.  You have the definition already and it will be decided in every case, either by assessment or on appeal.  Why can they not be taken as ready-made definitions also for the purposes of the Land Acts?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has given me some difficulty.  There are so many ways, when one gets down to company laws, of cloaking the real beneficial ownership by company devices that, unless one provides in this way to deal with companies as a whole, the door is wide open.  There are company devices&mdash;I shall be dealing with them in a later section&mdash;where perhaps a herd could be made the majority shareholder in a company.  He would be resident there.  Let me emphasise that the Lay Commissioners and the Land Commission for their purposes would not in the ordinary course of events be interested in the type of case Deputy Sweetman has referred to, where you have a genuine family company fully working the farm or estate.  But there are, I am advised, a number of these estates that are held under companies supposed to be Irish companies with their owners resident abroad and with other people running them.  Where such lands are wanted for the relief of congestion&mdash;we must have an order of priority in this&mdash;I feel this residence qualification, as defined, is the method whereby we can get at these people. There is a large number of acres of land let by absentee owners.  A big part of the purpose of this Bill is to get after that land for the land pool. The purpose of these amendments and <Col N="848" /> of this section is to give the Land Commission the necessary legal teeth in suitable cases to get after these people.  Some of these companies, bogus or otherwise, have certainly been used by aliens for the acquisition of Irish land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I can assure Deputy Sweetman and the House there is no intention on the part of the Land Commission of getting after the ordinary family farm worked through a private limited company, where everybody knows such is the case.  There is no intention of using these powers against such a company. But in order to enable the Land Commission to deal with the type of case I have posed, it is necessary to spread the legal net as wide as possible.</P>

      <P>Why can you not exclude cases where the shareholders are entirely Irish nationals?  I am at one with the Minister on the case of the foreigners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another device to deal with that one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister entirely in spreading his net wide to bring under control companies operated for the benefit of non-nationals who hold land under the cloak of a variety of company law devices which, in fact, are operated to frustrate the functioning of the land code.  I think the Minister has received a considerable number of warnings from this side of the House that a situation was developing here that required control.  We are glad to see that the Minister has come to realise that an undue acreage of Irish land is passing into the hands of aliens, either by direct purchase or by a series of company law devices which are merely a thin disguise for the alienation of Irish agricultural land to foreigners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in dealing with that situation we should not spread our net so wide as to make no distinction between Irish nationals &mdash; people born and reared in this country &mdash; and people <Col N="849" /> who have come from the ends of the earth to buy land in Ireland.  We want legislation which will bring under the closest possible attention of the Irish Land Commission any acquisition of Irish agricultural land by aliens, no matter what device is operated to achieve that end.  We welcome this awakening by the present Minister for Lands to the gravity of the situation, which can only be brought under control by a comprehensive power which gives the Minister the right and imposes on the Land Commission the duty to take note of the acquisition of Irish agricultural land by aliens by any device, so that appropriate steps may be taken to put the matter right.</P>
    <P>As the Minister says, we may look at this again in connection with another group of amendments.  He has asked us to study the amendments in certain groups.  That is acceptable to us.  We are glad to convenience the Minister by undertaking to do that.  He has asked us to look at this section and these amendments together with section 41&mdash; one in the light of the other.  Now, in the first group of amendments which the Minister would like us to discuss together occurs amendment No. 43c. That amendment reads:</P>
    <P>In page 18, after line 35, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;immediate neighbourhood&rdquo; includes any place which the Lay Commissioners are satisfied is not more than three miles from the nearest point of the relevant holding.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to raise this question of the Lay Commissioners before in connection with section 27, and I explained the vicious and detestable character of the proposal that the executive head of the Department of Lands should also be a Lay Commissioner. This problem recurs here again because he exercises a quasi-judicial function in determining whether lands are in the &ldquo;immediate neighbourhood&rdquo; for the purposes of the Act.  The Minister intervened very impressively on a previous occasion and quoted from a memorandum prepared for the then Minister for Lands by the late Commissioner Deegan.  No doubt it impressed <Col N="850" /> the House that the Minister was in a position to say that Commissioner Deegan&mdash;a most distinguished public servant whom all sides of the House are prepared to acknowledge as having given great public service to the country&mdash;had expressed his opinion very categorically and very clearly that not only was it permissible but eminently desirable that the Secretary of the Department of Lands should himself be a Lay Commissioner.</P>
    <P>It was disingenuous of the Minister, to say the least of it, to make that communication in so formal a way to the House without adding that every single other Lay Commissioner appointed since 1923 down to today wished to be emphatically dissociated from Commissioner Deegan's opinion. Commissioner Deegan was the only person holding that post in Ireland since 1881 to hold that view.  It so happens that other men like Mr. Waddell, Mr. Herlihy and Mr. Browne &mdash;men I remember with admiration and, indeed, affection&mdash;were Lay Commissioners and were also officials of the Department of Lands.  It was Mr. Waddell, I think, who most strenuously objected to having thrust upon him the dual duties of chief inspector and Lay Commissioner.  I think it was Mr. Nally &mdash;another distinguished public servant &mdash;who succeeded in prevailing upon Deputy Blowick, then Minister, to relieve him of the post as Secretary of the Department because he said his experience of functioning as Secretary of the Department, and as a Lay Commissioner, which had been thrust upon him, had convinced him of the deplorable character of such a dual relation.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that every single Land Commissioner who has functioned since the Land Commission was first instituted in Ireland has taken a view diametrically opposed to that of Commissioner Deegan.  I want to warn the House that the very best information in the Land Commission is that if anyone challenges in the High Court a decision taken by the Land Commission when the Commission sits with the Secretary of the Department as one of its members, it will be upset as being contrary to the Constitution. <Col N="851" /> Remember the consequences of that. If anyone goes to the High Court or the Supreme Court and succeeds in upsetting one decision of the Land Commission, which comprised as one of its members at a court of the Lay Commissioners the Secretary of the Department of Lands, every decision of the Commissioners in which the Secretary of the Department participated will thereupon become null and void and every individual affected by the decision will have a right of action for damages against the Land Commission.  That will be the law.  That will be the finding in law, and it will not be open to Oireachtas Éireann to introduce retrospective legislation depriving people of rights which the Supreme Court had declared to be theirs under the law.  It is not constitutionally possible for the Oireachtas to legislate and say&mdash;once a person has been determined by the High Court to be entitled to compensation from the Government&mdash;&ldquo;You will not get the compensation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We will put down an amendment on Report Stage which will declare once and for all that executive officers of the Department of Lands must not be members of the Land Commission, and that the quasi-judicial state of the Land Commission must be restored.  I most earnestly ask the Minister between now and Report Stage to examine, if he has not already had put before him, the opinion of every Lay Commissioner who ever functioned in this country under a British or an Irish Government, against the opinion which he has tendered to the House as the judgement of Commissioner Deegan.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that here is a change which he says is designed to achieve nothing but expedition in the discharge of Land Commission business.  Against that, we on this side of the House consider this goes to the root and foundation not only of fixity of tenure but of the judicial functioning of the Land Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In this context it is not as grave a matter as in the context of section 27.  I cannot but bring to the Minister's attention facts which I can only assume he does not know or he would have told us about them when quoting Commissioner Deegan's memorandum here in Dáil Eireann. Looking forward to the amendment which we shall certainly submit to the House on Report Stage, I am asking the Minister to reconsider this whole question in the light of the situation.</P>
      <P>I want to say also that in the considered judgement of some of the most experienced ex-Land Commissioners, they are prepared to say that there has been, and that there is as of today, no delay as a result of preserving the existing reserved services of the Lay Commissioners.  They acknowledge that by strengthening the field force of inspectors, you could eliminate some delays that at present exist, but they are prepared to testify that whatever delay exists is to be put down to the inadequacy of the field staff&mdash;not in quality but in quantity.  I want to emphasise that&mdash;not in quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to weary the House with tributes to the special quality of Land Commission inspectors but it is an outstanding fact for which the country has every reason to be grateful.  No matter how high the quality of public servants may be, if they are called upon to do too much work, they cannot do it according to the standard they have set for themselves.  The remedy for any delay which may afflict the Minister for Lands in dealing with various matters appropriate to the Land Commission is to be found not in a change of the character of the Land Commission court itself but <Col N="853" /> in the strengthening of the full force of inspectors not in regard to quality but in regard to quantity.  If that is necessary, I am sure the House will not demur to authorising the Minister to expand the number of inspectors available to the Land Commission for the due discharge of their work.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to reconsider this whole question in the light of what I have said to him today.  I can assure him that it is a matter to which we attach most fundamental importance. I want to renew my pledge that if the reform I now urge on the Minister is not given effect to by this Government we shall repeal so much of this legislation as it may be necessary to repeal in order to restore the quasi-judicial character of the Land Commission court as soon as there is a change of Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain two things?  Is it not a fact that at present in the &ldquo;immediate neighbourhood&rdquo; is considered to be one mile?  Does this mean that, in future, when the question of division of estates come up the &ldquo;immediate neighbourhood&rdquo; will be extended to three miles?  Does it follow?  It is very difficult to say that &ldquo;immediate neighbourhood&rdquo; in one case is one mile and in another case three miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next, is it proposed to deal with the case of a person who has a residence in one place and an accommodation holding or a small farm more than three miles away?  I know that the Commissioner has the right to decide that, in such cases, he need not interfere but is there any guarantee that somebody might not try to bring pressure to bear and say, in effect: &ldquo;Apart from anything else, you are living more than three miles from the farm&rdquo; and that, therefore, it could be taken?  I have in mind a farm in North Meath which is owned by a widow with a young family who live eight miles away.  If her husband had lived, a house would have been built.  The family must, therefore, remain in the house in which they are at the moment until they grow up and are able to do something about it themselves.  These are the types of cases which would <Col N="854" /> arise.  For my information, perhaps the Minister might be able to give me some clarification on that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, I will get these specious arguments of Deputy Dillon out of the way first.  Let me emphasise on these amendments that we are dealing with what is, in fact, the immediate vicinity of the farm for residence purposes, which we are defining.  This is a matter for the Lay Commissioners.  It would appear that Deputy Dillon, by some very curious reasoning, seems to think that because Commissioner O'Brien is Secretary of the Land Commission he would be able to override his colleagues in the Land Commission and decide, although the law here says three miles that, in fact, it is four or two.</P>
      <P>To buttress up that argument Deputy Dillon quotes unknown former commissioners who he says were strongly of the opinion that the Secretary of the Land Commission should not be a commissioner of the Land Commission as well.  All I can say about these anonymous gentlemen is that they left no such opinion in writing after them.  I have put on the records of this House what I call the last legal Land Commission will and testament of Commissioner Deegan who was appointed by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government in 1930 and who was both Secretary of the Land Commission and a Commissioner of the Irish Land Commission in which capacity he served with distinction from 1930 to 1951.  He wrote this letter on his retirement to the then Minister, Deputy Blowick, specifying how essential it is in the interests of good administration to have the Secretary of the Land Commission also a Land Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This fear of the Supreme Court's upsetting the whole legal apple cart of of the Land Commission by virtue of Commissioner O'Brien being also Secretary of the Land Commission does not shake me one bit.  It is extraordinary how the Supreme Court, if Deputy Dillon's legal advisers are correct in their assumption, never thought fit in all the cases that were before the Supreme Court concerning the Land <Col N="855" /> Commission from 1930 to 1951, to say: &ldquo;Oh, this business is completely unconstitutional because the Secretary of the Land Commission is also a commissioner of the Land Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was in a number of these cases concerning the Land Commission before the Supreme Court in my professional capacity.  Is it not extraordinary that none of the lawyers all down these years discovered this wide-open constitutional point that becomes so suddenly clear to Deputy Dillon?  If he is making the argument against Commissioner O'Brien, appointed by me, the point never occurred, evidently, to Deputy Dillon or to his colleagues in all those years while Commissioner Deegan was Secretary of the Land Commission as well as Commissioner?  I think that that disposes of these professed legal fears of Deputy Dillon.  While I cannot anticipate any decision of the Supreme Court, if we come to that situation we shall have to meet it.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court, in two cases I mentioned in the course of this debate &mdash;(1) in the Dunleavy case from Mayo &mdash;upset the whole procedure of the Land Commission since its foundation and the sky did not fall.  The Land Commission had to follow out the new procedure laid down under the Dunleavy decision.  If something is found wrong in any land court, and the Supreme Court decides it is not properly constituted, that situation will be met.  I suggest that this again is another attempt by Deputy Dillon to create legal fears or bogies in the minds of the public outside this House that there is something very sinister in the Secretary of the Land Commission being made a Land commissioner and that in this way the rights under these amendments will be interpreted in a sinister way by at least one commissioner of the Irish Land Commission.</P>
    <P>As far as the one mile and three miles are concerned, &ldquo;immediate neighbourhood&rdquo; was not defined as far as I remember in any of the Land Acts&mdash;this is for congestion purposes. A number of sections gave specific powers to the Land Commission to <Col N="856" /> acquire land for the relief of congestion in the &ldquo;immediate neighbourhood.&rdquo;  That was left to be a matter of fact: I do not know how it was defined.  Here, for this particular purpose, that is, for the purpose of defining who is resident and who is non-resident, we are defining it.  We are saying that the &ldquo;immediate neighbourhood&rdquo; of the lands is a distance of three miles. The answer to Deputy Tully is that there are several cases where you have two farms over three miles distant and so long as they are worked together there is no question of the Land Commission interfering.  There is already a provision in law that if it can be proved that the economic working of the farms depends on each other &mdash;you may have a man with one farm suitable for tillage purposes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case where there is only a residence in one place and a farm in the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am citing that case. The place where the residence is may be where the man is doing the major portion of his tillage and the other place, which may be over three miles away, may only be useful for winterage.  If the Land Commission, in a suitable case, were moving in on him and if he could show that the economic working of his holding required both places it would be a good defence and he would be entitled to severance compensation in the case of the land being taken from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have several cases of this kind throughout the country and I want to emphasise again that these amendments are not designed to deal with such cases at all but to deal with the case where, for instance, a man may have a farm more than three miles distant that he is not living on or not properly using.  The amendments are designed to deal with the case of an individual who, through a company&mdash; or even himself&mdash;is not resident in the vicinity of the land but, perhaps, lives in some city here or on the Continent. I can also think of a fairly common device that has grown up in recent years&mdash;I am sure Deputy Tully has come across such cases&mdash;of the very <Col N="857" /> big industrialist who has a sort of hobby of having an agricultural holding down the country, to which he can siphon off certain losses on the expense sheet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot get away with that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>We have that type of people also.  I suggest that where land is required for the relief of congestion this type of person should be vulnerable before others and should be first on the list and in order to give the Land Commission the necessary legal teeth to increase the land pool, to get after that non-resident, it is necessary to have legal definitions of this kind. It is in that sense that I recommend this group of amendments to the House.  One of these amendments defines &ldquo;immediate neighbourhood&rdquo; as three miles.  I was not thinking of that distance originally but Deputy Ryan had an amendment down suggesting five miles and my amendment goes part of the way to meet that view.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Lands is now three years in office and despite that he has not gone to the trouble of exploring the records available to him in relation to the subject on which he has now spoken.  Those amendments and regulations will be decided on and put into effect by the Commissioners and Deputy Dillon has very clearly stated what may be described as a sound objection against the Secretary of the Department of Lands being a Commissioner.  The Minister now refers to the fact that Mr. Deegan was appointed by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and that he has made a recommendation stating it is advisable, not alone advisable but absolutely necessary, that the Secretary of the Department should be a Commissioner.  The Minister did not tell us that when Mr. Deegan wrote that letter to the then Minister for Lands in 1951, Mr. Deegan was dealing with the old Land Commission procedure in court and not with present procedure.  There are two quite different and distinct situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that Mr. Deegan was the <Col N="858" /> only individual connected with the Land Commission since it was established who made a recommendation of that kind.  If the Minister quoted Mr. Deegan and said that he was a nominee of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, surely the Minister knows that in the records of the Land Commission there is a recommendation by Mr. Dan Browne who was violently opposed to the Secretary of the Department also being a Commissioner, and that Mr. Browne was a Fianna Fáil nominee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

When the Minister found Mr. Deegan's letter to Deputy Blowick when he was Minister for Lands, why can he not find the observations of Mr. Dan Browne who was violently opposed to the Secretary being a Commissioner?  Mr. Browne was a nominee of Fianna Fáil in the same way as Mr. Deegan was a Cumann na nGaedheal nominee but it suits the Minister now to quote Mr. Deegan and does not suit him to quote Mr. Browne.</P>

By reason of an acute shortage of qualified personnel, a departure from the general practice was authorised in the case of the physiotherapist grade and new appointees, who have previous experience, may be remunerated at a higher point than the minimum of the salary scale in accordance with such experience.  I do not think I would be justified in extending this concession to the radiographer grade where no such acute shortage exists.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual contribution of each member country of the OECD is calculated as a percentage of the total budget of the organisation, <Col N="863" /> which varies from year to year. Ireland's contribution for 1964 has been calculated at the equivalent of £23,380 approximately.</P>
      <P>The article in the OECD Observer to which the Deputy refers is a very brief summary of a report entitled &ldquo;Problems of Manpower in Agriculture&rdquo; prepared at the request of the organisation by Professor Dovring of the University of Illinois.  Ireland was included in this study and is mentioned several times in the report.  It is not entirely correct to suggest that there is no reference to Ireland in the summary given in the OECD Observer as this country is mentioned in the chart on page 28.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it is not correct to say that the Irish economy is not reported in the OECD Observer.  I would, for example, refer the Deputy to the June, 1964, issue which contains an article on the Government's Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that on occasions when analyses of the economy of various countries were published in the OECD Observer, there has not yet been one covering this country?  Is the Minister aware that an official of the OECD has stated that the reason it has not appeared is that they asked for certain information from this country and did not get it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to have got a wrong report of what was said.  If you look at the OECD Observer for June 1964, there is an article there called &ldquo;An Irish Experiment and its Results&rdquo; and the article opens up by saying:</P>
      <P>The five years 1959 to 1963 witnessed the fastest growth in twentieth century Irish history.  How Ireland managed this achievement is explored by the OECD's Economic and Development Review Committee in its newly issued study of the Irish economy.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to indicate precisely the extent to which either subsidy or the loss on rural revenue account is incurred on connection of premises in more remote or isolated areas; but it is in general the case that premises in such areas are far more expensive to connect and, therefore, absorb a correspondingly greater proportion of subsidy and loss.</P>
    <P>The substantial reduction or abolition of special service charges which exceed 50 per cent of normal charges would require very substantial increases in the present very high level of subsidy and/or losses in order to meet the cost of connecting isolated houses on an extravagantly uneconomic basis.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister at least refer to the fact that there are householders in not excessively remote areas in County Monaghan who could reasonably look forward to getting supplies of light and power in less than two years, which is at present the period of waiting in some areas in the constituency which the Minister and I represent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I made it clear already that the costs of rural electrification have been rising.  In order to keep the special service charges as low as possible, the ESB at my request, and certainly of their own volition, have planned the whole of this redevelopment programme on a <Col N="866" /> basis of canvassing area by area and, instead of doing all the work at once, which involves difficulties, doing it at a steady pace over a period of five years from the time the subsidy was provided and connecting up a group of householders who are looking for power in the ordinary way in a given area.</P>
      <P>This reduces the overhead cost.  The Deputy should know that if they were to move from one place to another, connecting one house here and two houses there, the overhead costs would become enormous.  What they would like is to appoint a group of people, executives, workers and installators to move into an area to do all the work required of them there, and then move on into another area.  That would inevitably result in delays in certain areas in the redevelopment programme just as there were delays when the rural areas were first developed.  Many areas had to wait for a considerable time.  I can assure the Deputy that it is in the interests of the householders and the taxpayers that it be done on a planned basis area by area.  As far as I can recall, something like one-third of the areas involved have now been developed in County Monaghan and the whole work there will be completed in the next two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there are a great number of people who could have taken service with the ESB at any time without paying any additional service charges and for one reason or another refrained <Col N="867" /> from doing so.  As a result of the increased subsidy, a great number of people who up to now had not been able to get power are able to obtain the installation without paying extra charge, or by paying very moderate additional charges.  I do not see any other way of doing it except by a canvassing principle.  I regret some people will have to wait but we expect that in the next two years something in the region of 90 per cent of the rural population will be connected.  I think it will be a fairly good job, considering that it began after the war and for a considerable period incomes were not sufficient to bear the cost of current.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is expected that the work in question will be completed in about four months.  The number of outstanding applications in the area is 78 and service is currently being provided for 30 of these.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall that all right and I admit that what the Deputy has just stated is a fact.  The primary reason for the delay was the need to divert the engineering personnel to more urgent work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not wishing to criticise anything&mdash;the Minister has admitted he was wrong&mdash;I would ask the Minister would he not reconsider the relative urgency?  There are many people in the Walkinstown area who have been awaiting 'phones for five or six years.  Having regard to that would the Minister not revise his programme for Walkinstown?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the greater part of the built-up area in <Col N="884" /> the Walkinstown exchange area the service is on demand, that is, a person can get a telephone on demand; that would be within a few months of the date of application and that applies to the greater part of the area.  Out of the 78 outstanding applications, 30 are currently being supplied with telephones and the remainder will have attention when the underground cabling work is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister undertake to look at the application I have been recommending for some three years now and ensure that that person will receive immediate attention, particularly having regard to the fact that the father of the family in question is in very delicate health and the family have many an occasion to communicate with the hospital?  Is that not a case deserving priority?</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with the amendments relating to limits and distances, I have been endeavouring to elicit from the Minister if it is not a fact that the determination of the limits and distances will have to be made by the commissioners.  If it is a fact that the commissioners have to make that decision I want again to support very strongly the observations of the Leader of the Opposition this morning and to join in the protest to the Minister against the Secretary of the Department of Lands being a commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> Since the Minister was out of the House during Question Time he may have availed of the opportunity of asking the Secretary of the Department if at any time Commissioner Browne raised the objection which I outlined a few moments ago against the principle of the Secretary of the Department being a commissioner.  The Minister told us here that he had no idea of any such objection, that there was not a shred of evidence of it.  If he makes further enquiries from the Secretary of the Department he may be able to ascertain the views of that commissioner who, I would point out, was a Fianna Fáil nominee having regard to the fact that the Minister made reference to Mr. Deegan's being a nominee of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  Both of these gentlemen gave this country excellent service.  They have carried out their duties in a careful and efficient manner and not alone the Department but the country owes a deep debt of gratitude to both of them for the loyal public service which they have given.</P>
    <P>It is on record that violent opposition against this principle was expressed by Mr. Browne and I hope that between now and the Report Stage the Minister will make inquiries because we on this side of the House feel it is a matter that cannot be taken lightly.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, it is extremely doubtful whether the Supreme Court will hold it constitutional for the Secretary to sit as a commissioner under the procedure laid down.  I hope that the circumstances which were prophesised by Deputy Dillon may be avoided by the Minister seeing some common sense in relation to this reasonable plea.</P>
    <P>The Minister argues that it is necessary for the Secretary to be a commissioner so that he may have a knowledge of what is happening.  It is nonsense to suggest the Secretary of the Department does not know what is happening.  The senior commissioner who is appointed as such by sealed order of the Minister is bound to preside at the commissioners' meetings and to send a report of those meetings direct to the Secretary for transmission <Col N="924" /> to the Minister.  This is always done and the Secretary knows at once of any problem or difficulty arising in the Department.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is anxious for a speedy passage to the remainder of his Bill I would ask him to assist the Opposition in this matter.  It is our duty to be constructive in our opposition, to make the suggestions and observations we have to make and which we feel we are making in the interests of good law so that our citizens will not alone get fair play and justice but be seen to get justice to the last letter.  We feel, particularly in relation to these amendments, that our citizens cannot get justice and fair play if the Secretary of the Department is to be a commissioner.</P>
    <P>May I ask the Minister what regulations he will have or what machinery will be set up for defining this distance of three miles and if he is prepared to approach this matter in a reasonable and generous way in so far as the hundreds of landowners in this country are concerned who for one reason or another find it impossible to live on their holdings or to live within a distance of three miles.  It should be borne in mind that nowdays three miles is an extremely short distance.  It is not like many years ago.  We have had cases where people some years ago were living in houses on their holdings and for the convenience of the family and for the purpose of being near schools and churches they decided to purchase sites convenient to towns, with the result that they allowed the old houses to deteriorate or converted them into out-offices.  They now find that the provision in this amendment will seriously affect them.  That is why I want a guarantee from the Minister that the fullest possible consideration will be given to such cases.  I want a guarantee that their lands will not be confiscated or taken from them.  This provision may be the means of putting a number of citizens to the expense of having to change residence and go back to their holdings.  Everyone has a reason for selecting where to reside.  It may be that the owner of land would have gone to reside with a married son or a married daughter in the town.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> Once that land is being well worked, being looked after with the best of good husbandry, producing food for man and beast, providing employment and, more important still, providing a standard of living for the owner, then there should be a guarantee from the Minister that these lands will not be interfered with and I am very uneasy about the powers the Minister is seeking in these amendments.  I trust that the amendments dealing with distance and limits will be put into effect in such manner as to cause the least possible inconvenience to the owners of the land and that steps will be taken to ensure that justice and fair play will prevail in all decisions taken under these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister inserted this section into the Bill, I assumed he had collected all the statistics necessary to make a case for it.  I do not know that he has so far made his case.  The least I should expect from the Minister is a statement of the number of owners who would be affected by this section, if it goes through, and details of the number of owners who are at present depending on an outlying farm to make the home farm an economic unit and how he justifies the taking away of this outlying farm and thereby rendering the home farm uneconomic. I have experience of a great many people who, as long as I can remember, have been depending on farms outside the three mile limit to make the home farms economic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be very surprised if it were found possible to implement these provisions without creating chaos.  It could, perhaps, be done under some sort of resettlement scheme, through an exchange of holdings by agreement, but for the life of me I cannot see why one should compel a man to surrender a holding simply because it is situated that short distance away. Three miles in not a very significant distance in the light of modern transport.  Generally speaking, I regard this provision as most unfair.  As Deputy O.J. Flanagan says, if the farm is run properly and produces the maximum amount of food for man and beast, <Col N="926" /> there does not seem to be any justification whatever for this provision.  It would be much better for the owner, of course, and everybody else if a compact economic holding could be provided, but that has been found impossible in many cases.  People have not been able to find sufficient money to purchase a farm or a smallholding when it came on the market in order to add it to their own holding, thereby improving their income and making it possible to live out of the farm without any dependence upon casual work elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled an amendment providing for five miles.  I did so not because I felt there should be any limit at all, but, rather, because the Bill stipulated no distance allowance at all and, once a man's farm was divided between two holdings, he could, under the Bill as drafted, lose part of his farm, irrespective of how close it was to the homestead.  This seems to me to be a most dangerous principle.  It amounts to forbidding a man to hold two farms.  Its effect will be to depress the price of land.  In future any piece of land offered for sale will be offered to a very limited market.  Only those residing within three miles will be interested, unless some individual has some particular reason for wanting to reside in a particular place.  The holding might in itself be uneconomic but capable of being worked with another piece of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is, of course, a grossly improper interference with family life and family liberty.  There are many people who choose to remain single.  Domestic circumstances may compel them to remain single.  These have found it possible to live in some degree of reasonable comfort by adding to the immediate income available from the home farm the income derived from an outfarm or, perhaps, two outfarms. The entire holding may not comprise more than 35 to 40 acres.  Deputy Flanagan said three miles is no longer as long as it used to be.  As far as measurement is concerned it is, of course, still the same, but the time and stress taken to negotiate the distance has lessened considerably and the <Col N="927" /> probability is that it will lessen still more in the future.  The Minister may argue that we can extend the distance from three to five or 10 miles, should the necessity arise.  That is true, but we know from experience that State Departments invariably move long after the facts would justify their moving.  Meanwhile, this unnecessary restriction will remain, and so will the temptation to use it unfairly and improperly.  This is undesirable legislation and I would ask the Minister to think about it again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government and I are determined that vacant and unworked holdings should come under particularly severe scrutiny and should be especially vulnerable for acquisition to meet Land Commission needs in relation to the relief of congestion.  To that end I have been compelled to find a formula which will identify the vacant holding.  After much consideration I though it best to come at the problem from the other direction by saying that a farm is residential if the owner lives within three miles of it. That does not mean, as I have already said, that the Land Commission will immediately go after people who have farms three, four, or five miles away from their homes.  This is designed to get at the vacant holding and this is the most effective way that I can see of getting at the kind of nonresidential holdings I have already described to to the House.  The purpose of these amendments is to give the Land Commission more legal teeth to deal with the type of case I have illustrated here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The opposition to this amendment is apparently causing the Minister considerable irritation.  It is nonsense for the Minister to say that he is being capriciously obstructed in this matter.  We have consented to take whole groups of amendments and discuss them together and, if we wished to block the Minister, we could discuss these amendments seperately and divide on them separately, thus providing ourselves with enough material to keep us here for the rest of the day, without any discussion at all.  Far from adopting such an obstructive course, <Col N="928" /> we have expedited the enactment of certain parts of the Bill with which we find ourselves in agreement.  I do not give a fiddle-de-dee whether the Minister gets annoyed or not.  He can blow his top for all I care.  The fact remains this is a most grievous matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister tells us it is his purpose and the purpose of his Government to put teeth in the Land Commission's acquisition machinery in order effectively to secure the compulsory acquisition of certain holdings which, in the judgment of the Land Commission, are being inadequately worked. One of the tests of the special machinery envisaged under section 34 is now proposed to be a distance which is defined as three statute miles between the home farm and the out-farm.  The Minister points out that in addition there are other considerations which it will be the duty of the Land Commission to consider.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the afternoon, I was referring to the general question of the undesirability of the Land Commission charged with such responsibility consisting in part of an executive of the Department.  I said that the Minister for Lands was disingenuous in reading to the House a memorandum by the late Commissioner Deegan favouring the appointment of a Land Commissioner who was also Secretary of the Department, without telling them that no other Land Commissioner since the Land Commission was established shares the view of the late Commissioner Deegan.  Now, I am in a position to quote to the House&mdash;I cannot quote to the House but I can communicate to the House&mdash;the substance of the considered opinions of one of the most experienced men in Land Commission work in this country today.  His view is that the appointment of a top level executive, that is to say, a chief inspector or the Secretary or Assistant Secretary, to the additional post of Lay Land Commissioner, calling from him judgment in both capacities, is undesirable and perilous; that the Lay Commissioner should have no say whatever in staffing matters, which should be exclusively controlled by the Minister through the Secretary of the Department of Lands.</P>

      <P>Of which I have a copious and detailed note, and I am asserting that every single Lay Commissioner who ever functioned in this country, with the exception of the late Commissioner Deegan sustains the view&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Deputy is getting away from the point of order I have made.  I submit he is holding in his hand a document which he said represents the view of an experienced man dealing with Land Commission matters in this country.  I submit the House is entitled to know who is the author of this document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a copious note of what I was told and I am now asserting that every Lay Commissioner who has functioned in this country since the Land Commission was established dissents from the view expressed by the late Commissioner Deegan.  I am saying specifically that the late Commissioner Nally, who was at one time Assistant-Secretary of the Department and a Lay Commissioner, entered on <Col N="931" /> his duties, and by virtue of the experience of an attempt to discharge his duties as Lay Commissioner and Assistant Secretary, he went to the Minister for Lands, Deputy Blowick, and told him that he found it impossible to discharge these dual duties satisfactorily and begged to be relieved of either one or the other.  In fact he was relieved of his position as Assistant Secretary and remained as a commissioner only for that reason.</P>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind in this context the full gravity of this whole problem.  My information is that one of the considerations which must be borne in mind in this connection is that when the Land Commission is using the teeth the Minister for Lands now says this section is designed to provide, when there comes before them a question of acquisition of land, the only witnesses called to give evidence for the acquisition of lands are the State-paid inspectors of the Land Commission whose careers are controlled by the Secretary of the Department of Lands who may be one of those adjudicating on the evidence submitted by the inspector.</P>
      <P>Unless Oireachtas Éireann has taken leave of its senses, it is not going to enact in this House that where an issue is joined between the Land Commission and citizens of the State in respect of one of the most vital matters that can concern a person, that is, the ownership of his land, the man who has ordered the inspection with a view to its acquisition is to be the man who will sit in judgment on whether the land is in fact to be acquired or not. I want to advise the House of this, that I have the best possible opinion for the view that if Oireachtas Éireann so legislates, the first person who goes to the Supreme Court will have the legislation declared null and void.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the House should know that this is not an issue that arose today or yesterday.  This issue has been on the mat for 30 years.  I think it would be true to say that the first man who ever put this proposition <Col N="932" /> to the Department was the late Commissioner Deegan.  The present Minister for Lands professes to have no record of these matters.  I am going to suggest to the Minister for Lands that there are in his Department at this moment permanent records which will show that at one time Commissioner Deegan and the then acting Minister for Lands drafted a Bill for submission to the Government transferring all reserved matters to the Minister for Lands.  I want to tell the Minister for Lands that on the records of his own Department there is a decision of his own Government instructing him to withdraw the Bill. There is a view expressed by his own Government that if such a Bill were passed it would create chaos in Ireland and precipitate something approximating to a civil war.</P>
    <P>I ask the House: has the Minister for Lands been frank and open with it when he has quoted as a coercive authority the opinion of such a distinguished public servant as Commissioner Deegan, without telling us the rest of the story, which I have now told and which I challenge him to deny in any particular?  I am gravely shocked that I should find myself at this time addressing the House without one single Fianna Fáil Deputy on the Government benches.  They simply do not give a damn.  I am entirely satisfied that the decision recorded by the Government, over which the present President of the State was then presiding, that the reserved functions of the Land Commissioners be transferred to the Minister for Lands, which was drafted by the late Commissioner Deegan and submitted to the Government by the acting Minister for Lands, is evidence that this whole concept which it has been sought to commend to us has been exhaustively considered in the past and has been rejected as extremely dangerous and going to the very root of land tenure and fixity of tenure in this country.</P>
    <P>It is to me a tragic thing that we should find ourselves in Oireachtas Éireann debating a matter of this kind and yet being unable to secure from the Minister any evidence of understanding <Col N="933" /> on his part of the gravity of the matter involved.  I assert without fear of contradiction that there is not a responsible officer of the Land Commission today who, if he felt himself free, would not confirm that any delay in the examination of land with a view to acquisition is due not to anything transpiring in the Land Commission itself in Merrion Street but exclusively to the scarcity of experienced staff in the field.  I assert that is the universal view held by every responsible authority in the Land Commission today.  I assert that that is the conviction of every single Lay Commissioner, and I am now alleging against the Minister for Lands that the consequences of inadequate field staff are being pleaded in this House as a justification for a departure from the established practice of leaving certain reserved matters in the hands of the Lay Commissioners, who shall remain utterly independent of the political control of the Minister. That is something they cannot continue to be once one of the Lay Commissioners is, at the same time, the chief executive of the Minister's own Department.</P>
    <P>There is a perfectly simple way in which the Minister can resolve this whole matter and greatly expedite the consideration and passage of this land legislation.  He says he wants nothing but to promote expedition.  We say this is a matter of fundamental principle for us.  No reasonable Minister can possibly say, if he wants to put legislation through this House in an intelligent and rational way, he will set against something which the Opposition feel to be a matter of absolute fundamental principle nothing more than a mere machinery device he thinks might serve to expedite the due despatch of Land Commission business.</P>
    <P>I asked him to drop this whole concept of the joint function of Commissioner and Secretary of his Department.  If he does, I do not see anything in the remaining sections that we cannot quickly resolve by discussion and mutual consultation.  I pointed out to him in regard to an earlier section, which was ambiguous to those of us who read it for the first time, <Col N="934" /> that it needed only a short discussion to remove our doubts and allow us to go on to the next section and the next section.  Exactly the same procedure is most readily available to the Minister if he will show some understanding and appreciation of the gravity we attach to the principle I am now defending.  I think Deputies will agree there is nothing left in this Bill which is incapable of quick resolution.</P>
    <P>Again and again in the sections remaining and in the amendments proposed by the Minister this vital evil is occurring.  Again and again when we raise our voice against it, the Minister expresses the intentions of a man who feels he has got himself into an intolerable position and, out of mere obstinacy, is resolved not to yield an inch.  The Minister has his duty to do and we have ours.  We do not intend to allow the country to be under any illusion in regard to this matter.  I quote the authority and I claim the support of every Land Commissioner who ever functioned in Ireland, against the view of Commissioner Deegan.  I believe I have the support of every responsible officer of the Land Commission experienced in the work of land acquisition.</P>
    <P>I know that analogous proposals of this kind were submitted to the Fianna Fáil Government in the thirties and were withdrawn and never brought before Dáil Éireann.  I stake my reputation that the proposals in section 34 and the proposals in section 37 of the Bill are poison, and are rendered gravely dangerous to the whole pattern of our society by this damnable principle, proclaiming that it is no longer necessary in a matter of this character that it should be evident to all that justice is being done.</P>
    <P>If a man is on trial for his life in this country, or on trial for stealing a pair of boots, and judgment goes against him, he has a court of appeal to go to&mdash;not only one court but maybe two or three&mdash;but if a decision is taken in the court of the Lay Commissioners of the Land Commission which operates to take from him the land he was born and reared on, and radically to alter his whole life&mdash;in a <Col N="935" /> court where no evidence can be called, with a salaried servant as one of the Lay Commissioners sitting on the bench&mdash;there is no appeal to any tribunal in the land.  Unless we are all taking leave of our senses, we cannot legislate in that way.</P>
    <P>I claim the support of every Lay Commissioner in the country.  I claim more than that.  I do not know how many Ministers for Lands we have had since the State was founded, but they have belonged to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, the Fianna Fáil Party, the Clann na Talmhan Party, and were members of inter-Party Governments and Fianna Fáil Governments again.  The present Minister is the first Minister for Lands who has brought a proposition of this character before Dáil Éireann.  I am telling him that an acting predecessor brought in not this proposal but an analogous proposal and the Government of which he was a member contemptuously rejected it and forbade him to submit it to the House.</P>
    <P>On these facts I put it to the Minister that he should indicate his readiness to mend his hand in regard to this matter of the permanent head of the Department of Lands being at the same time a Lay Commissioner.  If he does, the whole situation in regard to the remaining sections of the Bill is revolutionised and we see nothing in it that cannot be quickly disposed of, but with this poisonous principle reasserted again and again, I am bound to inform the Minister that some difficulties will arise.  If we conceive it to be our duty to fight this issue on every occasion that presents itself, we will do so.</P>

      <P>It would appear now that the main impetus in the attack of Deputy Dillon and his cohorts on this Bill is being switched and concentrated on the fact that Mr. O'Brien, the Secretary of the Department, has been appointed a Lay Commissioner of the Land Commission and will act as such with other Commissioners in dealing with the powers under this Bill as well as the general land law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> I listened very carefully to what Deputy Dillon said.  He purports to speak on behalf of all the Lay Commissioners of this country, but he has not quoted any one by name.  I wonder why Deputy Dillon was so coy about quoting from the document purporting to give the highest Land Commission opinion on this matter and why he would not give the author of the document.  I assert that Deputy Dillon has no right whatsoever to try to put over to this House or the country that any of the Lay Commissioners shares his view on this issue.</P>
    <P>I have put on the records of the House what the late Commissioner Deegan had to say on this issue.  As I pointed out, he was an appointee of a Cumann na nGaedheal Government and was there for some 11 or 12 years both as Secretary and Commissioner of the Land Commission.  I have pointed out and put on the records of the House that when leaving office, Commissioner Deegan wrote to the then Coalition Minister for Lands, Deputy Blowick, and is on record for all time, that it was essential to the proper working and administration of the Land Commission that the Secretary of the Department should also be a Commissioner of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon claims that this was an individual view to which every single individual, every legal man, and every Commissioner was diametrically opposed.  He goes further and says it is completely unconstitutional for the Lay Commissioners to operate with the permanent Secretary of the Department being also a Commissioner, and that a person has only to walk into the Supreme Court to upset a decision by virtue of the fact that the Secretary of the Department is also a Commissioner.  I want to pose this question: if that is so, is it not an extraordinary thing that during all the years a Cumann na nGaedheal appointee was there as Secretary and Commissioner, no legal luminary woke up to the fact that a decision of the Land Commission could be upset for that reason.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon comes back to the attack and again asserts that the whole problem about this Land Bill is the <Col N="937" /> fact that the Secretary of the Department, Mr. O'Brien, is a Commissioner of the Land Commission, that by virtue of that fact justice will not be done, and that any decision taken by the Lay Commissioners will be &ldquo;bust&rdquo; in the Supreme Court.  He asserts that there is no responsible official of the Land Commission and no responsible lawyer who does not accept that view. He asserts that he has it on the highest legal authority in this land that by virtue of the fact that Commissioner O'Brien is the Secretary of the Department, any decision taken by the Lay Commissioners will be unconstitutional and will be upset in the Supreme Court.  He asserts that no one except myself as Minister for Lands has agreed with the view put forward and expressed to the then Minister for Lands by Commissioner Deegan when he left that office.</P>
    <P>He mentions some other high officials of the Land Commission who held a quasi-judical function and alleges that they were opposed to the Secretary of the Department being also a Commissioner.  Whatever document Deputy Dillon has been quoting from, and whatever records he has from the Land Commission of which I am not aware, I again say that up to now I have no evidence of any of the allegations made by Deputy Dillon.  I know that the late Commissioner Deegan was both Secretary of the Department and a Commissioner.  I know Mr. Waddell was both Chief Inspector of the Land Commission and a Commissioner.  I do know that the late Mr. Herlihy was an Assistant Secretary of the Department and was also a Land Commissioner all or some of the time. The late Mr. Nally was appointed, I think, by Deputy Derring.  As far as I know, when Mr. Nally became Commissioner, he was nearing 63 years of age and he felt he was not physically in a condition to carry out both jobs.</P>
    <P>But, contrary to what the legal luminaries who have been advising Deputy Dillon that this is unconstitutional have to say, contrary to the assertion that I am the only individual who agrees with the view of the late Commissioner Deegan that the Secretary of <Col N="938" /> the Department should also be a Commissioner, there is another view that I have discovered in my researches. If Deputy Dillon and his cohorts were ever brought by hard facts to squirm on an issue, I advise them to get ready to squirm now because I have another document to quote.  Unlike Deputy Dillon, I shall not be so coy in saying who wrote it or in saying what the date of it is.  In contradistinction to the assertion by Deputy Dillon in relation to Commissioner O'Brien as being Secretary of the Land Commission that everything done would be unconstitutional, let me quote paragraph 5 of a letter dated 26th April, 1949, which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The maximum number of Commissioners should be fixed at four.  No legal barrier should be placed on a Commissioner holding also an administrative post or the post of Chief Inspector.  In my opinion it is desirable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;desirable&rdquo;, mark you</P>
    <P>&mdash;where four Commissioners are operating that both the post of Secretary of the Department of  ,,Lands and that of Chief Inspector should be held by Commissioners and though this is not a practical issue at the moment I hope you will leave the way open for such a point of view in future.  If you wish to have provisions made enabling two Commissioners to form a quorum for court sittings, I am prepared to agree.  The case for such a provision is not so strong if there are to be four Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Who wrote this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Deegan for Deputy Blowick.  Was he not Secretary of the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not at all, but his eminence, Professor Patrick McGilligan, the Minister for Finance in the Coalition Government.  Here is Professor Patrick McGilligan, the legal luminary of the Coalition Government, telling Deputy Blowick how desirable it would be that the Commissioner should also hold these offices.  Here is the legal luminary who was Minister for Finance in the Coalition Government <Col N="939" /> backing up the opinion of Commissioner Deegan, which I quoted here laying down the desirability of having the Commissioner also either Chief Inspector or Secretary of the Department. Deputy Dillon has the audacity to come along here and to try to assert that, against all legal opinions, we are taking this step and that any decision to be made by the Lay Commissioners of the Irish Land Commission will be unconstitutional and void because Mr. O'Brien, the Secretary of the Department, is also a Lay Commissioner.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon can sort this out with his colleague, Deputy McGilligan. Perhaps Deputy Dillon will say to Deputy McGilligan: &ldquo;What was wrong with you, Paddy, when you wrote that letter?  Did you not know that if this came to the Supreme Court it would be blown sky high?&rdquo; Perhaps Deputy Dillon can reconcile this official view of Professor McGilligan, the Minister for Finance of the Coalition Government, who laid down this law and made this suggestion and has backed up the last will and testament left by Commissioner Deegan to the hilt.</P>
      <P>How was it that the legal expert of the Coalition Government did not foresee the dangers of the Supreme Court &ldquo;busting&rdquo; the Land Commission high, wide and handsome if the Secretary of the Department was made a Commissioner?  How was it that it never occurred to the legal adviser of the then Government, one of Deputy Dillon's own colleagues, that these dire things would arise constitutionally if they attempted to make an officer of the Land Commission a Lay Commissioner as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, in view of Deputy McGilligan's letter to his colleague, Deputy Blowick, dated 26th April, 1949, which I have quoted, that Deputy Dillon and his cohorts should for the rest of this Bill be silent about these allegations that everything being done here is unconstitutional, that the Secretary of the Land Commission was made a Lay Commissioner for some sinister purpose and that this whole business is a mere trick to take <Col N="940" /> land from the working farmers of Ireland.  Deputy Dillon has got this now.  I hope he puts that in his pipe and smokes it.  I hope that those outside whom he has endeavoured to terrorise by his bluff in this House will now realise how much weight is to be attached to the sheet-anchor of objection by the Fine Gael Party to this Bill because the Secretary of the Department is also a Lay Commissioner.</P>

      <P>I have already charged the Minister with being at least disingenuous. I must now declare him to be thoroughly dishonest, which I believe is a Parliamentary expression. He has quoted from a public document which, no doubt, he will lay on the table of the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now he was the Minister for Finance, we have discovered. I want to say quite deliberately that the views of the Minister for Finance are almost invariably at variance with the views of any normal man, whoever has the misfortune to become the Minister for Finance.  The views of the Minister for Finance always are that if it is possible to get rid of a Land Commissioner, or anybody, or to make anybody do two men's jobs for one man's pay then by all means let us do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> I think the present Minister for Lands will agree with me that you can almost see that document being written by the hand of the late Commissioner Deegan.  There are many Departments of State&mdash;12 or 14.  From each of these Departments of State there pours into the office of the Minister for Finance every day thousands of questions relating to the status, position and tenure of various public servants.  Anybody who has been Minister in this State knows well of the practically-weekly conferences that take place regarding establishment matters with the Department of Finance.  I do not know who signed the document the Minister read out but it is a regulation Department of Finance admonition to the Land Commission to cut down and try to get one man to do two men's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is signed personally by Deputy McGilligan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is perfectly all right.  When I was Minister and wanted two civil servants, I asked for eight and probably ended by getting four and usually had to create two jobs for those I did not really want.  That is common experience.  We all did it when we were Ministers; all Ministers do it at present.  It is part of the awkward, clumsy functioning of the Government machine.  I do not want to expand on that very much but it works in the long run because even if you get four when you want two, before very long you want two others and you fit them in somewhere.</P>
      <P>That document is simply a recommendation relating to the financial and administrative affairs of the Department of Lands.  It carries with it no considered judicial or legal opinion for which Deputy McGilligan would be held responsible.  It is the Department of Finance view of some proposal advanced by the Minister for Lands. That had its origin in the Department of Lands.  Who originated it?  Who was the executive head of the Department of Lands at that time when the document issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's colleague, Deputy Blowick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="942" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no, no.  He was Minister and the executive head of the Department was Commissioner Deegan. He thought this whole thing up.  I want to interpolate a few remarks here. I knew Commissioner Deegan and I say with great deliberation, lest the fact should be lost sight of in the course of earnest disputation here, that one of the most distinguished public servants of the country was Commissioner Deegan.  He was a fearless public servant who had no concern but to do what he thought was his duty by whatever Minister he served.  The fact that I disagree with his view&mdash;I want to make it perfectly clear&mdash;in no sense diminishes the height of my admiration, born of long acquaintance for the late Commissioner Deegan or the praise I have to offer for his distinguished public service to the country. Nor do I think it right for the present Minister, even by implication, to suggest that anybody on these benches deprecates a proposal to appoint Mr. O'Brien, the present Secretary of the Department of Lands, as a Commissioner.  I said at an earlier stage in the debate there is no fitter person to be a Lay Commissioner than Mr. O'Brien nor is there any man better fitted to be Secretary of the Department of Lands.  The basis of our contention is that there is nobody, short of an archangel who is fit to be Secretary of the Department and a Commissioner at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it should be the Minister's concern, as it is certainly mine, to avoid any suggestion that there is a personal reflection either on Mr. Deegan or on the present incumbent of the office of Secretary of the Department of Lands.  It is irrelevant and silly of the Minister today to produce the Department of Finance document of 1949 which, in fact, I believe was drafted by Commissioner Deegan in order to prove that Commissioner Deegan was right in his view. I have not the faintest doubt&mdash;I never had&mdash;that Mr. Deegan was most profoundly convinced of his view and was actuated by no consideration but a desire to improve the public service but that is no reason why I should not advance against him the view of every <Col N="943" /> other Lay Commissioner who ever functioned in this country.  Mark ou, the Minister does not challenge me.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to speak of the views of the present Lay Commissioners, I did not think it appropriate or proper to ask them for their views because while they hold office by quasi-judicial tenure they are still public servants serving the present Government and I do not think they would be free, whatever their personal feelings might be, to brief me in any sense against a policy which the present Minister sponsors in the Dáil.  They are not among the people to whom I have had access or with whom I have discussed this matter but I am certain, on the authority of those who know, that with the exception of Commissioner Deegan&mdash;I do not know what the existing Commissioners' views are &mdash;every other Lay Commissioner in the history of the country since the Land Commission was set up holds a view diametrically opposed to that of the late Commissioner Deegan.</P>
    <P>I make no more of that than this: that I charge the Minister with being at least disingenuous, if not dishonest, in reading out to us at an earlier stage of the debate this testimony of the late Commissioner Deegan without saying: &ldquo;But that was the opinion of one man whereas there are a dozen men of equal experience who took a diametrically opposite view.&rdquo; Perhaps the present Minister did not know this but if he knew, and intended to communicate to us the text of Commissioner Deegan's view, he should have told us that this was the man whose views were of so unique a character that he advised and helped his Minister to draft a Bill dealing with analogous matters, the reserved functions of the Land Commission, and that the Bill was of such a character that when it was submitted to the head of the Government, he tore it up and sent for the executive head of the Department and for the Minister and dictated to him, as head of the Government, the maximum he would tolerate of the proposals that had been submitted by the acting Minister, advised by the late Commissioner Deegan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="944" /> The Minister can ascertain the truth of those facts on the files of his Department.  And so absolute and comprehensive was the condemnation of the then Minister's Taoiseach and his colleagues that the Bill never saw the light of day.  It dropped dead before it was ever submitted to the Oireachtas. Again, I want to make it crystal clear that I do not quote this as any evidence of bad faith or failure in public duty on the part of the late Mr. Deegan; I salute it as the deeply-held conviction of a conscientious public servant that he considered it his duty to press upon his Minister whenever the matter arose.  Although I pay that high tribute to his integrity and sense of duty that does not require me to feel that because he felt so strongly on that matter it is sacrilege on my part to differ from him.</P>
    <P>I respect him for the courage and tenacity with which he held this view. I respect a public servant who has experienced the rebuff of pushing his Minister into the position of being mowed down by the Taoiseach of the Government to which he belongs, but he said: &ldquo;That does not alter my view. I think the Taoiseach was wrong and if I am, in the future, asked for advice, I will tender the same advice as I tendered on the previous occasion. The decision is for the Minister and whatever his decision is I will carry that into effect.&rdquo; You have this testimony while he was serving in the Department under the Minister and he was a man who had manoeuvred his Minister into the position of suffering a sharp rebuff from the head of the Government to which he belonged. That testified the integrity and courage of the man.  As he left the service, he left a valedictory memorandum behind him.  That is admirable in its integrity and courage but it carries no conviction with me.</P>
    <P>I have often met a man before with a been in his bonnet and that man's particular bee will buzz with a particular buzzing but the fact that he nourishes and cherishes the bee and grows attached to it does not make the bee any better.  It is still a buzzing bee; it is still that man's particular bee.  I maintain most energetically that <Col N="945" /> the Minister has been guilty of dishonesty in seeking to suggest to the House that a document signed by Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, represents Deputy McGilligan's opinion as the principal legal adviser of the Government to which he then belonged.  I am obliged to attach the word &ldquo;dishonesty&rdquo; to that because the Minister must know that the Minister for Finance is not charged to give legal advice to the Government to which he belongs.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know that the Attorney General is the person charged with that responsibility.  It is particularly disingenuous of the present Minister for Lands to read out a document signed by Deputy McGilligan dated, 1949 when we all know that Deputy McGilligan became Attorney General during the 1954-57 period. There might be some simple-minded people in Dáil Éireann who would forget the fact that Deputy McGilligan has served this State at various times as Minister for External Affairs, Minister for Industry and Commerce and Attorney General.  I admit to find such brilliant versatility in one individual is not usual but I am proud to claim that Deputy McGilligan is a colleague of mine.  Did the Minister think he might inculcate some confusion in his colleagues' minds by saying that Deputy McGilligan was legal adviser of the Government when he knew the document from which he was quoting was signed in his capacity as Minister for Finance?  If the Minister set out to do that, he sought to mislead the House and that is something of which no Minister should be particularly proud.</P>
    <P>I am not in the least concerned to find that Deputy McGilligan or any other Minister for Finance would not jump with agility at any proposal put forward by Mr. Deegan or the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture or the Secretary of any other Department, that he was planning to make one man do two jobs for the salary of one.  If Deputy McGilligan proposed that on the grounds of constitutional law, the whole Department of Finance would fall in their standing.  It is hard, I suppose, for those who have <Col N="946" /> not served in the Government to understand the mighty load which falls on the shoulders of the Minister for Finance.  It is one of those horrible things which faces every person when he is a member of the Government. One must change overnight from being a reasonable man into a kind of worn gramophone record with a sharp &ldquo;no&rdquo; on it, except there is a proposal that one might do two men's jobs for one man's salary.  Then one voice will echo down the corridors of Government buildings with &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In this case the Minister for Finance, in 1949, gave exactly the answer I would expect any Minister for Finance to give.  Let us be clear it was not the legal advice of Deputy McGilligan. That was not the opinion of Deputy McGilligan when he was the law adviser of the Government to which he was a member.  I think the Minister should be ashamed of the effort he has made to create a wrong impression in this regard.</P>
    <P>This matter has not been tested in the courts as yet but I have been informed on the highest authority that men, long experienced in this office, have repeatedly expressed the view that it ought to be, in view of the unique procedure of the Lay Commissioners court, from which, the Minister will agree, there is no appeal.  It is also uniquely true that there is no parallel, that the only witnesses to be heard in matters of acquisition are paid inspectors of the Land Commission.  It is also the view of the highest authority that some time or other decisions in excepted matters, come to, or participated in, by a Commissioner, who is also Secretary of the Department, will be challenged before the courts.  I have the highest authority for expressing the view that it is impossible in that event to justify any judgment on such an issue other than one declaring the proceedings to be null and void.</P>
    <P>I recall that there is an earlier paragraph in the White Paper accompanying this Bill which speaks of the need of one section to remedy an adverse decision of the High Court.  The Minister will recall that I mentioned that it might not be adverse to the Land <Col N="947" /> Commission but it might be adverse to the other party.  The fact is that down through the years the High Court have repeatedly set aside findings of the Lay Commissioners court on issues, which, compared with the issue of one of the Lay Commissioners being himself the Secretary of the Department, must be regarded as trivial.  I have said already, and, I here again claim the highest authority for this opinion, that if such suit were brought into the Supreme Court deciding that the person of the Secretary of the Department in the Lay Commissioner court as Commissioner is ground for upsetting the decision of the Lay Commissioners' court, a whole series of consequences could ensue which would be irremediable by this Oireachtas because, not only could many of the decisions, or all of them, of the Land Commission court, in which the Secretary of the Department of Lands participated, be set aside, but all the consequences flowing from the decisions of that court could be made the subject of an action for damages against the Minister for Lands.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Sinn Féin Funds case would render the Oireachtas unable retrospectively to prevent the courts continuing to declare its unconstitutional decisions which contain the fatal flaw of a quasi-judicial person being disqualified owing to his executive character as Secretary of the Department.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which will be discussed again on the Report Stage of the Bill and it is a matter about which I am wholly unable to understand the Minister's position.  I think his triumphant production of the irrelevant Department of Finance memorandum shows the extremity to which he is pushed to defend his whole untenable case.  I would have sympathy with the Minister if I felt that he is deeply concerned in this matter as a high matter of principle.  Then I would feel&mdash;here is something for the Division Lobby; there is no other way to have it resolved.  He holds his views just as strongly as I hold mine but I do submit a grievance to Dáil Éireann.  I do not think it is the right way to legislate, <Col N="948" /> if the principal opposition, or any substantial body of Deputies, say: &ldquo;Here is a matter about which we feel deeply; it is a matter of high principle to us and one which it must be admitted is nothing more to you than a device to expedite the procedure.&rdquo; The principal Opposition then say: &ldquo;Listen; we will offer you another method and sustain you in giving effect to it to secure the increased expedition you want.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For the Minister to stick his heels in and say: &ldquo;I do not give a damn for your principles; if I can steamroll over them, I will&rdquo; is an utterly indefensible position for the Minister for Lands to take up.  I have it on the best possible authority of those who have long experience of administration in the Land Commission that, so far as the Commissioners' desks are concerned, there is no delay; there is no accumulation of documents; there is no waiting list of matters for examination. That there is some delay is universally admitted but all experience seems to point to the conclusion that that delay derives from an insufficiency of experienced inspectors in the field.  If four or six inspectors were added to the inspectorial staff, I want to submit there would be no delay whatever in carrying out the inspection or the acquisition of land.</P>
    <P>I want to assert that the Minister's allegations, that the proposals contained in this Bill will expedite acquisition proceedings, are wholly illusory and I&mdash;not that there is much hope in view of the Minister's attitude &mdash;renew my strong urge that we regard this as a matter of fundamental principle, while he regards it as purely a matter of expediency.  If he had any respect for the legislative procedures of this country, then he would gladly concede what I ask and look for the support he requires to get the extra staff.</P>

      <P>This is no memorandum from the Department of Finance, and I want to put that on the records of this House.  When I was quoting from it I knew Deputy Dillon, like a hooked eel, would wriggle and wriggle in an attempt to vomit the bait and get away, but I shall not allow him to get away <Col N="949" /> from this document.  I have one leg on the bottom, and that is the opening of this letter.  It is suggested that this letter was a composition by civil servants of the Department of Finance and that Deputy McGilligan merely put his name to it.  Let me quote from the letter of 26th April, 1949:</P>
      <P>Dear Minister,</P>
      <P>With reference to your letter of 1st April, 1949, and to our discussion of the 21st idem about the future position of the Land Commissioners, I set out hereunder in modified form my suggestions for dealing with the problem.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon wants to suggest that this was a mere production of the Department of Finance, cooked up by some civil servants to which Deputy McGilligan signed his name in an offhand manner without any consideration; but this letter sets out to confirm a discussion, about the future of the Land Commissioners and the Lay Commissioners of the Irish Land Commission, between Deputy Blowick, the then Minister for Lands and Deputy McGilligan, the then Minister for Finance.  As a result of this discussion and after mature consideration, Deputy McGilligan writes personally, and signs it personally, to his colleague.  I quote paragraph 5:</P>
      <P>The maximum number of Commissioners should be fixed at four. No legal barrier should be placed on a Commissioner holding also an administrative post or the post of Chief Inspector.  In my opinion it is desirable where four Commissioners are operating that both the post of Secretary of the Department of Lands and that of Chief Inspector should be held by Commissioners&mdash;</P>

    <P>Here is Deputy McGilligan, Minister for Finance in the Coalition Government, a man who is held up to us as one of the greatest legal experts in the land, deliberately writing to his Government colleague.  Here is a man who has spent years of his life lecturing on constitutional law in University College, Dublin, who has served as Attorney General in this country and who, according to Deputy Dillon, advised poor Joe Blowick to drive a coach and four through the Constitution by appointing the Secretary of the Department of Lands a Commissioner of the Irish Land Commission as well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has told the House that he has it on the highest authority that, because of the fact that we have appointed Commissioner O'Brien, who is Secretary of the Department of Lands, to be a Commissioner of the Irish Land Commission, any decision taken by him as Commissioner or his colleagues will be &ldquo;busted&rdquo; high, wide and handsome by the Supreme Court by virtue of the fact that he is also Secretary of the Department. Deputy Dillon told us he has that proposition on the highest legal authority.  Again, Deputy Dillon is coy.  He does not quote for us here the high authority who has so advised him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to quote one of the highest legal authorities in the land, to wit, Deputy Patrick McGilligan, a former Attorney General, who says here that not alone is it legally proper but it is desirable that the Secretary of the Department of Lands should also be a Land Commissioner.  Either Deputy Dillon with the advice he has got must take an awfully poor view of his colleague, Deputy McGilligan, who is supposed to be one of the best constitutional lawyers, or the advice he has got must, to say the least of it, be unreliable on this issue.  I knew the Deputy would endeavour to wriggle away from this proposition when he adverted here to <Col N="951" /> this as a trick of mine to appoint the Secretary of the Department, with some dire intention, to be a Commissioner of the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>When the Lay Commissioner, Mr. Deegan, was retiring, he said in his valedictory address, as Deputy Dillon chooses to call it:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before leaving the Department, I want to place on record my most definite view that the Secretary of the Land Commission cannot do his work as satisfactorily as he would wish to do it or as he should do it, unless he is at the same time a Commissioner.  From my administrative experience in other Departments and from outside knowledge of the Land Commission, I held that view when I came here as Secretary in 1930; my years as Secretary and Commissioner from 1930 confirmed it; the past couple of years when I have been Commissioner without administrative responsibility have doubly confirmed it for me.  It is, or should be, an axiom that the Permanent Head and Accounting Officer of a Department should be effectively aware of everything that is happening in his Department and should be in a position to ensure administrative and financial efficiency and correctness.  Here in the Land Commission a Secretary who is not a Commissioner does not come in contact with large blocks of most important work until something goes wrong: the most troublesome and danger-holding items of our business (those matters related to the acquisition and distribution of land) are routed direct to Commissioners and unless the Secretary is himself a Commissioner &ldquo;anything may happen&rdquo; without his knowledge, and, though Permanent Head of the Department, he has not the opportunity which he should have of controlling in good time, in the interests of efficiency, economy and financial correctness, the administration for which he is responsible.  It is definitely wrong that there should be work in progress in any Department in regard to which the Permanent <Col N="952" /> Head and Accounting Officer has no effective say: and, as regards the Land Commission, I wish to state from long experience inside and outside the Land Commission, that that position can be avoided only if the posts of Secretary and Commissioner are combined, and to emphasise once more my very definite view that the Secretary here should always be a Commissioner.  The fact that I held the two posts for so many years and during periods of exceptional stress shows that there is nothing impossible in the proposition&mdash;indeed each post makes the operation of the other easier for the holder.</P>
    <P>There is the record of the view of a Secretary - cum - Commissioner who served for 11 years, at least, in the dual capacity and who advised the then Minister for Lands, Deputy Blowick, that this should be the procedure in the future.  There is the view that is recorded by Deputy McGilligan when he was Minister for Finance and this is the proposition on which Deputy Dillon and Fine Gael have now been arguing&mdash;that this Bill is completely wrong by reason of the fact that the Secretary of the Department is also a Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary view is now being asserted that, though everything done while Mr. Deegan was both Secretary and Commissioner over a period of 11 years was perfectly constitutional, the fact that now a new Secretary of the Department is also appointed a Commissioner of the Land Commission makes everything utterly wrong, that every decision taken will be null and void and will be so declared by the Supreme Court.  The country is threatened with the dire consequences that will follow the appointment of Commissioner O'Brien as Secretary and Lay Commissioner.</P>
    <P>In view of these documents, of this record, as against the unquoted opinions, the Capel Street opinion, being posed by Deputy Dillon on this issue, I think it is clear to everyone now, whatever confusion may have been created by Deputy Dillon and his cohorts, that on this Bill Deputy Dillon thought he would get the people <Col N="953" /> outside to believe that something unconstitutional was being done.  He thought he would terrorise the landowning community into the belief that for the first time this sinister appointment was being made in furtherance of some queer, dim, distant plot of Fianna Fáil to take land from the general public for their own followers. No doubt he thought he would get away with that.  As against his unquoted legal authority, I have quoted a well-known legal authority in the written record of the former Minister for Finance, former professor of constitutional law, former Attorney General, Deputy Patrick McGilligan. Let Deputy Dillon put that in his pipe and smoke it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to do so very energetically.  This is not only a proposal that one man should do two jobs. This is a proposition that two men should do four jobs.  A proposal was put up by Mr. Deegan&mdash;who, remember, wanted to abolish all the reserved services to the Department&mdash;that the higher officials of the Department of Lands ought to double up and be Commissioners as well and, of course, the Department of Finance at once submitted it to Deputy McGilligan with a whoop of joy.  This disingenuous Minister, as I shall call him, now seeks to create the impression that this was a personal correspondence between Deputy McGilligan and his colleague, Deputy Blowick, but when he went to read it, he found it opened with &ldquo;Dear Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Can one picture any of Joe's colleagues sending him a letter addressed &ldquo;Dear Minister&rdquo;?  I do not suppose the Minister for Lands addresses the Minister for Finance even as &ldquo;Dear Dr. Ryan&rdquo;, or that the Minister for Finance greets the Minister for Lands with &ldquo;Dear Mr. Moran&rdquo;: after a lifetime of association in public life, they would address each other by their Christian names.  If a letter should come to me addressed &ldquo;Dear Minister&rdquo;, I would say to my colleague concerned the first time I met him afterwards: &ldquo;Did you see this blasted document I got from you yesterday saying: `Dear Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> Would you get rid of 50 of your officials' &rdquo;?  If he said to me he had not seen it, I would say to him: &ldquo;Of course you did; you signed it&rdquo;.  He would say: &ldquo;I signed 140 documents yesterday&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands may think this is good enough to pull the wool over the eyes of the less sophisticated members of his Party and of those who do not know the intricacies of Government administration.  This is the classical Department of Finance rejoinder to any proposal to get any one man to do two men's jobs.  It is not a legal opinion.  It was not imparted by the Minister for Lands to the Minister for Finance as carrying any legal significance whatever because, as the Minister for Lands well knows, if the constitutionality of any proposals in legislation made by him to the Government were called in question, the Party to be called on to decide the issue would be the Attorney General, no matter what status in law he enjoyed as compared with the Minister for Finance in his office.  In government the Minister for Finance deals with finance matters. The Attorney-General deals with the law and the Constitution.  They do not cross each other's paths and do not trespass on each other's domains.</P>
    <P>But, Sir, the Minister for Lands is now carried away by the violence of his own views in this matter, which I am wholly unable to understand.  He defends no principle.  He is merely trying to convey to the House a piece of administrative machinery but he is getting quite passionate about it and he says that all this objection that we have been raising in regard to the dual capacity of the Secretary of the Department and the Lay Commissioner is related to Mr. O'Brien.  Of course, there is not a speck of truth in that.  I have said and repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> that the personality of Mr. O'Brien does not come into this question at all, but, over and above that, the Minister is now trying to persuade the House to forget that all this business is linked up with section 27 which is cognate with section 34.  The whole of our case relates to the problem of acquisition and to the undesirability of <Col N="955" /> the Minister having power to say to a Lay Commissioner who is Secretary of his Department: &ldquo;Tell the Chief Inspector to inspect the land of A.B.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what poor Deputy Corry is talking about. The objection is that if the inspector sent out to walk those lands on the orders of the Secretary of the Department of Lands recommends the acquisition to the Land Commission, when the Land Commission Court goes down to the district to hear the case of whether these lands should be acquired or not, sitting on the bench of the Lay Commissioners Court is the man who initiated the proceedings for the acquisition of the land which he is now hearing as a judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not seem to have made much impression on the Minister.  This comes up again now in this group of amendments that the Minister has asked us to consider jointly.  I refer to amendment 43(c) which he has asked us to consider with the other amendments.  Amendment 43(c) raises precisely the same principle because, as the Minister rightly said, the immediate aim is defined by statute.  There can be no argument in the court about that.  The only argument is, is the out farm three miles from the home farm or is it not?  I come into court and say it is two and three-quarter miles.  The Land Commission inspector comes in and says it is three miles and 22 yards.  I am not sure that on that issue I would even have a right as owner of the land to be heard by the Lay Commissioners. Yet, I am not sure that this is not one of the matters relating to acquisition in respect of which the Commissioners will hear only the inspectors of the Land Commission.  Perhaps the Minister will look into that and advise us at a later stage.  But, here is a question of fact.  Bear in mind that from the <Col N="956" /> Lay Commissioners Court on a question of fact there is no appeal.  They determine finally and irrevocably as to whether this three miles condition is observed or not.  I say that this involves again the principle that you shall not condemn a man to appeal from the prosecutor to the prosecuting counsel and I do not believe that any reasonable Deputy in the Fianna Fáil benches disagrees with me in this contention.</P>

      <P>I know that some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies agree with me and view this development with the gravest possible apprehension.  I view it with great apprehension and I view with great dismay the attitude of the Minister for Lands in this regard.  What puzzles me is this &mdash; he is convinced that we are concerned to use this as a stick to beat him with in the election, but is not he in a position to disarm us at once by saying: &ldquo;Very well.  If you object to it, I will take it out&rdquo;? There is no difficulty about it.  Nobody suffers; nobody is any the worse off. He is further entitled to say to me: &ldquo;But, if I take this out, can I understand that I have the full support of the Opposition in increasing the inspectorial staff in order to get over the delays which I believe are at present existing in the acquisition of land?&rdquo; and I am prepared to say in advance: &ldquo;Yes, we will support you.  If you believe delays are being created, let us try strengthening the field staff of inspectors&rdquo; and is not he in a position then to say, in spite of Deputy Flanagan's, mine and my other colleagues' opposition to the whole of this Bill, &ldquo;While I do not agree with them, if they feel like this about it I will take out of the Land Bill the very thing they complain about&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister cannot have it both ways.  If the Minister wants to make the case that this is fractious opposition for opposition's sake, he must be in a <Col N="957" /> position to add that they are asking him to do something in regard to this Bill which if he did it would go to the whole root of the legislation.  He is not making that case.  He himself says these are merely administrative procedures designed to improve the administration of the Department.  I am putting it to him that for us they are nothing of the kind.  He replies: &ldquo;You are making a dishonest case to frighten the people.  You are trying to misrepresent purely administrative reforms as being highly dangerous and radical departures.&rdquo; I say to him: &ldquo;If you believe that I am wielding that weapon and you want to strike it out of my hand, why do not you say now: `I will concede the point and I warn you that if the adjustment of the inspectorial staff in the office does not meet my requirements for expedition I will come back to the Dáil and renew the proposal which you are opposing now'?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am prepared to say that I never could undertake to the Minister that any question of expedition would, in my judgement, justify the kind of departure he advocates&mdash;never&mdash;but I would be prepared to say to him: &ldquo;We are prepared to support you in any other administrative measures you think necessary in order to get the expedition you seek but do not ask us to accept what we believe to be wrong in principle for no better reason than that the machinery can be geared up to work a little faster.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that when we return to the discussion of this Bill, if the Minister will concede this point to us, the rest of it can be passed through in a couple of hours.  It will be a very much better Bill and without section 27 and this new proposal for legislating the views expressed by the late Commissioner Deegan, I believe the Minister will be able to do the work or get the work of the Land Commission done very much better than it has ever been done before.</P>
    <P>I do not despair that when the atmosphere has cooled down a little the Minister may not on reflection determine to come that distance to meet us.  I would be glad if he would. <Col N="958" /> I should like to see the good parts of this Bill operating.  I should like to help him to get them into operation. It is my public duty to fight the principle I have been fighting today, as I am convinced Deputy Flanagan would fight it, horse, foot and artillery, with every resource we have because we believe it to be wrong.</P>

However, I have a duty on behalf of some 60,000 tillage farmers and as Chairman of the Beetgrowers' Association, that is, to see that this extraordinary stockpiling of sugar purchased abroad at a higher price than the cost of home-produced sugar will not be used as a big stick to the detriment of my colleagues in the Beetgrowers' Association in their fight for a just price this season.</P>
      <P>I hold that while the farmers are prepared to produce beet, they are entitled to the full acreage they can produce and are entitled to the protection of the Minister for Agriculture in that line.  What has happened?  I admit that, for a new Minister, the Minister made a very good attempt to deal with this.  He states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> Production of refined sugar from the 1963 beet area of 88,000 acres amounted to 131,000 tons and the imports of sugar referred to by the Deputy were necessary in order to meet the difference between this domestic production and total requirements.</P>
    <P>The 88,000 acres of beet averaging 12 tons to the acre, with an average of 16 per cent sugar content, gives a yield of 168,960 tons of sugar that is 38,000 tons more than the Minister's figure. There was an importation during the year 1963 of 39,562 tons of sugar, giving a total of 208,522 tons. According to the reply I got from the Minister here last week, of that quantity in sugar and sugar goods we exported 51,000 tons bringing it down to 157,000 tons required for domestic use, 120,000 tons for household use. Therefore there was in stock before this quantity came in 37,522 tons of sugar.</P>
    <P>Why should we add to that as imports from January to July of this year 39,562 tons of sugar at an average cost of £73 11s. a ton, that is, £15 10s. a ton higher than the cost of sugar leaving our Irish factories?  The total stock, when that was brought in was 77,084 tons of sugar or over 50 per cent of our total domestic requirements.  The Minister continued in his reply:</P>
    <P>The world price of sugar has now fallen to about one-third of what it was a year ago and sugar could now be imported here at significantly less than the cost of home-produced beet sugar.</P>
    <P>From January to July of this year, there were exported from this country 8,231 tons of sugar at an average cost of £92 13s. a ton.  The cost of beet manufactured into sugar and selling as the best refined sugar leaving our Irish factories was £58 a ton.  Why should there be an import of close on 40,000 tons of sugar when there was already in stock some 37,000 tons?  Why should those imports be made at an average cost of £73 a ton against the Irish price of £58?  If that quantity of sugar were required and the Sugar <Col N="960" /> Company asked the Irish farmers to produce it at the price that was down here, there would be an increase in our beet prices of 52/- a ton.  I am sure the farmers would be very happy to do it.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister the reasons for this.  He gave me as a reason that the imports of sugar were necessary in order to meet the difference between domestic production and total requirements.  The domestic production, as I pointed out, was 168,000 tons.  What has not appeared in the question I asked the Minister and which I kept up my sleeve was that there were 40,000 tons of sugar brought into this country in the year 1963 and that should be capable of fully satisfying our requirements.  Seeing that we exported only 51,000 tons of sugar, there were 37,500 tons of sugar left in stock.</P>
    <P>I know the difficulties we have to meet at times but there is such a thing as the sinews of war.  When we find that our costs of production have gone up and the price of our beet is based on costings, we do not want to have a big stick of 60,000 or 70,000 tons of sugar lying in stock there to fight us. In my opinion, that is what it is there for and I object to it.  I object to the expenditure of £400,000 more on that import of sugar than was paid for the sugar produced by our own farmers. Surely they are entitled to as good a price at least as any nigger.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let me say a very sincere word of thanks to Deputy Corry for the fact that he obliged me yesterday evening in agreeing to postpone the raising of this question on the Adjournment because it was necessary for me to be elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I want to say that it is with very great trepidation that I rise to debate any matter of this sort with Deputy Corry because, as the House is aware, Deputy Corry knows more about beet production and sugar than probably any other Member of this House.  He has had a lifetime of experience.  However, I hope to be able to reassure him on what is, I think, his main worry, namely, that the <Col N="961" /> Irish Sugar Company is stockpiling with a view to using that stockpile, perhaps, to depress either acreages or prices in the coming year.</P>
    <P>I should like to take all the mystery out of this whole question of sugar.  I think it is something that we can put down in black and white, in fairly simple terms and on relatively small sheets of paper.  The enormously diffuse statements and the complicated explanations which have been given about it from time to time seem to me to be totally unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I shall begin with the picture as it was in 1962-63.  The total production of sugar from the 1962 beet crop was 125,000 tons.  In 1963 we imported, as Deputy Corry rightly points out, 43,000 tons of sugar.  That gave us our requirements for both domestic consumption and the export market. We used approximately 120,000 at home and we exported 52,000 tons. In other words, between home production and imports, we had a figure of 168,000 and, between domestic consumption and exports we had a figure of 172,000 tons.  The difference was made up between the opening and closing stocks on hands in the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>The position in 1964 is very much the same.  The figure I gave in reply to the Parliamentary Question is correct.  The total production of sugar from the 1963 crop was 131,000 tons.  Imports so far are 40,000 tons. That gives us 171,000 tons of sugar, which roughly corresponds with what we will need for both domestic consumption and our export requirements.</P>
    <P>The nub of the difference between Deputy Corry and myself in this matter is whether or not the 1963 crop produced 131,000 tons of sugar or whether it produced 168,000 tons, according to the Deputy's calculation.  My calculations are simple.  We had a total acreage of 88,000 acres.  Our average yield per acre was 10.7 tons of beet. That gave us approximately a total of 942,000 tons of beet.  The extraction of sugar in the year was higher than usual.  It was, in fact, 88.22 per cent. As you know, the standard is 15.5 per cent sugar content from gross beet tonnage.  If one makes a simple <Col N="962" /> calculation and takes, first of all, 15.5 per cent of 942,000 tons of beet and then takes 88.22 per cent of that, one gets a figure of 129,000 tons so that, according to the normal standards of sugar content in beet and the degree of extraction of sugar from that sugar beet, the yield from the 1963 crop should have been 129,000 tons.  In fact, it was a little better, for one reason or another.  It was 131,000 tons and I am afraid no calculations of Deputy Corry's can alter that figure.</P>
    <P>I should mention here that that figure is in accord with the figures for previous years.  If Deputy Corry's figures were right and if we were to get 168,000 tons of sugar from 88,000 acres&mdash;the calculation is a simple one &mdash;that would involve getting practically two tons of sugar per acre.  We have never got that.  The best we got recently was in 1960 when we got 1.76 tons of sugar per acre.  In 1961 we got 1.46; in 1962 we got 1.6 and, in 1963, as the calculations I have given show, we got 1.49.  There is the difference in our calculations.  Deputy Corry thinks we should have got two tons per acre roughly from our 88,000 acres.  In fact we got only 1.49&mdash;approximately 1½ tons per acre.  No matter what way we try to do it we cannot change the fact that out of our 88,000 acres we got 131,000 tons of sugar from the 1963 crop, and no more.  Far from any question of stockpiling, the Sugar Company, between that 131,000 tons produced at home and the imports of 40,000 to date, will have available to it roughly 171,000 tons of sugar, which is more or less what is needed for home consumption and export requirements.</P>
    <P>I said I want to take all the mystery out of this.  When one gets down to calculations of this sort, percentages, yields per acre and so on, it is not very easy to do it here across the floor of the House.  I should like to invite Deputy Corry and the officials of his organisation to come into the Department and let us sit down around the table, employing an electronic computer, if necessary, and satisfy each other that these calculations are valid. We can, I think, establish to the Deputy's satisfaction that they are.  I <Col N="963" /> want to emphasise again that it is a matter of cold mathematics and, being such, there should be no room for dispute, argument, or disagreement between us.  I do not think I have anything further to say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the conditions prevailing last year, because last year was not a good year.  The yield of beet per acre was down to 10.7 as against 11.8 in 1962, 11.2 in 1961 and 13.9 in 1960.  In 1963, therefore, we had a low yield of beet per acre.  Out of 88,000 acres, we got 942,000 tons of beet. If you were able to have the 1960 standard, for instance, applied to last year, you would get more into line with the tonnage Deputy Corry suggests should have been available but you still would not reach it.  In 1960 from 68,000 acres, we got practically 1¾ tons per acre.  Last year we got only 1.5 tons per acre.  If we had been able to get the 1960 standard last year, we would have had 88,000 acres producing 1¾ tons per acre which would have been nearer to Deputy Corry's figure but still would not come up to it.</P>

      <P>Estimates of the purchasing power of money may be based on the retail price index numbers.  The first series of such index numbers for this country was calculated in 1922, to base July, 1914=100. The relevant index numbers are not, therefore, available for the years 1909, 1916 and 1919.  The information available suggests that retail prices in the United Kingdom rose by 6.4 per cent between 1909 and 1914 (the base year for the first Irish series of retail price index numbers), by 46 per cent between 1914 and 1916 and by 115 per cent between 1914 and 1919.  On the assumption that the earlier figures for the United Kingdom apply to this country, the following statement gives the estimated amounts required at mid-August, 1964 (the latest date for which the relevant index has been calculated), to purchase the same quantum of goods and services at retail prices as would the amounts specified in the years in question.</P>

    <P>These figures are subject to the qualifications stated on pages 21 and 22 of <i>Economic Statistics</i>, Budget, 1964.  It is not possible to distinguish sales of insurance stamps in respect of females engaged in agriculture as the appropriate contribution rate also applies to other social insurance contributions.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he can state from agricultural statistics in his Department the average weekly wages of agricultural workers in each county and province and in the State in 1909, 1913, 1916, 1919, 1924, 1928, 1932 and 1935.</P>

      <P>No comprehensive series of figures is available for the average weekly wages of agricultural workers for all the years specified in the question.  For the years 1909-10, 1913 and 1915 information available concerning the weekly wages of permanent agricultural labourers in each county is that published in the series of official reports entitled &ldquo;Report and Tables relating to Irish Agricultural Labourers&rdquo; issued by the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland.  Corresponding particulars for 1916 and 1919 are not available.  In each of the relevant reports (Cd. 5033, Cd. 7418 and Cd. 8386) a range of wages is given for (a) Ploughmen, (b) Cattlemen (except for 1909-10) (c) General farm labourers and (d) Boys; for each of these categories separate figures are given for (i) With <Col N="895" /> board and lodgings, (ii) Having free house, etc. and (iii) Without free house, etc.  It is not possible from the data available to determine the average weekly wages for all agricultural labourers in each county.  Using as weights the numbers of permanent male agricultural labourers, 18 years of age and over in each county as returned at the 1912 agricultural enumeration, estimates of the range of weekly wages of general farm labourers can be obtained for the provinces and for the State.  The results of these computations are given in Table I together <Col N="896" /> with the corresponding weekly wages data for each county.</P>
      <P>Particulars have been published in &ldquo;Some Statistics of Wages and Hours of Work in 1937, with comparative figures for certain previous years&rdquo; (P. No. 2904) of the average earnings during a week in July, of permanent male agricultural labourers over 21 years of age who were stated not to have had a free house or allowance of any kind.  These figures cover the years 1925 to 1937 inclusive.  Corresponding particulars for 1924 are not available. The figures for 1925, 1928, 1932 and 1935 are reproduced in Table 2.</P>

      <P>The revised estimate of the cost of the scheme is £300,000, of which approximately £285,000 has been spent to date.  There are 64 men employed comprising 14 foremen or gangers, a storekeeper, a works clerk, a fitter, a mechanic, a carpenter, 15 drivers, 27 labourers, 2 work study assessors and a nightwatchman. Works will be completed in the next few weeks.</P>

Employment allowance may not be granted except where the land valuation of the holding exceeds £20.  The net rates payable on a holding of £20 land valuation would not, therefore, be affected by the employment of a relative on the holding.</P>
