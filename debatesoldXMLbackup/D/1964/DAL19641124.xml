    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government have reconsidered <Col N="2" /> the question of enabling Dáil Éireann to review the accounts of statutory bodies or other State or semi-State bodies; if so, what decision has been arrived at; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with questions of a somewhat similar nature on 29th March, 1960, 26th July, 1962, and 15th April, 1964.  Briefly, the view which I expressed was that where the State provided grants from voted moneys there was ample opportunity for parliamentary debate on the affairs of State-sponsored bodies.  In the case of the principal State-sponsored bodies, which did not receive annual grants but whose capital was subscribed or guaranteed by the State under statute, I pointed out that opportunities arose for parliamentary debate when the enabling legislation was before the House periodically from time to time.  I went on to say, however, that in these latter cases, I would, if there was a substantial demand in the House, be prepared <Col N="3" /> to consider whether there was need for an arrangement whereby the House would be asked to allow time periodically for discussion of a motion dealing with the report and accounts of each such body which had been laid before the House pursuant to statute, provided that discussion on the motion was confined to matters of policy, arising out of the report and accounts, for which a Minister clearly had parliamentary responsibility.  So far, however, there has been no substantial demand for this in the House.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, of course, be aware that the report of the Committee of Public Accounts on the Appropriation Accounts 1962/63, dated the 12th November, 1964, and released a few days ago suggests that consideration be given to an amendment of the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann so as to provide, where appropriate, for the reference to the Committee of Public Accounts of the audited accounts of bodies which receive subventions from voted moneys.  The bodies in question are those on which I have already expressed the opinion that adequate opportunity for parliamentary debate exists.  The Committee's suggestion raises a number of new issues apart from those which have already been raised by the Parliamentary Questions to which I have referred earlier.  The suggestion will, of course, be taken fully into account and commented upon in the formal Minute which the Minister for Finance addresses annually to the Committee in reply to matters raised in its reports.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach mentioned, the recent comments of the Committee of Public Accounts, published last week or the week before, would have been published subsequent to the earlier replies he gave.  Does he not now consider, in view of these comments, that some procedure should be adopted, either by means of amending the Standing Orders or by the establishment of an <i>ad hoc</i> committee, for consideration of accounts of public companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate <Col N="4" /> question.  The Committee of Public Accounts referred to the possibility of bringing the reports of companies receiving subventions from public moneys before that Committee, but whether that suggestion is appropriate is a matter for further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that the Taoiseach is prepared to consider referring, in certain cases, the accounts of statutory bodies for consideration to some committee in respect of general questions of policy as distinct from day-to-day administration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that at least one of those who have come to be described by some newspaper scribes as the bright young men of Fianna Fáil has expressed the view that some procedure should be introduced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of representations made to my Department by the Department of Agriculture, on 29th July last, my Department issued a circular to all health authorities urging the desirability of using pasteurised milk in their institutions in order to avoid the possibility <Col N="6" /> of infection arising from the use of supplies of raw milk.  Reports on the action being taken are still outstanding for some areas but the health authorities which have reported all intimate that they have implemented, or propose to implement, the recommendations in the circular.  In the case of a small number of institutions located at a distance from pasteurising plants, it has not been possible to obtain tenders for the supply of pasteurised milk.</P>

      <P>I presume that the question refers to the further survey, undertaken by the Medical Research Council, of deformities in babies born in a period after the use of thalidomide had been discontinued, to which I referred in my reply to a question by Deputy Kyne on 8th April, 1964, and in my speech when introducing the Estimate for my Department for the current year.  This survey was undertaken in an effort to obtain a clearer picture of the influence exercised by this drug.</P>
      <P>My latest information is that the necessary investigations were completed recently and that the council expects to be in a position to furnish their report to me by the end of next month.</P>

      <P>The children's unit at St. Loman's Hospital, established by the Dublin Health Authority at my suggestion for the treatment of mentally ill children, including autistic children, was to an appreciable extent experimental.  The value of the experience gained during the short period in which the unit has been in operation is now being assessed and in that connection the establishment of a special unit for adolescents is being considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Under our health legislation, services for infectious diseases are made available more freely than for other conditions, on the traditional basis that, in caring for a person with an infectious disease, protection for the health of the community at large is being afforded, as well as succour for the individual.  There is no such basis for extending the scope of the cancer service.  Our present services under the Health Act, 1953, as amended, ensure that treatment for cancer is available to all who cannot arrange for it privately without undue hardship.  Therefore, I do not propose to introduce legislation on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that, at a recent interview conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners for the appointment of a public relations officer to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, one member of the board was the editor of a newspaper employing <Col N="11" /> pressmen; and whether, in view of the fact that applicants for this post might reasonably be expected to be pressmen themselves, it is desirable to have an editor of a newspaper rather than somebody not actively engaged in an executive capacity in newspapers as a member of such a board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should perhaps say that I have no function in regard to the composition of these interview boards which are set up by the Civil Service Commissioners in pursuance of their statutory duties.  They have informed me, however, that one member of the board in question was, in fact, the editor of a newspaper employing pressmen.  They have explained that, as the applicants for the position to be filled included pressmen it was considered essential to have on the Board persons with newspaper experience; and that, in view of the small number of persons known to the Commissioners to be qualified to act, it would not have been practicable not to include the editor of a newspaper, even if that were agreed to be desirable; in fact, however, the Commissioners see no good reason why newspaper editors should not be eligible to serve on such boards, as they have served in the past.  The Board consisted of five members.  Two of these were persons unconnected with newspapers. Two were persons experienced in journalism but, as far as is known, no longer actively engaged in an executive capacity in newspapers.  The other member was, as I have said, the editor of a newspaper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £6,666,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st March, 1965, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net amount of this Supplementary <Col N="21" /> Estimate, added to the original Estimate for 1964/65, brings to an all-time record level of £30,324,700 the expenditure from the vote for my Department.  The corresponding figure ten years ago, that is, in 1954/55, was £7,250,950; five years ago, £13,478,460; and last year, that is, 1963/64, £25,262,000.  This increasing expenditure reflects both the continuing development of our agriculture and the increasing measure of support and assistance which the Government are extending to it.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be appropriate, on a Supplementary Estimate which is confined to a specified number of subheads, to make the kind of general policy statement which is usual in introducing the main Estimate.  I may say, however, that our agricultural policy in general will continue to be developed within the framework of my Department's &ldquo;Brown Book&rdquo;&mdash;a publication which I believe has received a considerable measure of support throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The biggest provisions in this Supplementary Estimate are for Subhead N and Subhead K 14.  Practically all the additional provision in Subhead N is required to finance the increase of 2d. per gallon of creamery milk announced in the last Budget.  This increase in the allowance came into effect on 1st May, 1964, and is estimated to cost £2,800,000 in the present financial year. The cost of the increase in a full financial year on the basis of present production levels would be about £3 million.</P>
    <P>As we all know, milk is of fundamental importance in our agricultural economy.  Not only does it provide a steady source of income, especially for the small and medium-sized holdings, but it is also the foundation on which our cattle industry and, to a substantial extent, our pig industry depend. Milk production has shown a steady increase in recent years, due both to increased productivity&mdash;which has been greatly helped by lime and fertiliser subsidies and other schemes&mdash;and to the increases in price support given in the last three financial years.  Total creamery milk production in 1964 is <Col N="22" /> estimated at 363 million gallons, as compared with 337 million gallons in 1963, 324 million gallons in 1962 and 240 million gallons ten years ago.  The total amount of the farmers' creamery cheque in 1964 is expected to be in the neighbourhood of £34 million which is about £5 million more than last year, £7 million more than 1962 and £15 million higher than ten years ago.</P>
    <P>Exports of milk products have increased considerably in recent years. Exports of butter are expected to reach about 18,700 tons in the year ending 31st March, 1965, and there has been a notable increase in the exports of milk products other than butter, which is reflected in the increasing diversification of our milk processing industry.  The production of such products as milk powder and cheese is now very much higher than it was previously, and we appear to be arriving at a healthy balance between the production of butter and of other milk products.  Prices on export markets, while they have improved substantially for products such as butter and cheese, are still well below our actual cost of production.  Considering the export market problems which face them I think that An Bord Bainne are doing a good job, and it is particularly gratifying to note that Irish creamery butter is selling both in Britain and in the Six Counties at prices above those paid for most other butter.  Granted reasonable weather conditions, we look forward to a further increase in milk output next year.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead K 14, we are looking for an additional sum of more than £2½ million for the calved heifer grants.  Our original estimate was £405,000, but the response to the scheme has exceeded all our expectations and there is every indication that the scheme is having the desired result of increasing the number of cows in the country, and, therefore, will lead to higher cattle production in the future.  By the end of October just over 73,000 herds had qualified for grant, the number of animals concerned being nearly 146,000.  Herd-owners in every county are qualifying in considerable <Col N="23" /> numbers for the grants.  Relatively speaking&mdash;that is to say, relative to the existing number of cattle already in the country&mdash;the counties which are qualifying for a particularly large share of the grants are Roscommon, Longford, Cavan, Monaghan, Galway, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal, but every county is, in fact, doing well.  I believe that this scheme, which is quite a novel one for this country, is proving to be a considerable success, and I am very hopeful that it will enable us to effect a major break-through in cattle production.</P>
    <P>The next Subhead in order of size is K 11&mdash;Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme&mdash;where we are asking for an additional sum of nearly £600,000. Our purchases of reactors in March last, payment for which was made in the present financial year, were particularly heavy.  The rate of compensation is also higher than we had anticipated, due to the steep rise in cattle prices as compared with last year. However, even with the additional sum now sought our total expenditure on the eradication of the disease will be £3½ million less than last year.  We are confident that the six counties which are not yet attested, that is, Cork, Kerry, Kilkenny, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford, will be declared attested within about a year from now, and we shall then be able to celebrate the attestation of the entire country. Already, the incidence of bovine tuberculosis in the six counties I have mentioned has been brought down to a low figure.  The present round of tests has disclosed an overall incidence of only 0.5 per cent and an incidence in cows of 0.8 per cent.  In fact, therefore, tuberculosis has been largely eradicated from these counties, and what we are now undertaking is the final mopping-up operation so as to ensure that the counties will be technically ready for attestation within the next year.</P>
    <P>As a result of the progress made in the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, we are now in a position to make effective plans for the deployment of our veterinary resources on the elimination of other animal diseases, including <Col N="24" /> brucellosis.  I have already announced our intentions in this regard.  I am glad to say that these plans will be considerably facilitated by the fact that, with the agreement of the British veterinary authorities, it has now become possible to reduce check-testing to 50 per cent of the herds, instead of 100 per cent as previously in seven of the present attested counties, namely, Donegal, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
    <P>As will be seen from the Supplementary Estimate, our other schemes are also forging ahead.  We are looking for additional money for the Land Project&mdash;Subhead K 7&mdash;and for Farm Buildings&mdash;K 6.  These schemes are moving ahead very satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>I am always grateful for any comments I can get from the Opposition benches.</P>
      <P>We require another £400,000 under K 16&mdash;Payments to Pigs and Bacon Commission.  This money is required to meet the additional cost of the Exchequer payments on exports of bacon.  The increased cost is due partly to the fact that the minimum guaranteed prices for pigs were increased during the financial year, as announced in the Budget, and partly to the fact that prices for bacon on export markets have recently been at a lower level than we had expected.  Although the British bacon market is now controlled, under what is known as the multilateral understanding on bacon, prices for bacon are not quite as good as we hoped for: on the other hand, of course, in the absence of the present controls in Britain, bacon export prices would probably be appreciably lower than they are.  We expect to fill the British bacon allocation of 27,000 tons during the present financial year and take our share of some allocations from the reserve quota, in addition to exporting a moderate quantity of pork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to an item of particular <Col N="25" /> current interest&mdash;the import of cattle and sheep from continental Europe through the quarantine station we have set up on Spike Island, off the Cork coast.  The relevant provisions in the Supplementary Estimate are to be found in Subheads C 2, E 1 and E 2, The cost of running the quarantine station is included in C 2; the cost of the imported Friesian bulls and heifers is in E 1; asd the cost of the Charolais bulls and heifers and the Texel rams and ewes is in E 2.  The Office of Public Works gave us very good service in arranging for the construction of the quarantine station which is one of the most modern in the world.  Our thanks are also due to the Army authorities for granting us a very suitable isolated site within the moat on Spike Island, and to the many other services and people who helped us in this regard.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that extreme veterinary precautions have been taken in regard to the animals that have now been imported, and the conditions under which imports have been permitted were, in the first place, discussed in great detail with the veterinary services of the United States and Britain.  I need not, I think, go into detail on these precautions, some of which were of a very technical nature, but I can say that they were very stringent and exacting.</P>
    <P>We are hopeful that these importations will enable us to bring about a further improvement in our dairy and beef stocks, as well as in our sheep. The performance of the imported animals will be carefully recorded and assessed, and the results made known. It is interesting to note that, as we have imported Charolais females as well as bulls and as we already have in the country a number of American Charolais females and bulls, it should be possible to establish the breed here permanently if its performance under Irish conditions gives satisfactory results.</P>
    <P>First priority in the future use of the quarantine station will be accorded to official imports from the continent or elsewhere of selected animals of breeds of cattle, sheep or pigs that offer a prospect of effecting an improvement <Col N="26" /> in our native stocks.  The import of pigs from Scandinavia is at present under consideration in this connection.</P>
    <P>The station may also be used if the need arises to quarantine breeding stock imported from Britain, whether by my Department or by private breeders.  These imports are now quarantined in British stations.  It is scarcely necessary for me to add that the safeguarding of animal health and avoidance of the risk of introducing animal diseases will always be a paramount consideration in the operation of this station.</P>
    <P>Among the other subheads, there is a provision for wheat losses under K 18, which represents the final liquidation of the losses in disposal of unmillable wheat from the 1962 harvest. This proved to be a protracted operation and final assessment of the losses sustained was not possible until fairly recently.</P>
    <P>We are also looking for an increased sum for An Foras Talúntais under Subhead I 6, part of which represents an increase in the normal grant-in-aid and arises out of the cost of the ninth round of salary and wage increases. The subhead also includes a figure of £15,000 by way of capital grant.  As An Foras Talúntais has now practically used up the sum it received for capital development when it was established, it has become necessary for the State to find additional capital for further development.</P>
    <P>Subheads D 4, D 5 and D 9 provide for increased grants to the University Faculties of Agriculture, Dairy Science and Veterinary Medicine to meet salary increases and costs of extra staffing.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead I 2, we are seeking an increase of £3,000 for the grant-in-aid to the IAOS.  This is required to meet the cost of additional staff recruited as a result of the recommendations in the report by Dr. Knapp.</P>
    <P>I think that this is all I need say on this Supplementary Estimate at this stage.  I am fully conscious of the fact that the extra amount sought is considerable, but I ask the Dáil to approve of it in the interest of our farmers and for the benefit of our agriculture.</P>
    <Col N="27" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say, first, that this Supplementary Estimate is not a harbinger of good news in the material sense for the farmer.  There is no question of the farmer getting more money today or tomorrow because of it.  The position in relation to milk is that this sum is being voted in respect of an increase in the price of milk given some months ago.  It was then estimated it would cost £2,600,000.  Apparently that estimate was fairly correct, because the Minister says the figure will be £200,000 more.</P>
      <P>It should be remembered that our price to farmers for milk is the lowest in Europe.  I would have hoped that the Minister would have indicated his plans for the future in regard to milk, for its better utilisation, for its better handling and its moving into products which give the best profit.  On this, the first occasion he has introduced a serious motion in the House, I should have hoped that he would have told us what his hopes were for an increase in the milk price in future.  I am rather disappointed that has not happened. Therefore we find that almost half of this Supplementary Estimate relates to moneys which were already voted after a long and protracted disagreement with the farmers and an increase in the price of milk given some time ago which is regarded by them as still very inadequate.</P>
      <P>There are other subheads here which are excellent in themselves and very proper to be voted but which have no immediate or direct relation to the remuneration of the farmer. While agreeing on them, it is right to draw attention to the fact that nobody is putting £6,600,000 into the farmer's pocket today.  Far is it from that situation.  For instance, the two votes to University College, Dublin, and Trinity College in respect of the expenses of veterinary medicine, though excellent in themselves and in the years to come will ensure we have a supply of veterinary surgeons, will not in the next week or the next year increase the income of any farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of the two other subheads related to the Land Project and the subsidy on pig meat, I take it the <Col N="28" /> position is the votes under these subheads were reduced in the Additional Estimate.  In the Book of Estimates for 1964-65 under Subhead K 7, the amount to be spent on the Land Project was reduced to £2,170,500 from £2,232,180, a reduction of £61,680.  The Minister now finds himself obliged to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for £60,000.  Therefore the <i>status quo</i> is being preserved.  That is all that is happening.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the estimate of payments to the Pigs and Bacon Commission was that in the 1964-65 Estimate, Subhead K 17, there was an estimated decrease in the sum required of £500,000.  The Minister now finds himself obliged to introduce a Supplementary Estimate in respect of this subhead for £400,000, so that in regard to the actual amounts we are spending on these items which are not directly related to farming, in the one instance, it is the same as in the previous financial year and in another instance, it is £100,000 less.  It must be remembered that the farmers do not like to see heavy expenditure because it falls on their backs to pay it.  These are two items that have been restored to their previous level.  I do not know whether the Minister for Finance was parsimonious in that respect but although we are spending more money on the Land Project than we did last year, we are not spending more money on the subsidising of farmers' pig prices than we did last year, and these two subheads virtually remain the same.</P>
    <P>In respect of bovine tuberculosis, I always like to make the case that this was a national crisis and that the operation of the bovine TB eradication scheme did not put money in any farmer's pocket.  It may be argued, perhaps, that if there had not been a bovine TB eradication scheme and if our cattle had been excluded from the various markets as a result, there would have been a catastrophe.  The answer to that is there would have been a national catastrophe striking just as heavily on the lady working in the hat shop in Grafton Street as on the farmer who could not sell his <Col N="29" /> cattle.  Therefore one must take this figure for bovine TB eradication as a national charge, properly included in the Estimate for Agriculture but at the same time a national charge.  It can be said that that item, which, of course, will decrease now that we have got the job done, is something that has its impact on every one of us as distinct from the farmers.</P>
    <P>The heifer scheme has exploded in a most spectacular way and one might say it would be churlish of anybody here to criticise that situation.  I do not mean to criticise that situation but it is wise to draw attention to certain points in relation to it.  The first point is that the estimate of the Department of Agriculture of the expenditure on this scheme has been as far out, as we say in our part of the country, as the cow and the calf.  As long as I have been here, I have never seen the figures introduced for a Department as far away from the eventual result as these.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote the contribution of the previous Minister for Agriculture on the Estimate for Agriculture, on the heifer scheme, as reported at column 1361, volume 205, of the Official Report of 12th November, 1963:</P>
    <P>The cost of the scheme is estimated to rise from about £300,000 in the first year &mdash; 1964-65 &mdash; to around £1,500,000 in 1966-67 and to about £1,800,000 in the later '60s.</P>
    <P>That was the Department's figure. What are we asked to vote today? We are asked to vote today in respect of a scheme for grants for calf heifers an additional sum of £2,550,000; including the Estimate for 1964-65, which was £300,000, that is, a total sum of £2,855,000.  What are we to say?  Are we to say this is a wonderful scheme or are we to say there is something odd about this.  I hope the scheme will succeed.  I hope we shall get the cow numbers which form the whole basis of our agricultural effort. However, we must examine these things as they are here.</P>
    <P>What do we find?  We find that in respect of the crops and livestock figures for 1st June&mdash;I quote from the preliminary statement; there may have <Col N="30" /> been some corrections in it since, but I would say they would be pretty slight &mdash;the number of cattle three years and upwards fell from 227,000 to 201,000 a reduction of 26,000, or 26.4 per cent. In the number of two to three-year-olds, there was a decline of 39.9 per cent, and the one-year-olds and under declined by ten per cent.</P>
    <P>This indicates to me a worrying feature in relation to this scheme. People who have herds, graziers grazing dry stock, maybe around the number 100 or 200, suddenly realised there were 100 times or 150 times £15 to be gained and went into this scheme and had their calves single suckled on the heifers.  The worry in respect of this is that these people would not have created what one would call a proper herd because they would have moved over and got £15 for each, and next year, knowing they could not get another £15, would move back again. What hope is there for the five or seven cow man?  He can increase by possibly two or three if he improves his grassland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That assurance is valuable because I honestly believed, from the figures, that there was a sudden moving over from grazing dry stock to grazing heifers and the people who had been grazing dry stock probably had a nil, or a one or two, figure in their herd.  There are flaws in the scheme inasmuch as the fellow who has being doing his job well, keeping ten or 15 cows, cannot get any £15. You may say we have been pragmatic about this; our job is to increase the numbers and, if some do not benefit, that is just bad luck.  I maintain a scheme should have been devised to bring everybody in.  I know excellent men in my own and neighbouring constituencies farming on optimum production, and they cannot afford, because of the price offered for milk, expensive concentrates in order to improve their feeding and increase the flow of milk.  They can do a certain number of cattle, and that is all, with their own food.  I am not now detracting from the heifer scheme.  We are with the scheme.  We were the people who first said there should be either a calf subsidy scheme or a heifer mating subsidy scheme.  We considered what was the right thing to do and what we would have done, had we remained in office, unless there was strong advice to the contrary, was something very different from what this Government have done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some evidence that this scheme can be used by people to move over from dry stock to the other and then, having got £15 per head from the Government, to move back again.  My worry is that it is all very well to give a grant and establish a situation in which this movement occurs, but, remember, the farmer is restricted in his capital.  Very often he has made his arrangement with the bank; he has a bit of an overdraft and he cannot get any more credit.  I have <Col N="32" /> drawn attention here to the numbers of other cattle.  The increase in the price of heifers and cows is something for which we should be thankful, but the numbers of other cattle have decreased. Is that because of the excellent price as a result of the 1948 Trade Agreement or is it because the farmer could keep only the same number of stock, his capital being so limited?</P>
      <P>I indicated on the Estimate for Agriculture last year the sort of capital investment necessary in order that what the Government indicated in their Blue Book and their Brown Book could be done.  If you want to increase cow numbers to the figure indicated by the Government, one of the main problems arises in connection with the production of cattle.  If you have 177,000 moneywise extra heifers this year they replace 177,000 other cattle, unless the money can be got to keep them, because the farmer must sell in order to get the wherewithal to pay school fees, rates, keep the suit on his back, and live.  That is the basis of it.</P>
      <P>I had hoped the Minister would indicate today what his plans are and I want to warn him now that, in our considered judgement, unless he follows his heifer subsidy scheme, or any other scheme, with the introduction of a better advisory service and a heavy injection of capital to the individual farmer, then one is merely robbing Peter to pay Paul.  You have increased to 177,000 heifers but there is no money there to keep 177,000, or something very close to that number, extra cattle and, while in this year you have succeeded, in the following years you will fail.  Remember the £15 has been paid out in respect of 177,000 and, if the farmer sees no £15 coming in next year, he may revert again to dry stock. I do not offer this criticism in an effort to damp down the scheme.  My anxiety is to ensure the introduction of the capital, following on the scheme, to permit the farmer not only to keep the 177,000 extra heifers but to keep them in addition to his normal quota of dry stock and other animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to butter seems to be exceptionally good.  I asked a series of questions recently and <Col N="33" /> elicited certain information.  We can send on the basic quota plus additions to the best moneywise price market 17,205 tons of our butter.  The amount available for export, I was told, would be 18,500 tons.  We will be in a position, therefore, to send almost all our butter this year to the best export market available.  That is an excellent step forward.  Prices in Britain have improved because of the GATT arrangements limiting the introduction of butter.  We have been rather well treated, though it seemed at first we might not be.  Now that we have increased our production, we will be able next year to increase, if not the basic quota, certainly the additions.</P>
    <P>A very interesting situation has developed in regard to my forecast as to what would happen.  I told the Minister's predecessor he would never need the £9 million he indicated would be required.  I still think I am right. There is more milk coming forward, for one thing.  The planning done by the Committee on General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Britain has helped us.  It is a bad thing, of course, that we should lose completely free access but, in the event, it has actually helped us.  We will have all our butter going into the best export market in future and that is a good thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very brief with regard to wheat.  I take it it is in order to discuss the wheat position on this. Wheat is a crop which has been charged in against the people and the industrial workers at a high price in the past, a price to which their remuneration has been negotiated freely.  It is therefore a crop that pays the farmer if he can sell it for milling better than most other crops and certainly better than feeding barley or oats.  We had the situation where the Fianna Fáil Government, in December, 1953, realised there was going to be a surplus of wheat and they set up an inter-departmental committee to see how much we needed and the figure they arrived at was 300,000 tons.  The consumption of bread has since decreased and now the Government's Brown Book indicates that 265,000 tons is the right figure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> Last year&mdash;again this is information elicited from the Minister last week&mdash; with only 3,480 tons of wheat which was unmillable, we produced only 197,457 tons, that is, a deficit of some 67,000 tons of wheat, at a high price, wheat that can be grown here and sold to the millers and that can give the farmers a good price.  It will be a great mistake if this industry is ever let go down.  The whole basis of the mills here is not the employment they give, because that is very low, but really the delivery and handling of flour, which would still continue if there were imports of wheat, and the whole basis of their existence is that they could buy Irish wheat at a high price.  Over the years Fianna Fáil Governments have been so dilatory in the handling of this situation that the amount of wheat produced has fallen from, at one stage, 486,000 tons to 197,000 tons, and even by the highly conservative lines taken by them in the Brown Book, that is 67,000 tons of wheat less than we need.</P>
    <P>The Government asked Dr. Olered for his recommendations in this regard and his recommendations have been in the hands of the Minister for some weeks.  Dr. Olered suggests that the fall in number test of wheat for millability should be used.  The millers have refused pointblank to accept that, even though it obtains in every country.  He also recommended various other things one of them being that there should be segregation of wheat at intake points.  We have a progressive fall in the quantity of wheat produced over the years and it is urgently necessary that the Minister should do something about it quickly.  If you want to get segregation, this brings about segregation in storage and perhaps brings about more driers, changes in the mills and various other things that have to be done.</P>
    <P>In 1951 when this problem was first touched on, the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, instituted the Grain Storage (Loans) Act and provided money at four and a half per cent&mdash;and afterwards at five and three-quarters per cent&mdash;for 35 years to provide storage and drying for our own wheat.  That was a great step forward <Col N="35" /> but now Dr. Olered has recommended that we should pass on to the fall in number test for sprout damage and that there should be segregation.  Any work that has to be done in a mill to produce this would require at least a year, and if the Minister were to make a decision now, it is doubtful if we would have one quarter ready next year.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he has asked for advice from the interests concerned and that he proposes to await their views before taking action.  May I remind him that we have 70,000 tons of wheat less in the country than we should have and if the Minister is going to wait until things happen, we will probably have less next year?  This is something on which his officials are competent to advise him and he could make a decision and some action could be taken within a matter of weeks.  If he does not, he will find that 1965 will be a dead letter as far as change is concerned. A new, up and coming Minister for Agriculture could be expected to be a bit of a firebrand as regards time.  The word &ldquo;await&rdquo; and words like it do not indicate that he is chasing around the Department with any great degree of activity.</P>
    <P>As I say there is nothing in this Supplementary Estimate that brings more money immediately to the farmers.  There are a lot of items in it which relate to agricultural education, not advisory services directly for the farmers, but on a higher level.  There are a lot of items in it which, in my view, are the direct result of cheeseparing by the Minister for Finance with the then Minister for Agriculture when it was time to publish the last Book of Estimates.  At the same time, we on this side of the House welcome the expenditures foreshadowed or in the process of being made here and hope they will produce good.  We feel the individual criticisms&mdash;I hope, constructive&mdash;that have been offered were necessary and we hope they will be valuable and helpful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should do is congratulate the Minister <Col N="36" /> on his appointment and wish him well in office.  I am rather sorry to see Deputy Haughey in front of me in place of Deputy Smith because I have had a bone of contention with the previous Minister over a number of years and I believe I had worn him down, but the next thing is I find he is gone and so I have to start all over again with the new Minister.</P>
      <P>The matter to which I am going to refer may not seem very important to the Minister but to me it is most important. It is the plea I have been making continually for the subsidisation of milk on the islands around our coast which have not got creamery facilities.  Even though the number of people involved is small, in justice they are entitled to some share of the large subventions we give towards the dairy industry each year.</P>
      <P>In Galway during the week, I noted that Ministers were telling people that the subventions on milk during the current year would total almost £9 million. I cannot see why small farmers living on the islands should be precluded from benefiting from that large subsidy.  In the course of discussions on this matter on a previous occasion, it was pointed out that in most cases it would not be economical to provide creamery facilities.  In fact, the Dairy Disposal Board, a State-sponsored body, recommended that the best and most economical method of providing justice and fair play to the island farmers was to give them a subsidy on home-produced butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to confine my agitation to island dwellers because whilst a number of people on the mainland make home-produced butter just as well as the islanders, it is not the same thing because in a number of cases creamery facilities are within their reach, if they desire to sell their milk to creameries.  In the case of the islanders, the Atlantic Ocean is between them and the creamery facilities, and consequently they cannot avail of the subvention given to the dairy industry.  I believe it is unconstitutional on the part of the State to deny this subsidy to butter producers on the islands.  I am asking the Minister <Col N="37" /> as the new Minister for Agriculture impartially to examine their claim for subsidisation.  If he does, he can come to only one conclusion, and that conclusion is to grant their request.</P>
    <P>I have had a number of deputations &mdash;and I am sure my colleagues have also had deputations&mdash;from some of the islanders living on islands around the coast of West Cork, particularly Sherkin Island and Cape Clear.  While the amount of milk produced on the islands may be relatively small, and the cost of the subsidy would be relatively small, in common justice they should get the subsidy.  The least they should get is 6d. in the £.  The farmer who sells through a creamery gets 50 per cent more than the man who sells without any State aid.  Surely the Minister will see for himself that it is unfair to those smallholders, most of whom are in exceptionally poor circumstances, and trying to eke out a livelihood between fishing and farming in a small way not to grant them a subsidy. The milk they produce constitutes the main part of their income from farming.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need to labour the point further.  I am asking the Minister to re-open this question and to examine it in the careful diligent and fair way it merits to be examined.  I hope he will grant this subsidy to these people.  It is scarcely necessary to mention the fact that when this matter came to the attention of the Cork County Committee of Agriculture they unanimously recommended the payment of the subsidy to island butter producers.  I hope there will not be any need to continue this agitation.  I hope that before the year is out the Minister will give these people the justice for which they are looking. They are not looking for any dole or charity.  Farmers who supply milk to creameries are subsidised from central funds, and why should islanders who cannot avail of the creamery facilities be denied that subsidy?  That is not justice.  I am sure we will not have to continue with this kind of discussion here any longer.  I am sure the Minister will see the need to grant this subvention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> I said earlier that the former Minister was weakening on this question. When I questioned him about it in the summer he seemed to think they were entitled to the subvention but he seemed to prefer to provide them with creamery facilities.  At least that is as well as I recollect his statement.  The Minister must not have examined that proposition very closely at the time, because everyone knows it would be economically impossible to provide creamery facilities for islanders.  I do not make this claim for the islanders off the coast of West Cork only.  The Minister must act on a national basis, and I believe similar treatment should be given to islanders all round our coast.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have put our views clearly on the question of milk prices time and again.  Like every other section of the community the farmers are entitled to a fair and reasonable return for their production. Having regard to the general increase in costs in recent years, it was only natural that the price of milk should be increased.  I believed the approach of the Government to increasing the price of milk was wrong.  I do not believe in giving a flat rate increase of 2d. per gallon to all our milk producers.  Time and again we have been told in this House that the small farmer is the backbone of the country.  I believe we should give a subsidy of 4d per gallon for the first 7,000, 8,000, 9,000 or 10,000 gallons.</P>
    <P>This is what we could do.  We could give a subsidy of 4d per gallon for the first 10,000 gallons of milk supplied to the creamery in any one calendar year, and a subsidy of 2d for the next 5,000 or 10,000 gallons.  Then, for milk in excess of that figure we could give a subsidy of 1d per gallon.  In that way we would be helping the small farmers, and more of the money which has been passed by this House, and paid through taxation into the Central Fund, would be channelled into the pockets of the small and medium-sized farmers, who are much more entitled to it than the well-to-do farmers who are fortunate enough to have good land, and an easy means of making money at their disposal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="39" /> Surely you cannot compare a farmer in the western or southern part of the country, who has to trudge with his horse and cart, or donkey and cart, with ten or 15 gallons of milk to the creamery&mdash;and possibly at this time of the year with less than ten gallons&mdash; with the farmer in the midlands with a tractor to take more than 100 gallons daily to the creamery.  There is a big distinction between the two, and the cost of delivery is much the same.  For that reason I believe a flat rate increase in the price of milk was not fair to the small farmers.  I think an average of 15 gallons of milk per day, winter and summer, is a reasonable average for small and medium sized farmers.  That is 2/6d. per day for seven days of the week, which represents an increase of 17/6d. in his income.  That is less than the flat rate of £1 which was given to workers who had an income of less than £8 per week, so it is quite evident that the small farmer is not treated fairly in regard to the subsidisation of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the increase in the price of milk, we had the introduction of the calved heifer scheme.  There, again, the small farmer is at a loss. He is not getting his rightful share of the moneys&mdash;in the region of £2½ million I think&mdash;devoted to this scheme during the current year.  Last week Deputy Pattison asked the Minister for some information as to how this money is disposed of, and he was told that seven farmers got more than £1,215 each.  I do not know how much in excess of £1,215 they got, but it is evident from the Minister's reply that seven farmers got more than £1,215 each for the calved heifer scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a big figure for the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of £1,215 may not seem a big figure to the Minister, but this House is supposed to be vigilant in relation to the expenditure of that money.  So far as I know, those may be seven of the most progressive farmers in Ireland.  They may have changed from dry stock to milk production and may be going <Col N="40" /> into it legitimately and lawfully and are genuinely entitled to this grant.  On the other hand, there could be seven farmers, one or other of whom could take advantage of the terms of this scheme to draw this £15 per heifer and, once the money is drawn, sell his stock and go back to dry cattle.  Could that not happen?  There is nothing to preclude farmers from doing that.  If a farmer went in for dry stock, instead of selling off his heifers in 1963, he could allow them to calve and when they are calved, apply for the calved heifer scheme grants.  Then he could sell these cattle again to any farmer who would require them, or on the market, and could go back again to dry stock farming, having got his bonus from the State.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any regulation which would preclude him from doing that.  That is one of the abuses to which this scheme is open.  If a person has no intention of continuing in milk production, he can avail of this scheme in the manner I have outlined, draw his £15 per head, and then go back again to dry farming.  He would have no difficulty in disposing of his heifers when it would be known that they were sold because the particular farmer was changing his system of farming and that the cattle were not being sold because of any faults or defects.</P>
      <P>On the other side of the picture, Deputy Pattison was told that 54,664 farmers got £1,393,355, an average of £25 10s. each It is evident that the 54,664 averaged just a little more than a heifer and a half apiece.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole average would be two, but when you take away the top-notchers, you will find it is an average of one and a half per head.  In any case, in money, it represents £25.10 per farmer.  That is the subsidy which the smaller farmer got.  I am sure the type of person who drew this subsidy is the more genuine type rather than the larger farmers. I cannot for the life of me see how all of a sudden these bigger farmers could bring in more than 80 heifers to calve in one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> There is an obligation on the Minister carefully to review the expenditure of this Estimate money.  I know incentives given to farmers are justified, once you are satisfied that a scheme is not abused.  There is an obligation on the Minister to ensure that the scheme is not abused.  If he finds abuses exist which are not covered by present legislation, these loopholes should be closed and regulations brought in to cover them.  Everybody knows that in the early days of the BCG scheme, there were several loopholes and, as a result, the State had to pay money to people who were not lawfully entitled to it. I do not wish to see a repetition of that, so far as this scheme is concerned.</P>
    <P>How could the Minister be said to keep track of all these people?  Once the grant is paid, it is a matter for themselves to do what they like with their animals.  It would be quite easy to ascertain, say, in 1965 or 1966, the number of people who have got big subventions on foot of the calved heifer scheme, and to see whether they have reverted to their former methods of farming.  The position is, owing to the layout of the country, in several counties the people with the first-class high productivity land, are, to my mind, not the best farmers.  I do not want to reflect on any group or take advantage of the privileges of this House, but they are not the best farmers, and that is putting it mildly.</P>
    <P>I am not singling out for special mention a constituency because I represent it, but if the farmers of south-west Cork enjoyed the advantages of farmers in other parts of the country, particularly in the midlands, I feel sure, with an average holding of 40 to 50 acres, they would be quite happy and would have reasonable incomes for themselves and their families. In parts of western Ireland, and along the west coast, areas of more than 1,000 acres could be said to be the equivalent of 30 to 40 acres of good arable land.</P>
    <P>In Cork we are pressing hard in our efforts to get the county attested.  The Minister said it is likely that it will be attested, together with the other five southern counties, within the next 12 <Col N="42" /> months.  I hope that prophecy is correct and that the Department will cooperate with the Cork Bovine Tuberculosis Committee, which, to my mind, has done outstanding work in focussing attention on the desirability of eradicating bovine tuberculosis.  I hope that the combined efforts of the Cork committee, the Department and the outdoor officers will result in the realisation of this prophecy.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed by all that the fact that Cork county and other counties are not attested at the present time results in a loss of not less than £5 per head of store cattle and a higher loss on other types of cattle. The Minister can rest assured that, so far as 99 per cent of the farmers in Cork are concerned, he has their full co-operation in bringing this scheme to a successful conclusion.  It is no harm to bring it to an end because, undoubtedly, it has cost public funds a lot of money and it brings home to us the desirability of having herds cleared of tuberculosis.  It brings home to us in another way the importance of the British market.</P>
    <P>It is, indeed, peculiar that it was Britain who got us to eradicate tuberculosis in our cattle.  It was as a result of the regulations for the importation of cattle to Britain that we decided to spend up to £30 million on the eradication scheme.  I have no doubt that that money is wisely expended.  There was no alternative to doing so if we were to keep our place on the British market.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of what the previous Minister for Agriculture and other Ministers and members of the Government had to say about the British market, it is certain that it is almost our only market for agricultural produce. I do not want to go back on past times but I am quite sure that certain members of the Government, who in other days publicly decried the British market, will now change their tune.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the action of another country caused us to embark on the scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  Be that as it may, we are all pleased that the work is coming to an end.  We trust that, once an area is cleared, every effort will be <Col N="43" /> made to ensure that it will be kept cleared and that there will not be any outbreak in any part of the country.  I have no doubt the Minister will get the co-operation of all concerned in this matter.</P>
    <P>Pig production is very important and it is mentioned by the Minister.  Our quota on the British market this year is 27,000 tons.  It appears that there is also a reserve quota, in addition to exporting a moderate quantity of pork. It is quite all right to make every possible effort to increase pig production so long as we are assured of a market for our pigs.  We were fearful in Cork some years ago lest we should have no market or that once supply exceeded demand, prices would go down.</P>
    <P>There is one thing which worries me about pig production.  I mentioned this matter a few years ago on the Estimate. I refer to the trend of setting up big pig farms in different parts of the country. I understand that there are farms with more than 1,000 pigs and that there are sow stations with up to 50 sows in some of them.  That is quite all right so long as we have an unlimited economic market but I fear that when saturation point is reached, then what happened to the poultry industry may happen the pig industry.</P>
    <P>Take the position in West Cork.  Pig production there is a very important sideline of farming, as well as the production of young pigs.  On an average, the majority of farmers keep two or three sows: up to five would be the limit, with a few exceptions.  Then there are farmers who do not keep sows and who buy the bonhams from people who hold sows.  Almost since the end of the war, the price of bonhams has been considered to be reasonably good, having regard to the general trend of agricultural prices.  It is asserted&mdash;I think with some degree of truth&mdash;that the farmer who goes in for the production of bonhams does much better than the man who buys the bonhams, fattens them and sells them to the factories.</P>
    <P>Many people feel that at present the profit on fattening pigs is not as high as it should be.  As one with a reasonable <Col N="44" /> knowledge of the fattening of pigs, I believe that statement to be correct. I am trying to bring home to the Minister, as a new man on the job, that there is a fear that if big combines, big farmers or big co-operative societies, or any other type of society, take over and erect big pig stations and fatten thousands of pigs, it might react very much on the price of pigs and on the incomes of the vast numbers who are making a reasonable percentage of their livelihood from pig rearing and pig production.  We have enough of combines here.  Unless we are satisfied that they will not interfere with the small pig producer's market, which has kept us going through the years, there should be a curtailment.</P>
    <P>I think I mentioned in this House already that no farmer or combine should be allowed to have, say, more than seven sows.  Everybody has to live.  When there is a limit on our export market, there should be a limit, if at any time the situation demands it, on the erection of these big pig breeding stations.  I do not see any justification for the action of the Department in making big grants available for substantial piggeries.  Grants of £1,000 or more are available for the erection of piggeries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says the buyers cannot get enough at the moment.  The obvious reason is that the margin of profit in the fattening of pigs is not adequate.  It should be stepped up.  I asserted that people who have sows or who engage in sow farming and sell the bonhams do better than people who buy the bonhams and fatten the pigs.  If the number of pigs available is not sufficient, is it the Minister's policy to set up big combines and to allow them to fatten thousands of pigs and to keep, say, from 30 to 100 sows?  If such a policy should come into operation, it will sound the deathknell of those farmers who keep, say, from ten to 20 pigs, or two or three sows.  Such a step would be detrimental to the interests of the <Col N="45" /> small farmers, as is clearly borne out by what happened to our poultry industry.</P>
      <P>We were told that the main reason the poultry industry declined below the economic limit was the fact that the production of poultry had increased so much in Britain.  Now, there is little or no market for our poultry or poultry products there.  Up to, say, eight years ago, the poultry industry gave a good deal of self-employment in this country.</P>

Now the turkey market has gone by the board and it is estimated that the turkey population of the country at the moment is only barely sufficient to meet our own requirements.  With the decline of the export market, the number of turkeys available is not much more than what is required for our own use.  I understand the number of turkeys in the country is between 500,000 and 550,000.  The Minister made no mention of the poultry industry in his Supplementary Estimate. Am I to assume from that that he is satisfied there is no hope for the revival of the industry?</P>

      <P>That might not be a bad idea.  It is possible that the Minister did not include anything in the Supplementary Estimate towards the further development of the poultry industry because he feels that the poultry industry is in a sound economic position; but I cannot see why he failed to include any aid to develop that industry further.  I shall leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's <Col N="48" /> attention to the desirability of developing horticulture.  We had no statement from him on such development.  The reason I emphasise the desirability of that is that we are establishing in the Fastnet Co-operative Society a food processing factory in co-operation with the Irish Sugar Company in the town of Skibbereen which we all hope will be successful.  I believe that the Department should make technical assistance available for the development of that industry in its infant years.  It may be difficult for a company such as the Fastnet Co-operative Society to get all the technical advice needed from its own resources.  Where you have infant industries based on agricultural products, there is an obligation on the Department to help in every way possible. I think the Minister should take a special interest in the development of these factories, particularly in their early years.  Let us all hope that, as a result of co-operation from the Department, the county committee of agriculture and the workers and producers, the management will be successful from the beginning.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to hold the House much longer, but I should like to re-emphasise the necessity for a more dynamic policy in respect of the small farmers along the western seaboard. This scrap here and scrap there policy will never get them anywhere.  We can give the proceeds of a loan of £20 million for the development of industry. Since we can see the advantage in floating such a loan, I suggest we should consider the desirability of giving the entirely of a loan for a similar amount for the development of the western seaboard.  We must have money if we are to provide any worthwhile schemes for these areas.</P>
    <P>Nowadays, we have growing up throughout the country local voluntary organisations anxious and willing to help in every way.  There is, however, an enormous shortage of money and this is without doubt our main difficulty in this branch of national development. If we are to keep our people in the west and in the other congested districts, we must be prepared to make available big sums of money such as those we are prepared <Col N="49" /> to give by way of loan for development in other directions.  In this way we would succeed in getting a large number of worthwhile schemes, schemes which might not be economic in their infancy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know the Minister is interested in industries based on agriculture.  We are learning now that it is only industries based on home-produced materials that are likely to succeed, not those which depend on imported materials.  I should like to end as I began, by asking the Minister to review the application of island holders for butter subsidies.  It may not be an economic proposition but it would help the islanders who have not creamery facilities.  There are only small numbers of islanders who have not got such facilities and those of them who have not should be subsidised for their production of milk. If the Minister grants this request of mine, I assure him I shall visit his poultry farm in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the way he has presented his Supplementary Estimate. I cannot help noticing that it keeps very well in touch with the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> It covers a fairly wide field and shows that the Government were serious in the conditions they laid down and the promises they gave when initiating the Second Programme.  In spite of all that, the two Deputies who have spoken tried, in the main, to belittle that effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the first points of Deputy Donegan's speech was an effort to make the case that the increase in the number of calved heifers which qualified for the calved heifer scheme was infinitesimal, that it really did not matter very much to the economy of the agricultural community.  He went further, if my memory serves me right, <Col N="50" /> and tried to make the case that none, or very little, of this money was finding its way into the pockets of the agricultural community.  He tried to show that the increase in the number of calved heifers under the grant scheme was brought about by a certain amount of manipulation.  Judging from his expression, he seemed to suggest that beyond a certain point that scheme could not expand any further.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy made a different case&mdash;that only one section should be entitled to help by way of grant or other form of encouragement.  That was the keynote of his speech from beginning to end. Apparently he wants nobody to live but his friends.  I have spent my life farming and all farmers, big and small, are farmers to me. Each section of the community, each one of each section, has constitutional rights which have been won by the struggles of our people in past generations, which are enshrined in our Constitution and upheld by our courts. One would imagine that a scheme such as the calved heifer scheme had been introduced for the sole purpose of helping only one section of the agricultural community.  In fact, it was a real attempt by the Government to increase our cattle numbers to such an extent that our cattle and carcase exports will in future contribute considerably to our balance of payments position.</P>
    <P>One could not help noticing the doleful manner in which some of to-day's criticisms were made. I suppose every country has its quota of doleful Jimmys but unfortunately this country has them.  Nothing good can come from Nazareth.  According to some people, nothing good can come from the Government benches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

      <P>What an extraordinary comparison to make!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the cap fits, I wish you luck.  That is the line of argument being followed.  One Opposition speaker suggested that the target for increased cattle numbers could not be reached unless our cows started to farrow instead of calving or had multiple calves each time they calved. <Col N="51" /> Probably that statement has been agitating the minds of the previous critics.</P>
      <P>One of the items in this Supplementary Estimate is a payment to the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  Deputy Murphy dealt at length with the pigs and bacon industry.  I would much prefer if the small and middle farmers raised and fattened sufficient pigs to supply our bacon factories with enough material for the export trade, but, seeing that for some reason or another they have not been able to rise to the occasion, it is in the public interest that the industry has been organised on another basis.</P>
      <P>I hope the farming community will continue the breeding of pigs, will continue to sell them at economic prices to those who fatten them, who will, in turn, sell to the factories.  This is an industry in which more than one section of the community is concerned. There is the breeder, the fattener and the curer.  Each section should make every effort and give full co-operation for the purpose of improving that industry.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note that recently the Pigs and Bacon Commission have broken new ground in regard to markets.  I congratulate them on having done so and wish them every success in obtaining further and better markets. Without export markets, there is no point in our farmers producing beef, mutton, bacon, poultry, milk or anything else.  I note that the sale of our dairy produce has now reached the high figure of £8,911,000.  I am not suggesting that, because of this, the Irish farmer is rolling in riches.  He is not.  Unfortunately, farmers all over the world are the social dray horses for other industries.  The farmer is getting &mdash;or almost getting&mdash;only that which he is entitled to.  He should be getting much more than he is getting now if he is to keep pace with the standards laid down by industry, not alone here but everywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a sum in the Estimate for the disposal of wheat.  I agree that the wheat question is a very complex one. It is very hard for the wheat grower to see how much wheat he should or <Col N="52" /> should not grow in a given year in order to meet the requirements of the millers.  It would be an ideal position if all the wheat grown in this country were millable and accepted by the millers as such, but that is not so.  Due to adverse weather and so on, the acreage under wheat has definitely fallen. I remember&mdash;and I would like others to remember&mdash;that there was a time in the history of this State when the people who are now loudest about the losses on wheat did their utmost to try to prevent our people from growing wheat.  We cannot forget those things. If the wheat policy had not been adopted away back in the thirties, our people would have been in a bad way for bread when their supplies of wheat were practically cut off during the last World War.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the Farm Buildings Scheme and the Land Project schemes are being availed of more and more by farmers.  The sum for farm building and water supply schemes is up by £100,000.  The more I see such schemes availed of, the more I regard it as a sign of progress and increased production.  We must all agree that one of the essentials in a rural community is water&mdash;on tap if possible&mdash;in every house.  Definitely this Government have done their share to encourage that. They have done their share in giving better facilities to the farmer, in the farmyard, in the household and in the byre.  It is essential for all stock that farms should have a reliable water supply for the 52 weeks of the year. I appreciate the grants that have been given down the years to encourage this, not alone by one Government, but by a number of Governments. There has been a transformation in farm life where water and electricity have been installed.  I am pleased to note that the demand is still there and that the Government in their wisdom are still giving grants for this very praiseworthy object.</P>
    <P>I have noticed here also that there is an extra £60,000 for lime fertiliser grants for farmers.  One of the previous speakers said that at the moment we can carry only so much stock in the country.  I do not share that view. I believe that our present herds and <Col N="53" /> flocks could be considerably increased by the more widespread use of fertilisers on land.  It could become a great national asset and a great source of wealth for our people as a whole as well as for individuals, if everybody having land made better use of the advisory services afforded them and availed of the opportunities offered from Government sources for providing the essentials for farmers as far as the Government can go.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy tried to make a case against a flat price for milk.  He says the flat rate is not fair to one section. I wonder does he forget the parable about the workers in the vineyard.  It does no harm to anyone that all should get the same price for the produce. Deputy Murphy says that because a man has a small bit of and, he should not get an economic price.  Does it not boil down to that?  I am sorry he is not here.</P>
    <P>He referred also to the people who may have single sucklers from their heifers.  He said they should be prevented by law from doing this.  He forgets that we all have our constitutional rights.  It is a different thing if somebody is trying to carry out an act which is illegal.  I cannot understand the mentality of anyone who states in our national Parliament that such-and-such a section should be denied the right to get so-and-so.  As I said earlier, farmers, whether big or small, are all farmers to me.  My interest is in the farming community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have taken up the time of the House for a little while now and I conclude by wishing the Minister success in the office he has come into so recently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister did not consider it appropriate to make a general statement on agricultural policy when introducing this Supplementary Estimate, there is not very much we can say by way of a discussion of general agricultural policy.  The best one can do is to make a few comments on the headings in this Supplementary Estimate, in which one is particularly interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On page 2 of the Minister's statement, there is a remark I welcome. <Col N="54" /> The Minister states that milk is of fundamental importance to our agricultural economy.  I agree with that wholeheartedly.  It is something to which I have referred on numerous occasions in this House.  The Minister mentioned the 2d. per gallon which was granted earlier this year.  There has been quite a lot of propaganda and talk regarding this 2d.  However, it seems an extraordinary state of affairs &mdash;and I do not know whether the Minister is aware of the situation&mdash; that very few creameries have found it possible to pay the full 2d increase. There is a considerable difference in the proportions of the 2d. which have been given.  Some creameries have given as low as 1½d. while others have given up to 1¾d.  As far as I am aware, most creameries have found it impossible to pay the 2d. per gallon increase.</P>
    <P>This is a serious matter and something that should be looked into.  It bears out what other Deputies have said relating to this Estimate, that not all the millions that have been devoted to agriculture are finding their way into the pockets of the farmers.  The dairying industry is the branch of agriculture in which I am most interested. I represent a constituency where dairying is the main enterprise on the family farm.  It is an industry which provides a considerable amount of employment, not alone in County Limerick but even in Limerick city.  It is for that reason I welcome the Minister's recognition of the fact that milk is of fundamental importance to our agricultural economy.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat what I said here on numerous occasions and, in fact on every occasion on which I have spoken on agriculture, that I believe the dairying industry has a colossal potential for development.  The 2d. per gallon for milk and the £15 heifer subsidy are entirely inadequate, in my opinion, from the point of view of putting this industry in the position in which it will be able to make its full contribution to both the agricultural and the national economy.  The first essential is the payment of an economic basic price to our dairy farmers.  While I welcome the increase given in the last Budget, I do not accept, and most people in the <Col N="55" /> dairying industry do not accept, that the present price is an economic one. The Minister must face that fact and he must not be surprised if there are demands for further increases.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of milk prices to which I have referred on numerous occasions.  I appeal to the Minister now to give it very careful consideration.  I refer to the payment of some type of bonus for quality. Quality is of vital importance to the whole dairying industry.  Now that we have succeeded in diversifying not alone our markets but also our production from milk, the question of quality assumes tremendous importance.  I believe the only way in which we will achieve this high quality milk is by the payment of some type of bonus for the production of high quality milk.</P>
    <P>I understand that Mitchelstown Creameries have in operation some form of quality payment.  This is of vital importance.  I know farmers who have gone to considerable expense to modernise their milking equipment, who have installed coolers, and so on, in order to ensure cleaner milk of better quality, and they are paid the same price per gallon as that received by the farmer still operating the old, antiquated, not always hygienic methods.  Quality is of vital importance. If an economic basic price is paid and, in addition, some form of bonus for quality, then our dairy farmers have the ability to produce all the milk necessary to meet our market commitments.</P>
    <P>With regard to the marketing of dairy produce, all down through the years there has been a latent fear of marketing, a fear that production will outstrip markets, that supply will outstrip demand.  Thanks to the efforts of An Bord Bainne and the dynamic efforts of Mr. O'Reilly, the question of markets need not in the forseeable future cause us any great concern and we should now aim, therefore at getting increased production, particularly of this high quality milk, to enable us to diversify still further our milk industry.</P>
    <P>In one way I am sorry the Minister did not make a more general statement on the dairying industry remembering <Col N="56" /> that such a large proportion of this subvention is devoted to it.  Dairy farmers and others connected with the dairying industry are awaiting a definite statement with regard to the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the survey team which examined the industry and also with regard to the Knapp report.  I see here an item relating to the IAOS which seems to indicate that a start has been made in implementing some of the recommendations of the Knapp report.  I asked the Minister some questions relating to the latter report and also to the report of the Survey Team because I know that people in the dairying areas are wondering how soon something concrete will be done to implement the provisions in these documents.</P>
    <P>I was unavoidably absent at Question Time today but I see in a reply given by the Minister to a question of mine an announcement that the Department are arranging the establishment of regional dairy laboratories at Cork and Limerick and that the Department's butter testing station in Dublin is being extended.  That is a very welcome development because it indicates that steps are now being taken to implement one of the main recommendations of the survey team in relation to the establishment of research and laboratory facilities.  In particular, I welcome the establishment of one of these laboratories at Limerick.  When we come to debate the next Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, I hope the Minister will give practical proof of his belief in the importance of the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the discussion today has centred on the heifer subsidy scheme.  I have never approved of that scheme and I said so cleary on its introduction.  It is my belief, as it is the belief of the vast majority of the farmers in my constituency, that a much better approach would be a calf subsidy scheme.  Most people, unfamiliar with the environment, seem to think of Limerick in terms of the Golden Vale and the big grass rancher. That is far from being the true picture. There are very small farmers there, farmers with ten or 15 cows.  The <Col N="57" /> heifer subsidy scheme has not been of any great advantage to them.  The figure given by the Minister for County Limerick was £150,000.  With 10,000 dairy farmers, that works out on average at one £15 per farmer.  I know that average does not give the true picture.  I know people who have had substantial amounts paid to them and, therefore, there must be others who have not received anything at all under this scheme.</P>
    <P>A calf subsidy would have been a much better approach.  Many small farmers rear their calves until this time of the year.  Because their holdings are small and they have only enough fodder for their cows during the winter months, having taken the risk of rearing their calves, they now have to sell them.  A system could be devised whereby a person who rears the calf and keeps it for six to 12 months would get, say £7, get half, the balance to be paid when the heifer calved.  I recommend that suggestion to the Minister; at least it is worth looking into.</P>
    <P>In regard to pigs and bacon, the bacon industry is of very great importance in my constituency because Limerick has been traditionally associated with bacon production.  There has been one development in recent years, and quite frankly I think it is the only hope for the future of the pig and bacon industry, and that has been the development of large scale fattening units.  A good number of co-operative creameries are going in for this type of business and it is a good thing.  I am fully in favour of it.  The system seems to work and generally it varies from one place to another, but the general arrangement seems to be that the creamery lets out the sows to the farmers and the creamery will then buy the bonhams at a certain age.  This is a very good development because the fattening of pigs, except in large numbers, is not an economic proposition at present.  Having seen the scheme in operation both in Limerick and in other counties, I am all in favour of it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the increased subvention for An Foras Talúntais, I may say that I have had a good deal of contact with this body.  I read all the <Col N="58" /> documents they issue but I must confess that I am not satisfied that the results of the research work done by the Agricultural Institute are being passed on to the farmer.  There seems to be some bottleneck in the flow of information from the Institute to the farmer.  That should now be reviewed. I am not in any way trying to detract from the tremendous work which the Institute is doing but there should be some better means of channelling the information from the Institute down to the farmer.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is a pet subject of mine is the question of co-operation at farm level.  I have criticised the Agricultural Institute on previous occasions for not paying sufficient attention to this problem and I am not aware of any recent research into this question of co-operation, and I am referring now to co-operation such as in the operation of machinery pools and so on.  The Institute is the proper body to examine this problem and it should take a greater interest in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on this important Supplementary Estimate which affects the interests of every Deputy but particularly those of us from the rural areas.  I am particularly glad to note that the Estimate mainly concerns educational matters generally and veterinary research, which people in recent years have rapidly come to realise are of fundamental importance to any advance in agriculture whether in relation to the small farm areas, to the larger farms, or to any other type of farm.  Incidentally, people sometimes talk here as if the word &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; covered a specific category of people.  The term is so wide that it is almost impossible to consider as one class the different categories coming within any particular heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us mainly concerned with the problems of the western seaboard realise that the term &ldquo;small farmer&rdquo; is not applicable to the area as a whole at all because we have many cases where physically a farm is not small but the income is small, if you are to look at it that way.  The term &ldquo;uneconomic <Col N="59" /> holding&rdquo; is probably more apt in relation to these holdings.  There is no place where the necessary educational facilities are more necessary than on the western seaboard where the system of husbandry has not kept pace in recent times with the general advancement in agriculture as a whole under the various categories to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>One of the most heartening signs&mdash; and I have said this quite often and it cannot be repeated too often&mdash;in recent years has been the number of organisations that come forward to offer all sorts of solutions for a problem which is as old as the west itself.  Many of these organisations are simply nothing more than pressure groups which come together to criticise the Government for not doing something, or who come together simply to get money for these people in some way or other.  You have the occasional group of people coming together to do something and those people who referred to what is being done for the western seaboard, and what can be done, should appreciate that the group responsible for the Glencolumbcille effort, which is so much talked about by people who know little about it, is quite different from many of the pressure groups or agitation groups we get throughout the country inasmuch as they did something first and asked for something afterwards.  They have got down to doing something for themselves and that must commend itself to anyone interested in this problem on the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>We are not looking for social services as such on the western seaboard. Sometimes the type of campaign which is conducted would lead one to believe &mdash;and I am not sure that some people in this House do not think it&mdash;that we are merely looking for social services. We have good, active and progressive farmers on the western seaboard all of whom could probably do better but we have many whose incomes are very much below what might be regarded as sufficient to maintain the standard of living people have become accustomed to at present.  A mere subsistence from the land is not sufficient to justify any <Col N="60" /> member of the family considering that he is going to continue on the farm. The problem is to enable these people, by better methods and more up-to-date mechanical appliances, to obtain from their holdings a better income than they have been capable of getting in the past.</P>
    <P>There was a time when work in these congested areas was sheer manual labour, and the people got a mere existence.  There was a time when they had very little choice other than to try to eke out from the little land they had some form of existence to keep body and soul together.  They were probably more content then than they are now, because in those days there was no other outlet, no labour market in England.  The only emigration there was from places like Donegal was to potato picking, known as &ldquo;tatty-hoking&rdquo;, in Scotland.  That was migratory and the people shuttled back and forth seasonally.  We have now reached the stage when a young man can buy a ticket at a railway station or bus station and find himself in one of the highly industrialised centres in England, able to earn from £12 to £20 a week, according to the overtime he is prepared to work.  It is easily appreciated how difficult it has become to keep people living on subsistence farms when that labour outlet is available to them just across the Channel.  What annoys me is that people talk as if some Government had created a situation in which they were driving these people into this position.</P>
    <P>Our emigration in the past was mainly to the United States of America. That emigration was costly and selective. People had to pass tests, medical and otherwise, in order to qualify to go. They had to find a reasonable amount of money to go.  That was our main source of emigration and huge numbers of people went.  Most Donegal families can boast that they have more relatives living in Boston, New York or Chicago, than they have at home.  That type of emigration was not so frequent and it was not taken in the same trivial way as emigration to England.  A young man can make up his mind in a matter of hours and he can go to England in the morning.  That is the problem that <Col N="61" /> faces us in regard to depopulation and trying to keep young people at home.</P>
    <P>There is no man on these farms on the western seaboard who has not got more today than ever before, and the problem is in regard to what he wishes to have, and to create a situation whereby he will feel more content to remain.  We must face the facts as they are.  There is no use in using the west as a means of propaganda to denigrate the genuine efforts of the Government to try to do something to ameliorate the position there.  Time and again I have read reports of groups coming together, and nothing more constructive emerged from the proceedings than condemnations of the Government for not pumping enough money into this, that or the other area, to assist those people.  We do not want gifts, or doles, or social services.  What we want is sustenance in any responsible effort which will give a better way of manipulating, operating and working the holdings in a business-like way, which will create good family units, holdings that will give a reasonably happy existence to the family or to the young married couple who wish to settle down, and re-orientate our whole outlook in regard to living in those areas.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of heartening signs in regard to the whole matter. I have scarcely met&mdash;and I have met enough of them&mdash;one of those people who went away and returned, as they frequently do, who would not stay at home when he has become more mature and has had an opportunity of comparing life in different places, if he were satisfied he could move into a better way of living, with some security for the future.  For that reason the huge amount of money which is earmarked in this Supplementary Estimate for educational services is most heartening.  It is easy to see that it will not be hailed by many people as a great panacea for many of the problems which we know exist, because money is not put directly into someone's pockets.  Without an educational foundation it would not be possible to make the progress that is essential.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker&mdash;and I have heard this from that side of the House <Col N="62" /> before&mdash;said he did not approve of the heifer scheme.  As we know, the bulk of the money in this Supplementary Estimate is for the heifer scheme. It is over £2½ million extra.  That is a colossal amount of money, and it is a great tribute to a scheme which is one of the most beneficial schemes we have seen.  I do not regard it as something for which we can take a lot of credit but in actual fact it is the best scheme the agricultural community have experienced for a long time, particularly in those areas where there was a depleted dairy stock.  In many small holdings, or uneconomic holdings, one or two heifers had to be sold as dry in order to get a little extra money. When I see that they can now be retained in order to get the £30 or £45 which would accrue from the scheme I think this is a tremendous scheme. The fact that it is given for cows additional to the herd is in itself indicative of the huge increase in the cattle population which it has definitely brought about.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out before from this side of the House on many other occasions, the scheme was not just to give a subsidy for having cows or extra calves, but it was primarily organised to increase the cattle population. For that reason it was channelled towards additional cattle in the herd.  While the primary purpose of the scheme was to increase the cattle population, it has been of tremendous assistance to a great many people who lacked the necessary capital to retain in their herds those dry heifers, and were compelled to sell them at certain times.  It has resulted in a tremendous increase in those areas where because of lack of capital or for some other reason they had not the necessary additional stock.  In some areas, particularly in the west, where people are living on farms and getting £X per year return from their efforts they could all do better.  It is an important point that we could do better by using the proper system.</P>
    <P>This is not an appropriate time to go into a detailed debate on matters pertaining to agriculture but, in passing, I should say that I have absolute confidence in the co-operative schemes.  I <Col N="63" /> think every parish on the western seaboard should have a co-operative scheme, and I do not mean a glorified grocery shop which is sometimes referred to as a co-operative, but a co-operative which will work in co-operation with a committee of intelligent farmers, with the guidance of an agricultural graduate or two, and which will keep a pool of necessary modern machinery which can be hired out to the small farmers, if they need it, which will bring into the area the proper types of fertilisers which can be obtained on a long or on a short-term credit system; which will have an exchange system for seeds, and so on. In that system lies 95 per cent of the solution to what is necessary to bring up those holdings on the western seaboard to the full economic level of which they are capable, thereby giving those who live on them a decent standard of living&mdash;and they have much to offer otherwise that one cannot get elsewhere.</P>
    <P>While we moan and groan at times outside chapel gates about houses closing&mdash;and nobody likes to see houses closing anywhere&mdash;we must take particular courage and pride in the fact that modern housing is going up in hundreds in these areas, properly equipped with water, sewerage, electric light and the rest.  They are being built in every district one travels through.  Therefore those who want people to believe that hope is gone and that effort is lacking should visit the areas I speak of and see for themselves that there is yet there a very strong nucleus of good motive power, capable of expanding and giving to those areas the fertility which they are capable of achieving, thus making them places where good, comfortable family farms are bound to become a feature in the very near future.</P>
    <P>All the signs are for the better.  Consider even those pressure groups and agitation committees, in themselves indicative of a new thinking and a feeling that something can be done and has to be done.  While they may not properly be directed towards doing anything that might be worthwhile, some of them, like our Glencolumbcille <Col N="64" /> effort, led by Father McDyer, are giving a lead in that they are doing something and have done something.  It is not merely a question of saying: &ldquo;Give us money and we will get on better.&rdquo;  Rather is it the position: &ldquo;Give us money and we will prove that we can uplift our whole economy by doing certain things.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not believe in free grants for everything.  There is a lot to be said for the interest-free loan or the low-interest loan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Agriculture can generally be described as the primary industry. I am sure the Minister will not have any fear about getting his Estimate through this House in a reasonable time.  Analysing the figures he gave us, it would appear that there are three headings under which this Estimate is produced.  The first heading is the heifer scheme, which takes up by far the greater portion of it; the second is the ninth round wage increase; and the third is the main part of this year's Budget&mdash;the items his predecessor should have included in this year's Budget except that, trying to keep down the amount to a reasonable sum, he felt it would be safer to introduce a Supplementary Estimate at a later stage.</P>
      <P>It seems extraordinary that the Government, having decided that £300,000 was the necessary amount of money for the heifer scheme this year, now find that £2,500,000 is required. Can the Minister say if in fact the increase in stocks which was required, or that the Government thought was required, would be represented by the estimate his predecessor made when introducing the scheme?  If so, has it gone miles out of hands already?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Successful&rdquo;: let us follow that up.  If, in fact, we have satisfied ourselves that the amount being spent is not more than the Government anticipated or is not more than the Government would like to see spent, does the Minister imagine we shall have the same situation coming along year after year?  Is it not a fact that the people who could afford to <Col N="66" /> increase their herds this year did so, seeing that it could happen only once? With the amount of land available, particularly to the smaller farmer, the Minister says that there were about two heifers each to 54,664 of them.  If that is so, does it mean that, with what we have spent in one year, the increase which has taken place this year is not likely to recur?  Either that will happen or what some of the Fine Gael Deputies said earlier is the truth, namely, that the speculator increases his herd in one year and goes back to dry stock next year.</P>

    <P>The next item is the question of the milk.  Would it not have been better if the Department had made some effort to find a market for milk and milk products, which are bound to increase tremendously as a result of the increase in the cow stock?  Does it not follow that we will have, inside the next year or two, a tremendous increase? Does it mean that we will have to find an extra subsidy for the purpose of dealing with the butter, in particular?  Would it not have been a far better thing if this matter had been planned on a long-term basis?  I do not believe that giving an extra £20 or £25 to the small farmer for one year will make his life completely successful. It is like thinking that if you give <Col N="67" /> an extra few pounds to an agricultural grant, it will result in more men employed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Tully on 11th November, 1964:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that, in view of the recent steep rise in the cost of living, and in particular in the prices of essential foodstuffs, and in view of the resulting hardship inflicted on those in receipt of unemployment, sickness and disability benefits and social welfare benefits and assistance generally, the amounts <Col N="68" /> payable in these benefits and assistance should be reviewed immediately with a view to granting equitable increases.</P>
    <P>Debate was resumed on the following amendment moved by the Minister for Social Welfare on 18th November, 1964:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;that the Government should continue to implement its declared policy of arranging that improvements in the national income, resulting from national economic growth, should be shared by Social Welfare recipients, and notes that this has brought about increases in rates of benefit in every year for a number of years past.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to get from the subject being discussed all the evening to the subject of this motion. When the debate was adjourned last week, I said the Minister's speech had a nineteenth century ring about it. In fact, I said it could have been made by the defeated candidate for the American Presidency, who believed in the sturdy principles of no help for those who are less fortunate than others.  That kind of view has of course been rejected all over the world and has now been rejected in the United States, but we must do more than reject it by words.  If the capitalist society in which we live worked, it would work only by ensuring that there will be no submerged pretence and we must make certain that if we have an affluent society, that affluence does not contain any miseries.  I think any criticism of our society should be measured by our treatment of the underprivileged. If we are embarrassed by the living conditions of any, then we have failed in justice.  I do not think any Government plans, any proposals or White Paper on economic expansion, or any progress reports, have any value whatever because if the shares are not fair, we have failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister who has just vacated the seat where the Minister now present is seated said in the past few days that, to have a community in the <Col N="69" /> social justice privileges, we cannot contemplate a permanent state of affairs in which a substantial section of our people lag behind in living standards. The Minister for Agriculture was talking about the agricultural community. Indeed, he was quite right in the application of these words to the farmers and those who work the farms, as against those who work in the towns &mdash;industrialists and professional people. I have always said the agriculturists did not get a fair share of the cake in this country.  If the Minister for Agriculture contrasts himself with the people who are in receipt, or deserving, of social welfare assistance, I think he would be even more indignant than those whom he represents as Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister for Social Welfare express similar indignation on behalf of the poor people for whom he is responsible?  He should remember the words the Minister for Agriculture used about those who lag behind in living standards.  The Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Social Welfare, or any one of us, should not at this stage start quoting any rebuttal of the case being made of our present attitudes towards these services.  We should not bother about what we do now compared with what was, or was not, done in the past. We should not bother about what the community affords but we should concentrate on the words&mdash;the group who lag behind.  I think the Minister for Social Welfare should have a talk with the Minister for Agriculture and if there is to be another reshuffle in the Government, perhaps the Minister for Agriculture could do good work in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The principles the Minister for Agriculture has outlined for the community in which he is now interested apply almost completely to those in receipt of social welfare.  Of course, the trouble in this country, and in every western country, is that those in receipt of social welfare&mdash;the old and the poor &mdash;are not organised.  Trade unionists are organised; industrialists are organised; shop-owners and professional people are all organised, and they institute very strong pressures, but there are no pressures <Col N="70" /> that cannot be easily resisted from the poor.  Is that not a test of us all?  Those who kick up a row will be reasonably well treated; those who cannot kick up a row will have to take what is left.  Of course it means that we really have not a Christian conscience in public affairs, if we cannot stand this test.  It does not matter a damn what our gross figures are, what OECD says, or what Ministers say, if we fail in this regard, we have failed utterly.  If we meet inflation as we have met it up to this, unfairly and unequally, we have failed.  Organised workers, public servants, shopkeepers, industrialists, professional people, all reacted very firmly in self-defence when the inflationary wage came.  They got their share, and some got too much if we are to believe the Minister for Finance.  By getting too much, they added to the trouble of those who did not get enough.  The agriculturists did less well, if we are to believe the Minister for Agriculture, but that is his affair.</P>
    <P>Who will look after those who require social services?  The Minister for Social Welfare should.  Inflation more grievously injures that section of our people than any other.  Their standards are low and, indeed, in this country they are low by any international standards.  This is particularly and shamefully so for us when we compare them with the standard of treatment meted out in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  The figures given are indisputable. I think the percentage declined and the national share-out is the only fair measure by which we can test ourselves in this.  There is no good talking about money on its face value. It is only by relating the percentages of the share-out in social welfare services to the entire distribution that we can preserve any kind of picture of what has happened in the last 25 or 30 years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully very aptly and clearly pictured it for us when he related the old age pensioner to the agricultural worker before the First World War. That relationship has become a joke. I am afraid the hard fact is that we are a selfish and self-grabbing society. Those of us who have authority, <Col N="71" /> wealth or union power grab for ourselves and the poor and needy get less and less.  The old age pensioners, the widows, the widowers and the old pensioners, the retired and scandalously treated old railway workers, are all our responsibility.  We have turned our backs on our responsibility to them.</P>
    <P>In speaking to this motion, the Minister said something that shocked me. He said that we must not get emotional about this.  What other way should we get about it?  He said that we are going to give what we can afford.  What can we afford?  If Deputy Dr. Ryan as Minister for Finance were told in 1957 to increase his Budget from £110 million to £210 million, he would have exploded in horror but now everybody knows that that is just what he has done.  It is now costing us £100 million more to run this State than it cost when the Minister first sat in office on those benches over there.  The Minister should tell the Minister for Finance that he should use at least one of the instalments which he has taken in those seven years to increase social welfare awards.  If the Minister for Finance rejects that proposition, then we should put an end to all this guff about progress in this country.  That progress, as it relates to social welfare recipients in that same period, is shameful and disgraceful and brands us as a generation of cynics.</P>
    <P>I do not expect any result from this discussion but it will move more minds away from the direction indicated by the Minister in his speech last week.  If the question is asked of me: &ldquo;How can we do it?&rdquo;, the answer is that we can do it only by increasing taxation. I am willing to pay more income tax and to pay higher taxation on my cigarettes and tobacco.  I would be proud if this country were the first to tax itself heavily for this particular purpose.  I think the majority of Deputies would agree with me in this so as to disprove the case put forward by Deputy Dr. Browne last week that the system we operate here is a failure because it has failed to protect the underprivileged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was very <Col N="72" /> critical of the motion put down by the Labour Party and suggested to the House that there was no sincerity behind it.  He said that our motion mentioned three things and that the various speakers did not refer to these particular things.  If the Minister looks at his own amendment and studies it, he will find that he can only regard it as a pious resolution that says to those in receipt of social welfare benefits: &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass.&rdquo; His speech was one of smugness and complacency.  From what he said, he does not seem to realise that there is extreme hardship and poverty amongst certain sections of the community here. There is no use in the Minister talking about an increase in the gross national product.  There is no point in trying to pretend that we are a prosperous nation because the national income has been going up from year to year.  It may also be true that there are not as many people in poverty today as there were 25, 30 or 40 years ago but the fact remains that there are people who have not any sort of a standard of living. The other fact is that the Minister and the Government of which he is a member have a responsibility for those people.</P>
      <P>There is no point in telling us that prosperity and the standard of living has gone up for 95 per cent of the people if 5 per cent of them are living on £1, £2, £3 or even £4 a week.  I do not think the Minister was serious when he was dealing with this motion. Deputy A. Barry was probably right when he said that there will be no result from this discussion because some Independents will support the Minister and his Party when the matter comes to a vote.  This debate will end at ten minutes past seven o'clock and then these people will be forgotten again because there will be a majority against those of us who vote for the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should read the motion again.  It calls attention to the recent steep rise in the cost of living. Does the Minister deny that?  It says that the cost of living is inflicting hardship on people in receipt of social benefits and asks for an immediate review of the situation for the purpose of increasing those benefits.  That is what <Col N="73" /> the Minister was asked to do at the recent Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis and that is what the Árd Fheis voted for despite the complacency when he said, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 18th November:</P>
    <P>The worst thing we could do in the interest of social welfare recipients, and the community generally, would be to impose an unbearable burden on the economy, raising taxation to a level which would interfere with this growth.  The only way to benefit social welfare benefits&mdash;and the standard of living generally&mdash;was to realise that the economy had to be expanded to yield these results.</P>
    <P>The social welfare recipients have not got increases commensurate with the expansion of which the Ministers have boasted since 1957 and 1958.  The Minister depends in this debate on the argument that increases in social welfare benefits have been made regularly since Fianna Fáil resumed office.  He ignores other facts, I do not know whether deliberately or not.  He said that increases were given to match the increases in the cost of living.  If that were so, it still would not be sufficient, but it is not so.</P>
    <P>First of all, what should be done for those people is to give them a standard and then to relate that standard to increases in the cost of living.  It is not good enough in 1964, when we are told we are ready to go into a European community, that we can give increases to our social welfare beneficiaries only in accordance with increases in the cost-of-living figure, without first of all fixing a decent standard.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to increased prices.  He referred to the cost of living in 1950, 1960 and 1961, picking out those years to justify what had been done by the present Government for old age pensioners.  I have here what I do not think is an untypical letter.  It appeared in the <i>Evening Herald</i> a few weeks ago, written by a person in receipt of sickness benefit. This is what he wrote:</P>
    <P>I am drawing Social Welfare sick benefit for some years now, owing to bad health.  I receive £2 2s. 6d. <Col N="74" /> and, as I live alone, I have no other help or income.  My rent for one room is 12s. weekly.  I can only afford two meals of tea and a little bread and butter&mdash;no breakfast. Therefore, I have to go into hospital very often in a run-down condition. When coming out, I get a diet chart from my doctor which is put in the fire as how can I buy fowl, meat, fish and other nourishing foods, out of what is left after paying my rent?</P>
    <P>I would say there are many people in similar circumstances.  Nobody wants to talk about poverty in this country. Not alone do members of the Government, politicians, shy away from that word but other people in other places try to give the impression that there is no such thing as poverty.  They point to the social services, to the different charities, but those of us who are close to the people, those of us who have to call on the people and on whom the people call, know that in very many cases bread and tea is a regular diet.</P>
    <P>I know, of course, that the Minister has no direct responsibility for the local authorities.  It is typical of many local authorities&mdash;I am glad to say Labour Party members are not responsible&mdash;that they refuse to provide the requisite money for the managers to pay decent amounts in home assistance. I know of one man who has no social welfare allowance and who is getting something like 10/- or £1 a week home assistance to live on.  A married couple are expected to live on £2 a week.  If there were children, the man would not be given a proportionately higher amount.</P>
    <P>I have had a letter from a constituent with eight children.  The local authority offer him £2 per week for himself, his wife and eight children. The allowances for children range from 5/- to 10/- per week.  Therefore, the local authorities, as well as the Minister, are failing in their jobs of providing reasonably for people who have nothing.  The Minister&mdash;all Ministers do the same&mdash;boasts monotonously about the progress made since Fianna Fáil came back to office, about progressive increases in the national income.  None of these <Col N="75" /> speeches is of the least consolation to the people concerned in this motion.</P>
    <P>It is no consolation to the 250,000 to 300,000 people depending on our social services, who have not been compensated for increases in prices, even for increases as reflected in the cost of living index figure.  Despite what the Minister has said, even considering his own standard, he has cheated the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans.  The non-contributory old age pension at the moment is 37/6 per week.  The Minister's speech last week seemed to be devoted mainly to the fact that Deputy Tully made a slip and gave the figure of 35/- instead of 37/6. I feel sure the Minister does not doubt that Deputy Tully, in his work in his constituency and here in the Dáil, knows all about benefit rates, but the Minister had so little to say that this seemed a good avenue of escape from the main point of the motion.</P>
    <P>The non-contributory old age pension rate was 35/- a week in August, 1963.  The cost of living index figure was 159 at that time.  The cost of living figure in August, 1964, was 173. In a period of one year, between August, 1963 and August, 1964, the cost of living index figure rose by nine per cent.  The old age pensioners did not get an increase of nine per cent.  Again, if we take the Minister's standards, the last increase should have been 3/- instead of 2/6, so the Minister and the Government cheated the old age pensioners out of 6d. per week.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the object of this motion is not, as the Minister suggested in his speech, aimed at relating these increases or relating allowances to the cost of living index figure but to trying to get those beneficiaries a standard and then, if anyone likes &mdash;I feel sure we all would&mdash;to have increases related to increases in the cost of living as per the new standard.  The Minister said there was no mention of prices by the mover of the motion.  I have a long list here, given in reply to a Parliamentary Question, of prices for the period August, 1963 to August, 1964.  In respect of food alone, widows and old <Col N="76" /> age pensioners, the sick and the unemployed, were all hit by increased prices.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister knows that the introduction of the turnover tax was one of the biggest factors in the increased cost of living, particularly involving food items.  Beef, mutton, sausages, eggs, butter, margarine, tea, bread, sugar were all hit.  They were all items which affected recipients of old age pensions and other such benefits. As I have said, the Minister cheated the old age pensioners even on his own principle.  He has cheated the widows and orphans much more so. There has been no consideration at all for the widow with children.  She got no increase.  In August, 1963, the weekly pension of a non-contributory widow was 33s. per week.  She got an increase of 2s. 6d.  The widow with two children got only the same increase, no regard being given to the fact that she had children.  Those who had more than two, those who had four, six, or even eight, were cheated more so, taking again the Minister's own principle of applying increases to the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Deputy A. Barry referred to the Exchequer income from taxation.  The Minister has never answered this adequately and he may think it monotonous for the Labour Party to go on mentioning it.  We have heard it said: &ldquo;If we got the money, we would give it to the old aged, the sick, the widows&rdquo;.  They did get it, and in great quantity during the past six or seven years, but did not apply a fair proportion to social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>For the record, I want to repeat what I said on many occasions.  In 1957-58 tax revenue was £102.7 million. Out of that £24.3 million was spent on social welfare.  That represented 22 per cent.  In 1958-59 the relationship between social welfare expenditure and tax revenue fell to 21.5 per cent.  In 1959-60 it fell still further to 20.9 per cent; in 1960-61, to 20 per cent; in 1961-62, to 18 per cent. There was an improvement in 1963-64 when it went back to 20 per cent, but for 1964-65 it is down again to 19.1 per cent.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister if the social welfare recipients <Col N="77" /> are receiving their fair share of the moneys obtained by the Minister for Finance through the Revenue Commissioners and so on.  Rather than the position of these people being improved, the contrary is the case.  The Minister may say there is less unemployment. There is not.  There is a smaller number of non-contributory old age pensioners because of the introduction of the contributory pension scheme.  But if the number is smaller, surely there is a greater case for giving them a little more?</P>
    <P>The Minister ignores all these things in his amendment.  Compared with the firm and direct motion of the Labour Party, his amendment looks puny and watery.  It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that the Government should continue to implement its declared policy of arranging that improvements in the national income, resulting from national economic growth, should be shared by Social Welfare recipients, and notes that this has brought about increases in rates of benefit in every year for a number of years past.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the increases in the gross national product, in national income and in the revenue the Government have got from the taxpayers, all these social welfare recipients have been cheated.</P>
    <P>The Minister says: &ldquo;You will not vote the money.&rdquo;  We made our position very clear, especially on the Budget in which the turnover tax was introduced, and on the one before that and before that.  We said we would not vote for these taxes when we saw that a fair proportion of the taxation was not being given to these deserving people.  A week last Wednesday the Taoiseach came into the House and proposed that Irish industry be subsidised to a tune of X million pounds. The House agreed to give him general approval.  Did the Taoiseach say how he was going to raise the money?  We had a notion from the Minister for Justice to the effect that the turnover tax being such an easy tax, another half per cent or one per cent on it would get all the money we need.  That is what we were afraid of when we <Col N="78" /> opposed it in the first instance.  By and large, in respect of that tax and other tax proposals of the Government, we were not convinced that a fair proportion of the money derived from them was being given to these deserving people.</P>
    <P>The Minister criticised my regime in the Department of Social Welfare.  I make no apology for saying that when I was Minister for Social Welfare in an inter-Party Government and two Budgets were introduced, the social welfare recipients were the people who got first consideration.  If we could have a balance either by economies or increases in taxation, the first charge demanded by the Ministers for Social Welfare in those inter-Party Governments, who happened to be Labour Ministers, were the social welfare recipients. I do not think the present Minister can say, even if he did make the claim, that his Government listened to him in the past five or six Budgets.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment says that the Government should continue to implement their declared policy of improving the position of social welfare recipients according as economic growth increases.  We ask: how long must they wait?  Even since the Minister came into the Dáil old age pensioners have died off.  They have waited month after month and year after year, for somebody to come to their aid.  Surely we will not let another decade pass until we can say to them: &ldquo;Here is an allowance that will give you a reasonable standard of living and we will improve it as the cost of living goes up.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In 1963&mdash;I have not the figures for 1964&mdash;national income stood at £677 million.  The old age pension in 1963 was 35/-.  In 1957 national income was £469 million and the old age pension was 25/-.  Between 1957 and 1963 national income increased by 50 per cent but the old age pensioner got only 40 per cent.  Therefore, on cost of living figures, social welfare recipients have been cheated; and on national income figures they have been left behind.  Yet the Minister drags in some phrase to the effect that when the economic growth is sufficient we <Col N="79" /> will do more for them.  Between 1957 and 1963 the gross national product increased by 43 per cent.  But the old age pensioner did not get 43 per cent. Therefore, as far as the cost of living is concerned, as far as national income is concerned and as far as the gross national product is concerned, this Government have not done the right thing by the old age pensioners, the widows, the sick and the unemployed.</P>
    <P>What is the policy of the Government in respect of these people?  There was not tremendous mention of them in the two programmes for economic expansion.  It is true they are not productive, that they do not toil or manufacture. But it is also true that they are our responsibility.  I do not think anybody in this House would object if a Minister for Finance came in and said: &ldquo;We want at least that amount of money from this sort of tax to give to these people.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance is getting £15 million per year out of the turnover tax.  These people we are concerned about did not get their fair proportion of it.  It can be given to this, that and the other section, but these people have to lag behind.</P>
    <P>Our motion draws the attention of the Dáil&mdash;and, we hope, of the Minister&mdash;to the undeniable fact that there has been an increase in prices.  This makes it extremely difficult for certain people to live.  I have no hesitation in saying that some of these people die of malnutrition.  There is a notion among some of the back benchers of Fianna Fáil that these payments are not supposed to be complete allowances but should be supplemented by allowances from other sources such as local authorities.  The Minister knows that such is not the case.  Others believe that because old age pensioners have a son married in Canada, Britain or elsewhere, that such people have responsibility for them.  They have a certain amount of responsibility for them, but that does not operate in practice.  In many cases it cannot operate because the young man with his wife and family, no matter where he is working, may find it difficult&mdash;despite what the Minister for <Col N="80" /> Transport and Power says&mdash;to provide for them all.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we ask that there should be an examination and a review of this whole question of social welfare. The Minister taunts us by asking: &ldquo;Where do you get the money from?&rdquo; Every Minister in this Government is spending money for which there will be no provision until the next Budget. When a Minister for Agriculture, a Minister for Transport and Power or a Minister for Defence embarks on new projects, he brings his Estimate to the Dáil for £1 million or £2 million, but in doing so he does not tell the Dáil or the people how he will get the money to pay for it.  Similarly during election time, the Fianna Fáil Party promised many things&mdash;I am not objecting to the promises they made&mdash; but they never told the people they intended to impose a turnover tax. They want us to behave as they would not behave, as they will not behave, even though they are members of the Government and responsible for expenditure and the collection of money.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, an unanswerable case for this review of social welfare services which the Labour Party members call for.  There is an exhortation now by members of the Government that in view of the circumstances in which we find ourselves, hardships must be borne.  I suggest that if there are hardships, the burden should be borne by other than those who are mentioned in this motion.  If there is a burden to be borne by way of expenditure, that burden should be placed on the backs of those best able to bear it.  I suggest that the turnover tax was a burden that should not have been placed on people who could ill afford to pay anything extra for their foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>I conclude by reminding the House again that, even by Fianna Fáil standards, even by the standards which the Minister lays down for increases in social welfare, he and the Government have failed.  They have failed to live up to their responsibility and they are ignoring the fact that 250,000 of our people have a very low standard of living.  I, therefore, ask the House, and ask even the members of the Fianna <Col N="81" /> Fáil Party, to vote for this motion because it draws attention to the fact that there are hardships, that prices have increased and that there is a case for a review of the whole system.  It is no more than what the members of the Fianna Fáil Party at the Árd Fheis last week asked the Minister to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally the wording of the motion appeals to me because I have made it my life's work to help these people.  In fact I think I can claim that the increases the disabled have got over the past few years are largely due to my agitation here.  They got four increases in four years, whereas they got no increases in the previous six years and they got five shillings last week, due to a motion I was instrumental in passing.  The last seven increases in social benefits were not taken into account by the Dublin Corporation for differential rents, due to my motion, whereas before that they were.  Therefor I helped those people considerably.</P>
      <P>I am still willing to do all I can for the people mentioned in the motion but I can say from my experience since I came into this House, that these motions are not so much intended to help those people as to be a stick with which to beat the Government. Whether we like it or not, it is the wherewithal that counts, not the words. The great difficulty is getting the money and when you try to get the money, you make enemies of somebody.  Then the Opposition sharpen their knife to get it in as far as they can between the shoulder blades of the Government every time they try to get a penny to help those people.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances, how can I support this motion?  There have been marches and attacks on the Government due to the turnover tax.  Now we are told there is not enough money to pay increases to all the people employed by the Government.  Is it the suggestion that there should be no further taxation and that these people should be paid only six per cent? There probably will be increased taxation&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but these people employed by the Government will have to get their 12 per cent increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the fact that in order <Col N="82" /> to save thousands of workers from being unemployed, the Government have been compelled to bring forward a motion here to subsidise employers up to 50 per cent of the surcharge imposed by the British Government.  It will be seen that the Government have other problems besides the old age pensioner.  There is the problem of paying their employees the 12 per cent, the problem of keeping thousands of workers employed, and various other problems, including demands from certain lobbies.  It does not matter what the Government try to get money for, the Opposition will use their knife because somebody must pay and the Opposition would want to be on the side of those who pay.  That has been the practice since I came here.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition were genuine, they would organise a joint deputation to the Minister for Finance and make suggestions.  They would commit themselves to voting for certain taxation. Instead of that, the Opposition say they will vote for tax but they never say who is to be taxed because naturally their idea is to be on the side of all groups, including any group that may be taxed.  That is good politics, but how can we accept a motion like that as genuine?</P>
    <P>The Government have a tough job. They have the dirty job of trying to get the money.  The Opposition have the easy job of promising something in the bush.  However, if the Government give only half a crown once a year to the old age pensioner, it is of much more value to him than four times that amount in the bush&mdash;in other words, something that may never happen.</P>
    <P>Let us say there is a change of Government.  I said myself a number of times I would not mind a change of Government because I would like to see everybody finding out these people who have been making all the attacks and making all the promises.  The Labour Party who were returned recently in Britain made promises but they did not say before the election there would be an increase in income tax, an increase of 6d. in the price of petrol and that all employees would <Col N="83" /> have to pay an increase of 1/9d. in the case of females, and 2/- in the case of males.</P>
    <P>If there were a change of Government here tomorrow, those who now want the blood of the Fianna Fáil Party would want the blood of the present Opposition in three months' time.  The Opposition want to have all the groups on their side.  Therefore they will not mention what particular group should be taxed.  No one could be blamed for being sceptical.  I am all for any attempt to give the old age pensioners an increase of 5/- or 10/- but if the Opposition want it also it is not sincere for them to criticise the imposition of a tax to raise the required amount.  I hope that, when the next Budget comes, they will get another increase. That, at least, will be something in hand and it will be much more satisfactory than all the political gimmicks which are, in my opinion, shadow and not substance.</P>

      <P>I had no intention of intervening in this debate and I should not do so now, were it not for the points made by the various speakers supporting the motion.  Their guns were trained on the plight of the old age pensioners.  I would ask them now to do an about turn and try to eradicate the cause which, they state in their motion, is the steep rise in the cost of living.  Economists tell us that when income outpaces productivity, inflation follows, and inflation is the cause of poverty.  In other words, the rising cost of living is the cause of the poverty of those like the old age pensioners in receipt of fixed incomes. Income has outpaced productivity in recent years and we have not heard one protest all the time.  One speaker stated we should not argue about what was given in the past; our problem now is to put some bread upon the old age pensioner's table.  I want to protest against the action of those who are taking the bread off the old <Col N="84" /> age pensioner's table.  I give the small farmer's point of view, the point of view of the man who is producing most of the wealth of this country and, when that increased productivity occurs, it is other sections who reap the benefit.</P>
      <P>The bacon industry has been very much in the news in recent months. The cost of building a certain type of house six years ago was £3,000; today the same house costs £3,500.  I do not know where to lay the blame, whether at the feet of the manufacturer, the builders' provider or the employee in the building industry but the fact remains that today only six houses can be built where seven houses were built six years ago, with a consequential increase in the rent of the poor aged pensioner.  Take the ordinary motor car.  I have one in the forecourt here which cost £1,000 two years ago.  It has gone rusty.  I have a similar make of car at home in my backyard.  It is rustproof.  It did not cost anything like £1,000 30 years ago.  Indeed, that is four times what I paid for the car in my backyard.</P>
      <P>We produced wheat 15 years ago and we got £4 per barrel.  Today we get £3 10s. for a much superior quality. Eggs are cheaper than they were at any time in the past 20 years.  As far as the farmer is concerned, he is putting food on the old age pensioner's table at much lower prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be wrong, but he said I should go on a joint deputation to the Minister for Finance.  There was an old character named &ldquo;Gabby Hayes&rdquo; and he used to tell about how he captured 12 Indians by surrounding them.  Maybe Deputy Sherwin surrounded the Government and showed them how it could be done.  It is all very like the nonsense we get from people who write to the papers&mdash;I am not now referring to the letter to which Deputy Corish referred&mdash;usually finishing off by asking what are the Labour Party doing about it, whatever the &ldquo;it&rdquo; happens to be.  I have a letter here signed &ldquo;Old Age Pensioner&rdquo; from somewhere in Drogheda.  This pensioner asks what are we doing or what are we not doing about the old age pensioners.  I suggest to the writer that he would be much better off if he approached Deputy Faulkner and the Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Aiken, and asked them what they are doing.  They are the people who are in a position to deal with this matter of increases and not people like us who are doing our best and getting very little assistance in our efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in what I am about to say I intend nothing personal.  I have a great respect for the Minister's Department and for the Minister, though he may not think so.  Within his restricted limits, he is doing what he can.  I should like to point out, however, that the Taoiseach in reply to a question of mine when the turnover tax was introduced and it was announced there would be an increase of 2/6 to assistance groups, with effect from 1st November of that year, had the answer, as he always has the answer; I asked him what about the benefit sections and he said that where the assistance sections were entitled to 2/6, he believed the <Col N="87" /> benefit sections were entitled to double that.  They got 5/- from 4th January. The benefit section got 5/- from 4th January but the assistance section in the last Budget got 2/6.  The benefits section got nothing.  Does this type of logic only work in one way, that when it becomes logical no longer, it is in order for him to change, to take a different line?</P>
    <P>This question of people living on social welfare benefits and social welfare assistance has to be faced by this House.  I am prepared to give the Minister any proof he may desire that in this city and in every town and village there are old people who are too proud to beg and too poor to pay for the necessaries of life and who are slowly dying.  They are people who have not had a new suit, a pair of boots, or any new clothing for years.  Sometimes, when they become desperate, they approach somebody like myself in public life to see if we can do something for them with the local authorities. It is shocking that they have to do that.  If the Minister wants to, he can check with any of the charitable organisations in the city and find out to whom they give most of their assistance. He will find, as I did, that it has to be given to these unfortunate recipients of the assistance given by his Department.</P>
    <P>It is quite easy to say that there has been this percentage increase and that percentage increase but those of us who live with our feet on the ground and realise what the situation is can see in the country and in this city the difference in prices now compared with what they were a few years ago.  There is no point in the Minister saying: &ldquo;We gave a percentage increase which was more than the increase in the cost of living.&rdquo;  Deputy Corish put his finger on the matter.  There must be a basic rate on which ordinary people can live in ordinary frugal comfort.  I referred in my opening speech to the comparison between pensions in 1909 and now.  We have now got a contributory old age pension.  That was a great thing to introduce and an excellent idea.  I <Col N="88" /> would not say one word against that particular scheme except that the farm labourer in 1909 was able to get for himself from a non-contributory pension one half his week's wages and if he was married he received an amount equal to his full week's wages, which was 10/- a week.  At present the contributory old age pensioner gets one-third of a farm worker's wages for himself, or slightly less, and if he is married he gets 60 per cent, so that even the contributory pension falls far short of the basis on which the original pension was based.</P>
    <P>No matter from what angle we look at it, we can say that the whole question of social welfare benefits and social welfare assistance has been sadly neglected.  The small farmer who has a bad farm and who now has a valuation put on it, if he has no stamps, or if he had stamps and was unfortunate enough to stop getting stamps for one reason or another&mdash;perhaps because he acquired the farm&mdash;by the time he reaches the age of 60 and has no qualifying stamps, will get no con-contributory pension.  In 1909 he could have an income from the farm equal to a farm worker's wages and still get the full pension but at present if he has more than £3 a week he gets nothing.  It goes right down to the full pension, he will only have a fraction of what a farm worker can earn.  Surely this must make an impression on the Minister.  If he did not know before that that was the situation he must say to himself: &ldquo;There is something wrong with this, we cannot be going backwards. If it was right to do that in 1909 it cannot be right to give such small amounts now in relation to wages.&rdquo; Yet the Minister asks: &ldquo;Why did Deputy Tully not say it was 37/6d instead of 35/-?&rdquo; That seemed to be the main point of his argument which I think was rather a stupid one.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the little green book, S.W.4, which is an excellent production but the next time the Minister is adjusting the rates in the middle of the year, would he ensure that his Department issues leaves for the book which are the same size and not like this?  It is only a small point <Col N="89" /> but he will appreciate it is something that could be easily dealt with and a great aid to those who have to plough through them.</P>
    <P>Whether or not there is going to be an increase in taxation, as was suggested by one of the speakers, for the purpose of finding the extra money is a decision which the Government must make and whether or not there will be an increase in the turnover tax for the same reason is a decision which the Government must take, but I want to throw back in the Government's face the allegation that the Labour Party have been voting against increases for those people.  I want to tell the Minister, and I have repeated it again and again, and so have all of us on these benches, that if the Government are prepared to earmark a certain sum of money and say that it is going to be applied for the relief of those on social welfare benefits and social welfare assistance, then they will get any support they want from the Labour Party to see that that amount of money is voted, provided, and I assume it will be, the tax is put on in a fair way.  I want to assure the Minister, however, that if the Government decide to raise a certain amount of money and try to throw out the sprat that there will be a few shillings in it for the old age pensioners, in order to get something passed as they did before, that will not wash.</P>
    <P>The whole question of social welfare <Col N="90" /> benefits and assistance came to be discussed under this motion. We introduced it, as it was pointed out, some years ago.  The Minister thought he was making a good point by saying it was not one which we introduced last week.  If I was the Minister I would be ashamed to say that because the motion was gaining strength on the Order Paper and the arguments in favour of it are 100 times stronger now than when the motion was first put down.  The Minister may have overlooked that point when he was speaking and criticising us for discussing a motion which he said had nearly been two years on the Order Paper. Things were bad two years ago for these people but now they are a whole lot worse.  The answer to all this lies with the Government.  The Government may decide that the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans, the unemployed man, and the sick man or woman, are entitled to a fair deal. If they offer to give them a fair deal they will find no opposition either inside or outside this House but if they continue with their stingy methods of dealing with them, where they will give nothing except what they have to give to whitewash themselves and in order to give the impression that they are catering for them, then they will continue to get opposition from the Labour Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  I do not, I suppose, have to tell the House that this is a Private Member's Bill and that it does not represent Labour Party policy.  It is my own personal production. The Labour Party accept no responsibility for it whatsoever: the individuals may have their own views on it.</P>
      <P>I think I should, at a very early stage, try to make clear what the Bill does not propose to do.  The Bill does not propose to prohibit the sale of tobacco; it does not propose to prevent people from smoking cigarettes if they wish to do so.  It is an enabling Bill which would give to the Minister for Health authority to take action in certain circumstances in regard to the sale and advertisement of cigarettes in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable that a Bill of this kind should be introduced to the House, whatever its chances of being passed, because, at this particular point, it is important that the public should be made aware of the fact that there is a very wide consensus of scientific and medical opinion in the world which holds that there are grave dangers associated with the smoking of cigarettes. It is particularly difficult to try to get acceptance of this idea in view of the fact that in Britain the cigarette smokers are rated at something like <Col N="93" /> three-quarters of the population: as far as I can gather, three out of four persons there tend to smoke.  It is generally held by authorities, whom I could quote, that the ratio is much the same here.  There is quite clearly, therefore, a very substantial volume of opinion which will not like any restriction whatsoever on indulgence in their addiction, the smoking of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>The various rationalisations which have been set up by people who favour the continuation of smoking cigarettes &mdash;who wish to suppress or to play down the case made by scientists and medical people, after the most careful examination&mdash;are very powerful.  I believe that the most powerful rationalising influence which most people addicted or habituated to smoking cigarettes depend on is the very expensive, very clever and, at the same time, I believe, very misleading and dishonest advertising campaign carried out in all the media of communication&mdash;radio, television, public hoardings and, in particular, the newspaper. The average person who is addicted to cigarette smoking depends on this continuous exhortation by the tobacco companies&mdash;in their own interests&mdash;for his continuation in a habit which he has been told is a most dangerous one and, from the point of view of his health, a most damaging one.</P>
    <P>The case against cigarette smoking is largely directed at present against its likelihood of causing lung cancer.  An equally good case has been made against cigarettes as being the cause of a very high incidence of coronary heart failure and of chronic bronchitis, both of these affecting relatively young people&mdash;middle-aged people in their most productive years when they are most needed by their families.</P>
    <P>Although there are other diseases said to be influenced by cigarette smoking, the three major diseases with which I am concerned are lung cancer, coronary heart diseases and acute and chronic bronchitis.  They are all disabling, and in certain circumstances killing, diseases for which cigarettes are responsible.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this legislation <Col N="94" /> being promoted by me is unnecessarily restrictive.  On that I would simply answer there are very many precedents for this kind of legislation, precedents, in particular, in our own licensing and traffic laws and, as I will show later on, in our Health Act.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £6,666,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1965, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice in the Supplementary Estimate that there is a very substantial amount required for the calf heifer scheme&mdash;£2 million more than the original estimate.  It was only £405,000, estimated to be spent in the financial year when this Estimate came before us, and now the Minister requires, in addition to the £405,000, a further £2,550,000.  I think the explanation should be available.  When the Estimate was before the House some time ago, it should have been possible to indicate more precisely the amount that would be required during the current year for this scheme.  Possibly, it will be explained that when this Estimate was being prepared, it was expected that only people engaged in agriculture and farming would be applying, and qualifying, for these grants.  Instead of that, we have a situation where a number of financiers with money stacked away have decided <Col N="95" /> that it is good business to cash in on this scheme.  The result is they are able to get the full benefit of this scheme, whereas the ordinary farmers cannot.</P>
      <P>Let us take the example of an ordinary farmer who already has ten cows.  If he increases his stock to 11, and then has 11 calves, he still gets only one grant.  If these financiers, who never had cattle and know nothing about cattle, get 11 heifers, they will get 11 grants.  That is one explanation for the very large amount now required, that is, it is required for people who have devised ways and means of qualifying for payments of these grants. It was stated earlier in the House that the average payment here is only two heifers per claimant.  It is difficult to understand that.  I know of some moneyed people who have bought large stocks of heifers in order to get £15 apiece and qualify for this payment.</P>
      <P>I would be interested to learn from the Minister at this stage if he would give us a clearer picture regarding the amount of money now required.  It is such a colossal increase on the original Estimate that there must be some concrete explanation for it.  The experts, in making out the Estimate, should not have been so much astray in forecasting what the demand by the Department was likely to be during the current year.  I feel a claim has come in here from sources which were not anticipated by our experts in the Department when this Estimate was originally being prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still feel it is not the right type of scheme to increase our livestock population here.  I believe this £2,550,000 should be available instead to the smaller farmer who is the backbone of livestock production, who is engaged full-time in the business of livestock rearing, and who, consequently, should have the benefit of this.  It is well known, and I think the Minister will not contradict me, that quite a number of people who will qualify once for payment of these subsidies will not seek to qualify again, because, having harvested this windfall in the form of this subsidy, they will not be able to <Col N="96" /> qualify again.  Take one of these financiers who buys 100 heifers and qualifies then for the payment of 100 subsidies of £15 each.  That man will probably finish with that business as soon as the calves are reared and those cattle disposed of, unless he decides to go into business under another name and qualifies again for payment of subsidies on another 100 heifers.</P>
    <P>The ordinary small farmer is not able to adopt these devices and his chances of qualifying even for one grant of £15 are very remote, if he is fully stocked already.  He has not the accommodation and the means to enable him to increase his stock even by one heifer per annum in order to get the extra £15.  There is a limit to the expansion he is capable of.  On the other hand, the man who is engaged full-time and is producing ten or 20 calves per annum would benefit better from a scheme which would make the subsidy payable in respect of each calf instead of in respect of each extra heifer brought into calf production.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister specifically why there is such a big difference between the additional sum required in the current year and the original Estimate of only £405,000.  I think it demands a lot of explanation. It reminds me of the time the financiers were going into wheat production and availing of the subsidies.  There was one company called the Pure Ice and Cold Storage Company who had something like 1,000 acres of land under wheat. There was a period of very bad weather during that time and they lost a lot, but they were prepared to speculate and put their money into this business of wheat production about which they knew nothing.  This heifer scheme seems an easier way of getting money handy, that is, to buy 100 heifers and qualify for 100 calves after keeping them the requisite period and then disposing of them as beef.  I think that is the result that is envisaged, but in the long run I do not think it will be of a great advantage to our livestock population or to the people who are the backbone of that industry. They are the people who should have this money within their reach and they should be able to qualify by having the <Col N="97" /> money payable on calves instead of this calved heifer scheme.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that additional moneys are required for different sections of the Department but we must face up to the fact that a substantial part of the Estimate is for increased salaries and allowances owing to the manner in which the Government are running the country in relation to the cost of living and to the reduction in the value of earnings and salaries.  The farm building scheme is one that deserves to be encouraged because in this modern age, housing accommodation in every farm, particularly in the small farms, is very important.  There is a great lack of housing accommodation amongst our smaller farmers, a lack of accommodation suitable for providing a shelter for livestock and the produce of the farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks were directed only to the part of the Estimate providing an extra £1 million for the Farm Building Scheme.  I welcome that.  I feel that many farms need extra accommodation.  In many instances you see nothing but a farm dwellinghouse with a tiny shed attached, instead of a good farmyard shed in which a good deal of work could be done in times of inclement weather, and which could be used for the storage of crops.  An extension of that scheme will show advantages when it comes to putting the surplus on the market or making feeding available for our livestock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considering that the British Government have not put a tax on our livestock, every effort should be made to increase our cattle population as rapidly as possible.  The heifer subsidy scheme is not the best way to do that and I believe the calf subsidy scheme would enable our livestock population to be increased more rapidly.  A greater <Col N="98" /> number of farmers would then be in on the effort to increase their livestock. This is a very important matter for the economy at a time when our industrial exports must shoulder such a heavy burden.  Britain is our principal customer for our industrial and livestock exports and an increase in our livestock exports should enable us to offset the heavy burden imposed on our industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate for a few moments to welcome the subsidies.  Some of the previous speakers from the opposite benches have painted a false picture of the situation.  The last speaker mentioned the case of a farmer with 100 heifers who reared them until he got the subsidy and then sold them.  If such a man has 100 heifers and gets £15 each for them this year, he must have their progeny next year.  Deputy O'Donnell from Limerick mentioned that if you keep a calf for six or seven months, you should be paid a subsidy.  His experience should be the same as mine, that they sell all the calves in County Limerick.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>I know they should but they sell them.  I think the heifer scheme is a good scheme and has helped to increase cattle numbers very considerably.  That is what we wanted to do and that is the idea behind the subsidy.  The farmers down the country are asking where all the cattle are coming from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell said that we should be paid on the quality of our milk.  I am a member of a creamery committee and I know that you must have good quality milk, as you are paid on the butter fat content.  If you have poor quality milk, you will be found out.  You cannot supply any kind of milk you like.  He also said that those who employ modern methods of milking should get more for their milk but I think the people who go out and milk their cows by hand should be entitled to the same price as those who do it by machinery. Every cow byre in the country is up <Col N="99" /> to date now and it would be unfair to give an extra 2d. per gallon to those who have up-to-date machinery on their farms.</P>
    <P>The heifer scheme is a good scheme. It has been said that the small farmer cannot profit by it and, perhaps, the small farmer with four or five cows has not room for any more, but if he wants to hold his heifers, he will find that the price has gone up by £20 or £30 each.  Not so long ago the price for a heifer was £25; now it is £50.</P>
    <P>On the question of pig fattening stations, I think they are a very good proposition.  We have one in Thurles which is run in co-operation with the Irish Sugar Company and which lets out sows for our pig producers.  I have done the job myself.  They buy back the progeny.  You take in the animals, which are weighed, and you are paid the following day, and that is all is about it.  It is a great boon to the small farmers.  It makes it possible for every small farmer to have a sow, because the production of bonhams has become a good job now.  The days of feeding two pigs have gone. Of course there is some difficulty about finding the space, but so have the days of keeping two or three cows. One must work on a big scale nowadays. That is why the pig fattening stations are such good husbandry.  We have been well pleased with the price they pay for bonhams and with the elimination of difficulties for the producer.</P>
    <P>We had the speech of Deputy M.P. Murphy from West Cork. He suggested that a man producing an amount of milk should get top price for so many gallons and a lesser price for the balance.  How could one operate such a scheme?  I would never support it.  It would not help to increase milk production.  Even if one were to put a quota on, one would find it very difficult to work it.  The Minister certainly would.  You could have three or four farmers getting together to pool for a lorry to transport the milk and what is there to prevent a man who is overproducing putting some of his milk in with that of another farmer?</P>

Down the country, long ago, it used to be said that all the bright fellows went away and the duds stayed on the land.  It is heartening to note, therefore, that more money is being invested in improved advisory services, in the provision of better buildings.</P>
      <P>The county committee of agriculture in North Tipperary, of which I am a member, have appointed extra instructors because there is now a waiting list of farmers seeking advisory services. Farmers are now more than ever before availing of instructors to get planning advice and to get specialist knowledge in the matter of fertilisers.  They are getting more up to date, as Deputy J. Brennan said earlier.  He was perfectly right.</P>
      <P>As I have said, it is foolish to criticise the heifer grant scheme.  I do not represent the big ranchers, of whom there are few in North Tipperary.  We go in for tillage and milk production in a big way.  I intervened only to make the few points I have made.  It cannot happen, as has been suggested, that the man who has 100 heifers can get rid of them the following year as beef.  He cannot have it both ways.  He must have the hundred heifers in respect of which he was paid.</P>
      <P>I shall not delay the House any longer but should like to congratulate the Minister.  I have not done so already in public.  He is a good young man who did a good job in the Department of Justice and who will, I feel confident, do the same in the Department of Agriculture.  Most of the people making attacks on him are, I note, city people.  I do not care where a man comes from.  If he has ability to carry out his duties, he will do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We all, of course, welcome expenditure on agriculture in that we hope it will help to attain greater production.  I notice that the Minister, in his speech&mdash;I read it because I was not here&mdash;concentrated very largely on milk production and related that to beef.  I am with him there.  However, there is one problem we must face in this country and, in fact, in many other countries in the western hemisphere.  It is that costs of production are going up so steeply that milk production in itself is not as lucrative as it was and it is conceivable that we shall find ourselves in the not too distant future short of milk production and, consequently, of the by-products of milk.  In other words, we may find ourselves in the position where the creameries will be crying out for milk.</P>
      <P>The reason for that happening is the increasing difficulty of procuring labour because the standards of living in the dairy produce sphere are not as good as in the industrial arena.  The mainstay and the prop of our creameries have been the big farms.  I have noticed in my county recently that a few big farmers have gone out of milk production, due to a shortage of labour.  Those people do not want to continue to be slaves all the time and therefore are entering into other types of production, many of them going into beef production.</P>
      <P>That is why I noted at the beginning that the Minister related his remarks on milk production to the production of beef.  If he reads the papers assiduously, as I believe he does, he will have noticed that another market has appeared in Europe for beef&mdash;Spain. With its heavy tourist influx and its inability to produce the requisite amount of food for its own people and the tourists, Spain, which hitherto bought beef from South American sources, has been coming into the market increasingly because the South American sources have dried up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister, new to the job, has no immediate answer.  Is he satisfied that the heifer scheme, initiated to increase the production of milk, will help to produce the required amount <Col N="102" /> of beef for an expanding market? Before leaving this subject, I should like to draw his attention to the statement of Mr. A.J. O'Reilly the other day in regard to milk markets and the increasing potentials for the sale of milk and milk products in developing countries, not necessarily the new African States but the Arab States, where he, very wisely, has gone to look for markets.</P>
    <P>On the subject of milk, I should like to ask the Minister if he would consider reversing a decision of his predecessor which was responsible for a great deal of chaos among milk producers in my county.  For some reason, the Department of Agriculture, acting through the executive authority &mdash;the Minister&mdash;decided to do away with the creamery we had in Wexford. We had a very strong area in the south &mdash;where, I hasten to reassure the Minister, Fianna Fáil have a strong-hold&mdash;from which they sent cream to the creameries partially separated and were able to take the milk themselves for feeding purposes.  There was a very strong build-up of agricultural husbandry in that area.  It was organised and had been going on for a good many years.  I believe the origin of the thing was a letter written from New Zealand which put the fear of God into those who conduct our agricultural policy, with the result that the cream husbandry was washed out.  This has meant that a lot of people have got out of milk.  It has meant that in the creamery they were supplying, which is close to where I live, milk has been in short supply for a time.  The farmers were reluctant and were hanging back for a long time, waiting for the Minister to retaliate by withholding the grant from the creamery concerned.  There has been a good deal of confusion in the area and I do not know whether it has rectified itself yet or not.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister to look at the whole thing and see if he thinks it feasible, right and good for production to return to the original scheme.  I know he will encounter a certain amount of opposition from his own devoted officials in this matter who conceived it was out of touch and was <Col N="103" /> not the right thing to do.  However, I courteously point out it is the procedure adopted in France, where the dairying industry and the co-operative system are good, where milk production is strong, particularly in the south, and where the by-products are good as well.</P>
    <P>I now pass on to beef.  I have the feeling that the heifer scheme was intended to increase production.  I believe it did increase production, but I also believe it did not increase beef production at the rate necessary.  I can confidently assert that anybody who produces beef of good quality in this country is assured of a good and stable market, provided always that our officials and those who represent us in our embassies abroad look for such markets.  I base my statement on the facts that emerged from the discussions that took place recently at the European Regional Conference of the FAO and statements made at the World Conference by leading Ministers from the best agricultural producing countries, such as M. Pisani of France, Mr. Freeman of America and so on, that this market is there for the asking providing we produce the beef.  It is also the most reliable market, due to the fact that the population is growing at a phenomenal rate in South America and that export from this, one of the great beef producing areas, has now practically ceased.</P>
    <P>Some of my colleagues maintain we should have a calf subsidy, while others of them maintain we should continue the heifer subsidy.  Listening to Deputy Fanning, I thought he got a bit mixed up in his argument with regard to the question of the success or otherwise of the heifer subsidy in relation to the small farmer.  I suggest to the Minister: why could we not have both?  The Minister will appreciate, when he is long enough in the Department, it is obvious that the aim and object in this country should be to get the most rapid beef production we can.  It is a sure seller.  It will offset the great economic difficulties we face at the moment.  Many other countries face the same situation.  The only way you can <Col N="104" /> get that production is by a calf subsidy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy across the way mentioned farmers selling their calves on the dairy farms in Limerick.  It is a well-known fact that the dairy farmers in Limerick and South Tipperary breed calves, never give them a pint of milk but get rid of them as soon as they can.  They are purely and simply milk producers.  There is absolutely no reason why they should not be both, if you give a calf subsidy and encourage them to keep the calves for a certain period, that subsidy not to be paid until the calf has matured. If a reasonable subsidy is given, I guarantee the Minister he will get the production he wants.  That is what is essential for agricultural production to meet world conditions today.</P>
    <P>There is no use talking about agriculture and imagining Britain is the only agricultural market in the world. As long as the British continue their present efficiency payment system and the Germans, the other great buyers, continue their high rate of subsidy, those are not the only markets.  The markets are elsewhere, and it is necessary to look for them.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say a word on wheat.  I hope the Minister, who is new in the Department, is going to protect the farmers against the millers. In the county I come from, which is the premier wheat-growing county in Ireland, we have suffered from the millers and the system which they have operated over the past five or six years.  In the year in respect of which the Minister is asking for the subsidy it would have been far bigger but for what happened.  The system of the millers was simply this: to turn down <i>ad lib</i> everything they possibly could without the risk of a complete conflagration of the farmers and to buy wheat outside at a cheaper rate.  The world price of wheat was below our price.  It was depressed.  The Canadians and the Americans had enormous surpluses of wheat.  It was thrown on the market and could be bought for next to nothing.  That is what the millers were doing at the expense of the Irish farmers, unprotected by the Minister for Agriculture. <Col N="105" /> The Minister is now asking for a subsidy to clear them.  Suddenly the situation changed.  The Chinese, the Russians and other countries behind the Iron Curtain were short of food. They had to buy wheat or they would have starved.  The price went up and the millers could no longer buy cheap wheat outside Ireland.  They started to buy Irish wheat.  Overnight they accepted wheat they had turned down before.  This proves they were putting a quick one across the farmers, who were unprotected over the years.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Agriculture&mdash; he is new to the job&mdash;to take up the whole question of the millers in their relationship to the farmers and see that the farmers get fair play.  I unhesitatingly say here, as the representative of a constituency that grows wheat, that the farmers have been openly swindled by the millers over the years.  I know of many cases of people who sent two lots of wheat out of the same field to the same mill.  One of them was turned down with an enormously high rate of moisture while the other was passed as millable.  The first was sent when the world price of wheat had fallen and the millers were turning down wheat <i>ad lib,</i> but when they wanted to buy Irish wheat cheaply they could accept it as millable.  I am also aware of the fact&mdash;not in one case but in 20 cases&mdash; that wheat turned down by the Irish millers was milled and turned into first-class bread in Irish houses.  This shows that the Irish farmers have been totally exploited by this gang of financiers. Therefore, I ask the Minister now, and I am justified in doing so, to see that in future the millers will not be allowed to put it across the Irish farmers and to see to it that the farmers get the fair play to which they are entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>While a number of farmers have been treated generously by the millers, I want to agree with the last speaker that a number have been treated very badly.  We have had a similar experience in my constituency. Two loads of wheat grown under the same conditions go out of the same field One is accepted and the other rejected.  Then John Murphy brings the second load down again and gets it <Col N="106" /> accepted.  While the previous Minister for Agriculture met the farmers and did everything he could to remedy the position, there are certain loose ends to be tied up and I have no doubt that the Minister will go into this matter because it is most desirable that he should do so.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the position of dairy farmers in County Dublin.  They are finding it very hard to get labour. A friend of mine told me that in order to get labour in County Dublin, he has to pay at least £12 a week to each worker.  He is selling milk to the dairies here.  The County Dublin milk producer is in a different position from that of the dairy farmer down the country.  Whereas in the county about which the last Deputy spoke, it is only during the summer period they have milk production at all, in County Dublin our farmers have to feed their cattle the whole year round and feed them well or they will be prosecuted for selling milk deficient in fats.  I would ask the Minister to have a look into that problem.</P>
      <P>I was amused by some of the remarks made by Deputy Donegan.  He said that from the £6,666,000 being voted, the farmer would not get any direct benefit.  Let us deal, first of all, with the heifer scheme.  The original estimate was for something like £400,000.  It has gone up to £2,955,000. The Minister is asking for an additional sum of £2,550,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It represents a subsidy of £15 for 130,333 calves.  Is that not a direct subsidy to farmers?  I was surprised that, even on that count alone, the heifer scheme was criticised as being of no use.  As a result of this scheme, we have 130,333 more calves in the country and, as the Minister rightly stated, small farmers with one or two cows will benefit by it, too.  If so many people had not benefited by the scheme, we would not be in the position in which, after scarcely a year, our calf population has gone up so much.  In most counties where the <Col N="107" /> scheme operates and where there are very few large ranches, surely the people who have benefited under this scheme are small farmers, having three or four cows, who have succeeded in getting another heifer or two.  If they have two, on average, it will be a great encouragement and it will show also that people are anxious to do something to increase their cattle numbers. I want to say to Deputy Donegan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is great importance attached to milk production but Deputy Donegan says the farmers get nothing from this Supplementary Estimate.  Does the farmer get nothing in respect of the improvement of livestock? Does he get nothing in respect of byres?  The farmers will not benefit at all, according to Deputy Donegan. I do not want to go into every detail, but under the Farm Building Scheme and water supply schemes, there is a sum of £100,000 provided.  Who will get that?  It is not for the South Africans or the Canadians.  It is the Irish farmer who will get that £100,000. Under the Land Project, an additional sum is being provided.</P>

Now Deputy <Col N="108" /> Donegan tells us across the floor of the House that the farmer will get nothing out of this.  The Minister for Agriculture is a very clever man and a shrewd accountant.  He will see that this will go direct to the farmers.  For the veterinary research scheme, a sum of £500,000 is provided.</P>

Will he tell them that he voted against the £2,500,000 for the relief of rates on agricultural land?  Deputy Donegan is a very intelligent fellow, but when he comes into the House and makes that statement, he must be challenged. I am sorry for delaying the Minister. He has sat here for a long time listening to various contributions.  I was very happy to hear him inviting Deputy M.P. Murphy out to see a poultry farm.

      <P>First of all, I should like to commend Deputy P.J. Burke's approach to this Supplementary Estimate. Secondly, I want to confess that I am surprised by the attitude of Fine Gael Deputies and others.  It is absurd to suggest that this £6,666,000 will not go directly to the benefit of our agriculture and for the good of our farmers. The vast proportion will go directly to the farmers in some shape or form and the remainder of it, as Deputy Burke pointed out, will be for the benefit of agriculture in a number of indirect ways.</P>
      <P>Supplementary Estimates of this sort are pretty well unavoidable in the agricultural field because it is very difficult to estimate in this particular field what the levels of production will be.  A great many factors enter into the picture.  It is very difficult to anticipate how successful any particular scheme will be.  It is very difficult to know whether or not farmers will take to a scheme and that governs the amount of money spent.  It is very difficult to prognosticate what will happen in the export markets and what prices we will get for our products.  It is wrong, therefore, to criticise the Minister for Finance, the Department of Agriculture, or anybody else, for the fact that it is difficult to estimate exactly what will be spent on agriculture under any particular heading in any particular year.  We do the best we can.  Inevitably, from time to time, the Minister has to come in here and look for supplementary amounts under one heading or another. It is unreal to suggest, as some have endeavoured to suggest, that this money will disappear down some boreen and that it will not go to the benefit of the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised and puzzled about the approach of Fine Gael Deputies to the heifer subsidy scheme.  I remember, of course, that when the targets in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> were published, Deputy Dillon derided the targets set for cattle numbers.  I have not got the exact quotation, but I am certain my recollection is correct: he poured scorn on the targets and on the whole concept.  He suggested the targets could not be achieved.  Now Fine Gael <Col N="110" /> Deputies are critical of the fact that far more will be spent on the scheme this year than was anticipated.  It may be that they are disappointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in cattle numbers is only 1.9 per cent. The Minister did not find money to keep up the numbers of the other cattle, apart from the heifers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that.  Deputy Dillon said this could not be achieved.  He made a typical speech and he laughed the whole thing to scorn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It looks now, judging by the success of the scheme, that these numbers will be reached.  Perhaps that is why Fine Gael are criticising, in a backhand sort of way, the success of the scheme.  The reason why we are looking for more money is because the scheme has been a fantastic success. It has been successful beyond what anybody in the Department anticipated. The scheme was planned on the basis that in the first year of operation it would cover about 20,000 heifers and cost £300,000.  There is one aspect of that to which I want to direct attention.  When the scheme was devised it was intended it should come into operation on 1st April, 1964. As Deputies know, it was brought into operation on 1st January, 1964, so that, apart from any particular buoyancy in the scheme itself, we had three months of 1963/64 which fell into 1964/65 and that accounts to some extent for the increase.  But the main cause for the increased expenditure is the big increase in the number of applications.  Instead of 20,000 heifers, the scheme will cover 190,000 heifers in the period to 31st March, 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument that it is the big farmers who will make the most of the scheme is just nonsense.  The figures are quite clear.  There are 95,000 applications covering 190,000 heifers. The average per application, therefore, is two heifers.  As I mentioned earlier, there are only seven people in the whole country out of a total of 95,000 applicants who have got more than <Col N="111" /> £750 under the scheme.  All counties are participating more or less on the same level but, if there is anything in it, if any counties have an edge and are generating something more than the average in regard to applications, then these counties are Roscommon, Longford, Cavan, Monaghan, Galway, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal.  These are not rancher counties.  These are essentially small farming areas.  No matter what yardstick is applied to the scheme, it is clear the small farmer is the principal beneficiary under the scheme and the number of large grants under the scheme is infinitesimal.  Anyway, I am not worried if there are some large grants.  If we think it is worthwhile to pay £15 to get an extra heifer into our cattle population, then, from the point of view of the agricultural economy as a whole, it does not really matter who gets that £15 so long as the economy gets the extra heifer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister mind if I asked a question?  Does he think it is a good thing that 26,400 older cattle, 39,900 between two and three years old, and 10,000 under one year old should show a decline in the number of cattle?  These are the three figures for reductions.</P>

They have asked if it does not appear that because we have had such a great flood of applications this year there is a possibility they will now dry up and we will not have anything like the same numbers in future.  As far as I can see and estimate, there is no basis for any such suggestion.  I mentioned that roughly 190,000 heifers will be covered by the scheme between now and the 31st March next.  As far as we can anticipate, between cows and heifers, the numbers will go up by approximately 100,000 this year as a result of this scheme.  As a direct result of this scheme we will have an extra 100,000 heifers.  All the indications are that that figure will be more or less the same the year after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only reason I am coming in here looking for this couple of million pounds is because the scheme has been so successful.  I am sorry to say that I cannot escape the conclusion that its very success is to some extent rankling Fine Gael Deputies bearing in mind what Deputy Dillon said about this whole idea of securing this target of output of cattle of one and half million by 1970.  I want to describe briefly for Deputies how we think this heifer scheme is now fitting into the over-all target position as set out in the Brown Book.  As Deputies know the Brown Book postulates an output of cattle of one and a half millions by 1970.  That involves getting our cow numbers to somewhere in the region of 1,700,000 by 1968.  In order to get the numbers up to that figure it postulates an increase of 400,000 in our cow numbers as compared with 1963.  That, as you can establish from a mathematical calculation, means an average increase of 75,000 a year over the years 1963-68.  The Brown Book stipulates an average increase of 75,000 cows per year.  As far as we can see the calved heifer subsidy scheme has resulted, in its first year, in an increase of somewhere in the region of 100,000, so that to my mind it is fitting in very adequately <Col N="113" /> with the over-all projection for the livestock industry.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies said they did not like the scheme and would prefer to see a calf subsidy.  I cannot understand why an intelligent Deputy like Deputy O'Donnell should come along at this stage, when we have clear-cut evidence of the success of the scheme, and say he does not like this particular scheme and would have preferred another. This whole matter was gone into minutely and carefully by the experts of my Department before the calved heifer scheme was introduced and the idea of a calf subsidy was examined very carefully indeed.  In the end it was decided that we should have a heifer scheme rather than a calf subsidy scheme.  In Britain they can have a calf scheme because they have records of a certain type.  We have no records of calves but fortunately, because of the BTE scheme, we have records of cows and that was probably one of the main factors in favour of the heifer scheme. Added to this, as Deputies know, the manner in which our calves are distributed around the country is very complex and complicated and the opinion at the time, when the scheme was being introduced, was that it would be technically very difficult, if not impossible, to administer a calf scheme and when you had this ready-made machinery there to operate a heifer scheme, it was the obvious thing to do, and in the result it has proved itself to be so successful.</P>
    <P>Most of the debate has of course centred around this question of the heifer scheme but some Deputies did raise other questions.  I cannot understand Deputy O'Donnell's suggestion that the full 2d a gallon is not being passed on to the milk producers in some creamery areas with which he is familiar.  Admittedly in any area creamery costs of production go up marginally but this could not possibly account for anything like the ½d mentioned by him.  If Deputy O'Donnell wishes to give us some more information about that we will have it examined but as far as I know this 2d a gallon on milk was passed on directly for the benefit of the milk producer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> It was interesting to see the clash of opinion between Deputy M.P. Murphy and Deputy T. O'Donnell on this question of pigs.  Deputy Murphy's fears in this respect are groundless.  He seemed to suggest that large scale fattening operations are a bad thing for the small farmer because ultimately they will be competing with them for a restricted market.  I think that is unreal.  I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that the large scale, efficient fattening operation is a good thing and there will always be a place side by side with that operation for the small farmer who is keeping limited stocks.  It is the job of the Pigs and Bacon Commission to see to it that whatever the output achieved, from whatever source, is sold.  One of the heartening factors in the whole general situation at present is the success which both the Pigs and Bacon Commission and An Bord Bainne are achieving in export markets.  Both of them are tackling their task very energetically and efficiently and achieving substantial results.</P>
    <P>As we can see from the figures, we are providing a great deal of money to ensure that our products are disposed of abroad to the best possible advantage.  That of course will continue, and indeed the operations of An Bord Bainne and the Pigs and Bacon Commission will have to be expanded from time to time as necessary to ensure that the output of both the dairying and pig industries is satisfactorily disposed of.  Deputy Michael Murphy also asked if I would look at this question of island milk and of procuring for the islanders concerned the benefit of the milk subsidy.  I undertake that I will look into this problem again.  I understand that some investigations have been made in regard to the matter, as to the extent of the milk production on these islands and so on and I will look at it.  I want to make this general statement in passing that I promise to look at any proposal and examine any scheme or suggestion which any Deputy puts up to me about any matters in the agricultural field because in this House amongst the Deputies there is a great wealth of knowledge and experience in agricultural <Col N="115" /> matters and it would be very foolish of me, as Minister for Agriculture, not to avail of that knowledge and information to the greatest extent possible.  I will be happy at any time to examine any proposal or suggestion put to me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde spoke about beef and the long-term prospects for beef. I think we are proceeding along the right lines in this regard.  The general policy for the livestock industry is fairly well laid down.  I mentioned how we hope to increase cow numbers and the output of cattle within the context of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> Deputies will have seen that we have arranged for the importation of French Charollais and Dutch Friesians, and we shall continue to endeavour by experimentation of this sort to improve the quality of our cattle in every possible way. There is a disease risk involved and we must take the most stringent precautions. In this way we propose to introduce here any strain which we think will be of value to our cattle industry, and which will help to improve the output of that industry.</P>
    <P>We also hope to consideraby expand the campaign for the eradication of disease.  As rural Deputies know, farmers lose a great deal of livestock through disease of one sort or another. Now that the bovine tuberculosis eradication campaign is coming to an end we hope to use the same machinery to launch an attack on contagious abortion and generally do everything we can to ensure an improvement in livestock output by eradicating diseases of one sort or another.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, our policy will be to try to improve grass husbandry, and to have the same amount of land carrying greater numbers of cattle. There is scope for great improvement here.  By and large, I think our policy in regard to the cattle industry is proceeding satisfactorily, and should bring us satisfactory results by the time we get to 1970 and see how we have fared in the matter of achieving our targets.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde referred to the question of cream in County Wexford. <Col N="116" /> The problem there is quite simple.  For some considerable time my Department tolerated this business of farm separating of cream, but it is a bad thing.  It is not modern farming; it is not good practice.  In France, which Deputy Esmonde mentioned, my information is that the dairy people have a very big grouse because this unhygienic practice is permitted.  I will undertake to look at the matter again, but looking at it superficially it seems to me inevitable that something would be done about it, and that we could not contemplate allowing the practice to continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. Brennan and Deputy Michael Murphy mentioned the small farmers, and in particular the small farmers in the western areas and along the western seaboard.  I think there is general recognition of the fact that many of our small farms are not viable economic units, and do not provide the people who live and work on them with an adequate or satisfactory standard of living.  There is quite a job to be done in that regard.  In this connection I should like to mention the pilot areas now established in 12 counties.  The experiments which are being carried out in those areas will have a great bearing on the steps we can take to bring up the income level of the small farmer.  Again, of course, one of the most effective ways of tackling the problem of increasing the income of the small farmers is to have a greater use and exploitation of our advisory services.  Probably the biggest single task that has to be undertaken at present is to get the farmers, particularly in the areas which have been referred to, to make more use of the existing advisory services and to avail of them to the full.  If we can get that done, we will be making a very big contribution to the problems of the small farmers.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Control of Manufactures Bill, 1964: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill proposes to set a date, 1st January 1968, from which the Control of Manufactures legislation will no longer operate, and in the meantime, to make some amendment of the law as it stands.</P>
      <P>The restrictions imposed by the Control of Manufactures Acts were considerably relaxed by the Industrial Development (Encouragement of External Investment) Act, 1958.  In addition to providing that certain small concerns would be exempted from the Control of Manufactures Acts, the 1958 Act enabled companies to be established whose business was primarily for export, without requiring that their shareholdings, <i>et cetera,</i> should be in accordance with the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Acts.  This modification was in the interest of encouraging and facilitating external capital investment in the establishment of industrial undertakings in this country having the development of exports as their prime objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> envisages that for the purpose of further facilitating increased investment in manufacturing industry the remaining restrictions on external investment in industry in this country will be removed by the repeal of the Control of Manufactures legislation during the currency of the Programme. This Bill gives effect to this by setting <Col N="118" /> the date from which the Control of Manufactures legislation will cease to operate.  The date of 1st January 1968 has been selected as a reasonable one to give industrialists time to adapt themselves to the new situation.</P>
    <P>Pending the final repeal of the Control of Manufactures Acts from the 1st January, 1968, as proposed in section 2, the Bill also proposes, in section 1, that companies which have been continuously engaged in manufacture here for five years before the passing of this Bill, should be free from any restrictions imposed by the Control of Manufactures Acts.  The same will apply to subsidiaries of such companies provided the latter hold more than half the issued shares and at least two-thirds of the voting shares.</P>
    <P>During the passage of the 1958 Act, the question was raised as to why the Control of Manufactures Acts were not then being entirely repealed.  The view was taken, however, that the time was not then ripe for total repeal and that there was still a case for retention of certain provisions of the Acts in the interest of firms which had come into existence because of the assurance given by the Acts.  That was six years ago, however, and since then very much has happened on the industrial front&mdash;in particular, the development of a very strong international movement towards the freeing of trade in manufactured commodities.  I am saying that in the full knowledge of the imposition of the British import charge which in recent times is accepted as likely to be of a temporary nature.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware there has been in progress for some time past a very searching investigation by the Committee on Industrial Organisation of the ability of Irish industry to survive in freer trade conditions and substantial financial aid has been provided to enable industry to make the necessary adaptations to enable it to do so. The Government consider that in addition to the adaptation grants already made available manufacturing firms which have been operating here for five years or more should, in anticipation of the repeal of the Control of Manufactures legislation on 1st <Col N="119" /> January, 1968, be given the opportunity, should they need it, of seeking external capital and &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; to strengthen further their competitive position.  Section 1 of the Bill provides this opportunity.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite an extraordinary situation that the Party whose economic policy was one of Sinn Féin over all the years, and who were most insistent that our development here should be an entirely Irish one, should now be in the position of introducing this legislation.  They were the people who said we would do just as well if every ship were at the bottom of the sea and who sought to build walls around us.  Because we on this side of the House held more liberal views, we were accused of being free traders, the implication being that, with free trade, you put people out of employment here.</P>
      <P>It is apparent, in modern situations, that this Government have got to be more free in the approach to foreign investment.  It is a pity that this was not done after the war.  Holland and many of the countries ravaged by all the dreadful calamities of the Second World War built themselves up on external investment.  During all that time we were turning away the moneys that could have built up this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you relate profits to the amount of money paid in labour in any industry, day by day and year by year, the situation becomes far more apparent that profit, in relation to the amount of wages paid to the people who do the work, is very small.  We here in Ireland have, perhaps, what no other country in Europe has, namely, a plentiful supply of excellent labour.  There is no doubt that the quality of labour here is quite extraordinary.  I had a certain experience in relation to a small industry recently, a branch industry of the parent industry in Britain. A director of this industry said to me that they were getting a far better production per person here in Ireland.  I said I could not understand <Col N="120" /> it because this industry is so small in relation to the parent company in Britain.  He replied: &ldquo;It is very easy to find out why.  All one has to do is to sit in his car outside the gates at 6 o'clock and to note the quality of the boys and girls who come out.&rdquo; They are healthier people and are mentally more alert.  In every way, they are preferable to people who, for several generations, have lived in a smoky city in industrial Britain and have been working in, perhaps, not as good conditions as are now enjoyed.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have always felt that a balanced approach to the investment of outside moneys here was a very important factor in our development and particularly in our industrial development.  From that point of view, we welcome this Bill. On the other hand, there is a great difference between the operation of coming in here and setting up a new industry and that of buying all or the greater portion of the shares of an old-established industry.</P>
    <P>We feel that old-established industries here should be protected as we move towards the Common Market: we do not seem to be moving as fast now as we were.  As we move towards a freer trade situation, these old-established industries should be given &mdash;as they are being given at the moment&mdash;time in which to develop and encouragement in the shape of industrial grants and, indeed, capital, if required.  The snag about this situation is that, with 1968 approaching&mdash; and the date of the Bill becoming law approaching&mdash;foreign combines and foreign companies will come here with a view to buying out old-established businesses.  This is something that, perhaps, has not been fully considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government would do well to see if they can protect these older industries, particularly if they are public companies, from bids which they may find themselves unable to refuse.  The directors of a public company are honour bound to do for their shareholders what in their opinion is best economically: their first duty is to the shareholders.  Where a continuance of the old policy might mean <Col N="121" /> employment for Irishmen, with the purchase of the company in conditions of freer trade by an outside combine it might mean the extinguishing of employment.  This is something which we do not put up as a strong Opposition move against the Bill but we suggest that the Minister should, perhaps, consider this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>The provision whereby the general approach of the Bill would apply before 1968 to a company that had been carrying on a manufacturing process here for five years or more is, I think, only fair.  It is proof that we do not regard a person as a &ldquo;runner&rdquo; until he has been here 25 or 30 years. It is a fair approach and it is justified. We welcome the move of the Government towards the enlightenment which, if they had it in the years after the war, would have seen far greater industrial expansion than that which really came about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to this Bill.  It is a short Bill and the opening statement was brief.  I do not think anybody can forecast the effect of the entire repeal of the Control of Manufactures Acts.  I assume that this is another step in the movement towards free trade.  I also assume that if ever we become members of the EEC it will be one of the conditions of our membership that we shall have no control over the investment of capital by foreigners in this country.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether or not it would have been possible or desirable to have these Acts repealed after the war.  I am still not satisfied that a certain amount of protection is not needed for the type of industry mentioned by Deputy Donegan, the old-established industry.  How one can legislate for particular industries, I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, like Deputy Donegan, have other industries in mind which certainly will not be able to withstand the impact of free trade generally.  Under the Control of Manufactures Act, 1958, as the Minister said, companies were unable to establish here whose businesses were <Col N="122" /> primarily for export.  We assume this Bill will allow these people to invest here in established factories under the Act of 1958 and will be free to go into competition in the home market. Could the Minister say whether I am correct in assuming that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them are bound by agreements they have made with An Foras Tionscal or where grants have been advanced to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister is satisfied that the terms of An Foras Tionscal can be implemented, so to speak.  There will be lots of try-outs.  This means that many of these industries will be in competition with the home producer and on the home market, and that can cause an effect.  This may be the general policy of the Government, the decontrolling of investment by industrialists or manufacturers in this country, but it still may be, as I have said, a requirement for membership of the EEC.</P>
      <P>It has been recognised in recent times, apart from the imposition of the 15 per cent surcharge by the British Government, that many changes would be necessary in the movement towards free trade.  A lot of things are being done on the assumption that we will be members of the EEC by 1970.  I do not think this is as big a certainty as it was before the election in Great Britain and not the same certainty it was when General de Gaulle decided that, unless Britain accepted the conditions, she could not become a member.  So, strong as the feeling may be in the present British Government against EEC and the conditions to be imposed in its general policy, I think it must be recognised that in recent years the previous British Government, the Conservative Government, faced the same difficulties, even though they wanted to become members, in gaining admission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty and the difficulty of the Government in all these things.  It is pure speculation as to whether we will become members of the EEC.  It is not as speculative that we are going into an era of free trade, whether in the EEC, in some <Col N="123" /> other organisation or within a general world policy.  I think we can be a little too drastic in our preparation for free trade.  I believe if we are to go into a group such as the EEC, there should be a greater understanding of Irish problems, and particularly Irish industrial problems.  No matter what our criticism may be of Governments, no matter what our criticism of ourselves may be, the State is relatively young and it is even younger still in the wide establishment of industry.</P>
    <P>I do not think we are big enough.  I certainly do not think we are strong enough that we should willy-nilly throw up all the protection we have.  I am not suggesting this measure will do that in any great way.  It still is a proposal which, to me, means that there will be some reprecussions for certain types of industry, perhaps the type of industry I complained about last week, the industry that did not avail of the generous assistance available from Government sources.</P>
    <P>Whilst we do not disapprove of this Bill, I do not think that either the Minister or any other member of the House can say what its real effect will be.  We trust in any case that it will not have any bad effect on Irish industry and on industrial employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this Bill is overdue.  In fact, it was our view that, when the amending Act was going through in 1958, it should have gone as far as this goes now.  As the Minister said in introducing the measure, this Bill has been introduced six years after the 1958 Bill.  During the time that has elapsed, considerable changes have taken place, in particular, the general movement towards freer trade. The Government apparently have now decided that the restrictions which have been in operation may be relaxed as from 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, one aspect of this matter which I think should receive some attention.  In that regard, what has happened in the case of the sales of land to foreigners is an example and, to some extent, a warning.  I believe there is a clear distinction between <Col N="124" /> newly-established factories or undertakings, or newly-established industries where foreign capital is involved, and the acquisition by foreigners of already established Irish firms, businesses or industries, as the case may be.  So far as factories which are established <i>de novo</i> are concerned, the investment here by outsiders of capital and know-how in the establishment of these undertakings is a development which everyone welcomes.  It is one which has been agreed policy for a considerable time.  Both inter-Party Governments, and certainly the second one, went to considerable lengths to attract external capital and external know-how in order to build up still further industrial development and to secure both capital and know-how in order to supplement the capital available here or to provide, where know-how was not available, the technical knowledge and skill for the purpose of starting particular industries, so that whatever deficiencies existed in the industrial arm would be made up in so far as the attraction of outside capital or know-how could do so.</P>
    <P>There is no conflict of opinion on any side of the House on that aspect of industrial development or on the attraction of outside capital or outside know-how in order to expand or develop industry.  I believe that, in some cases anyway, there may be a danger in the future of take-over bids by outside industries in the case of firms already established here or industrial undertakings already functioning, or in the case of old-established industries.  It is possible that in certain cases an advantage might accrue to a particular industry, if it were the subject of a take-over bid and in certain circumstances solid grounds would justify such action.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if take-over bids become the pattern of development as applied to existing industrial concerns or old-established firms, certain risks might eventuate which would act as a note of warning as to the general development of such a trend.  I believe that in this measure, before it is passed through the Committee Stage, power might be taken by way of amendment to ensure that the <Col N="125" /> Minister and the Government had adequate resources available and adequate powers to prevent undesirable extension of take-over bids and the undesirable acquisition by outside interests of old-established concerns.</P>
    <P>There may be certain cases where it might be in the interest of the particular firm, for financial, technical or other reasons, to be taken over by outside interests, perhaps, through the death or retirement of existing directors. For a variety of reasons it is possible to imagine circumstances in which the take-over might be in the interests of a firm.  On the other hand, there are dangers and risks to the economy in the wholesale application of the take-over procedure, even in circumstances in which the shares of a company are held by family interests and because of the death or sale by an individual member of that company of his or her interests to an outside concern ultimate control or an important shareholding in the particular concern might be acquired by outside interests, and be contrary to the interests of the company, the country and the other shareholders.</P>
    <P>In these cases, circumstances might operate to the extent to which it would be necessary for the Minister or the Government to have power to intervene and prevent such a development if it appeared to be growing to the extent to which it has been found necessary to take power in the recent Land Bill by way of amendment to ensure that powers existed to prevent the sale of land to outside interests. This situation has not yet developed here but one of the greatest defects in the Acts now being repealed was that there were so many loopholes and evasions and as many methods of circumventing the Control of Manufactures Act as there were factories which operated under it.</P>
    <P>I believe that the changes we are making are desirable but I think it is important that we ensure that power is available to prevent wholesale acquisition by means of the take-over procedure which may be a possibility. It may well be that it will not develop to anything like the extent which some people fear but circumstances might <Col N="126" /> arise in which it would be contrary to the interests of those concerned and those employed in these concerns that they should be acquired by outside industrialists.  Subject to that warning and to certain amendments which we may introduce on the Committee Stage, we believe the proposals in the Bill will find general approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though this Bill is a relatively small one, its consequences could be wider than we anticipate at the present time.  Everybody is satisfied that many Irish industries could not survive in a free market and that, without protection, a number of them will cease to exist.  The Minister's idea in this legislation is to bring in external investment.  Whilst we all realise that the emphasis on external investment is growing, I thought that a wind of change had been blowing in recent times, that this idea of depending to a large extent on external investment was not bearing fruit and that we were going to try to do for ourselves what others were not going to do for us.  I cannot see why we should not be more self-dependent and more confident in the resources of our own country.</P>
      <P>Sufficient capital could be provided at home for the development of soundly-based economic projects without bringing in capital from abroad and also bringing with it the management and control of these particular industries.  This is definitely going to be the case in three years' time when it is proposed to repeal the controls entirely.  I do not see why we should not try, with the available know-how we have, to establish the type of industries we expect foreigners to establish for us.  We have had experience of foreigners coming in here, we have welcomed them, but we have been disappointed to find that a number of the industries so established have been failures.  In respect of my own constituency, I sincerely hope that a number of recently established industries will survive.  It is all very well to import know-how if we have not got it but we should keep control of our own business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as competition in export <Col N="127" /> markets is concerned, and the finding of new export markets for our goods, we are well represented abroad.  We have lavish embassies, with numerous personnel in many cases, and I suggest that these should be better utilised to find export outlets for goods manufactured here.  As time goes on, I am becoming more convinced that industries established here with the aid of Irish capital and Irish people, utilising raw materials produced in Ireland, are much more likely to survive than industries established by foreign industrialists who, we must all agree, have no great love for us.  From the cold, businesslike point of view, they come in here to invest their capital to make a profit for themselves.</P>
    <P>I am inclining towards the view held by an increasing number of people that we must do for ourselves what others cannot be expected to do.  I am not too enamoured of the idea of bringing in outside capital.  We have had that policy since the Minister established Foras Tionscal and it has not achieved the results we then anticipated.  We all like free trade, but only last year we had a question in the House as to why the contract for the supply of pens and pencils to Government offices in Dublin was given to an outside firm. The reason given by the Minister was that the lowest tender had been accepted.  We found that that firm was able to send in a lower tender even though they had to pay a duty in the neighbourhood of 40 per cent or 50 per cent.  Despite that duty, that heafty imposition, they were able to supply at a lower rate.  What will the position be when protection is wiped out altogether?</P>
    <P>It is all very well to favour free trade, as this measure does, but is it to be assumed that factories can be closed down which are giving reasonably good employment, reasonably good wages and good employment conditions?  This Bill will give scope to international firms to take over existing Irish firms and may lead to a position somewhat similar to what is happening in local trade where dishonest methods are being used to take over smaller competitors.  Everyone <Col N="128" /> knows what I am talking about.  We have supermarkets offering such items as biscuits, particularly cream crackers, at prices lower than they pay to the manufacturers.  Surely that is not honest trading.  In order to attract custom and give a false impression to the public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If people from abroad are free to come in, they can undersell Irish firms because any foreign firms which may be established may be subsidiaries of bigger companies abroad, very well able to carry losses over a number of years in order to wipe out local competition here.  Is not that directly related to the Bill we are discussing?  You could have a British or a German firm, free not only to export but to compete in the local market.  Naturally, they would undersell for a number of years until they had wiped out competition on the home market.  Then they could recoup themselves by increasing their prices.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a very big problem to resolve in this measure, which is aimed at making free trade here. Advantage could be taken of this Bill, by large combines from outside to undersell and wipe out local manufacturers. Our first duty in this House is to protect our own people as far as possible and I have offered these comments on this measure with a view to bringing the Minister's attention to our duty to try and ensure that this legislation will not work to the advantage of outsiders and the disadvantage of our own manufacturers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Bill has received such a measure of support from the main Opposition speakers.  Deputy Cosgrave said the Bill was overdue.  It is true that <Col N="129" /> during the passage of the 1958 Industrial Development (Encouragement of External Investment) Act, he made the point that the Act did not go far enough.  However, I do not agree with Deputy Donegan's suggestion that the Government have turned completely about face as far as their industrial development programme is concerned. Nobody will deny that were it not for the policy pursued from 1932 up to and immediately after the war, it would not have been possible to build industrial development as far as it has gone and consequently it would not have been possible to encourage outside investors to take advantage of the skills that had been built up here in the meantime.</P>
      <P>Were it not for that policy we would still be importing a great deal of the consumer goods now manufactured at home.  Deputy Donegan alleged that because legislation of this kind was not introduced immediately after the war, we lost the opportunity of attracting outside manufacturers, from West Germany and other devastated countries, after the war.  That is not true.  Even if it were, Deputy Donegan's Party had the opportunity in the three immediate post-war years to bring in such legislation and did not do so.</P>
      <P>In the 1932 and 1934 Acts, there was provision for the giving of new manufacture licences by the Minister for Industry and Commerce whereby a commodity not being manufactured in Ireland to a sufficient extent, and not likely to be manufactured, could be manufactured under a new manufacture licence without the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Act applying to a company whose majority of shares was held outside the country. Especially since 1958, the encouragement given by that Act for the establishment of outside industry, mainly for export purposes, has certainly not deterred in any way foreign industrial investment in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point that ought to be remembered.  With the movement towards freer trade and with the possibility that in six or seven years we might have complete freedom of movement of goods between one country and another, is it not better, if cheap <Col N="130" /> goods are to be manufactured and brought in here, that instead they be manufactured in our own country by our own labour?  That is a consideration that some Deputies may not have taken into account.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Cosgrave's point of the danger of take-over bids, I do not think this is the Bill on which an amendment such as he advocated should be considered.  This Bill will repeal the Control of Manufactures Acts, and, having done that, it will die. There will be no continuing provisions that will be required in the Act itself. I referred to the possible danger of take-over bids in this country on a number of occasions during and subsequent to the passing of the Companies Act, 1963.  At that time we had particular regard to the recommendations made in Britain by the Jenkins Committee, the Committee set up to examine the companies legislation in that country.  We decided that the volume, if any, of take-over bids in this country was not such as required to be dealt with under that Bill. Subsequent to the passing of that Act, I have adverted to the possibility of take-over bids affecting our industrial structure and growth.  Again I have said that up to the present, there seems to be in no danger that these take-over bids will in any way upset our industrial advance or prejudice Irish companies; but, if we see that danger arising, it will be possible, under the companies legislation, to have the matter properly dealt with.</P>

      <P>It would.  Deputy Corish mentioned that this Bill seems to be introduced in the light of our possible membership of EEC by 1970. That is partly true.  As the House is aware, the obligation of membership of EEC imposes on us acceptance of the right of establishment, that is, the right of people from the Member Countries to establish industries and other businesses in any one of the countries.  But it also envisages the free movement of goods&mdash;the fact we will in one way or another be facing free trade conditions by that time. <Col N="131" /> As I have said, if goods are to come in here without tariffs to compete with goods manufactured in our own country, it is better that we should create facilities whereby these goods can be manufactured in our own country. At the same time, we are not ignoring the desirability of ensuring that our own industries will be capable of meeting free trade competition.  That is the purpose of our efforts to induce our industries, by way of grants and other inducements, to build up their efficiency so they will be able to compete with goods brought freely in here.</P>
      <P>I do not think there was any other point made that requires any specific reference by me.  I want to say again I am glad the House has accepted the Bill in the spirit it has.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, 1964: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to confirm nine Orders made during 1963 under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957 and the Finance Act, 1962.  It is a statutory requirement that such Orders must be confirmed not later than the end of the calendar year following that in which they are made.</P>
      <P>The first of those Orders, No. 132, extended the scope of the customs duties on bars, rods, angles, shapes, sections, sheets and plates of iron or steel.  The Order imposed minimum specific rates as an alternative to the <i>ad valorem</i> rates except in the case of sheets and plates, which are subject only to <i>ad valorem</i> rates of duty. The duties provide protection for a range of rolled steel products manufactured at Haulbowline, Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next Order No 134, amended the customs duty on wood so as to bring within its scope certain planed or dressed boards and planks of soft wood.  In the reclassification of customs duties in the Brussels Nomenclature, <Col N="132" /> the duty on these boards and planks was inadvertently removed, and it is necessary to restore the duty for the protection of the home industry.</P>
    <P>The Order numbered 135 exempted tinplate from the scope of the duty on sheets and plates of iron and steel to which it had inadvertently become subject under the Brussels Nomenclature form of customs classification.</P>
    <P>The five Orders numbered 136, 137, 139, 140 and 141, were made in accordance with the recommendations of the Industrial Development Authority. The first of these, No. 136, reduced the minimum specific duty on drinking glasses, other than drinking glasses of crystal.  The next Order, No. 137, reduced the customs duty on wooden furniture.  The third Order, No. 139, reduced the customs duty on certain kinds of floor tiles.  Order No. 140 reduced the customs duty on certain textile floor coverings and the fifth Order, No. 141, reduced the <i>ad valorem</i> rates of customs duty on thread and ply-yarn of flax and on single yarn of flax in ball form.</P>
    <P>The last of the Orders for confirmation, No. 142, effected a second general reduction of 10 per cent in the level of industrial protective tariffs. This was in pursuance of the policy of providing an incentive to industry to re-adapt itself and to prepare for freer trading conditions.</P>
    <P>An explanatory memorandum has been circulated for the information of Deputies and deals in more detail with the Orders.  I shall be glad to give any further information which may be required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say, where duties are reduced or varied under the procedure of this legislation, is any investigation or scrutiny carried out by either the Prices Section or any other section of his Department as to the effect on prices?  In other words, is the effect of the variation of duty or the reduction, as the case may be, taken into account in considering price changes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us something about Order <Col N="133" /> No. 132 mentioned in his speech. This is in respect of the scope of customs duty on bars, rods angles, shapes, and so on.  I assume that the duty to be imposed is at the ordinary rate and includes the two ten per cent reductions.  As regards Order No. 134 and the rest of them, I assume this is to bring the goods back under the umbrella of protection which was inadvertently removed from them in recent times.  I suppose there is no necessity for the Minister to confirm what was said here about two weeks ago, that another reduction of ten per cent in the level of industrial protective tariffs is not anticipated next year.</P>
      <P>It seems a little peculiar that we are thinking in terms of the imposition of duties when a few minutes ago we were talking in terms of free trade and the decontrolling of investment by industrialists and others in this country. Frankly I am worried about the rate of the reduction of tariffs.  Maybe it was a good thing and a good excuse for the Government in their present circumstances that they found it necessary not to go ahead with the further reductions.  The first ten per cent and the second ten per cent did not make much difference to Irish industry but I would say the next ten per cent, irrespective of the 15 per cent surcharge, would have hit&mdash;I will not say a whole lot &mdash; a fair number of Irish industries.  Maybe, it was a bit premature for the Minister to tell us what will happen between now and 1970 but I do not think Irish industry and the workers should be made to suffer more than they need in anticipation of our going into EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again the Minister or anybody else cannot be quite certain what will happen but I assume in any case he will, over the next year or two, keep a close watch on the effect of the reduction of these tariffs on certain industries.  I do not think the Minister can just look at industry as a whole and tot up the number of employed in it and the amount of production.  He will have to have regard to individual industries in various parts of the country because the process of stripping ourselves of protection that was built up for so long and that was so necessary is very <Col N="134" /> severe over a short period of five or six years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Cosgrave's question as to whether the Prices Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce are consulted in regard to the effects of the tariff reductions, normally they are not.  In fact I do not think in any case they have been.  These tariff reductions are, as the House is aware, recommended by the Industrial Development Authority after a request made under the terms of our Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement. The Industrial Development Authority are bound to have regard to the effect the reduction requested or made would have on Irish industry and on employment in Irish industry.  Their terms of reference are specific.  Reasonable protection must continue to be given to Irish industry, at the same time providing for reasonable competition for imported goods.  In all cases a searching examination is carried out into the effects that any tariff reduction of this nature might have on Irish industry.  This examination usually goes on over a period of some months during which Irish industrialists, people concerned in the manufacture of the goods involved, are given ample opportunity to make whatever case they wish.</P>
      <P>The first question asked by Deputy Corish was in respect of Order No. 132 which imposes a minimum specific duty or an <i>ad valorem</i> rate on certain goods which Irish Steel are preparing to make.  At the moment that duty is in the main suspended until such time as Irish Steel goes into full production. The <i>ad valorem</i> rates apply only to sheets and plates but the specific rate is £30 per ton on other items.</P>

      <P>Tá an Bille seo á thabhairt isteach chun Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht), 1929 go 1959, a leasú agus a leathnú agus is é príomh-aidhm an Bhille na deontais éagsúla atá ar fáil faoi na hAchtanna sin a mhéadú.  Is mithid na deontais a ardú le go bhféadfaidh muintir na Gaeltachta leanúint ar aghaidh leis an obair tithíochta atá riachtanach.</P>
      <P>Tá obair mhór déanta cheana faoi na hAchtanna seo chun caighdeán na dtithe sa Ghaeltacht a fheabhsú ach tá go leor le déanamh fós sarar féidir bheith sásta.  I dteannta caighdeán maith cónaithe a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta féin, tá sé riachtanach go mbeidh ar chumas na ndaoine freastal ar an líon cuairteoirí a bhíonn, agus a bheidh feasta, ag teacht chun na Gaeltachta ag foghlaim na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Tabharfar faoi deara go bhfuiltear ar intinn na deontais mhéadaithe a luaitear sa Bhille a íoc amhail ó thosach Dheireadh Fómhair, 1963.  Is eol don Teach, ní foláir, go bhfuil deontais tithíochta na Roinne Rialtais Áitiúil ardaithe ón dáta céanna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá ar intinn agam leis an mBille seo freisin feabhas a chur ar Scéim na Seallaí Saoire a tugadh isteach don chéad uair nuair a ritheadh Acht na dTithe (Gaeltacht), 1959.  Cuimhneoidh na Teachtaí go raibh dhá chuspóir romhainn nuair a cuireadh tús leis an scéim sin, mar atá, saoráidí oiriúnacha cónaithe a chur ar fáil do chuairteoirí samhraidh ar mhian leo tréimhse saoire a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht agus deis ioncaim a sholáthar do na daoine sa Ghaeltacht a dhéanfadh freastal ar na cuairteoirí sin.  Is trua liom nár éirigh leis an scéim chomh maith agus a bhíomar ag súil leis ag an am sin.  Is cosúil gur mheas na daoine go raibh an deontas le haghaidh sealla saoire ro-bheag i gcomórtas le deontais eile na Roinne.  Ar an ábhar sin, tá i gceist sa Bhille seo an deontas sin a mhéadú de 50% agus tá súil agam go <Col N="138" /> mealfaidh sé sin tuilleadh daoine sa Ghaeltacht chun seallaí saoire a thógáil.</P>
    <P>Ag an am céanna, ceapaim anois go mba mhaith an rud é foráil nua a chur isteach sna hAchtanna chun a chur ar chumas dream daoine roinnt seallaí saoire a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht chun saoráidí cónaithe a chur ar fáil do chuairteoirí a bheadh ag foghlaim Gaeilge nó ag cur feabhais ar a gcuid Gaeilge.  Fé mar is eol don Teach, tá méadú an-mhór tagtha le roinnt bhlian anuas ar líon na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, go háirithe daltaí scoile a théann ann faoi scéim eile atá á riaradh ag mo Roinnse. Tá gá anois le tuilleadh socruithe cónaithe do na cuairteoirí sin agus sílim gur fiú Scéim na Seallaí Saoire a úsáid chuige sin.</P>
    <P>Tá ar intinn agam mar sin deontais a cheadú do choistí a bheadh aitheanta agam agus a bheadh sásta roinnt seallaí saoire a thógáil le chéile sa Ghaeltacht.  Bheadh i gceist agam an scéim seo a riaradh ar an mbealach céanna agus a oibrítear scéim na mbrúnna faoi na hAchtanna, agus ní tabharfaí aitheantas d'aon choiste faoin scéim muna mbeifí sásta go mbeadh leas na Gaeilge mar chuspóir acu.  Féadfaidh coistí lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht cur isteach ar dheontas faoin gcuid sin den Bhille agus bheadh fonn orm cuidiú le coistí iontaofa ar fud na tíre chun seallaí saoire a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht.  Ní cuirfear teorainn leis an méid seallaí a thógfaidh coiste ar bith agus beidh an deontas iníoctha i leith gach sealla a ceadófar.  Tá súil agam go gcuirfidh eagrais Ghaeilge, agus dreamanna eile a mbíonn baint acu le foghlaimeoirí a chur chun na Gaeltachta, suim sa scéim seo agus go mbainfidh siad feidhm as an gcúnamh ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge agus leis an nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá socrú á dhéanamh sa Bhille seo freisin chun a chur ar chumas mo Roinn-se an dara deontas tógála nó feabhsúcháin a dhiúltú i gcás duine a fuair deontas den tsort sin cheana i leith tí cónaithe eile, má fheictear gur ceart é sin a dhéanamh.  Ina thaobh sin, níl uaim ach a rá gurb é príomhchuspóir Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) <Col N="139" /> ná cóir cónaithe na ndaoine sa Ghaeltacht a fheabhsú.  Le tamall anuas tarlaíonn corr-chás anseo is ansiúd ina bhfaigheann duine deontas chun teach nua a thógáil nó chun feabhas a chur ar a theach cónaithe agus go ndíolann an duine sin an teach faoin tuaith a cheannach le isteach ar dheontas eile.  Mar atá ráite agam níl ach corr-chás i gceist agus ní chuirfeadh sé as dom marach baol a bheith ann go mbeadh na tithe á ndíol le daoine a bheadh ar bheagán Gaeilge agus a mbeadh fonn orthu teach faoin tuaith a cheannach le haghaidh saoire.  Cuirfidh an Bille ar mo chumas srian a chur le imeachtaí mar seo más léir gur gá é.</P>
    <P>Sin iad príomh-aidhmeanna agus príomhfhorálacha an Bhille seo. Cuirim faoi bhráid an Tí é lena bhreithniú agus molaim go nglacfar leis.  Mar a dubhras i dtosach, déanfaidh an Bille seo na deontais éagsúla a mhéadú.  Ní amháin go mbeidh na deontais ó Roinn na Gaeltachta níos aoirde ná mar a bhí ach beidh siad i bhfad níos mó ná deontais na Roinne Rialtais Áitiúil.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille acht sílim nach dtéann sé fada go leor.  Tá sé anois timpeall 35 bliain ó bhí an chéad Bhille dTithe (Gaeltacht) againn agus is oth liom a chloisint ón Aire go bhfuil mórán eile le déanamh i dtaobh tógáil tí san nGaeltacht.  Táimíd go léir ar aon aigne go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag dul i laghad agus go bhfuil líon na ndaoine ag laghdú go mór ann.  Ní dóigh liom go mbeadh sé thar ár gcumas sa Teach seo tithe oiriúnacha do chur ar fáil do na daoine atá fágtha san nGaeltacht.  Do réir Bille a ritheadh le déanaí, tugadh cead d'údaráis áitiúla chun tithe do thógaint saor in aisce d'fheilmeirí atá fé £5 luacháil dhlí na mbocht.  Mar sin, ba chóir go mbeimís i ndon tithe do thógaint saor in aisce don líon beag daoine atá ag maireachtáil go fóill san nGaeltacht agus ligint dóibh an caipiteal a aisíoch sa chíos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tugaim faoi deara go bhfuil údarás ag coistí seallaí a thógaint san nGaeltacht. <Col N="140" /> Ach cén fá go gcuirtear teora leis an méid seallaí a thógfadh duine príobháideach?  Tá súil agam nach gceadófar cearta dílsithe a phréamhú san nGaeltacht faoin alt seo.</P>
    <P>Arís, ní fíor a rá go dtugann na h-údaráis áitiúla deontas ar aon mhéid leis an méid a thugann Roinn na Gaeltachta mar tá a fhios againn go léir nach féidir le h-aon chlann maireachtáil go cuí san nGaeltacht gan imeacht leo chun obair bhreise d'fháil ar an gcoigríoch.  Is trua go n-áirítear maoin na ndaoine sin maidir leis an deontas atá le h-íoc ag na h-údaráis áitiúla.</P>
    <P>In ainneoin an méid atá ráite agam, cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo ach, fé mar adubhairt mé i dtosach, tá mé in amhras go dtéann sé fada go leor. An dtéann deontas an lae inniu níos faide i gcostas tógáil tí san nGaeltacht ná an deontas a tugadh i dtosach báire i mbliain 1929?</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh Bhille den tsaghas seo chun deontais a thabhairt le h-aghaidh tógáil tí agus seallaí sa Ghaeltacht.  D'éist mé leis an méid adubhairt an Teachta O'Donnell.  Is ceart a rá go raibh Aire le h-aghaidh na Gaeltachta ann nuair a bhí an Chomh-Rialtas i gcomhacht, trath a raibh an Teachta O'Donnell ina Aire Rialtais Áitiúil.  An tAire Gaeltachta a bhí ann an uair sin, dealbh a bhí ann.  Níor dhein sé tada faoi scéal na dtí.  Anois, tá an Teachta ag clamhsán nach dtéann an Bille seo fada go leor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faoin mBille seo, gheobhfaidh duine sa Ghaeltacht £550 ó Roinn na Gaeltachta agus annsan, má thugann an túdarás áitiúil punt ar phunt, beidh deontas suas le £1,100 le fáil le h-aghaidh teach gcúig seomraí.  Tá an deontas £1,100 sin i bhfad níos aoirde anois sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht ná mar a bhí sé agus is dual do mhuintir na h-áite sin é.  Tá gá mór leis mar tá i bhfad níos mó daoine óga ag tabhairt cuairt ar an nGaeltacht anois chun an Ghaeilge d'fhoghlaim ná riamh.  Tré árdú an deontais, is féidir uisce, agus áiseanna eile a chur ar fáil ins na tithe.  Sílim gur bhain muintir na Gaeltachta usáid <Col N="141" /> as na scéimeanna nua seo níos túisce le déannaí ná ins na blianta a ghabh tharainn.  Go dtí le déannaí, bhí, sé andheacair ag muintir na Fíor-Ghaeltachta nach raibh aon airgead ná aon mhaoin acu, dul isteach i siopa in áit ar bith agus áiseanna d'fháil.  Anois, tá árdú ar an deontas agus beidh na siopadóirí cinnte go mbeidh an t-airgead le fáil agus rachfaidh na scéimeanna ar aghaidh níos taipiúla.</P>
    <P>Molaim an tAire as ucht an Bhille agus na hoibre seo agus tá súil agam go rachfaidh an obair chun chinn bliain i ndhiaidh bliana.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only just now got a copy of the Minister's Bill.  I am interested in the section dealing with the erection of chalets in Gaeltacht areas.  I should like the Minister to tell us what type of committee would qualify for a grant in this connection.  In the South-West Cork constituency, we have the Gaeltacht in the Ballyvourney district which many children from outlying areas visit each year to learn or improve their knowledge of Irish.  The people of that area are giving great help to such children to acquire a fluent knowledge of the language.  The fact that children come in such numbers helps the economy of the district and I feel sure that the people of that area would be anxious to provide additional accommodation, if such grants were available to enable them to do so.  It is for that reason that I am anxious to know from the Minister what kind of group would qualify for such grants. Would the local guild of Muintir na Tíre, for example, or a development committee or a voluntary organisation, qualify?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, it is a scheme that could be utilised on the island of Cape Clear which is only seven miles from my home.  Each year a number of visitors go there during the summer months. There is probably no part of the country where a knowledge of Irish can be acquired as easily as it can be on Cape Clear, particularly in the eastern part of that island.  I should be interested in hearing the Minister detail the system under which such grants can be obtained, because we <Col N="142" /> are now in the latter part of the year, and possibly a number of people in the Gaeltacht areas would be interested in the grants.  I agree it is a great idea to provide this accommodation because the only way in which a fluent knowledge of the Irish language can be acquired is by going to the districts where it is the spoken language.  We all agree that these districts should get all assistance possible.  In view of the help such districts are to the language and the help they are to the local economy, I support this measure wholeheartedly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill so far as it goes, but it occurs to me in view of the fact that it is aimed at dealing with housing conditions in the poorer areas, where building costs are even higher than they are in the richer areas, the Bill should have gone further and given a more substantial increase.  However, it is a step in the right direction.  I want to make the point that the method of testing people's knowledge of Irish does not engender a love for the language, because it often happens that the family with the least Irish may come out best.  It oftens happens that children from neighbouring localities go to different schools and on many occasions, as the Minister knows, the rule is enforced that unless the children of the family are getting the £5 grant for speaking Irish, the family will not get a housing grant.  The Minister should remember that in many cases it is the fault, not of the children, but of the people in the schools who will not send them to be examined to get this Irish grant.  The Minister should take steps to ensure that so long as Irish is spoken in the household, this grant is paid.  The £5 grant should also be very carefully examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is that the people who come to us as inspectors of Irish speak some kind of lingo they learned around Mullingar, and they have the audacity to say that the people in the West do not know Irish.  They do not know what language we are talking, and we do not know what language they are talking.  I think when a man is sent to an area as an inspector, he <Col N="143" /> should be able to speak the dialect of that area.  Even a Donegal man would find it difficult in my area and that is bad enough, but then you have a man talking some kind of ráiméis, that can cause considerable trouble and has caused considerable trouble in the past.  In the appointment of inspectors, the question of the local dialect should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>When an inspector goes to a house where there are three or four children under the age of five or six years, those children will not talk to any stranger.  Any sane man knows that, and an inspector who says they cannot talk Irish is talking through his hat. He does not know whether they can speak Irish, English, Greek, Latin or Yiddish.  I know that when an appeal is made, the Minister is most reasonable, but some inspectors have not been reasonable, and I should like the Minister to look into the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Beidh rud éigin le rá agam ar ball i dtaobh an méid adúirt an Teachta Ó Domhnaill.  For Deputy Murphy's benefit, here is part of what I said in Irish.  I said: &ldquo;I propose to sanction grants to approved committees who would be prepared to erect numbers of chalets in the Gaeltacht. It is intended to operate this in the same manner as the existing scheme for hostels under the Acts, and a committee would not be approved for the purposes of the scheme unless it clearly aimed at the advancement of the Irish language.  Committees outside the Gaeltacht may apply for grants under this section of the Bill, and I would be glad to help trustworthy committees throughout the country to erect holiday chalets in the Gaeltacht.  No limit will be placed on the number of chalets which any committee may erect and the grant will be payable in respect of every chalet sanctioned.  I hope that Irish language organisations, and other groups who are associated with the sending of students to the Gaeltacht, will be interested in this scheme and will avail themselves of it for the benefit of the language and of the Gaeltacht.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> I want to say also for Deputy Murphy's benefit that I have no intention of bringing Billy Butlin to the Gaeltacht unless he is prepared to learn Irish, and unless his organisation are prepared to promote the Irish language there.  When I originally introduced grants for chalets in the Gaeltacht, I had certain definite objectives in mind.  I am sorry to say the scheme was not as successful as I had hoped it would be.  Perhaps that was the fault of some of those organisations that should have made better use of the provisions of the previous Housing (Gaeltacht) Act.  I am glad to say that now there is an increasing demand for these chalets.  We have at present 16 applications for grants for chalets which are being built.  Applications were slow to start.  They went well in Donegal.</P>
    <P>A great thing about these chalets in the Gaeltacht is that they provide a market for the small local man to supply milk, vegetables and other things to the people who come to the chalets.  I think this chalet scheme should be much more widely availed of in the Gaeltacht areas.  Perhaps under the original Act the grants were not big enough, and perhaps they were too restrictive.  Under this Bill we propose to give these new higher grants, and we also propose to make them available to organisations outside the Gaeltacht areas, so that it will be possible for bodies like Gael Linn, and other friends of the language, to go to a Gaeltacht area and enter into an agreement with the local farmers to take some land near the sea and to have chalets erected.</P>
    <P>So long as we are satisfied with the aims of these bodies, we will sanction the grants.  It is necessary for us to have that power because this could be a ready-made opportunity for people in the cities and elsewhere who have no interest in the language to take advantage of the scheme to erect chalets or seaside residences for summer holidays.  We are providing that we must be satisfied about the intentions of these people in the very same way as we provided under the former Act that we should be satisfied about the intentions of the committees <Col N="145" /> to erect bruanna for which they could get grants up to £5,000.</P>
    <P>The amount of money made by people who have erected some of these chalets by letting them during the summer months has been fantastic. The income that would be available from chalets, if our people in the Gaeltacht areas generally took advantage of the scheme, would be revolutionary in relation to their ordinary caighdeán or their ordinary living standards.  This, in my view, is one of the easiest and best ways to raise the economic income of people living in Gaeltacht areas, particularly those near the seas.  By virtue of their location the vast majority of the Gaeltacht areas are well situated from the point of view of scenic amenities and are close to the sea.  I feel enough use was not made of the provisions of the previous Act under which the erection of chalets could be undertaken by people in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>As a result of the increased grants made available by the present Bill there will probably be a vast expansion in the applications from the people in the Gaeltacht who can avail of these grants to help themselves and to help people outside who want to come to the Gaeltacht for the purpose of increasing their knowledge of the Irish language or perfecting their blas. There will be a new inducement there and we expect much grater activity under this amending provision.</P>
    <P>I can well understand Deputy Leneghan's difficulty because, when the Order was made defining the limits of the Gaeltacht area&mdash;it was brought in by a then colleague of his in North Mayo&mdash;certain areas were written in that should not have been included. Areas which were English speaking were brought in under that Order for political purposes.  These areas should have been excluded under the definitions laid down; that is what gave rise to difficulties in North Mayo.  Generally speaking, in the Gaeltacht areas, if there is difficulty about Scéim an Cúig Phúnt or any other Gaeltacht scheme and if there is a suggestion as Deputy Leneghan said, that some inspectors with a southern blas are <Col N="146" /> sent in who do not understand western Irish, I send in an inspector from my own Department to ensure that the people are not wrongfully deprived of the benefits of Scéim an Cúig Phúnt or any other Deontas that is available. When representations are made to me and I am satisfied there is a just cause for it, I have a separate inspection made by a new inspector.</P>
    <P>I should like Deputies to appreciate that this particular scheme is judged by inspectors from the Department of Education and not by inspectors from my Department.  Therefore, it cannot be suggested that we are in any way trying to differentiate between one type of dialect and another.  It is sufficient to say, as I have already said, that, if we think there is difficulty about blas and so on&mdash; though I do not think there is generally much difficulty in this field&mdash;we send a separate inspector.  It is true there are difficulties with the blas as between different parts of the country but that is true in every country.  Indeed, I always think of my first visit to Kilcar factory in Donegal, where Deputy P. O'Donnell comes from.  On hearing the Donegal blas for the first time, I had great difficulty with it.  As against that I should like to quote a story about an occasion once when I was in the tube at Piccadilly Circus in London. There was an official beside me speaking English with a Cockney accent and I could not understand what he was trying to say to me.  That is a difficulty of language.  By and large there is not such a great difficulty between north, south, east, and west here in our own language.  There are some local colloquialisms which one has to get used to but, generally speaking, a native speaker from Connemara will understand what native speakers from Donegal are saying once he gets used to the sharp accent of Donegal.</P>
    <P>This Bill very substantially increases the housing grants, improvements grants, water grants, bathroom grants and every type of grant payable under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts.  There is in the higher group of housing grants a very substantial difference between the new grants payable by <Col N="147" /> the Minister for Local Government and the grants payable by Roinn na Gaeltachta.  For instance, under this Bill there will be payable, for a five-roomed house in the Gaeltacht, a grant up to £100 more than is payable under the new Local Government scale; that is a very substantial difference. There has always been a differential and it is now increased as between the ordinary grants paid in the rest of the State and the grants payable for the Gaeltacht areas.  It is very important that we should maintain the differential as between the Gaeltacht areas and the rest of the country.  It is important that we should maintain these special grants now being provided to enable the people of the Gaeltacht to take full advantage of the tourist business by improving their houses.  We are giving them inspiration and incentives to go ahead: those who have not already taken advantage of the special housing legislation for the Gaeltacht can make full use of these new grants.</P>
