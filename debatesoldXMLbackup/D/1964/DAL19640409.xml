      <P>My only interest in this Estimate is in the booklet, and the omission of the name of Michael Collins from it.  I took part in the Civil War, and in the past 40 years I have avoided, so far as I possibly could, all discussion on that unfortunate and dreadful period in the history of this country.  Some of my closest friends in those 40 years were men who were opposed to Michael Collins in the Civil War, but there is common agreement on the stature and quality of that dead leader.  One aspect more than any other of Collins which aroused my youthful admiration was his extraordinary and surprising reserve of moral courage.  We all knew the other kind of courage he had.  We knew of his personal bravery.  I consider his real greatness lay in his great reserves of moral courage, and the manner in which he faced slander and misrepresentation.  That is a characteristic which is not usual in our people, and it was a sign of his greatness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who saw in recent weeks the British television film, Rebellion, which was shown on Telefís Éireann, saw many pictures of Collins.  One Collins we saw was the extroverted, gay soldier whom most people remember when they think of Collins, but we saw another Collins whose forehead was overshadowed by a great sadness. It was quite obvious to those of us who interested ourselves in the conditions of our country in that grave time, 40 years ago, that Collins bore a great burden, that he knew the part malice would play, but he did not think <Col N="1369" /> malice would follow him to the grave.</P>
    <P>However, that has been done in the production of this booklet by the Minister, or by someone.  They could not injure Collins because he is quite secure, but they could and did injure Ireland and the Irish people.  Those abroad, and particularly those in Britain, will say: &ldquo;How petty and how mean&rdquo;, and then they will say: &ldquo;How Irish&rdquo;.  That is the injury that has been done by this booklet.  The people of Britain know of Michael Collins, if they do not know of the Minister for External Affairs.  That is the injury that has been done, this most un-Irish lack of generosity which has been shown in this matter.</P>
    <P>I stood where Collins was shot some three weeks ago in the midst of some thousands of silent people and I wondered whether our 700 years of slavery had not left a deep mark on us, a mark that could result in the production of so regrettable a document as this.  The book is an excellent production technically and I congratulate the Minister and his Department on that aspect of it but the aspect which led to the name of Collins being wiped from its pages is a regrettable imputation on the honour of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the first stage of the debate on this Estimate, a few points were raised with which I think I should deal.  After the discussion we had here on Tuesday, I do not think I need deal with the questions raised about Cyprus but I should like to deal with the question of our emigrants in England and what we can do for them, if they get into trouble.  The fact is that there are fewer emigrants going to Britain in the last couple of years than used to go and we are all very proud of that. One of the reasons we have emigration &mdash;it is not the only reason&mdash;is that our cash incomes per head are less than in some parts of England and in some trades in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greater the burden we put on our people here, the harder it will be for us to reach the standard of cash incomes they have in Britain but anybody who is in reasonable employment <Col N="1370" /> here is much better off with less cash per week than he is in Britain.  That is well recognised, and all over Ireland we find people who have been in Britain and who are back working here at less than they would have if they went to work in Britain and worked overtime and earned bigger wages.  It is not true to say that we have no interest in the Irish who emigrated.  I wish the Deputies over there would stop talking; it is very difficult to deal with this matter and make oneself heard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister did not cover the microphone, perhaps we could hear him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not covered the microphone.  One of the things we must avoid in trying to help the emigrants in Britain is a lowering of their will to help themselves.  We are doing our best with the resources at our disposal in the Department of External Affairs to foster their will to help themselves.  For the past couple of years, we have an officer in our Embassy in London whose sole duty it is is to keep in touch with Irish organisations and Irish emigrants, to encourage them to organise self-help and also to organise cultural activities of an Irish character that would keep up their morale.</P>
      <P>We have had a growth in recent years in the number of organisations in London and elsewhere which are based on the Irish counties.  These centres of meeting help to keep former neighbours in Ireland together so that they know when one of their fellow workers gets into difficulty and are able to help him along.  I believe that is the proper way to deal with the matter, not only from the point of view of the Irish Exchequer but from the point of view of the emigrants themselves. That must be our aim, to do everything we can to increase the happiness of the emigrant who feels that he must stay in England rather than in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one place where we can help the Irish people is here in Ireland.  When a Government passes an Act to help any group of individuals, any type of individual in the country, they have <Col N="1371" /> to arrange that all persons with an equal claim, all persons of equal status shall have a right to draw equal amounts from the Exchequer.  It would be impossible for us to create such machinery in Britain without huge cost, to create machinery which would distribute sums of money to Irish emigrants living in that country.  They are scattered all over it.  Some of them are short of cash only for a week or two and at other times they have very big incomes.  How are we going to create another civil service in Britain that would follow the Irish wherever they went, to every corner of Britain and Scotland and ensure that whenever they made a claim, that claim would be investigated, the circumstances investigated and the claimant treated equally with other Irish applicants in other parts of Britain?</P>
    <P>The fact that this has not been done up to the present, the fact that it was not done by the Fianna Fáil Government over the years or by the Coalition Governments is in itself a <i>prima facie</i> case that there is no means of doing this effectively, of doing it economically from the point of view of the Exchequer and doing it effectively from the point of view of the morale of the emigrants.  All Governments have been ready to help anybody in need.  The journey is so short between here and Britain that I feel it is better for the Exchequer and for the individuals concerned, if an Irishman or an Irishwoman finds himself or herself in want in Britain or in danger of being in want, to return home where they will be treated as well as anybody else.</P>
    <P>I am glad the efforts of the officer in charge of organising Irish people in Britain have been very successful.  He has now been at that work for the past three or four years and very good results have come from it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello made a small point to which it is hardly worth replying. He said that President Sukarno came here to get the Irish Government to go neutralist.  That is just nonsense.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello is also anxious that we should make good use of Strasbourg. Deputies' meetings and Ministers' <Col N="1372" /> meetings in Strasbourg are as well attended by Irish representatives as they are by representatives of the other countries.  All the Parliamentary delegates who go from here are as active as other delegations.  I do not think I have ever missed a Minister's meeting.  Occasionally, I have spoken in the Assembly.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be a good practice for the representative of a small country always to insist on his right to address the Assembly.  It is difficult enough for the President of the Assembly to fit in the list of speakers that are on offer without stretching out the time of the meetings. I think that, by and large, it is reasonable that an Irish Minister should be expected to speak only in cases of real necessity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave spoke about putting some control on the age at which boys and girls go to Britain.  There is an age limit&mdash;16 years&mdash;under which children are not expected to go without the consent of their parents.  I do not think we can go any farther than that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the law.  It would be very difficult to carry out any law designed to keep young Irish people at home when we have such a free and wide Border between ourselves and the part of Ireland that Britain holds on to and when it is so easy to go to Britain.  We cannot do it in that way.</P>
      <P>It is much better, I think, to encourage these young people, through the schools, through the various Churches and by the speeches of public men to ask parents to encourage their children to stay at home.  We know that it is not necessity that drives all of them. It is not want of food, of clothes or of some pocket-money that drives some of these young people away.  It is the fact that they are not encouraged to stay at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1373" /> I feel they would be much better off at home until they come to a mature age and then let them make the decision for themselves as to whether they want to go abroad or stay at home.  There are a number of factors at work on them and one of the most important, I think, is that people denigrate the standard of life that is available here.  They demand that every person here should have the same number of pounds per week as anybody can earn in other countries. In that way, they excite the cupidity of these young people and many of them want to go off to make their fortune in a very short time.  When they go there, they find that fortunes are not to be made quite so easily. A number of them who were enticed to go abroad by this type of propaganda seize an opportunity of returning to Ireland or at least a good number of them do from time to time.</P>
    <P>I find I have answered the various points that were raised with the exception of one, that is, the question of the publication &ldquo;Facts About Ireland&rdquo;.  I can understand what the Deputies are at in raising a fuss about &ldquo;Facts About Ireland&rdquo;.  They remind me of a pup who burns his nose on the coal and then seizes and shakes an old brogue around the floor.  The &ldquo;Facts About Ireland&rdquo; is a very handy way for the Deputies to let off their anger and disappointment at the cracks they got on the nose from the people of Kildare and Cork.  The truth of the matter is that &ldquo;Facts About Ireland&rdquo; had been in circulation for at least six months before the Cork and Kildare by-elections and there was not a word about it.</P>
    <P>When the late President Kennedy came here last year, we found we could not get a handy <i>dossier</i> of facts for visiting journalists.  We printed large sections of this book &ldquo;Facts About Ireland&rdquo; and circulated it widely. There were something like 3,500 copies and it was word for word the same &ldquo;Facts About Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;and there was not a word about what was in it or out of it until the Opposition lost the two by-elections, not a word.  Then they come along here and make a <Col N="1374" /> fuss about &ldquo;Facts About Ireland&rdquo;, though they had an opportunity of raising the matter earlier.</P>

      <P>If there had been any objection then to the way in which the history section was treated, it could have been looked at.  I have no prejudice against Michael Collins&mdash; far from it.  It was not because of any personal antagonism, or hatred, or any motive of that kind, that his name was left out; it was the same motive as drove the people who produced this Saorstát Éireann Handbook to leave out all these names in the historical section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In &ldquo;Facts About Ireland&rdquo;, until you come to the year 1926, de Valera's name is not mentioned. Surely, if we were going to write any sort of detailed history about 1916, the establishment of the Dáil, the Black-and-Tan War, de Valera's name should be put in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it should, and so should Michael Collins's and Griffith's names be in, if we are writing in detail.  But we did not pretend to write any detailed history.  We followed the practice that was started in the Handbook of Saorstát Éireann. There is a chapter of 23 pages in this on Irish history and there is not one word about Collins or about Griffith. Of course, we could alter the pattern. <Col N="1375" /> I should be very glad, indeed, to think that the time has arrived when we can, without going into detail, acknowledge the work that was done during the Black and Tan War by all the people who later differed.  The difficulty, of course, about treatment of the Civil War period is well known, very well known, and we are lucky here, I think, in that we seem to have recovered more quickly from the effects of the Civil War, which was very bitter, than most countries which have suffered in the same way.  In many respects there is, I think, a keener memory of the civil war that occurred in the United States of America than there is of the civil war that occurred here.</P>
      <P>For my part, I am quite prepared to admit that the men who accepted the Treaty did so in good faith.  They thought they were doing the best they could for Ireland.  I did not agree with them.  I thought that Michael Collins, an excellent soldier and Minister for Finance, an excellent Director of Intelligence, had not evolved to the point of being an excellent statesman. His great error was, in my opinion, that he thought the whole nation could be brought to change its mind as quickly as a small group.  He did not realise that, once you get a vast number of people moving in one direction, if you start making changes then, you throw everything into confusion.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin said I owe a lot to Collins.  I was appointed as the Commandant General of the 4th Northern Division in February, 1921.  I am sure Michael Collins, and all the other members of the headquarters staff, had a hand in that.  I am sure, if Collins had disagreed, my name would not have gone to Cathal Brugha for appointment.  I appreciated the honour that was done to me in entrusting me with that Division.  It was no sinecure to be put in charge of that area of the country in February, 1921&mdash;no mere ribbon to stick in my coat&mdash;and I appreciated the honour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin referred, too, to another point in history at which I was again suggested by Michael Collins for an appointment in charge of a <Col N="1376" /> number of Northern Divisions.  That was late in 1922.  My name was agreed to by both sides.  I had been doing my utmost from the time the Treaty was signed to prevent a civil war.  I could never see the sense in having a civil war to decide whether or not we would go on fighting Britain.  I did not think that was the proper method of deciding.</P>
    <P>I thought we should face the situation as we found it.  The Treaty having been signed, what were we going to do? My idea was that the Army should keep together.  There was a demand in January, 1922, for an Army convention. I opposed it.  I opposed it after every member of the Executive had accepted it, and they were all there.  Collins was there, and Mulcahy, and MacEoin, and many others.  They agreed to having that convention in January.  I objected to it.  I said at the time that, if we had the convention, we would have an artificial division. There were those who would say that they believed Collins, given time, would ensure that the Constitution would not contain the Oath of Allegiance to the British King, a Governor General, and all the rest of it.  There were those who would disagree. My proposal was that we should wait and that we should keep together until we saw the Constitution. By keeping together we could apply moral pressure on those who were framing the Constitution to produce the kind of Constitution Collins said he would produce.</P>
    <P>There is no use now trying to throw the Collins cloak over the Fine Gael Party.  They are very remote from each other.  I was desperately sorry Collins was killed.  General Mulcahy has a letter from me which I wrote when Collins was killed.  I was then on the other side, having been attacked.  General Mulcahy got a letter from me expressing my regret that Collins had died.  I felt that Collins was about the only one who was strong enough to change the course upon which the Cumann na nGaedheal people had embarked at the time.  I felt he would not continue the Civil War once it became bogged down.  I believed he would call the Dáil <Col N="1377" /> together and let the members of the Dáil discuss how best to make peace between Irishmen.  It was not without some justification that I felt that way.</P>
    <P>I was very deeply involved in the Collins-de Valera pact.  It had broken down.  Harry Boland and the others were negotiating with a view to getting a pact but the negotiations had broken down.  I went to Collins.  I went to Griffith, to de Valera and to Brugha. I went to Liam Lynch and Rory O'Connor.  I went to General Mulcahy and Eoin O'Duffy.  To each one of them I appealed that the pact should be accepted.  We brought them together.  I invited them to a meeting we held in the Oak Room of the Mansion House.  Peadar Murney, Pat Lavery and I addressed the meeting, urging the acceptance of this pact election and that we try to work out our differences in a peaceful manner. We did succeed in getting Michael Collins to change his mind and to accept the principle that the number of candidates should be the same proportion as in the case of those who voted on the Treaty issue and that the Republican side and the pro-Treaty side should support the whole list.</P>
    <P>That is a long way back into history but what I want to prove is that this allegation that the booklet &ldquo;Facts About Ireland&rdquo; was influenced in any way by some hatred or bias I had against Michael Collins is completely and utterly unfounded.  I should be very glad indeed that the time had come when we could deal with this question objectively.  In recent years we tried &mdash;I think Deputy Dillon is aware of this; maybe he is not&mdash;to get a combined statement of historical fact agreed upon by the various Parties and we could not get it.  I should be very glad if we could get a history of the period from 1916 to 1926 which is the gap in this handbook and if we could have agreement on a factual statement of what happened.  It is not possible in a Government publication to have any evaluation of the persons involved, even to have the evaluation of Michael Collins that I have given here today.  It must be a factual statement.</P>
    <P>One of the omissions I regret in the <Col N="1378" /> booklet is the omission of a photograph of the First Dáil Cabinet.  The preparation of this publication was going on for three or four years; I had seen it in its proof form and I confess I did not miss the First Dáil at the time. I should like to see in this booklet a photograph of the first Cabinet when the State was established in 1919.  The way things are going, we shall probably need to have a new edition printed before long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course.  That correction will be made.  That photograph can be inserted, as long as there is agreement, as we got with Deputy MacEoin, that this State was not established just by a few words written in a British Act of Parliament but that it was established here in 1919 by the combined efforts of Irishmen.</P>
      <P>One of the excellent things in this booklet is the bibliography.  One of the things badly missed both in the Saorstát Éireann handbook and in the other booklet &ldquo;Ireland&mdash;an Introduction&rdquo; published in 1950 was a bibliography.  In the bibliography in &ldquo;Facts About Ireland&rdquo;, there must be about 15 books which deal in full detail with Michael Collins, Arthur Griffith and all the other people of that period.  That is our effort at a bibliography but I shall be very glad to get from those interested throughout the country suggestions for a bibliography. We have been trying to evolve a very good one in the Department of External Affairs because when visitors come here, we like to have a list of books to which we can refer them and from which they may pick out what interests them.  It was a great want in the Department and one which we filled as best we could with a roneo sheet but it is much better that it should be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter about which we should be careful.  We have one day of commemoration for all who fought for Ireland, that is, Easter Sunday.  If we were to have State functions in commemoration of one side or the other in the Civil War, I do not think it would add anything or add to our harmony.  Michael Collins had the status in the Black and Tan War of Director of Intelligence on the Headquarters Staff.  There was also Cathal Brugha, who was Minister for Defence and you have a lot of other names of men on the Staff and if we are to have a military ceremony for one, then we should have a number of them.  The easiest thing to do is to have the general commemoration of all who died for Ireland, fighting according to their lights, on Easter Sunday.</P>

      <P>I should like to deal, first, with the question of medals and special allowances, although the Pensions Estimate will not be moved until we have disposed of the Estimate on Defence. Perhaps I should give some figures for the benefit of Deputy MacEoin who dealt at some length with this question. I prepared a note and I think it will save time if I read it out, with the permission of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" /> Several Deputies spoke about what they regarded as the over-strict standards applied to the award of the Service (1917-1921) Medal.  Figures have been given before to show that the standards are far from being as severe as they are often represented to be, and I will now repeat them.  To date, more than 55,000 medals without bar have been awarded and fewer than 5,000 applications have been refused. That certainly does not indicate a severe standard.  Indeed, as Deputy MacEoin knows, it became clear some years ago that, at the outset, when no financial benefit attached to the medal, it was often awarded too easily, and that it why a system of re-investigation had to be introduced in 1957 where persons who had already been awarded medals applied for special allowances. But even here, figures show that there is no excessive severity.  In a recent 12 month period, more than 1,100 cases were re-investigated, and only in 50 of these was the medal held not to have been duly awarded.  I am sure that Deputy MacEoin would be the last to hold that special allowances should be awarded to persons whose entitlement to the medal was not reasonably established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Reasonably established&rdquo;&mdash;I will accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; I am at one with Deputy MacEoin on that.</P>
      <P>I say &ldquo;reasonably established&rdquo; because, contrary to what has been suggested, every effort is made to ensure that no arbitrary or capricious decision is taken against an applicant. All surviving battalion and company officers are approached, and if there are no company officers still alive, then any surviving Volunteer pensioners of the company are invited to verify.  As well, all available records are examined, such as the battalion and company rolls and the applicant's military service pensions file, if he applied for a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where there is conflicting evidence, it is meticulously put to all the officers, and an effort is then made to reach the fairest decision possible.  It is absolutely wrong to say that applications are refused just because an applicant <Col N="1385" /> is not listed on the company roll. All the time, medals are being awarded where there is substantial verification by the officers, even though the name is not on the roll.  It was suggested that verification forms are sent out to deceased officers.  That may happen in isolated instances, but once it is ascertained that an officer is dead, his name is taken off the list of those available for verification purposes.</P>
    <P>It is doubtful if any better system of investigation of medal applications can be devised.  I cannot see how a system such as Deputy MacEoin suggests would work&mdash;that the applicant should go before a district justice or judge to establish his entitlement.  Even if it were possible for the courts to handle work of this kind, how could they investigate cases satisfactorily or how could uniform standards be achieved?  Neither do I see any merit in Deputy Tully's suggestion about local liaison officers to help secure verification.  The Department has no difficulty in approaching the verifying officers.  The difficulty is more often in getting replies&mdash;possibly because the officer is not prepared to verify but at the same time, because of local considerations, unwilling to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I can only assure Deputies that the Department does its best to come to fair decisions, and appeals usually reach the Minister in the end.  The fact of the matter is that only cases in which applications are refused reach Deputies, and as I have shown, these represent only a very small minority of the cases.  The same applies to applications for special allowances.</P>
    <P>It may interest Deputies to know that, of 18,500 applications dealt with since the special allowances scheme was introduced in 1943, allowances were granted in nearly 13,000 cases&mdash; in other words, somewhat more than two out of three applicants over the years received special allowances.  In recent times, the proportion has been as high as four out of five.  When it is considered that applications may be refused on any of three grounds&mdash; health, means and eligibility for the medal&mdash;that again disposes of any suggestion of over-strict standards.  Again, <Col N="1386" /> allowances are being awarded all the time, and it is only the small minority of cases in which the application is refused or the person is not satisfied with the allowance awarded that come to the notice of Deputies.  Short of granting every application, there is no way of satisfying everybody.</P>
    <P>I have dealt in detail with this matter and have had this note prepared in order to clarify once more the history of our dealing with this type of benefit to old IRA men.  I want to assure Deputy MacEoin and all the other Deputies who gave it priority in their remarks, that the benefit of any doubt that may exist is given to the applicant.  The approach to all available pensioners in a district who are not verifying officers, as a last resort, is very fair in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Reserve of Officers, appeals have been made frequently for an improvement of their position.  I have recently had the regulations governing promotions to the Reserve of Officers (First Line) amended so as to facilitate promotion from the rank of lieutenant to captain. A number of lieutenants have since been promoted to the higher rank.</P>
    <P>With regard to prescribed ages for relinquishment of their commissions by officers of the Reserve of Officers (First Line), I have had the regulations amended so as to bring the ages into line with the retirement ages for serving officers.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin referred to the system of recruitment of civilian employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may ask the Minister a question before he departs from the matter he has just been dealing with, has he had time to consider the case of giving captains in the Regular Army an automatic promotion to commandant where their period of service is approaching its conclusion, on the ground that if a man is deemed to be good enough to be a captain for a long number of years in the Army service, seniority itself should indicate that at a certain stage of his career he should be given the rank, emoluments and pension rights of a com- <Col N="1387" /> mandant, as is the practice, I think, in most other armies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy's information is correct when he speaks about other armies but I have been informed that it is not quite as simple a matter to promote captains automatically to a higher rank as it is to promote lieutenants to the rank of captain.  There are some special financial provisions for captains of long service and these have been made in recognition of the case made by Deputy Dillon and others.  I would not care to commit myself to any more positive statement at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the Minister will consider the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider it.  It has been brought to my notice and there has been considerable letter writing in the public press about it by the captains themselves.  They apparently think that they should use means to impress upon the Minister for Defence and the authorities what they regard as their claim to special promotion.</P>
      <P>I do think that every Deputy will agree with me when I say that where it comes to ranks of higher responsibility, the General Staff should be allowed some discretion and that it is necessary to ensure, particularly in these times, that we have top-class officers available for foreign service. There are considerations to be taken into account in relation to service such as we are called on to give under the United Nations apart from ability to fight.</P>
      <P>I was referring to Deputy MacEoin's remarks about civilian employees.  In their case, as in the case of other such employees, the labour exchange is requested to submit names, and it is from names so submitted that the men are recruited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Booth complained of the system whereby an officer's retired pay is rebated if his employment is remunerated from public moneys.  I feel sure the Deputy is aware that this is an arrangement of long standing and <Col N="1388" /> that it applies to public servants other than ex-Army officers&mdash;for instance, Civil Service pensioners.  I feel sure he is also aware that the Minister for Finance has indicated in reply to a question by Deputy Cosgrave that he is considering this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the vexed question of conciliation and arbitration procedure for the Army, referred to during the debate by Deputies MacEoin, Tully, McQuillan and Booth, the position has been, of course, that the General Staff have in fact acted in this capacity on behalf of the Army and I do not think the Army has suffered in any way through any lack of enthusiasm or effort on the part of the General Staff.  It is not clear that the Army would be better served by the suggested system of arbitration. However, I am having an examination made of the methods by which such problems are dealt with in other countries and if it becomes necessary to amend our thinking on the matter, that will be done.  I wish to assure the House that every genuine complaint from Army personnel receives the fullest sympathy and consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputies MacEoin and Tully mentioned the matter of automatic promotion.  I have dealt with that arising out of the remarks of Deputy Dillon and I do not think there is anything else I should say on it.</P>
    <P>A question of topical interest, the selection of personnel for United Nations service, was referred to by Deputy MacEoin and others.  I dealt with this pretty fully last year and there is hardly anything new I can say about it.  At that time, I indicated that suggestions of favouritism in regard to these selections were not well founded.  I should like now to stress that these selections are exclusively a purely military matter and as Minister for Defence, I do not interfere with the discretion of Headquarters Staff in choosing personnel for such service.</P>
    <P>I know one cause of complaint is the fact that some members have had more than one trip abroad.  This apparently has given rise to the suggestion of favouritism in the selections.  I have inquired why some men have gone <Col N="1389" /> more than once while others, who have sought inclusion, have not yet been selected.  Apparently the purpose is to maintain the practical liaison that has been established since the beginning of overseas service.  The purpose is to ensure that there will not be a completely new unit, with no link with its predecessors.</P>
    <P>That entails the sending of a small number of men a second or third time. On the whole, the principle of sending out new personnel and spreading the experience over as large a number of men as possible, is followed.  Perhaps I should say that the selection of soldiers for overseas service is influenced by various factors of which the principal are willingness to serve, recommendation of immediate superiors, age, standard of training and efficiency, physical fitness, medical record, disciplinary record, period of engagement remaining to be served, general suitability of temperament and physique.</P>
    <P>I feel sure every Deputy will agree it is desirable that personnel selected for overseas service should measure up to a reasonable standard under each of these heads.  That is what is done and if it seems to work out in a discriminatory manner, that is not in fact so.  There are no means whereby members of the Army can operate any influence to have themselves selected against their suitability under these heads.  There are certain types of qualifications that possibly make it more difficult to get suitable personnel. I have a list of such qualifications here&mdash;radio technicians, fitters, drivers, medical orderlies, cooks, storemen, clerks with ability to type.  Men with these qualifications, I am told, have a better chance of being selected more than mere line soldiers.</P>
    <P>Regarding the complaints about the severity of punishment awarded by courtsmartial, I do not think there is any substance in them because the number of petitions is very small.  In nearly all cases of detention, if it is of any length, even before the case comes to the Minister, I find the term has been greatly reduced by the military authorities and that it is hardly necessary for the Minister to <Col N="1390" /> interfere at all.  It seems to me in this connection that if the offence is of such a character that the punishment takes the form of a long term of detention, it would be better to dispose altogether of that soldier's services and get rid of him rather than keep him.  I have expressed that view to the military authorities and I think they accept it.  In this matter we must be careful not to play in with men who want to get out of the Army and who ordinarily would have to buy themselves out.  If they found an easy way out by committing an offence and getting a punishment, that would create an abuse of another kind and so we had better leave this to the good judgment of the military who have handled it reasonably well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth referred to variations in rates of pay for professional officers. Rates of professional pay in the Army are influenced by various factors such as rates of remuneration in corresponding civilian employment and particularly in corresponding appointments in other sectors of the public service.  Various rates of professional pay are therefore inevitable and to attempt to treat all professional officers equally in regard to remuneration would be unfair and unrealistic.  The question of revised rates for officers, other than medical and dental officers who have received increased rates, is under active consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin referred to the case of soldiers transferred to the First Battalion as punishment.  I did not like the tenor of Deputy MacEoin's remarks in regard to this matter.  He seemed to think we were using the First Battalion as a place or state of punishment where some soldiers suffered for a time before getting back to their original station.  Continuous complaints about the conduct of certain families in the Athlone married quarters facing the public road made it necessary for the command OC to take strong action.  Recent incidents involved two soldiers who are brothers and a third who is their brother-in-law, all three living in the quarters with their families.  It was decided the only thing to do was to break them up and the two brothers were detached to <Col N="1391" /> Galway in addition to being fined and the brother-in-law to Mullingar, in addition to detention.

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>As a general answer, I should say it is desirable that every branch of the public service should do all it can to provide houses.  The corporation is a housing authority and from the point of view of avoiding dislocation when soldiers come to the end of their service, it is desirable, in view of the number of overholders we have in military houses, that as many as possible should be housed in local authority houses.  A considerable number of ex-service men are over-holders in Dublin and unless we throw them out&mdash;and then we would be the worst in the world&mdash;what can we do? If they were accommodated in local authority houses, that question would not arise.  I take it if the Department removes the acuteness from the particular need where it exists and leaves the rest to the local housing authorities, that is the wisest course to pursue.</P>

      <P>We are not very high up.  Deputy MacEoin asked about the full cost of the pay increases.  I gave the annual cost for the Defence Forces.  It is approximately £615,000; for civilian employees, it is approximately £105,000; and the approximate annual cost for Civil Service staff in the Department is £40,000.</P>
      <P>Another matter of importance which was raised by Deputy MacEoin was the question of receipts from the United Nations.  To date we have received sums of approximately £1,478,000 in respect of allowances paid to officers and men, stores specially purchased, stores destroyed, lost or damaged, etc.  In some instances the sums received were credited to a suspense account to which the original expenditure had been charged; in others the sums received were credited to the Appropriations in Aid.  The Department's appropriation accounts show what is done in respect of the different items.  As well, sums amounting to £136,000, approximately, have been received from the United Nations in respect of pensions, allowances, lump sums, etc., paid as a result of the death or disablement of members of the Defence Forces who served in the Congo.  These sums are shown in the Department's appropriation accounts as extra receipts payable to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully complained about the reluctance of the Department to discuss with the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen matters affecting general Army conditions.  I want to make it quite clear that I, as Minister for Defence, and the Department, hold the Organisation in the highest respect. There never has been and there will <Col N="1394" /> not be, any objection to discussing with them matters affecting ex-servicemen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not correct that the Minister has not in effect arranged the interview which has been sought on more than two or three occasions for the purpose of discussing matters affecting ex-servicemen?  Is it not a fact that the Minister simply sent a long letter explaining that there was no necessity for such interview, and asking about further points, until the Organisation got tired of writing?  Or have they taken the wrong impression from the Minister's letter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could agree to discuss even with a body of the importance of ONE matters which are entirely and exclusively the responsibility of the Department of Defence.  One of the items on the Organisation's list was the provision of helicopters.  While I would be prepared to receive representations from any group of citizens on matters dealing with defence, I do not think I should concede an interview to ONE on a matter of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly the Deputy can take that as being so.  Of course I <Col N="1395" /> would not like it to go abroad that I am at the beck and call of anyone who feels he has a specific standing in relation to defence.  I can assure the Deputy I have many other matters to occupy my time.  I admit freely that ONE as an ex-servicemen's organisation would have a better claim than most.  I know Deputy Tully is a member of the Organisation, and I understand he was President at one time, and I would ask him to apply his good judgment in the selection of matters about which he would ask to be heard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan referred me to the question of houses.  The matter was also dealt with by Deputy Sherwin, Deputy Davern and Deputy Tully.  I do not think I have anything new to add except to say that 190 houses have been provided in recent years.  As I told Deputy Coogan a while ago, that policy of providing houses is being pursued.  I would ask Deputies again &mdash;it is no harm to repeat this because it is important&mdash;to keep in mind the number of over-holders we have in military houses at present.  Very often we receive representations from Deputies to stay action in the matter. If we withhold payment of pensions in respect of over-holders, we get representations from Deputies to forego such action.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> A point was made about a specialist's fee in respect of a visit to the Curragh and I consider that the matter is of sufficient importance for me to deal with it specifically.  It was Deputy Booth who raised the matter.  He referred to the case of a medical specialist brought to the Curragh and from what he said, the Deputy apparently got a garbled and inaccurate account of what happened in the case.  While some obvious questions relating to the necessity for the consultation and to the amount of the fee were asked by the Department, authority was given for the employment of the specialist on the day on which it was sought, two days before the consultation actually took place.  The specialist was not approached by the Department for a reduction of his fee, as might be suggested by what the Deputy said.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the new uniform, Deputies Esmonde and Booth criticised what they regarded as delay in its introduction.  I did not say in my opening statement that delay by the contractors was holding the matter up.  Supplies are already beginning to come through but when approval for the new uniform was announced at the end of January, it was also stated that stocks of the present uniform must be used up before the new uniform became a general issue.  I think it reasonable enough that we should use up existing stocks of material.</P>
    <P>Many matters of detail were mentioned in the debate.  Some of them have already been dealt with in replies to Parliamentary questions during the year and no doubt several of them will come up again in that way.  One Deputy&mdash;I think, Deputy Booth&mdash;complained that there seemed to be a marked omission in the statements of Ministers for Defence on this annual Estimate&mdash;a lack of policy statements. He said that we should create a United Nations Force and have it ready at a moment's notice but he qualified that by saying that it should be done at the expense of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any Minister or Deputy would object to such a suggestion.  I am quite satisfied that we would get more than one battalion of good soldiers here in such circumstances <Col N="1397" /> but the difficulty is that the United Nations are not in a position to guarantee any such payments.  Some of the most important members have been defaulting in relation to the expenses of the Congo operation, as the Minister for External Affairs has pointed out.  I understand that similar default is taking place in relation to Cyprus and I do not think any Deputy would put forward the suggestion that this small country should provide a strong force as ready as a fire brigade to go to any trouble spot to which United Nations might direct it unless the condition advanced by Deputy Booth is fulfilled, that the entire cost is going to be carried by United Nations.  If that can be constructed as a declaration of policy, no Deputy in this House need have any hesitation in making it.  We have been dealing with these matters in an <i>ad hoc</i> way. United Nations make the request and the Dáil makes a decision on that request.  That is our <i>ad hoc</i> policy.</P>
    <P>Outside of these United Nations commitments I may be asked what is the view of the Minister for Defence in relation to our Army, assuming that there were no outside assignments for it.  If I were asked to give an opinion I would say that we ought to extend as much as possible the educational activities of the Army.  There is a fair amount being done in that direction at the present time.  We have, for instance, the apprenticeship school at Naas which is doing very good work and turning out very good tradesmen.  I am glad to note that the trade unions recognise the qualifications gained by these boys in the apprenticeship school. They sign on usually for six or nine years but it is not easy to retain them for that period as, because of their training, they get offers of good employment and it is not easy to stand between them and these career offers.</P>
    <P>I would not mind that if we could have a continuous turnover.  It is all to the good provided the trained personnel remain in Ireland.  We also have very good training by the Air Corps, the training of pilots.  Again, we had the experience in the past of Aer Lingus taking the best of them as they became available.  Now we have <Col N="1398" /> a special agreement with Aer Lingus whereby we train their own personnel at Gormanston.  That has lessened the drain from the Air Corps.  These are two examples of the educational policy being pursued by the Army.  It is our wish to extend that type of activity and the Army could and should become one of our principal educational establishments.</P>
    <P>I am most disappointed that the Gaeltacht is not keeping the 1st Battalion supplied with Irish speakers. They come out of Connemara and pass Renmore and go over to England. I cannot see why a young fellow of 17 years of age&mdash;and we will take them into the Army at 17, with the parents' consent&mdash;would not sign on at Renmore at least for three years. He is still only a boy at 20 and he will have been better prepared for emigration, if he must emigrate, by spending his three years in the Army.</P>
    <P>Under the new scales of pay, a trained soldier has a clear £5 18s. a week in his pocket with his uniform, his food and his accommodation.  If we could fill up that battalion and if we could reduce the roster of duty which is too frequent now because of the small numbers there, much more time could be made available for the members of that battalion to attend the local technical school and to advance themselves.  Indeed, if we had sufficient numbers in the barracks we could arrange for special vocational classes with the local vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of thinking I have about our Army, its employment and its use.  I do not think the time has come when we can be so trusting as to abolish it altogether, as some well-disposed people seem to think it might be.  I do not suppose I have dealt with every point made by Deputies but if there are any specific questions I have not dealt with and which any Deputy would like to put to me I shall do my best to answer them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister said they found extreme difficulty in getting replies from the verifying officers in many cases and it was assumed it was a reluctance on the part of those people to say they had <Col N="1399" /> the service they were claiming.  Is it not a fact that quite a number of the original verifying officers have become incapacitated or have died?  Would the Minister not consider my suggestion that those people should all be written to and asked, as of now, if they are prepared to continue to act as verifying officers?  I believe the Minister will find that so many of these people are no longer able to do it, because they have got seriously ill or old or have died, that he will decide to change the system.</P>

      <P>They should.  Furthermore, take a person in receipt of a special allowance but who because of illness requires a member of the family to look after him or her.  A daughter or somebody has to leave off work to look after those people.  Is there any way in which allowances can be made to provide for such persons?  I had a letter yesterday from a lady in Northern Ireland who is looking after her husband, an Old IRA man, in Fermanagh.  The husband has £3 10s. and she has £3 to look after him.  Her brother in Cavan, an Old IRA man, has £78 a year special allowance and his daughter has had to leave employment to look after him.  She has nothing and therefore the old man must go into the county home.  It is a comparison that would not bear looking into too clearly.  If people have to look after them, could they not receive <Col N="1400" /> an extra amount of money?  I do not know if it is possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have done what I think is the most effective thing.  There was a recruitment bonus payable to soldiers who secured recruits.  It used to be only £1.  Now we have cut out ordinary advertising expenses and have diverted the money for a trial period by increasing the bonus from £1 to £5. I think the personal contact between a soldier and his friends outside should be more effective than any other form of advertising and we think the £5 bonus should be attractive enough to produce results.  It is too soon yet to say whether or not the scheme will succeed.  It is being tried out on an experimental basis.</P>

      <P>Two different matters are involved here.  He may have been permitted to sit for the examination at the end of the course and passed the examination, even though he had not been there for the full year.  In the conditions for the competition it was laid down that the candidate must have a complete year in an agricultural college.  There was, of course, no reference to the examination to which the Deputy refers.  The only stipulation was that a candidate must have completed a year in an agricultural college.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of providing special assistance for milk producers on islands has been considered on a number of occasions. Where possible, arrangements were made for the Dairy Disposal Company to provide cream-separating stations on the islands even though the actual or potential milk supplies were below the level required for economic operation of the stations.  In other instances where the milk supplies were far too low, the Dairy Disposal Company offered to help in the organisation of a milk cartage system on the mainland to the nearest creamery and to contribute towards its cost if the islanders themselves were prepared to transport their milk co-operatively to a convenient point on the mainland but the milk producers did not avail <Col N="1407" /> themselves of the offer.  This offer is, of course, still open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears from the Minister's reply that he is not conversant with the position obtaining in these islands.  Is he aware that the creamery facilities which are available elsewhere are not available in these islands and that the islanders gain no benefit whatsoever from the subsidy which the Minister mentioned in this House some time ago as being allowed to the dairying industry, that is, a subsidy of more than £6 million.  In view of the fact that in the case of Clear Island, which is nine miles from the mainland, it is impossible for the local milk producers to send their milk to the mainland, surely the only answer is to give them a special subsidy which would not cost very much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Dairy Disposal Company erected a cream separating station in Bere Island in 1940 and although the prospects of securing an adequate supply to justify the erection of a similar station on Whiddy Island was very doubtful, they also erected a separating station there. It was hoped that the erection of the second station on Whiddy Island might prove to be an encouragement to the islanders to increase cow numbers and thereby increase the volume of milk available.  Unfortunately, these hopes were not realised.  In the case of the other islands, that is, Hare island and Sherkin island, the supply of milk available there would not justify their erecting stations in these centres.  The offer was made by the company that if the people who are producing milk on these islands would cooperatively transfer the milk to the mainland, the company would introduce a subsidised cartage system to the nearest separating station.  The company have indicated not only their knowledge of the problems there but their willingness to be as helpful as one could reasonably expect them to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Dairy Disposal Company recommended that the best way to deal with the milk produced in the islands is to give these people a subsidy, <Col N="1408" /> that it would be the most economic way of helping them, far more economic than making creamery facilities available to them?  Surely that recommendation is there in the Minister's file if he wishes to look it up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the thoughts of the Dairy Disposal Company may have been in that regard but my thoughts are that not more than half the milk produced by the cow population of the country, not to talk about these islands, is handled in creameries.  I do not see how such a system as he suggests could be worked and I do not know how it could be confined to the islanders, even if it were workable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that if creamery facilities are not availed of in any part of the country, it is because people do not want them.  They are making more money from their present system of farming and do not wish to go into dairy farming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that a good case has been made by these islanders who, by virtue of the location of their holdings, cannot avail of creamery facilities and who are no burden whatsoever on the Exchequer so far as the subsidy towards the dairying industry is concerned? They are entitled to some special consideration by virtue of their being separated from the mainland by the Atlantic Ocean and by reason of the disadvantages under which they are labouring.  The recommendation of the Dairy Disposal Company should be implemented, that is, to give them a subsidy on their butter production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied the Dairy Disposal Company have approached the question of the islanders and the milk produced on these islands in a very generous and helpful way.

At this stage the company cannot say if they will be in a position to re-employ any of these workers.</P>

No. 7 of 1953), as amended by Article 3 of the Social Welfare Regulations, 1962 (S.I. No. 135 of 1962).  These articles provide that a day shall not be treated as a day of <Col N="1415" /> unemployment if an insured person is on that day following any occupation from which he derives any remuneration or profit unless such occupation could ordinarily have been followed by him in addition to his usual employment and outside the ordinary working hours of that employment and the remuneration or profit therefrom for such day does not exceed six shillings and eightpence, or, where the remuneration or profit is in respect of a period longer than a day, such remuneration or profit does not on the daily average exceed that amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked permission to raise this matter because of its extreme importance.  It concerns what is, to my mind, an unjustified and unjustifiable increase in the rents of some 10,000 tenants living in the Dublin Corporation housing estates at Ballyfermot, Finglas, Walkinstown and elsewhere, where the differential renting system is in operation.  My particular interest is in Ballyfermot which forms a large portion of my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that area some 68 per cent of the tenants pay the maximum differential rent.  The differential renting system as operated by the Corporation has, over the years, involved very severe hardship for a number of familie <Col N="1446" /> where the income levels are low and the size of the families is usually large, including a number of non-earning children.  It is to those cases in particular I wish to refer in this discussion. Up to last week, the maximum differential rent in Ballyfermot for the larger type house was 36/6d.  This has now been increased in all cases where the maximum rent is charged&mdash; 68 per cent of the tenantry pay the maximum&mdash;by 3/9d. to make the rent £2 0s. 3d.</P>
    <P>In the case of smaller houses, the maximum differential rent up to last week was 33/-.  That has now been increased by 3/3d., making the new rent 36/3d.  It seems to me to be unfair and totally unjust that a man and wife, with three non-earning children, where the man is the only wage earner, must pay £2 0s. 3d. a week rent if he has a wage of £12 16s. 6d.  I see no justification for such a large impost on a man earning what must now be regarded as being no more than the wages of an average labourer or artisan in this city.</P>
    <P>In the smaller type house, a man with a wife and three children, earning £11 17s. 6d. a week, is required to pay 36/3d. a week rent.  This clearly causes grave hardship on the hardworking Dublin factory, building or other type worker who has to meet many heavy costs apart from rent and who in fact can be regarded as the mainstay and bulwark of this great city.  This increase in rent shows a lack of consideration for such workers by the local authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes into the picture because he has the function of sanctioning this alternation or of refusing to sanction it.  Of course this rent increase cannot be isolated from the general picture of increases in the past two months.  It is hardly possible to open a newspaper nowadays without seeing an announcement of some further increase in the cost of living, some further rise in the price of the commodities necessary in the ordinary workingclass home.  The increase in rents must be looked at in conjunction with other increases that have been imposed on the people of Ballyfermot within the past few weeks, <Col N="1447" /> principally in respect of bus fares and bread and meat.</P>
    <P>It could well be said that the 12 per cent wage increase, the ninth round, through the exploitation of which the Government won two by-elections&mdash; by claiming it was their personal invention and property&mdash;has been completely gutted and that wage increase is something of a danger rather than a benefit to the living standards that exist.  Recently, somebody wrote to the papers appealing to the trade unions not to look for any more wage increases for him: he said he could not afford them.  It appears that a wild scramble in price increases has been allowed to develop that will completely counteract the effect of the wage increase.  Rent is something on which a very close watch should have been kept by the Government and steps should have been taken to prevent this imposition on working people.</P>
    <P>These tenants took up occupation of these houses several years ago in most cases.  They signed the tenancy agreement which set out the levels of differential rent with particular reference to the minimum and maximum.  The maximum was clearly stated in the print to be 36/6d. a week.  The tenants feel there is a very strong legal point there because the agreement has been arbitrarily abrogated by the Corporation without consultation with or reference to them.  This is something the Minister should look into because, surely, even between the Corporation tenants and the City Council the law of contract must apply.  It is not completely onesided although, to look at some of the other conditions laid down in the existing tenancy agreement, it is obviously loaded very much against the people who live in these houses and in favour of the City Fathers.</P>
    <P>I suggest the increase in rent is in breach of the law and should be examined by the Minister from that point of view to discover what power was there to enable the Corporation to increase the rent after making an agreement with the tenants giving them occupation of the houses with the stated qualification that the maximum rent would be 33/6d. per week in respect <Col N="1448" /> of the smaller houses and 36/6d. in respect of the larger ones.  I have a copy of the existing agreement relating to Corporation tenancies and from the knowledge I have of looking at documents of this kind I should say it is the most restrictive tenancy agreement existing in the country today.  Some of its clauses, you might say, are worthy of Lord Leitrim.  The heading is &ldquo;Housing Of The Working Classes Acts, 1890-1960.  Standard Letting Conditions For Cottages And Flat Dwellings.&rdquo;  Clause 22 of the document reads:</P>
    <P>The tenant shall not be at liberty to paper the internal walls of any new dwelling without the consent of the Corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest this is relevant as part of the whole picture of how Dublin Corporation tenants are treated.  For this rent which they pay, they must subject themselves to ridiculous conditions such as the one I have quoted.  They must seek permission to paper their houses.</P>
      <P>Despite the very high rents of 33/6d. and 36/6d. which now apply, the Corporation tenant has no security of tenure.  Many people throughout the city and country pay far less in purchasing their houses than the amount these tenants are required to pay in rent but despite the high rent there is absolutely no security of tenure.  If the Corporation want to recover possession of a house or flat, they simply send their legal officer into court to stand up and say that the Corporation want the house and the court must so determine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely pointing out the inequities of the present letting system and the lack of justification for asking people to pay more to endure these things.  The Corporation tenants appear to have no rights, only obligations. That is contrary to all decent practice.  As the Minister knows, when <Col N="1449" /> county councils throughout the country are thinking in terms of rents of cottages they also provide purchase schemes for their tenants but such advantages are not available for Dublin Corporation tenants.</P>
      <P>The people of Ballyfermot and throughout the housing estate&mdash;all 10,000 of them&mdash;are fearful of what this may mean.   Apparently, this is a precedent which may be followed in the future and they may eventually find themselves paying half as much more again for the houses they now occupy.  Many of these houses are far from the last word in construction. Large numbers of them were erected in the necessarily hurried housing programme initiated after the war by the first inter-Party Government.  It is doubtful if they would fetch very much if they were for sale in the open market but at the same time they are homes for a great number of people who are the mainspring of industry in this city and they should be protected. To my mind the Government have a duty&mdash;and so has the Minister&mdash;so to examine the activities of Dublin Corporation as to ensure that nothing shall be done which will reduce the living standards or in any way interfere with the conditions the working people themselves have built up by their industry and organisation over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ballyfermot has been victimised on many occasions by CIE.  Whenever CIE are short of money for their many fanciful schemes, the simple remedy is to put up the fares in Ballyfermot and in other Dublin areas on the workingclass people and get all the money they want.  That is their answer to every conceivable problem regardless of the ability of the people to pay.  Here is a case in which we can fasten responsibility.  Those of us who have tried at various times to bring the injustices of the people to the notice of certain Ministers here, such as the Minister for Transport and Power and others, know how we have been fobbed off and defeated in our efforts to express in democratic fashion the grievances of the people.  We have often been defeated by the side-stepping of the Ministers who disclaim responsibility <Col N="1450" /> for the activities of State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>Here we have a case of direct responsibility on the Minister, and a case where the Minister should step in. If he has not already been committed by his Department in this matter, he should at least have it reconsidered and looked at again.  The reasons which have been advanced for these rent increases by Dublin Corporation officials with whom I have discussed the matter do not convince me, at any rate, that they are justified.</P>
    <P>Most of all I feel it is a very bad principle, and a very bad practice, for the premier local authority in the country to tear up, in effect, what must surely be legal instruments of tenancy agreements under which these tenants took up occupation of the houses, and to increase these rents without any consultation whatsoever with the tenants concerned, and with no regard whatsoever for the rights of the tenants.  I ask the Minister to reexamine the whole matter and to see that the people of this area, and of all the districts affected throughout Dublin, are given a fair deal.  That is all they are looking for.  They are not looking for anything extraordinary. They are not making any wild demands.  They are looking for ordinary justice, and that is what I am asking for here today.</P>

      <P>When the Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation were examining the estimates for the provision of housing, maintenance and administration, the City Manager wanted £100,000 extra.  Having considered it, the Housing Committee reduced that figure to £30,000 and decided that the maximum differential rents should bear that burden.  I did not agree with that decision.  Up to this year the Housing Committee have resisted all efforts to increase differential rents.  The City Manager has pointed out to the Corporation that they were acting illegally and that provision should be made for a rates increase.  He had the advice of his lawyers on that.  When he wanted that extra money, it was placed on the people paying maximum differential <Col N="1451" /> rents.  This decision was reached by the Housing Committee and transmitted to the Estimates Committee of the Corporation, and some weeks ago they decided by a majority to impose this amount on the maximum differential rents tenants.  It was decided to undertake a review of the whole rents structure, which was certainly deserving of review.  It was represented by the City Manager&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to preface my remarks by saying how grateful I am to the Minister for giving me two minutes.  I endorse everything Deputy Dunne has said.  Those people went into those houses and signed agreements, and were told that if their wages went to £36 a week, they would still be required to pay only 36/- a week.  I submit to the Minister that this is contrary to the 12 per cent increase in wages which has been given.  This decision by the Corporation to increase the rents has taken away part of the 12 per cent and, <Col N="1452" /> therefore, it is not a 12 per cent increase.  As Deputy Dunne said, they have to bear the increased cost of transport into the city, apart from every other possible increase.  I trust the Minister will take this matter up with the Department of Justice, because I should like to have the money for a test case.  Dublin Corporation are definitely acting illegally and in breach of the tenancy agreements.</P>

      <P>One of the matters raised by two of the people who have spoken was that the tenancy agreements have been wrongfully abrogated by the Corporation.  In fact, the position is very much reverse.  Back in 1950 when this differential rents system was established and adopted by the council, it was subject to the Management and Letting Regulations, 1950. So far as I am advised, the situation is that whatever illegality there has been has been to the advantage of the tenants, in that under the Management and Letting Regulations of 1950 and the Local Government (Increases in Rents of Small Dwellings) Act, 1928, an increase in rates should have been added each year since, as it arose.  In fact, the position is that since 1950 to 1964 the method of arriving at the final amount to be paid, including rates, was not legal, and was not in conformity with the Management and Letting Regulations, 1950, under which the differential rents system was established, or the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over and above that, we must have regard to the fact that no change has taken place in the differential rents system except that the rents varied from time to time according to the scheme, since it was adopted.  While the maximum rents were realistic in 1950 in the sense that they approximated to the full economic rents, they no longer do.  In fact, they are just short of 50 per cent of what the economic rent would be today, related <Col N="1453" /> to maintenance and administration charges.  For instance, a rent of 36/-odd adopted years ago as a maximum for a four- or five-roomed house approximated to a full economic rent. Today, for a similar house, the actual full rent, inclusive of rates, would be 76/- instead of 36/-.  In other words, the rent would be approximately 56/-, plus 20/- for rates, which would give a figure of 76/-, instead of the original maximum differential for that type of house back in 1950-51 or thereabouts.</P>
    <P>Another thing that should be said is that the increase of ten per cent may be compared with an increase in rates over the same period of approximately 90 per cent.  The rates have gone up about 90 per cent in the period since the scheme was adopted and this is the first time the maxima, and only the maxima, have been increased.  Out of 45,000 tenants of Dublin Corporation, this change will affect less than a quarter, something about 10,000. About 19,000 of these tenants are on differential rents and the remainder are on fixed rents.  While the differential rent tenants did not pay year by year the increased rates which, according to the legal advice I got and the legal advice which, I believe, was given to Dublin Corporation, the fixed rent tenants to the number of 24,000 or 25,000 have been paying the increases in the rates year by year.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Dunne says that the people who are now being asked for these increases, related in some way but not fully to the rates, are being discriminated against, he should keep in mind the fact that they have not been paying the annual increases in rates in the combined rents and rates charged to them.  Because of that, they have been adding to the increases in rates charged to the 25,000 or so fixed rent people.  They have been adding to the rate charges of 25,000 of their co-workers and colleagues.</P>
    <P>The entire charges against the administration of the housing estates of Dublin Corporation comprising these 45,000 tenants runs to over £2½ million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1454" /> From the ratepayers there is coming this year a subsidy towards this charge of about £800,000.  The taxpayer, in addition to that, is providing another £700,000 so therefore there is a total of just under two-thirds of the entire charges for administration being met by way of subsidisation from the ratepayers and the taxpayers.  We should bear these things in mind when we come to consider this question of Dublin Corporation seeking my approval to increasing the rents by ten per cent, whether for all or only for part as in this case.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that the Minister is directly responsible for the rent of those houses.  I approve or disapprove of proposals sent to me by the local housing authorities.  In this case the proposal is to increase the maxima of differential rents, and only those, by ten per cent, a proposal recommended in the first instance by the Dublin Corporation Housing Committee and submitted to and approved by the entire Dublin Corporation.  In those circumstances and against the general background which I have given in brief detail, I did not feel that there were any grounds on which I could say to Dublin Corporation not to do this and that they must find money by increasing the rates still further than they propose to increase them.  I did not feel that there was any justification for finding this money by increasing the rates to the fixed rent people and to other ratepayers in the city.</P>
    <P>These considerations were the ones I had to have regard to in agreeing to a proposal which came from Dublin Corporation, having been recommended by the Housing Committee of that body who are, in a detailed way, responsible to their colleagues in the Corporation, in the effort to balance their budget and to give a fair trial to all the people, differential rent people, fixed rent people and the ordinary ratepaying people of the city.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 3.45 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 14th April, 1964.</P>

In particular various salary and wage claims involving retrospection being dealt with through the Conciliation and Arbitration machinery could result in considerable additions to the expenditure appropriate to the year. (The estimate given above takes into account the increase of 12% granted to Civil Servants, the increase given to Sub-Postmasters with effect from 1st February, 1964, and the increase given to Post Office Clerks with effect from 1st October, 1963).</P>
    <P>(2)  The following table shows on the bases requested the amount expended under the Telephone Capital Acts in the year 1962/63.  Estimated figures for 1963/64 are also given.</P>
    <P>The total expended in the various categories does not correspond with the amount expended under the Acts as it is affected by the extent to which stocks of capital stores are run down or augmented.  The amounts in each category have been expressed as percentages of the total cost of telephone capital works.</P>
