    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Partition: Six Counties Benefits.</Title>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in order to refute the allegation of the Six Counties Prime Minister concerning future conditions in the Six Counties if partition ended, he will guarantee that the welfare state benefits&mdash;no means test for health services, social welfare benefits, education facilities and agricultural and industrial benefits&mdash;will not be jeopardised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that it is sometimes advanced as an argument against unity that, in Northern Ireland, notwithstanding the prevalence of many and serious economic and social problems, the benefits of British social-welfare scales and certain other advantages are enjoyed, and that these scales and advantages exceed those now operating in the rest of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have already expressed my view, on more than one occasion, that Irish opinion would accept that, with unification, there should be an arrangement to ensure that there would be no reduction of the social benefits now enjoyed there.</P>
      <P>In this connection I should point out that in any area the level of State social benefits and services is related to the willingness of the public to pay for them.  In the Six Counties the weekly contribution payable by the insured worker is double the contribution payable here and general taxation per head is also higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it, therefore, that as far as the Taoiseach is concerned, he is prepared to allay the fears of people in the Six Counties who are at the moment under the impression from recent speeches by the Six County Premier that the farmers would lose their guaranteed prices, that the social welfare recipients would have their benefits trimmed from the British standards to the Twenty-Six <Col N="349" /> County standards and that even the Capital Development Programme would go by the Board?  Will the Taoiseach now allay the understandable fears of people in that locality that such will not be the case if Partition goes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the sense of the reply I have given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I hear the Taoiseach say that the level of social services depended on the willingness of people to pay for them?  Does he infer that the people in the Six Counties are willing to pay more than those in the Twenty-Six Counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am stating is the fact that they are paying a great deal more than the people here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should also have mentioned that part of the system which includes Great Britain and the Six Counties for social welfare purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I made was that the contribution by the insured <Col N="350" /> worker is double what is being paid here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Double?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>More than double.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying that the contribution by an insured worker in Northern Ireland is more than double the contribution by the worker here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Turnover tax is chargeable on moneys received by accountable persons in respect of services provided in the course of business. Where a hotel provides a service for its customers by arranging telephone calls from a private line or through its own switchboard, tax is properly chargeable on the moneys received by the hotel in respect of the service.  I understand that hotels generally have made a slight increase in their charges for services of this kind, in order to cover their tax liability.  In the circumstances I can see no reason to interfere in the matter.</P>

      <P>The person concerned sat for the earlier examination on 6th April, 1961.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply I stated that he is free, if the licensed wheat dealer rejects it, to offer it to an agent or a miller and, should rejection be repeated, he has the right of appeal.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will, I think, appreciate that there are geographical considerations in certain <Col N="357" /> parts of the country which impose on a farmer the burden of drawing his wheat a long distance, if he is to find an authorised agent or a mill to which to tender it, and it would be a very great convenience if the same machinery were available in the event of his selling his wheat to a licensed wheat dealer.  After all, the problem is exactly the same.  Is there any means whereby licensed wheat dealers could be linked up with the general arrangement which exists at present between millers and the NFA to provide this appeal machinery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The wheat dealers decided, apparently, not to come into this arrangement.  I appreciate a grower deciding to offer his wheat to a wheat dealer on the ground that the wheat dealer's premises are more convenient but, since he has the right to do so, plus the further right, should his wheat be rejected, of offering it to a miller or his agent, I believe the grower is fairly well protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A licensed wheat dealer is, after all, in receipt of a considerable advantage through his licence to engage in this business.  Surely, if it is in the interests of the growers that he should become part of the appeal machinery, it should be reasonable for the Minister to say to the licensed wheat dealers that, if they want to stay in this business, they must participate in this appeal procedure in exactly the same way as the miller or his agent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>When this right was established, the scheme designed made it clear that outside samples would be tested on the payment of a fee.  That is provided for in the scheme. Naturally these outside samples would not be tested to the detriment of those participating in the scheme itself.  The licensed wheat dealers did not come into this scheme and, as I have said, it is a natural thing that the grower should have the right to offer his wheat to the firm, agent, or mill that he selects.  Should he decide to offer his <Col N="358" /> wheat to a wheat dealer, and have his consignment rejected, he then has the right to approach an agent or a miller and, should his wheat be rejected a second time, he has the right of appeal.  I think he is safeguarded to the extent that one can reasonably expect to safeguard him.</P>

Does he not agree that where there are compact groups amounting to sizeable villages they should be dealt with as they come along and not be kept back until such time as outlying areas express a desire to have electric current?  Is he aware that this area has been canvassed three times within the past ten years and <Col N="362" /> that 25 out of 27 people have given positive replies?</P>

      <P>In order to satisfy the Deputy I will ask the ESB whether it is a fact there is some special reason, other than a decision to take Kilmessan because of planned development. If that decision relates to waiting for people to come in from outside, I shall suggest to the ESB they should not apply special reasons but should go on general lines.  That does not mean, however, that Kilmessan can be taken more quickly.  It may still on a rotational basis take two years to reach.</P>

      <P>(c)  None.</P>
      <P>(d)  The construction work involved in providing service in this case is particularly heavy, and includes the erection of 1½ miles of new poles and two miles of new linework on existing poles.  It has been necessary to defer the clearance of exceptional applications of this sort in order to avoid diversion of engineering effort from trunk line work that is necessary in the interest of the telephone service generally.</P>

I had a letter from Mr. Whaley on 5th February, 1962, in which he claimed he was waiting two and a half years. In a letter he wrote to the public Press, he said he made application in 1957. Two and a half years from 5th February, 1962, would be 1959.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to discuss Mr. Whaley's mathematical abilities across the floor of the House. I want to ask the Minister is it not a fact that at least after 1961 Mr. Whaley was told that if a group of people in the area would take connection&mdash;and names were mentioned&mdash;he might be able to get connection.  Having organised that group, they were connected and he was not.  Can the Minister explain why a scheme which was introduced in 1963 should have prevented Mr. Whaley from getting connected in 1961?</P>

      <P>Application was made in 1961.  I answered the Deputy's question at (c) with regard to the number of telephone connections made within one mile of his residence after the date of his application in 1961.  I have no information in relation to the statement now made by Deputy Tully that Mr. Whaley was advised to organise a group.  I do not know anything about that.  There is nothing on the file either, and I have read the file from beginning to end.  There is just one application form on it filled in, probably, by someone in the post office, for Jack Reginald Whaley.  I am unable to verify any conversations Mr. Whaley had with any official in the post office in Ceannanus Mór or to discount what is alleged to have taken place.</P>

      <P>In order to clear the issue finally, would the Minister state if, in fact, a statement was made to someone who made representations on behalf of Mr. Whaley that the reason he did not get it was that he was not politically entitled to it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

      <P>It was written to another Minister by Mrs. Whaley and I want to say there is no foundation whatsoever for it.  The fact is, of <Col N="375" /> course, that the engineering branch determine when a telephone will be connected.  I do not interfere in that, and I have not interfered since I became Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. The engineering branch will determine when the phone will be installed for Mr. Whaley.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education, in regard to the setting-up of colleges of technology as proposed by him in May, 1963 (a) what role in the educational system will be played by these colleges; (b) what type of skills, trades and sciences they will teach; (c) how many such colleges will be established; (d) where they will be established; and (e) when they will come into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The colleges concerned will be a type of Regional Technical College.  Their main role will be to provide courses for all three of the following:</P>
      <P>(a)  The Technical Leaving Certificate;</P>
      <P>(b)  Apprentice training;</P>
      <P>(c)  High level technician training.</P>
      <P>The arrangement will be such as to avoid as far as possible duplication of staff and equipment.  Hence particular Regional Colleges will cater on a nation-wide basis for the various specialised occupations which will be concerned.  Technician courses in food processing, for instance, would be confined to one College, or at most two.</P>
      <P>I envisage about ten such Regional Technical Colleges.  In addition to Dublin (with two centres), Cork and Limerick, the centres which, as far as my information goes at the moment, most readily present themselves as suitable are Waterford, Galway, Dundalk, Sligo, Athlone, Carlow.</P>
      <P>I should, perhaps, emphasise that it will, of course be open to many more technical schools in the large centres to provide courses for the Technical Leaving Certificate and for apprentices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishing of these Regional Technical Colleges and courses involves the question of sites, plans, financing, building, syllabuses, staffing and organising generally.  Planning in <Col N="380" /> these regards is proceeding as rapidly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal information comes in standards, and there may be several classes in the one standard. The problem of dealing with these very large classes in the city is in hands.  The inspectors of the Department of Education have been surveying the schools and it is hoped that from this survey I shall get enough information to enable me to solve the problem in a reasonable time.  Over the past five years we have been improving the teacher-pupil ratio each year through the addition of new teachers and I am now informed that through reorganising the classrooms, controlling the enrolment and by additional temporary buildings this temporary problem in the city will be solved in a reasonable time.

      <P>It is perhaps unfortunate that this debate began before the Commission's Report on the Irish Language became available to the public and to Deputies.  It would have been a more useful debate if the Government, who apparently had already received the Report, could have circulated it and then had come to the House with clear proposals arising from the recommendations of the Report.  It certainly appears strange that the Minister should have opened his Estimate knowing that the Report was available but not circulating it or giving any indication of the Government's views on this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the entire language revival problem, I suggest that there is <Col N="391" /> considerable public disquiet and anxiety.  It appears that in the last 40 years, instead of progress being made, there has been in fact a regression and where progress should have been achieved, there has been considerable slipping back.  One view strongly expressed is that the language revival movement has tended to become the preserve of a few people who in many ways have antagonised the majority. Whether that is true or not, it certainly is a fact that there are more people in this country today who have conceived a dislike of the language and everything associated with it.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael in the last election indicated their dissatisfaction with the methods used up to this.  We felt that what is comprised in the term &ldquo;compulsory Irish&rdquo; has not been a satisfactory method and we have indicated that, in our view, a determined effort should be made to inspire again among the people generally, and particularly among younger people, a love of the language and some resurgence of the fine spirit which caused so many people 40 or 50 years ago to equip themselves with a working knowledge of Irish out of regard for the language.  Our views have been criticised by different groups in the past two or three years.  I should like to know if the Minister would indicate during this debate if the Government have any views now in relation to this important matter.  Or, do they propose to continue with the same methods as have been adopted and which appear to have failed in relation to the language movement.  Or, do they feel that a time for stocktaking has now come and that an effort should be made, as we suggest, to attract and encourage people rather than compel and force them into learning the language?</P>
    <P>It does appear, in the view of a number of experts, that the fight for the revival of the language has been lost in the homes in the Gaeltacht, has been lost in the homes of those who have some knowledge of Irish, but it is not being passed on to the children.  If that is the case, it means that the desire to pass it on is not there.  If the <Col N="392" /> desire is not there, it cannot be created by compulsion; it must be fostered by encouragement.  It is the view of this Party that there should be new thinking along those lines and we would expect the Minister and the Government to recognise that the time has come for the Government also to speak.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> As I have said, there are some very important matters that have not been touched upon by the Minister in introducing the Estimate.  In our system of education, there are three water-tight compartments&mdash;primary education, vocational education and secondary education.  In my view, we should have a fully integrated system with easy access from one branch of education to the other.</P>
    <P>At present there are a number of teachers in primary schools who would be more suited to either vocational or secondary schools.  Therefore it would appear to me that there is great waste, that better results could be obtained for the money expended, to the benefit of pupils generally.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of integration in schools run by religious orders.  Some of the religious commence teaching in the primary school and then proceed to the university and, having got a degree, can transfer to the secondary school.  That does not apply in the case of lay teachers.  A lay primary teacher who transfers to a secondary school cannot have service in the primary school reckoned for salary and pension purposes.  I would ask the Minister to consider that suggestion.  It would be of advantage to education generally.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why there is an objection, or who objects, to the primary teacher having university training.  I understand that in the case of non-Catholics, the primary teachers receive part of their training in Trinity College, Dublin.  I do not know why the same system should not apply in the case of Catholics.  It would be of great advantage to the pupils.  A person does get something at university that he can bring back to the children he teaches.  There was a time when people of high authority would suggest that there was no necessity to have graduates engaged in primary schools in order to teach children their tables. In my view, it is very necessary that attendance at a university should form some part of the training of primary teachers, even if it means extending the period of training by a year so that instead of a two-year course, it <Col N="394" /> would be a three-year course, at the end of which the teacher would have a degree.  Such a system would facilitate the integration of the branches of education which is so very necessary. I would ask the Minister seriously to consider that suggestion.</P>
    <P>In my view, the school-leaving age should be raised within the next couple of years to at least 15 years.  I suppose 30 per cent or 40 per cent of Irish children do not go beyond the primary school.  I do not think there is any comparison between the standard that was achieved in the primary school prior to 1922 and the standard achieved now.  One would not expect that the standards would be comparable. A new subject was introduced into the schools&mdash;our national language&mdash;and children are taught that for such a length of time every day. How could it be expected that, with the introduction of that new subject, the standard could or would reach the standard of the primary school pre-1922? People who state that the standard today is as high as ever it was really do not understand the position. They must have looked at some of the big city schools where the brighter children are selected for scholarships, and so on.</P>
    <P>The larger percentage of our primary schools are one-teacher and two-teacher schools.  Children leaving a great number of our schools at the age of 14 have nowadays a sufficient knowledge of neither English nor Irish to go out into the world.  Things have changed very much in this country in the past 40 or 50 years.  Today, education must be of a higher standard than ever before.  Therefore, that section of our children who do not go beyond the primary school are not suited for the world today and we realise that fact only too well when they leave this country because they are not fitted to take up positions which they might otherwise be able to hold.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to bring the school-leaving age up to 15 years. There is the difficulty of school buildings and of getting trained teachers but I know what the Minister is doing and what he has done.  The success of the <Col N="395" /> international competitions was due entirely to him.  If he takes the matter in hand, I know he will do something to the advantage of the children I have been speaking for and I appeal to him to do something about raising the school-leaving age.  Across the water, I understand the school-leaving age is 15 years and that by 1970 it will be raised for all to 16 years.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister, if at all possible within the next few years, to insist that every child must attend school up to the age of 15 years.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to note the improvement in our school buildings.  I have seen grand schools built which were beautiful-looking structures for the first year or so.  Then, after a few years they were a disgrace for want of paint.  When Deputy Corish asked a question about these matters, somebody asked him if it was an attack on the managerial system.  There is no teacher in Ireland&mdash;and I was one of them all my life&mdash;who wants any system other than the managerial system but wanting it and having it is one thing.  Take the expense and the upkeep of the primary school, whether heating, cleaning, and the rest of it. That should not devolve altogether on the management.  There are poor parishes where managers find it difficult enough to keep their parishes going.  Further money by way of grants should be given to the managers.  I note it is being done for the painting and interior decoration of schools.  The amount of money for heating and cleaning is very small and it is not sufficient for the heating.</P>
    <P>I understand that in some parts of the country the children sweep out the school.  If the Minister knows of any place where that happens, I would ask him to issue a direct order that it cease immediately.  As in the vocational schools, there should be a person to clean the schools at stated times and to light the fires and have everything in order when the children go into the school.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a great job as far as vocational schools are concerned. It is very urgent that there <Col N="396" /> should be more of them.  Quite a number have been established in different areas but we badly need more.  If a boy or girl does not go any farther than the primary school, the education he receives is not sufficient for the world of today.  It is essential that our boys and girls in the vocational schools obtain the group certificate so that they may become apprentices and learn a trade.  Consider the position of our people down through the years who have had to emigrate.  For the want of a trade, they had to carry the hod for every foreigner.  I am glad something is being done in that matter.</P>
    <P>There are just a few minor matters to which I should like to refer.  In regard to school texts, I understand that it very often happens that one or two chapters are added to a textbook and the book is issued as a new text, which imposes a further expense on the parents.  Both in the primary and secondary schools, the cost of books is very high and where a large family is going to school, it is very important that such expenses should be kept as low as possible.  I would ask the Minister to have his Department look into that matter.</P>
    <P>Another point is that I cannot understand why in our college of commerce, boys and girls may go for their Leaving Certificate but cannot take Latin for a subject.  If they want Latin, they must go outside to study it.  I would ask the Minister to rectify that position as soon as possible because these boys and girls being educated for the Leaving Certificate should be in a position to have Latin taught to them there.  I mentioned this matter a year ago on this Estimate but there does not seem to have been any improvement in the position.</P>
    <P>I also maintain that the rudiments of civics should be taught in every primary school and that in the vocational school and in the secondary school, there should be a proper course of civics, a subject which is very necessary at present.  I hope something can be done in this regard.  Deputy O'Donnell referred to a matter about which I have thought for many years, having taught in a two-teacher school <Col N="397" /> for years.  It is not possible for a teacher in a two-teacher school, no matter how excellent, to give the pupils the same advantages as the pupils in a larger school receive, say, a city school where there is one teacher to one class. If you take the ordinary two-teacher school, the assistant has infants, first and second class, and the principal has third class, fourth class, fifth class, sixth class and often the seventh class. He cannot give those children the same high standard as can be given in the larger city schools.</P>
    <P>Therefore I would ask the Minister if it would be possible to have parish lay schools in which one school in a parish might have five, six or seven teachers and where there would be one teacher to one class.  This would be to the advantage of the children in rural parts and we must consider these children as well as the children in the city schools.  There might be some objections to this but my interest is to see that the children will get the benefit of it.</P>
    <P>At present secondary schools are, if you like, in private hands, but nevertheless some moneys should be given to the people in charge of them in the matter of building schools.  Side by side with that, we should have a number of lay secondary schools.  That is very important because up to the present our secondary schools have been found wanting in mathematics, modern languages and science.  The Minister has made some impovement in this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss the Irish language because I expect that in due course a day or two will be devoted in the Dáil to discussing the report of the Commission on the language.  It is very necessary that irrespective of our political affiliations, we should have an opportunity to discuss our language, how best it can be revived and how best to get the people speaking it as they spoke it in years gone by.  I am looking forward to the day when this will be discussed.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister sincerely on what he has done and what he is doing.  It was a pleasure for some of us connected with vocational education <Col N="398" /> in this city to have been present at the international competition for apprentices at which we had boys from places as distant as Japan.  It was grand to see children of our own schools being able to compete.  I should like to say that it would not have been possible to have had such a success if it had not been for the Minister and it is only fair that he should be thanked.</P>

Is dóigh liom go bhfuil sí as dáta tuairim is trí bliana agus go bhfuil leagadh amach leamh air.  Táim ag iarraidh ar an Aire arís rud a dhéanamh chun tuarascáil trí no cheithre bliana a thabhairt le chéile agus a thabhairt amach ag an am gcéanna.  As sin amach d'fhéadfaí an rud a choimeád in ord agus b'fhéidir go bhféadfaí an tuarascáil a dhéanamh níos tarraingtí agus níos éascaí a léamh ná mar atá sí anois.

    <P>Bhíos ag éisteacht le cainteóirí ón Phartaí Fine Gael agus ón Lucht Oibreachais agus iad araon ag rá go dteastaíonn uathu go mbeadh caoi ag gach páiste a fhéadfadh buntáiste a bhaint as, árd-oideachas a bheith aige agus iolscolaíocht cuimsithe annsin. Dár ndóigh, táimíd ar an dtaobh seo den tuairim chéanna faoin rud sin ach <Col N="399" /> tuigim ón méid a chloisim ó Fhine Gael agus ón Lucht Oibreachais go gceapann siad go bhféadfaí é sin a chur i bhfeidhm ar an bpointe.  Nuair a chloisim sin, measaim go mbhféidir nach bhfuil mórán smaoineamh déanta ag na cainteoirí seo ar an gceist.</P>

    <P>Tá rud eile níos tábhachtaí ná sin. Dá mbeadh an córas i bhfeidhm go mbeadh sé de cheart ag páiste ar bith árd-oideachas a fháil a bhféadfadh buntáiste a bhaint as, tá sé soiléir go mbeadh sé riachtanach líne a tharrac agus ar thaobh amháin bheadh na daoine a gheobhadh árd-oideachas ar chostas an Stáit agus ar an dtaobh eile, na daoine nach raibh sáthach maith le dul ar aghaidh chun árdoideachas a fháil.  Cá h-áit a cuirfear an líne sin?  An mbeidh scrúdú 11 plus againn?  Tá cuid againn nach bhfuil sásta leis sin.  Níl me féin sásta in a thaobh.  Tá droch-cháil air agus sílim go bhfuil an droch-cháil tuillte ag an 11 plus.  Conus a déanfar an deighilt seo?</P>
    <P>Tá ceist eile ann.  An bhfuilimíd chun bac a chur ar dhuine dul ar aghaidh i gcóir árd-oideachais gí nár éirigh leis san scrúdú a shocrófar chun fháil amach cé hiad na daoine is dócha a bhainfeadh buntáiste as árdoideachas?

An ligfear dóibh siúd dul ar aghaidh chun árdoideachas a fháil?  Ceapann a lán daoine gur cóir go ligfí ach má deirimid sin an bhfuilimid sásta go leor airgid a chur ar fáil chun na háiteacha a bheith ann, chun na múinteoirí agus na scoileanna breise a chur ar fáil? An bhfuilimid chun na daoine gur theip orthu sa scrúdú a fhagáil amach nó má ligtear isteach iad an mbeidh ar a dtuismitheoirí ní amháin an gnáchostas <Col N="400" /> atá ann anois a íoc ach costas an méid a tugtar anois mar deontaisí de gach saghas ón Stát?</P>

    <P>Táimse i bhfábhar árd-oideachas a bheith ar fáil do pháiste ar bith gur féidir leis buntáiste a bhaint as ach níl mé sásta go bhfuil na fadhbanna a bhaineann le sin réitithe fós agus, fiú amháin, níl siad scrúdaithe againn.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, in regard to the debate in the Department of Education, we have come by force of circumstance, convention, tradition and administrative arrangement to regard the Minister for Education as having another portfolio which is never mentioned officially, that is, Minister for Irish.  That is unfortunate because the Minister, purely as Minister for Education, has his hands full and indeed any Minister for Irish would have his hands full, too.  However, for the various reasons I have mentioned, it so happens that the question of the Irish language and the Irish revival comes up for discussion every year on the Estimate for the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to go into the <Col N="401" /> details of the language revival in this debate.  We shall get an opportunity in the relatively near future of discussing the whole matter arising out of the Report of the Commission and the Government White Paper which will be issued in due course.  However, there are certain things I feel I should say.  I said before, and I want to repeat, that I accept without question that the Fine Gael Party as a Party are genuinely concerned to see that the Irish language is revived but I do not understand the attitude they adopt towards the revival.  I can well understand that they would be dissatisfied with the progress or the lack of progress, and would endeavour to produce some new approach.  The approach they have produced is, in my opinion weak on almost every count and shows a lack of logic which, if not surprising, is certainly significant.</P>
    <P>As I understand the attitude of the Fine Gael Party, they say that the whole idea of compulsion is retarding the progress of the Irish language. They want to do away with this and they believe that doing away with compulsion will help the language. That is, of course, a tenable point of view.  It has been very ably argued on many occasions.  The question is, however, as to how they propose to implement this: by insisting that Irish not alone be taught in all the schools but be compulsory in all the examinations except the Leaving Certificate; by insisting that Irish be compulsory in all Civil Service examinations other than those for technical positions.</P>
    <P>I may have misunderstood the Fine Gael Party policy, but I do not think I have.  As I understand it, that is what their proposal amounts to in essence.  It seems to me quite illogical to talk about the dreadful effects of compulsion and, at the same time, provide as a remedy something that takes a very small degree of the compulsion out, leaving the bulk of it there.  Either you believe in compulsion or you do not.  If you believe in it then surely you should go the whole way.  If you do not believe in it, then surely you should go the whole way, take it all away, and leave it entirely <Col N="402" /> to voluntary effort.  This business of being half one way and half the other is doing no good, in my opinion, to Irish, and, if I may respectfully suggest so to the members opposite, it is doing no good to the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>There is another line taken by many Fine Gael speakers in discussing Irish and the new Fine Gael approach to the subject.  We had it from Deputy P. O'Donnell here when he led off for the Opposition.  The speakers refer to the voluntary bodies working for the revival of Irish and they mention Comhaltas Uladh, Gael Linn and others.  They say how much they admire the work being done by these people.  They suggest that, if all the efforts of the Government were directed along these lines, the language position today would be much more favourable than it is.  The strange thing is that they admit that these people whom they admire are really familiar with what the problem is.  They suggest the Government might have something to learn from them.  But not one of these groups has ever indicated that they agree with the Fine Gael approach to the revival of Irish.  In fact, a number have indicated that they disagree with that approach.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote now a leaflet issued by Gael Linn just before the last general election.  They issued leaflets with a statement from the Fianna Fáil Party, a statement from the Fine Gael Party, and a statement from the Labour Party with regard to their attitude towards Irish.  They quoted a speech made by Deputy Dillon on 3rd October, 1961, and they added this note:</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that in the foregoing, and in other Fine Gael preelection speeches, reference was made to Gael Linn, we had to clarify our position in the following statement issued on October 3rd.</P>
    <P>Gael Linn does not wish to be involved in Party political controversy, especially at election-time, and, therefore, we did not so far comment on Mr. J.M. Dillon's recent Party statement in relation to Irish, although Mr. Dillon in that statement expressed the hope that we <Col N="403" /> would approve of his proposals.  It has now come to our information that certain people believe that Fine Gael have our support seeing that Mr. Dillon has again, in a broadcast and elsewhere, referred to us.  This is not so.  Gael Linn has consistently advocated a more enlightened and progressive policy towards Irish.  Unfortunately Mr. Dillon's proposals cannot be regarded as such.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party would, I believe, serve a much more useful purpose from their own point of view, and particularly from the point of view of the language revival, if they would concentrate their dissatisfaction with the present position on constructive remedies.</P>
    <P>While there are many points on which one can make suggestions, there are two basic problems to which we require solutions.  One is the undoubted and appalling fact that, having spent so many years at school learning Irish, many of our children emerge, even from the Leaving Certicate with honours, unable to speak the language.  That clearly is something about which something must be done, and quickly.  The other major problem is that, even when children have learned to speak Irish, when they leave school the majority of them do not speak it and do not get any opportunity to speak it.  These are two major problems retarding the revival of Irish.  If the Fine Gael Party have constructive proposals to make in these matters, the country will be very grateful to them.</P>
    <P>I want to criticise now something Deputy P. O'Donnell said in this debate.  I have heard him make the same statement on other occasions. From something Deputy Coogan said, I think Deputy Coogan agrees with Deputy O'Donnell.  Deputy O'Donnell objects to what he describes as Civil Service Irish.  He seems to be of the opinion that Irish which is not used every day in the Gaeltacht is not Irish at all: it is made up and no one should listen to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The people in the Gaeltacht would not understand the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="404" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>They do understand me. I am understood in every Gaeltacht in the country.  Now as I have said, Deputy O'Donnell objects to this Irish. That type of objection betrays an appalling lack of confidence in the revival of the language.  It also conveys to me the idea that Deputy O'Donnell is not in touch with the problem. Surely, if one wants to revive Irish, one cannot expect that the language will simply be that used in a remote rural area.  Such a language is necessarily limited to the needs of the people living in the area.  A modern, living language must be capable of dealing with every aspect of the twentieth century in an urban environment.  To accept Deputy O'Donnell's contention would be to condemn Irish to being confined for evermore to a language used in a remote rural area.  One is entitled, I suppose, to take that view but one is not entitled, on that view, to expect to see Irish revived.  It is perfectly obvious that the revival must come from Dublin, not from the Gaeltacht, or anywhere else.  This idea may be new to Deputy Coogan.  I advise him to start thinking about it.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, a danger.  It has been a danger for a considerable time. You have people coming from the Gaeltacht to Dublin behaving as if Irish were their own personal property. The Irish language is the heritage of all the Irish people, including my constituents in Dublin North-East, and I will not concede to anybody from any Gaeltacht area that he has any greater right to the language than the people in Dublin have.  Anybody thinking logically about the matter must see that, if Irish is to be revived, it can be revived only if Irish is spoken in the larger centres of population, and particularly in Dublin.  I am not saying that the Gaeltacht is not important.  It is of the greatest importance.  If it dies before we can get Irish to take on in the rest of the country, we are in grave danger of losing the language entirely.  But to imagine Irish can be revived as long as the Gaeltacht is kept alive is just chasing rainbows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To finish on the subject of Irish, on which I have spent more time than I <Col N="405" /> intended, we all realise the problem is that our children are coming out of school unable to speak Irish, although they can write and read it.  The Minister took an important step by introducing the oral Irish test in the Leaving Certificate some years ago.  I know the administrative problems involved, but I want to urge on him the absolute priority of bringing in oral Irish tests for the Intermediate Certificate and Primary Certificate so long as that examination is held.</P>
    <P>We must concentrate on teaching our children to speak the language. The rest can follow.  We are not doing that at the moment.  It is true to say that the standard of oral Irish among many of our children&mdash;and, I think, it follows, the standard of teaching&mdash;is absolutely appalling.  When you can find children who have been learning Irish for years but are unable to put a sentence together, there is something wrong somewhere.  I want to urge the Minister to take every step possible to deal with that, even to the extent of considering in the Leaving Certificate for a certain number of years making the passing of the oral Irish examination compulsory and the passing of the written part of the examination not compulsory.  I would go so far in an effort to ensure we teach the children to speak Irish, which is the most important and first step in reviving the language.</P>
    <P>To leave that subject, I want to say a word about the comprehensive schools the Minister announced some time ago.  I regard the Minister's proposals on comprehensive schools as representing a vital break-through in our efforts to modernise and improve our educational system.  Many people imagine the Minister has produced something absolutely revolutionary.  Indeed, certain aspects of this show a most refreshing approach to the whole problem of education and a complete change from what we have been used to.</P>
    <P>I want to make a point which may not be generally realised.  What the Minister is doing is extending a natural growth.  I know of cases in certain areas where the secondary and vocational schools have been cooperating in the provision of classes. <Col N="406" /> The comprehensive school is simply extending and putting on an official and regular basis a process naturally occurring at present.  Apart from the intrinsic educational merits of the comprehensive schools, one of the great virtues I see in them is that they constitute a considerable weapon in the effort to break down the snob value of the secondary schools which undoubtedly exists.  No matter how good a vocational school is, an adjoining secondary school has a social value far in excess of it.</P>
    <P>For this reason, and because I hope the comprehensive schools will help to break down this barrier, I want to ask the Minister to reconsider part of his proposal.  He proposes that as a result of the comprehensive schools, some of the students would obtain a technical Leaving Certificate.  I want to urge him to take a different approach to this and to ensure that the ordinary Leaving Certificate available at present will be the one obtained by any student from the comprehensive school, whether he takes the technological subjects or not.  There is no reason why the Leaving Certificate should not be a general certificate available to any student.  One student might major in the Humanities, another in science and another in business and commerce.  But when a student finishes, he should have the same certificate as any other student. Where the subjects are common&mdash;for instance, in the case of the basic subjects like Irish, English, and, perhaps, mathematics &mdash; the actual examination papers should be the same for all classes of these students. The certificate issued should be the same, so that somebody who goes to a comprehensive school will finish up with a Leaving Certificate that is of exactly the same standard as somebody who goes to a secondary school and finishes up with a Leaving Certificate. This is of great psychological and social importance.  Indeed, it may have certain educational merits, and I am not aware of any demerits educationally.  Therefore, I would urge the Minister to consider this aspect.</P>
    <P>I think the reason for the Minister's proposal is that he has in mind a <Col N="407" /> certain amount of screening at Intermediate Certificate level.  Insofar as there is to be screening, has the Minister considered what standards will be laid down and whether they will be made public&mdash;the standards by which it will be decided that a particular student is more suited to one branch than another?  It is important to know what test will be applied.  Having laid down the test, it is also important that it is not imposed on anybody, that it is simply made available, that people are told they are fitted for this or that but that nobody can force somebody to take a particular course.</P>
    <P>One of the revolutionary aspects of the statement by the Minister on comprehensive schools was in regard to the psychological tests that would be involved. This is an excellent idea, very badly needed.  I wonder are there sufficient qualified people in the country to conduct these tests?  I should like to be sure that the tests to be applied will be based on standardised tests related to the children of this country and not tests related to other countries.  I know it has been found that when such tests were applied here, they did not suit our children.  By certain tests prepared in Britain and America, all our children would appear to be sub-normal.  That is obviously not so.  The reason is that the tests used were not related to the standards in this country.  There is a good deal of technical and scientific work to be done in this regard.  This might entail the setting up of some kind of psychological research institute which would prepare these tests, standardise them, grade them and interpret the results, all of which is a very specialised occupation.  If the Minister would consider this, I would hope he would have in mind ultimately the extension of these psychological and aptitude tests to all our schools.</P>
    <P>I should like to see them conducted at intervals of a year or two years from the time the child starts going to school, so that we could have all these reports available, have them assessed by someone competent to do so, and have the results of the assessment, together with the teachers' reports, and <Col N="408" /> the examination results, all made available to the parents when the child finished school, so that the parents could decide where the child should go, what direction he should take, and whether he was likely to succeed in that direction.  It goes without saying that this should simply be advice to the parents, and not compulsion on anyone.  There are great possibilities in that if the Minister could develop it, and perhaps, arising out of the work of the compulsory schools, he might lay the foundation for its extension to all schools.</P>
    <P>I have referred to parents once or twice and I want to say that, in my opinion, a lot of lip-service is paid to the primary rights and duties of parents in regard to education.  I do not think it unfair to say that interest by parents in education is actively discouraged by the teachers, the churches and the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, they are regarded as interlopers.  That is a shocking state of affairs, especially in a Christian country where we are taught, as part of our religion, that the obligation, the responsibility and the right of educating one's children is vested primarily in the parents, and that the State has no right to interfere except to lay down certain specific standards.  That is basic teaching in regard to this matter, but how does it work out in practice?</P>
      <P>As I say, in the main, parents are regarded as interlopers.  I know this is a very vexed question, but it is one about which I feel very strongly.  I am sure Deputy Barron will have a fit, as a teacher, when he hears what I have to say next.  I feel that the Minister should take active steps to encourage the foundation of parents' committees. I know the Minister is certainly not opposed to that idea.  He has dealt with this problem before, but I rather have the impression that he said: &ldquo;I certainly am not standing in the way of anyone forming parents' committees,&rdquo; but I want to urge him to actively encourage them.  They will be unable to succeed unless the Minister pushes them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> Grave difficulties are involved, particularly for the teachers and managers and others, but these committees have worked in other countries, and in certain parts of this country in certain schools.  If their rights are laid down clearly at the beginning, and if where they can go is laid down, I feel there is a great potential for good in the formation of such committees.  The parents would know what the teachers are trying to do, and what their aim is in regard to particular subjects.  The teachers would get the co-operation of the parents which is so necessary to get the best out of the children.  I have no doubt many parents' committees would provide the teachers with many facilities which they are crying out for at the moment, and which they do not see themselves getting to aid them for many years.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see the parents' committees used, as some are, solely as fund-raising committees.  That is a separate function.  Deputy Byrne spoke about that, and there is a lot to be said for his point of view.  If you want a fund-raising committee, let it be a fund-raising committee and do not call it a parents' committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barron urged some form of integration between the various branches of education.  I heartily agree with him.  I think all the branches of education, primary, secondary, vocational and university, should be integrated and work together in a centrally designed plan, if you like. The resources of this country are far too small to be squandered on this kind of duplication, overlapping and competition which goes on at present, in some cases.</P>
    <P>One example, which I understand is becoming less common, is that in certain primary schools, children are kept on to do an unnecessary year's work for some reason about the average and not letting them into the vocational schools.  This usually happens where secondary schools are not available.  I understand steps have been taken and that it is less frequent, but it is the kind of thing that should not happen.  Children should come first and not the situation of the primary <Col N="410" /> school involved.  If there were co-operation between all branches of our educational system, that could not happen, and automatically when the child had finished in primary school, he would go into the next branch, whichever it was.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the secondary school course is geared, officially and practically, to the universities and the seminaries but, in fact, the majority of our secondary school students do not go to the universities or the seminaries. For that reason, I want to urge again on the Minister what I mentioned a while ago, that he should consider dividing up the Leaving Certificate in such a way that one could major in the Humanities and science, or in business and industry and commerce into which most of our secondary school students go.  They leave school utterly and absolutely untrained for business.  If most of them are to go into business, why should they be sent out almost as labourers in this field?</P>
    <P>Do not misunderstand me, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I am not against a liberal education, but I am against education being provided on such a liberal basis that the majority of our secondary school students become the hewers of wood and the drawers of water in the commerce field.  For that reason, I want to see the secondary schools making provision in the Leaving Certificate for those who want an opportunity of doing a major examination in business and commerce, and also taking papers at a minor level in the other branches I mentioned, the Humanities and science.  That would involve reducing the marks for the classics.  It would also involve getting the universities to alter some of their entrance requirements.</P>
    <P>Some people may say I am urging interference with the autonomy of the universities.  I do not think I am, but if I am, I still urge it.  I believe the universities have a moral and social obligation.  Even if they never got any money from the State, they would have that obligation, but they get such substantial sums from the State that the Minister is entitled to expect that our whole educational system, including the universities and their entrance <Col N="411" /> requirements, should be co-ordinated.</P>
    <P>I understand that examinations in secondary schools have to be held on particular dates in order to tie in with the requirements of the universities. That kind of thing is wrong.  There should be no doubt&mdash;and it should be made quite clear&mdash;that this House feels the Minister has a right and a duty to ensure in regard to the universities, or anywhere else, that the syllabus and the entrance requirements are regulated and tied in with the rest of the educational system, and not to have the whole thing working in separate compartments and nobody knowing in the one what is being done in the other until the unfortunate student comes up against it.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I want to mention.  There seems to be a certain doubt where in a particular area a primary school is needed as to who is supposed to take the initiative to have that school provided.  I probably know more about it than the average person, but it seems to me, too, that in practice the Department may agree there should be a school in an area, the parents may agree, but if the putative manager is disabled or old and does not want to take on the burden&mdash; and it is a considerable burden&mdash;you may find that area going without a school for many years.</P>
    <P>This is something which I am afraid just cannot be tolerated any longer.  I am not saying it is happening all over the country, but it is happening in certain areas and it is serious enough to merit protest in this House.  I am urging the Minister to take whatever steps are necessary to see it does not continue.  The position is that in theory the Department can do something but in practice it is very difficult for them.  That being so, I would urge the Minister to see what further powers he needs to deal with the matter easily.</P>

      <P>With regard to the training of teachers, I would urge, as I have done before, that the aim should be that our primary and secondary teachers, perhaps all our teachers, should have a university degree, plus the level of teaching training the primary teacher now has, because I think the primary teacher gets a much better training and teaching than anybody else, though not a university degree.  We should aim at a combination of the two, or at least on a greater degree of interchangeability among teachers.</P>
      <P>It can, and, I think, does, happen in secondary schools that a teacher with a degree who is qualified in certain subjects teaches subjects in which he is not qualified at all.  This is something that should not be tolerated and I would ask the Minister to consider remedying it.  Would it mean the employment of many more teachers or would it mean just a small number of extra teachers?  I am sure the Minister has already considered this, and would he therefore tell us what would be involved in providing a system in which no teacher would teach in secondary schools subjects in which he is not qualified.</P>
      <P>Many of our primary schools are small one- or two-teacher schools.  The effect of this is that each teacher is teaching perhaps two or three classes. I understand the primary teacher, despite the good training he gets, is not trained in the art of teaching more than one class at a time.  If this is so, I would urge that some training be given to primary teachers to deal with that situation, because there must be a different technique involved.  It may be that urging this is a confession of failure but the fact is that a majority of our schools are one- or two-teacher schools and we have got to have our teachers geared to deal with that situation until we are able to change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been complaints about the methods of teaching history.  I do not want to go into all the pros and <Col N="413" /> cons but I would urge the Minister to give serious reconsideration to the whole approach to the teaching of history.  When I went to school&mdash;and I do not think the system has changed in the meantime&mdash;we spent a very long time learning early history, remote history from 1000 A.D. to about 1700 or 1800, and very little of history from 1800 on.</P>

      <P>The Minister should consider having the teaching of Irish and world history confined to a more recent date, say, the last three or four hundred years, and let the more early history be dealt with at the advanced levels, even in the universities.  The amount of time children spend learning what happened, or is alleged to have happened, in Ireland before Christ, is, I think, most unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>In the situation in which we find ourselves to-day, management training is something we are all agreed is essential, but as far as I know a boy who leaves secondary school and decides he wants to train as a manager has not got a course to go to there and then.  It may be the Minister would consider whether management courses would be provided to which a boy could go soon after leaving secondary school when he had made up his mind he wanted to study the subject which is a very complicated one.</P>
      <P>Another related matter, which is referred to from time to time and urged on the Minister, is the question of career guidance.  We had a report some time ago from the Council of Education on this subject which I can only describe as lamentable and completely out of touch with the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage I do not urge the Minister to do anything elaborate in the matter of career guidance but I would commend to him the system <Col N="414" /> which is used in Northern Ireland where simple leaflets are issued to the children telling them a little about the various jobs but mainly telling them what jobs exist.  The children here do not know what jobs exist for which they will be suitable and accordingly I would urge that this basic information be provided.</P>
    <P>I would urge also that some form of general science course be made essential for all students.  It is now generally agreed that some basic knowledge of science is essential for the ordinary man of the 1970s.  We should start providing it now.  It does not have to be an elaborate course.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the old chestnut the Minister has had before&mdash;that of civics. I know the Minister is interested in this and I feel we could combine with civics such things as a critical appreciation of music, of films, of television and the development of a critical faculty in regard to most subjects, one of the things we lack very much.</P>
    <P>This is something that can come only from the education provided in our schools.  It is a long term thing. A combination of civics and the development of a critical faculty is something which might be more effectively attempted in schools television than in any other form and the Minister might consider this as one of the subjects to be provided in the new television programme for schools.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is well aware, there have been considerable changes in the teaching of mathematics and even in the type of mathematics taught in other countries.  The Minister showed considerable foresight some years ago in sending teachers and others to the United States to study these courses.  I take it, it was as a result of that that the proposal he had for changing the course came about.  I shall not enter into the pros and cons of whether that was properly prepared or not but I urge the Minister to urge his Department to be a little elastic about mathematics. There are various methods in vogue at the moment for teaching mathematics and in one of these I became very interested.  It is known as the Trachtenberg method which, no matter how admirable its features, <Col N="415" /> could not be taught in our schools at present as it does not conform to the Department's requirements.  The net effect is the same: you learn mathematics but you learn them in a different way.  I urge the Minister if he gets a proposal from a competent teacher who wants to use some of these methods and if he is satisfied about the reliability of the method, although it is not used in this country, to allow the teacher to use it and, indeed, should show considerable interest in it and apply various tests to see whether it is better than the existing methods we use.</P>
    <P>On the question of extending the school year, particularly in the senior classes, I know this is a subject dear to the Minister's heart and I think most people agree that the amount of time for which the schools, particularly the senior schools, are closed is indefensible.  I assure the Minister that he has the support of most thinking people and, I think, of most members of the public in trying to ensure that the classes are considerably extended so that more time will be spent in class than at present.</P>
    <P>Finally, I shall mention a matter arising out of a seminar I attended some time ago, at which the Minister presided for portion of the time, and which some members of the House also attended.  Two things struck me and I have been making inquiries since about them and I understand there is reason for advocating them.</P>
    <P>There may be some doubt whether this is a matter for the Minister but, to some extent, it certainly is because much of the research is carried out in universities.  Some of it may come under the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I suggest that where people find themselves doing basic research, they should not have to spend perhaps many months, or a great deal of effort in ascertaining whether the particular research they are given to do has not already been done in some part of the world.  There are certain fields in which it is impossible to find out and the only remedy I can see is to set up some sort of central technical library where anybody can discover what <Col N="416" /> research has been done and what results are available.  This might be expensive but in the long run it will be an economy because we should not have people wasting research grants doing work&mdash;first, having to look to see if the work has been done or not&mdash; which has already been done.  This is unnecessary duplication which we cannot afford.  It would be money well spent to set up a central technical library which will make available to everybody engaged on research information about what work has been done, what stage has been reached and what has still to be done.</P>
    <P>Allied to that, I suggest the formation of a central information service to make information available on the availability of research grants and scholarships.  There are many of these available, particularly from the US, and I think the information should be available to students so that some brilliant student who might avail of one of these if he knew of them will not take a job instead just as if these facilities did not exist.  One of the bright young men who avail of these grants may turn out to be another Einstein.  Since these facilities are available, we should take advantage of them and our students should know of their existence and have an opportunity of applying for them.</P>
    <P>This is one of the most exciting times we could have in education. The challenge is very great but the prizes are greater still.  It is a great consolation to me and many others to know that at this time the Minister in charge of education is far-sighted and clear-thinking and realises that education involves the development of the whole mind, physically, mentally, morally and socially.  What is most required here in addition to the qualities I have mentioned is strong leadership and I think the Minister has shown he is capable of giving it.  He may have to show even stronger leadership in the future.  I feel confident that if he does, he will get full support from all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>Fan noimeat.  An dtuigeann tú í?  An bhfuil an blas agat?  It is well to teach the different subjects but one of the most important things is to teach road sense first. It is wonderful for our children to have languages and degrees but if they are crippled for life, what good is it? We cannot overstress the importance of road sense.  We can see the great work done by some teachers in the behaviour in the children coming home from school when they walk on the right hand side of the road facing the traffic.  The Minister should encourage that type of teaching in other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>Physical culture is also very important and so is civic spirit, which is greatly lacking today.  A great deal could be done with the children in school.  First aid is also important and, while I know a certain amount of it is being taught, I think the instruction should go further in that regard. The curriculum may be overloaded but, if so, use might be made of television to teach such subjects on one or two nights a week.  It would be a very suitable medium.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned here before the importance of career guidance.  Parents as well as children have to be guided to prevent a square peg being put into a round hole, to see that the right job is filled by the right child.  I would ask the Minister to do all he can in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the Irish language.  I was amazed to hear the last speaker saying that the revival would have to start from Dublin.  I have often listened to Irish speakers from Dublin and the native speakers of Irish who were present had not a clue as to what they were talking about.  If you want to save the language, it is important to start, not in Dublin, but in the Gaetacht.  It is imperative that the native speakers should be retained in this country.  The cradle of the language, the Gaeltacht, is being denuded.  There is no use in talking about what will be done or what has been done.  Until such time as the people in the Gaeltacht can be assured of a livelihood in the Gaeltacht, <Col N="418" /> I would suggest they should be taught English, that they should be prepared for the British market to which they are going, so that they will not be the carriers of the hod all the time.  People from the Gaeltacht come into the town of Galway and they have not a word of English.  They come in to acquire a knowledge of English in order to fit themselves for the English market.  I have ample evidence of that.</P>
    <P>The Irish speakers in this country are comprised as to 75 per cent of native speakers, as to 15 per cent of enthusiasts and as to ten per cent of the greatest hypocrites this world ever produced, who are cashing in on the language and killing it.  But for the good work being done by the few enthusiasts, I do not think there would be much Irish spoken.</P>
    <P>I smiled when I heard the Deputy say a minute ago that the revival would have to come from Dublin.  For the past ten years, since I was first elected to the Dáil, I have not heard a word of Irish spoken in the streets of Dublin.  If I tried to find somebody who spoke the language, I would find that it was some well-paid official who spoke it or somebody who had to learn Irish for his job.  Is mór an náire go bhfuil an scéal amhlaidh. Day in and day out, constituents of mine who cannot speak a word of English come in to me.  They feel embarrassed when they come into the town of Galway.  They feel more embarrassed still when they have to emigrate.  It is an awful situation that many of them could not even go to confession in England, that the priest had to follow them out in order to cater for them.  If a man's soul has to be saved as well as his life he is entitled to have at least a smattering of English.  We fight an uphill battle, sandwiched as we are between two English-speaking countries.  That may not have been of such importance 30 years ago but now when distance is measured in minutes and hours, it assumes greater significance.  If you want to save the language, save the Irish speakers.</P>
    <P>The report on the Irish language reminds me of the kiss of life, an <Col N="419" /> effort to revive.  It reminds me also of locking the stable door when the horse is gone.  After 30 years of Fianna Fáil great effort, what progress have we made?  I heard more Irish spoken 30 years ago in the town of Galway than I hear in five years now. If I wanted to hear the national language spoken, I would have to go deep into my constituency.  There is more Irish spoken to-day in Coventry and Birmingham than there is in the entire Gaeltacht.  That is due to Fianna Fáil policy.  It is the result of what they were going to do for the people.</P>

      <P>Let us consider the position of the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to the Irish language.  Take the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil.  Start with the Taoiseach.  I should like to know how much Irish the Taoiseach has.  I would safely say that half of the members on the Front Bench cannot speak Irish.  I would say that about 15 per cent of the backbenchers cannot speak Irish.  I do not say that they are all failures in that respect.  There are many of them who call themselves &ldquo;Seán&rdquo; who were called &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; and &ldquo;John&rdquo; at one time.</P>
      <P>A grant of £5 is given to school children coming from Irish-speaking homes for proficiency in Irish.  That is a good thing but it would be much better if that grant were given to childdren coming from English-speaking homes for proficiency in Irish.  That would be an inducement to learn the language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of compulsion, I want to say that you can lead an Irishman but you cannot drive him.  That is where the failure of the Fianna Fáil effort lies, that is, if there is any sincerity in that effort.  Let us test the sincerity.  How many Deputies or Ministers in the last election put the <Col N="420" /> Irish form of their names on the ballot paper?  I challenge any of them. Of course that would affect their jobs. That is the Deputies' sincerity.  Let us see what they will do in that regard in the coming election.  Possibly,, a man with a name starting with &ldquo;Z&rdquo; will put the Irish form of his name on the ballot paper, if that would bring his name up to the top of the paper.</P>

      <P>I have tested the sincerity of those who are trying to teach us Irish.  The trouble in this country is that Fianna Fáil have made the language a tool and have played their part in killing it.  They can accept responsibility for that.</P>
      <P>The Commission set up to report on the Irish language was like all other commissions set up to handle problems, such as the itinerancy problem, when there is a matter which it is distasteful to the Government to face up to.  Then they can say: &ldquo;Do not blame us for what they say; we need not adopt it if we do not like&rdquo;.  I regret to say that in my city, where we had a full Irish-speaking battalion in the Army, one can count on one's fingers the number of Irish speakers in that battalion now.  It is very regrettable agus is mór an náire é gur thánaig an lá sin.  The importance of the Irish language was proved in the Congo.  It saved the lives of our troops there.  When wires were tapped and when information was being looked for they did not know what was being said through the medium of Irish.  It is a fine thing that our language played a very important part in the fighting by our Irish troops in the Congo.  I am glad that men from the First Battalion were in that fight and that the language played its part in helping them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement in regard to the setting-up of a college of technology.  He mentioned Galway as one of the places concerned.  I can assure him he will get every support from us.  He has already been invited to do it by the City of Galway Vocational Education Committee, of which I have the honour to be a member.  I assure the Minister he will receive the <Col N="421" /> full support of that committee and of all sections of our community.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress again the importance of civic spirit, physical culture and road sense.  If we went further and added possibly boxing, the manly art, or even judo we might have less of &ldquo;The Twist&rdquo;, and so on.  Physical culture will help to keep a lot of our youth from going soft as unfortunately there is a lot of that today.</P>

      <P>It is strange that we are discussing an Estimate for the Department of Education and that in a month or two we shall again be discussing an Estimate for the Department of Education.  As so many Deputies from all Parties, including the Labour Party, have dwelt in detail on the aspects of this important Vote I think that to await the introduction of the forthcoming Estimate would be more important than a discussion of an Estimate which is now almost 12 months old.  I know that that is not the fault of the Minister: perhaps it is the fault of the House.  It is anything but satisfactory to find oneself discussing an ancient Estimate, as it were.</P>
      <P>The first point I want to deal with concerns our national schools.  Perhaps we shall know shortly from the Minister what progress will be made in connection with this type of school building and whether it will speed up the erection of schools in rural areas.  Undoubtedly the Minister has a big task in providing adequate schools and in improving many of the others in every county.  If his new proposal will help this serious situation it would be well that we should know it.</P>
      <P>We have a serious problem as regards sanitation in many rural schools. I fail to understand why grants are not being made for this purpose.  I do not hold the present Minister responsible for this position as every Minister for Education of every Government in this State seems to have adopted the line of not allowing grants for water supplies in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some years past any person can get a grant towards the cost of the installation of a water supply.  Yet, the Reverend Manager must provide the <Col N="422" /> money for a water supply in every school in his parish and that money must come from the parish.  In most respects, conditions in schools in rural areas are good but in certain schools the sanitary conditions are appalling. The Cork County Medical Officer of Health reports on conditions in the schools.  The report may point out that everything is in fairly good order in most schools but there is a question mark about sanitation.  Would it be possible to form local committees?  It would be of immense importance and great help if the Reverend Manager had the co-operation of a committee comprising the parents of the children of the parish and the teachers with the Reverend Manager in charge.  I am sure such co-operation would be forthcoming in most parishes.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that the local committee should have full powers to deal with everything, far from it, but there are many instances where improvements to schools could be made without having to approach the Minister or his Department.  With commonsense and an understanding of the problems, some of our schools which seem drab can be improved by voluntary effort and voluntary help.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan mentioned career guidance officers.  That is another aspect in which the co-operation of a local committee and a full understanding by all concerned in the parish can help.  The tragedy all down the years has been that frequently the parents of a boy or girl leaving a national school do not know what the ability of their child amounts to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress, I adverted to the fact that there were many people, young and old, who suffered from some physical disability and in a number of instances this disablement lasted from the cradle to the grave.  As a civilised community, we have always more or less agreed that those in a sound financial position should try to assist those who are not so circumstanced, in particular the infirm and the sick and especially the disabled.  In 1954, when the Health Act was introduced, it was the first time that many of these people received any financial assistance whatever.  Indeed, except in rare instances when some of them had received home assistance they would not have received anything up to that time and their families or relatives were saddled with the burden of looking after them as well as trying to fend for themselves.</P>
      <P>That, too, would have been about the first time that local county councils got any idea of the great number of these people in each county.  It is reasonable then to expect that at a time when many increases are being granted these people should not be forgotten.  I feel that many of the local authorities are not living up to their full obligations in this matter because I understand that the payment of this disability allowance is a 50 per cent effort between the Government and the local authority and I am aware also that many local authorities are not paying the full amount that they are allowed to pay. I believe the vast majority of the local authorities would welcome something similar to what is advocated in this motion.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this motion and the sentiments expressed in it.  The introduction of disabled persons' allowances was very well received in necessitous homes as they helped to cushion in some measure the extreme hardships which existed in those homes, not alone in Dublin city but throughout the country, where unfortunate members of families suffered from a disablement or an incapacity of a permanent or <Col N="424" /> semi-permanent nature.  I feel that with the improved economic conditions, the Government will find some means of increasing the allowances to these people.  Other services directly administered by the Government have been increased appropriately, such as the social welfare benefits, and I do not see why this class should be left out.</P>
      <P>One matter to which I should like to refer is the question of eligibility. It is the responsibility of the local authority to determine an applicant's eligibility and if they examine his circumstances and he is disallowed there is no means whereby he can appeal.  I would suggest to the Minister, if he has a function in this matter, that he should arrange for an appeals officer or some independent person to review cases in which applications are disallowed.</P>

They are some of the people who have been passed by in this affluent society which was mentioned by a previous Deputy. They have been hit very hard by the steep rise in the cost of living which was caused by the Minister, his colleagues, the Taoiseach and their turnover tax.  That is the real nigger in the woodpile.  I am sure the Minister is holding something back from us, that he wants to be able to come in like Santa Claus, or the man who put in his thumb and pulled out a plum, and that he will say that he is going to give these unfortunate people a substantial rise.  I am sure he is not going to do it because I am asking him but he surely must listen to the appeals of his colleagues in the back benches of Fianna Fáil and to his staunch supporter Deputy Frank Sherwin.  I will leave the Minister to it and we will expect him to say a word.</P>

      <P>This is the type of motion which is always welcomed by this side of the House because it has always been our policy down through the years to ameliorate the lot of the poorer and weaker sections of our community.  In that regard we have always had the courage to make provision for the money necessary to improve the circumstances of such people by giving improved social welfare benefits.  Now, when it comes to getting the money, Opposition Deputies are not always eager to vote for the money.  They play a different tune then and we are treated to hypocrisy of the deepest dye.  We are concerned for the wellbeing of all our people, always leaning towards the weaker sections.</P>

He is prepared to vote for increased taxation in order to give these people increased social welfare benefits.  We are anxious to increase social services and we are prepared to raise the taxation necessary to do so.  The Opposition want better social services but they are not prepared to vote for the taxation necessary to give those improved services.  I welcome any advance in social services and, so far as the national resources permit it, we, in Fianna Fáil, will continue to improve social services.  I trust our friends on the other side of the House will support us in that and vote for the increased taxation necessary to implement that desirable policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Sherwin on tabling this motion. It is timely; in fact, it is overdue.  When men and women reach an age at which work is no longer regarded as desirable for them, even though they may be in perfect health, a pension is provided. If a person becomes blind, a pension is provided.  If a man loses both his legs and becomes totally incapacitated, no provision is made by the State.  If he is an insured worker, and meets with an accident, he may possibly recover compensation.  Those with whom this motion deals are the most neglected section of our community. We all know that 25/- has very little value today.  Secondly, a disabled person needs someone to take care of him and, therefore, two people are affected.  The least we should do is to ensure that these people will not live in poverty and penury.  I do not believe it would cause any great dislocation of national finances if we provided properly for these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="427" /> We are not a nation of invalids.  We are an active, virile race.  I am sure the Minister knows from his records that the numbers in receipt of disability benefit are not by any means out of proportion to our population as a whole.  I see no reason why these people should not be cared for by the State in the same way as the aged and the blind, or those who obtain disability benefit through insurance.  It is all very well to throw this over on to local authorities, but opinions are widely divergent in such bodies.  In many cases people with identical means and circumstances get completely different allowances.</P>

      <P>It deals with those who are paid 25/- by the local authority. I fail to see why the local authority should be in a position to decide that one person should get one rate and another another rate.  This should be the same as the non-contributory old age pension.  It would be no great strain on the finances of the State if the Minister took steps to implement this motion.  That may take a little time, but the present situation is a travesty of justice, and that in an allegedly Christian and Catholic country, which is supposed to be a shining light to the rest of the world. These unfortunate people have to come like paupers craving a pittance from the local assistance officers.  I appeal to the Minister to implement the motion.  I believe he will have the backing of the House if he does so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion as I support any motion which aims at improving the lot of the poor.  I agree with Deputy Leneghan.  Not only do these people need sufficient on which to live but there is also the need for others to devote the whole or part of their time to looking after these physically as well.  They have as good a case to draw on State funds for their financial support as people who have <Col N="428" /> reached 70 and are not contributing to any pension fund or people who have had the misfortune to suffer blindness.</P>
      <P>All of us would agree that the most in need should have first call on whatever funds are available.  I cannot agree with Deputy Burke, however, that this matter can be dealt with only at Budget time.  We had the example of the announcement to-day of the 12 per cent increase for civil servants.  I quite agree with that&mdash;they are entitled to it&mdash;but it is no answer to say there is no money there and, unless the Opposition are prepared to vote for the necessary taxation, no money can be provided for these needy sections. If it were ever necessary to impose a special tax for these people, we in the Labour Party would be proud to support it.  When in the past taxation was introduced to aid specific classes, we were always prepared to make the money available.  I agree with the motion and I feel an increase for this section is long overdue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand these allowances have been increased to 27/6d. as from 1st November.  The local authorities are called upon to pay half the cost of disabled persons' maintenance allowances.  Normally, they supplement the allowance in deserving cases out of home assistance.  In some cases, I understand, the local authorities have been criticised for abating the amount payable by way of home assistance.  That practice should be stopped.  It is of no benefit to the holder of the allowance if it is increased at Government level and decreased by the local authority.  In most cases, if the applicant is deserving, the local authority does supplement the allowance and the amount generally paid is 25/-, now 27/6d., augmented by a subvention out of home assistance of normally 10/- but sometimes 15/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find myself in favour of this motion of Deputy Sherwin, but I think most of the local authorities who have to pay 50 per cent of the cost out of the rates are liable to &ldquo;kick&rdquo;.  I would have no objection to having it increased to 35/- a week if the State footed the bill.  This is the time of the <Col N="429" /> year when local authorities have to prepare their estimates.  With rising rates, they find it difficult to meet allowances of this kind.  If the allowances were paid out of central funds, with no obligation on the local authority to pay the 50 per cent, it would be a different matter entirely. It is much cheaper for a local authority to pay the person who qualifies for one of these allowances the full amount of 27/6d. than to pay for the maintenance of that person in an institution, usually a county home.  We should encourage the payment of higher allowances to keep people out of the county homes, where the cost of maintenance is far greater than 27/6d. or 25/-.  The usual figure is £2 10s a week and in some cases £3, depending on the costings of a particular county home.</P>
    <P>A case could be made for paying these people the same benefits as blind persons or the holders of non-contributory old age pensions.  Since this scheme of allowances was introduced, there have been three increases and, as far as my memory serves me, all three were given by this Government. I appeal to the Minister that, if he gives any increase to this category, he will relieve the local authority of the obligation to meet 50 per cent of the cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall intervene since apparently Fine Gael are preserving their usual ambiguous silence in relation to this matter.  They put up a Deputy&mdash;a Deputy who was extraordinarily vocal at Question Time, interrupting the proceedings very frequently with irrelevant and sometimes.  I am sorry to say, ridiculous questions&mdash;to give lip service to the principle enunciated in this motion.  The crocodile tears which Deputy Lynch shed for the unfortunate disabled persons, to whom this motion refers, caused me to throw my mind back to the year 1953 when the Health Act was before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the spectacle then of Deputy <Col N="430" /> Lynch and his colleagues in opposition on the Fine Gael benches opposing the Act and opposing this section under which these allowances are being granted.  At that time the maximum permissible allowance payable to a disabled person for maintenance was 20/- a week.  It was not, perhaps, as much as some of us would have liked, but it was very much higher than the disabled persons were getting prior to the enactment of the Health Act, 1953. Before that, the persons to whom the motion relates had no other succour, no other assistance, no other help except what they could get through the home assistance officer from the home assistance authority.  Their maintenance and assistance was entirely dependent upon the judgment of the home assistance officer, in the first instance, and of the local authority in providing for the financing of these allowances.</P>
    <P>That, let me remind the House, was the position prior to 1953.  That was the position which Deputy Thaddeus Lynch and his colleagues fought to maintain.  The election of 1954 was fought by them upon the iniquitous provisions of the 1953 Act.  Yet they come in today and Deputy Lynch speaks in a perfunctory way in support of the motion merely because he wants to be put on record as supporting Deputy Sherwin in this instance.  If he had any sense, of course, he would support Deputy Sherwin on all the really critical motions in this House. He is very anxious to rub shoulders with Deputy Sherwin today.  He was not so anxious to rub shoulders with Deputy Sherwin when Deputy Sherwin, maintaining his independence, asserted his right as a Deputy in this House to vote according to his best judgment upon any issue on which, if we had not been sustained, it is doubtful whether any consideration would have been given by the members of the Fine Gael Party to the plight of the disabled persons about whom they are so concerned today.</P>
    <P>There is one thing we can say in relation to this matter and that is that there are at least two men who were elected to this House as Independent Members who have maintained that <Col N="431" /> independence against all the obloquy which has been hurled against them, against all the efforts to prevent their discharging their lawful duties as members of this House.</P>

      <P>I was indicating that I felt serious consideration should be given by the Government and the House to the proposition which has been put forward by Deputy Sherwin. I should like to be able to say offhand that I can accept his proposal but then, if I did, I should be accused of doing so for vote-catching purposes.  It would be alleged that it was simply because we wanted to keep Deputy Sherwin tagging along with us.  That is what would be said by our friends in the Opposition.  They would ascribe to me the same sort of motive as, on another issue, they ascribed to Deputy Sherwin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this is not a matter which can be considered just as lightly as irresponsible members of the Opposition would like us to do.  This is a matter in which, as has been pointed out, the local authorities are intimately <Col N="433" /> concerned.  I mentioned a few minutes ago how, prior to the implementation of the Act of 1953, the whole burden of making any provision, even niggardly and completely inadequate provision for disabled persons, fell upon the local authorities.  The Act of 1953 changed that out of consideration for those for whom it provided under Section 50, but also having regard to the position in which the home assistance authorities were, in so far as these could not and were not able to provide more than a most miserable sum in general for a very limited number of disabled persons.</P>
    <P>As a result of the passage of the 1953 Act disabled persons' allowances of 20/- were given in 1954 and one half of the cost of the charges involved thereby was accepted by the State.  The local authorities were considerably relieved by that change.  Let me remind the House again that that change was opposed by the Fine Gael Party and that they actually made an issue of it at the subsequent election of 1954. Since the passing of the 1953 Act what has been the cry of Deputy Thaddeus Lynch and his colleague, Deputy T. F. O'Higgins?  What has been their cry wherever they have gone throughout the country in regard to the Health Act of 1953?</P>

      <P>I am not reopening the section.  I would not venture to do so, because I was one of the people responsible for putting the section there.  I was drawing your attention to the fact that in the motion it is pointed out that these allowances are paid by the State and the health authorities.  I <Col N="435" /> was coming to the obligations and the liabilities which fall upon the local health authorities by reason of Section 50 of the Health Act, 1953, and the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947.</P>
      <P>Under the latter Act, the local authority is required to meet the cost of 50 per cent of these allowances. Undoubtedly the number of people in receipt of disabled persons' allowances has grown very considerably over the years.  This means that the cost to the local authority has gone up, and as the maximum permissible rate at which the allowances can be paid has been increased again and again, the cost to the local authority has gone up, and there has been some increase in the rates.  I am reminding the House now that Deputy T. Lynch and his colleagues, whenever they have been down the country, have alleged and emphasised that the cost of these allowances, and everything else in the Health Act, is excessive and has been imposing an undue burden upon the rates.  That has been their common cry since the Health Act was enacted by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did Deputy T. Lynch, when speaking this evening, advert to the position of the health authorities?  Will Deputy T. F. O'Higgins advert to it?  He will follow me.  Will he advert to it?  Of course he will.  What will he say?  He will say the whole cost should be borne by the State.  That is what Deputy T.F. O'Higgins will say tonight, but what will he say when the Budget for next year is before the House?  What did he say when the Budget for the current year, which is now expiring, was before the House?  What did he say when the Government found it necessary to impose additional taxation in order to provide money to allow among other things these maintenance allowances to be paid?  What will he say when he goes to Cork next week? What will he say in Kildare?  Will he say that in Dáil Éireann on 5th February he got up and supported a motion which would mean a significant substantial increase in the expenditure of the State, and a corresponding substantial increase in the amount of money that has to be raised by the <Col N="436" /> local authorities?  Will he go down to Cork or Kildare and tell the people that with one voice he shouts for an increase in expenditure, and the next day turns around and tries to prevent the Government from raising the money necessary to meet that expenditure?</P>
    <P>Many motions in this House have evoked what I regard as hypocritical manifestations of sympathy for the downtrodden among us.  The position is that we here in Fianna Fáil are the only Party who have done anything for the socially submerged classes in this country.  As I have pointed out, it was the Fianna Fáil Party who brought in the 1953 Act.  We have reason to know that.  We have been carrying the burden ever since, and the political burden of misrepresentation which has been indulged in by our opponents.  We brought in the Act under which the allowance was fixed at 20/-.  That was in 1953.</P>
    <P>We were superseded in 1954, and Deputy T.F. O'Higgins was Minister for Health from 1954 to 1957.  What did he do in relation to these maintenance allowances?  I am looking to see if I can find&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Does the Deputy think memories are so short as to forget that?  We remember it well. Now the Deputy says he did it.  He did it because he could not do anything else.  The things had been laid down for him and all he had to do was sign on the dotted line and take credit for the work of his predecessor.  There was the period of four years in which nothing was done for disabled persons.  On 1st January, 1961, the allowance was increased by 2/6.  I am not saying that was very generous but it was better than nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On 1st November last year, it was increased by another 2/6 to 27/6.  No one regards that 27/6 as being a subsistence allowance.  It is merely a supplemental allowance, something to help a disabled member of a family, and we must realise that the family have some responsibility to a brother or a son, as the case may be. As I have been saying, it is merely an allowance given to a disabled member of a family to enable him to preserve some degree of independence, some control over his own spending.  I am not saying it is by any means a maintenance or a subsistence allowance but it is a help which is provided at the expense of the ratepayers and the taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, as I said at the beginning, this is not a matter in which I am prepared, no matter how much is said about the inadequacy of <Col N="438" /> the allowance, to get up and say the money does not matter, the ratepayers do not matter, the taxpayers do not matter, the general financial position of the State does not matter, so that it will get me a few votes.  I know that is not what moves Deputy Sherwin in this.  I know he feels deeply on this; I know he has good reason to feel deeply about it.  But it is the attitude of Deputy T. Lynch and those other people who opposed&mdash;and let me repeat it, who opposed&mdash;any grant for these disabled persons in 1953.  We have to consider certain things when dealing with this motion.  First of all, we have to consider the position of the ratepayers, of the local authorities, and in this regard I must say that most members of local authorities are by and large as humane as any member of this House.</P>

However, there is a very great difference between the disabled person and, say, a blind person.  If I had time, I would elucidate that further.  As far as the general principle of the motion is concerned, all I can say is that the most favourable consideration possible will be given to it when the time comes.  The nation's accounts have to be looked at, settled and, if possible, balanced.</P>

I always have sympathy for the Minister for Health but for Deputy MacEntee I entertain sympathy from time to time because he is obviously so concerned, when he speaks on matters that may in any way be slightly controversial, with attacking as many people as possible as quickly as possible, that he found it rather difficult tonight to dissociate Deputy Sherwin from his remarks. Deputy Sherwin had to be excluded and apparently anybody else who supported the motion was hypocritical and was shedding crocodile tears.  That applied to everybody but Deputy Sherwin.</P>

      <P>The Minister cannot afford to offend Deputy Sherwin. Anyone else can be freely attacked, and indeed the record may be altered and changed in order to conform with the line of the Minister's attack.  He found it convenient to say in relation to the period in which I was Minister for Health that I had not evidenced any concern for the people <Col N="440" /> dealt with in this motion.  I should like to remind the Minister&mdash;and he can check up on this in his Department&mdash;that while I introduced, as I did, legislation in this House to suspend the operation of the Health Act of 1953, I declared in this House in introducing the legislation that I would ensure that while I was Minister for Health, the Health Act would be brought fully into operation in an orderly manner.</P>
      <P>That undertaking was fulfilled strictly by me.  I would remind the Minister that when I introduced that legislation it was designed to deal with parts of the Health Act other than section 50 to which the Minister referred. Section 50, which provided for these disabled allowances, was in fact brought into operation by me and by nobody else.  It was brought in on 1st October, 1954, which was the earliest date it could have been brought in, because the Budget of 1954 which, as I recollect, was introduced by the then Minister for Finance, the present Minister for Health, only provided that the necessary financial provisions would operate from October 1954, and on 1st October 1954, the regulations providing for these disablement allowances were made by me.</P>

      <P>I did not take any credit but I do suggest to the Minister that, on reflection, he might consider his remarks in that respect as being slightly wide of the margin.  If I did not wish to do this, it was perfectly easy not to do it.  I have always described the provision in relation to disablement allowances and one or two other sections of the Health Act as being worthwhile sections.  I said that at the time and I have always said it. If the Minister will consider further, he will realise that the whole problem of rehabilitation of disabled persons was given priority in the Department of Health while I was Minister.  I established an organisation to deal with this problem in a realistic manner and may I suggest that the Minister now claims credit for many of the decisions then made?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us leave it at that.  We are concerned in this motion with a proposal by Deputy Sherwin to increase these allowances and to provide that disabled persons should be regarded as, and put in the same position as, blind persons and non-contributory old age pensioners. Deputy Sherwin tabled this motion before the operation of the turnover tax.  It is equally true that he tabled it because of the turnover tax.  He may have had in mind, in tabling the motion, that this particular tax would affect disabled persons very seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down that motion long before we heard of the turnover tax, some 15 months ago.  It was not put down because of any tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Whenever it was put down, it is opportune to discuss it now because whatever the situation was when the motion was tabled, it is far worse now when we are discussing it.  The effect of the turnover tax and other actions taken by the Government have been manifestly severe on people in this category.  May I remind the House that when these disablement allowances came into operation on 1st October, 1954, there was then in operation a system of food subsidies under which the bread and butter of these people &mdash;and of the whole population&mdash;was subsidised.  I forget the price but I think butter was about 2/9 or 2/10 per lb.  An allowance of £1 per week at that time was, as the Minister said, intended to be a help to disabled persons.  What happened since?  The Fianna Fáil Party came back into office and swept away some £8 million in food subsidies.  The food that disabled persons had to buy out of their allowances and whatever home assistance they obtained was increased in price and some form of increase in allowance had to be given.  We had the spectacle of three grudging half-crowns given out by the Minister for <Col N="442" /> Health and he expects everybody to applaud his generosity, after bread, butter and flour had been increased in price by deliberate Government policy.</P>
      <P>No doubt Deputy Sherwin tabled this motion after he had voted for proposals to abolish the food subsidies. Why would he not?  The shameful thing is that this motion is necessary and that it is necessary for Deputy Sherwin and others to try to undo the harm that has been done to disabled persons by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the light of that background that the latest assault on the living standards of persons within that category must be considered.  There are no food subsidies now to abolish.  They are already gone.  We have this new tax, a direct tax on the food, on the necessaries of life of the poor people who must buy bread, butter, flour, tea and sugar which are now taxed under the turnover tax.  Something must be done about it.  A halfcrown was provided last November to meet this problem.  I do not know if Deputy Sherwin, whose motion was tabled when the disablement allowance stood at 25/-, would suggest that the November halfcrown has met the effect of the turnover tax on the food of these unfortunate people.  I am sure he would not and, if so, I do not see how the Minister or anyone else can suggest that is the proper way to meet the problem these people have to face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that the disabled persons referred to in this motion, in order to qualify for any allowance, must establish themselves as being amongst the poorest of the poor.  Many disabled persons who <Col N="443" /> might qualify for a medical card could not qualify for a disablement allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be because they are not substantially incapacitated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of means, and I suggest that the means test for a disablement allowance is more stringent than for medical registration. In relation to disablement, all possible means are considered and the definition of members of family and so on is much wider, so that the people concerned in this motion can fairly be described as among the poorest of the poor and to them any tax on food may be a bitter blow. Many of them are forced to eke out some form of existence on the assistance alone they receive.</P>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Carter who referred to the position of local authorities in this regard.  It is true the local authorities are expected to contribute half the cost of these disablement allowances, but, mark you, they have not lost on this account in the past because when the allowances were introduced, what was the first effect?  Certain local authorities proceeded to reduce their home assistance provision.  They reduced the measure of home assistance being given, because of the disablement allowances.  Efforts were made by the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Corish, to prevent that practice continuing.  I was never satisfied that it completely ended.  One of the troubles in relation to an increase in these disablement allowances may well be that certain local authorities may then reduce whatever home assistance addition is payable on the allowance itself.  I do not know whether Deputy Sherwin is anxious to get in or not?</P>

If the only way these people can be helped is <Col N="444" /> under the present provisions in the Health Act, very well.  Any increase, of course, must be borne as to half by the Central Fund and half by local rates. It is not a very large sum.  I do not know what the total disablement allowances now are&mdash;something around £700,000?</P>

      <P>I am pointing out that these increases can be granted and were granted and brought into operation without any budgetary decision.  Surely, if we aim to compensate and meet the situation of persons in the Civil Service and elsewhere who are affected by this turnover tax, at least we should have some regard for the very poorest of the poor.  They have no organisation to fight for them and to them the effect of this taxation can mean a tremendous loss in worry and hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister should now agree with the principle involved in this motion and do something to alleviate the situation.  It is now clear, even from what the Minister said, that the half-crown granted in <Col N="445" /> November has not been sufficient and some increase in that should surely be possible and I do not believe it would cost too much.</P>

In fact, I have been advocating something like this since 1960 and on every Health Estimate and every Estimate to do with health I have spoken on this subject.  The motion must be on the Order Paper for 15 months, since before the turnover tax was heard of.  I only mention that.  It does not matter whether I introduced it since the implementation of the turnover tax or not.  Regarding the allegation that I voted for the abolition of the food subsidies, I forget that.  I believe that was done in 1957 or 1958.  I did not come in here until the end of 1957.</P>

      <P>I did not vote for such a thing, anyway.  It could be said that every word that comes out of a politician's mouth is a vote catcher.  I accept that.  A politician gets credit for doing good and is entitled to get credit for doing good but he can be genuine in what he advocates even though at the same time he might like a little credit.  The late President Kennedy said that you have to boost yourself if you hope to get power and do more good.  How can you do good if you have not power?  There is no great harm in trying to get a little backing for what one does if the aim is to get a little more influence and greater power to do greater good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My interest in this subject is great. We do not like to shed tears about ourselves. I happen to be affected and have been affected for 40 years.  It has been my lot to mix with these unfortunate people during 40 years.  In fact, I mixed with some of them this morning in the Richmond Hospital.  I will say no more about that.  I know these people and what they are up against. I have several letters here.  I do not want to read them.  I have a letter <Col N="446" /> from a person in Kerry saying: &ldquo;The old people deserve increases and we know they are getting it hard but they cannot be compared with cripples and people who are bedridden.&rdquo;  They are considerably worse off than even old people because old people at least may have their health and may be able to get around.  They may have a small pension.  They are allowed to earn up to £1 a week and receive maximum old age pension of 35/-.  In a great many cases the disabled person has been crippled from birth or for a great many years and may have no pension. He may not be able to earn anything.  I am referring to those who are 80 per cent, 90 per cent or 100 per cent disabled.</P>
    <P>I am not asking that every disabled person should get 35/-, the same as a non-contributory old age pensioner gets.  There are degrees of disability. A man may be disabled but may be able to earn a certain amount of money.  There are others who are totally disabled and cannot earn anything. Only those who are unable to work and are greatly disabled would get the maximum.  I am asking that the maximum be increased to the same level as the maximum non-contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>It is the local authority, not the Minister, who will decide the degree of disability.  The Minister merely fixes the maximum.  Unfortunately&mdash; and this is why I am pressing the motion&mdash;it rests with the local authority whether those unfortunate people are subsidised by way of assistance or not.  While in some cases the assistance officer may be generous, in other cases he is not.  That has been proved. I have here a letter the writer of which says she has £1 a week and is getting nothing from the assistance people.  It was in order to get something from the assistance people that she wrote the letter.  There was no stamp on the envelope.  The writer said that she could not afford a stamp.</P>
    <P>Too much is left to the local assistance officer as to whether those people should get additional assistance or not. My point is that in their own right, if totally disabled, they should get it.  Of course, there is a means test.  There is <Col N="447" /> a means test in respect of all non-contributory pensions or allowances. The beneficiary is entitled to certain amounts, irrespective of income, in the case of contributory schemes.  It is the accepted practice, in the case of non-contributory schemes, to have a means test.  That is understandable. If a person is totally disabled, I trust the assistance people will not be a bit too tight on the question of means.  I want to see a totally disabled person getting at least 35/- a week, the same as the non-contributory old age pensioner. That is not a lot.  As time goes on and as the non-contributory old age pensioner gets an increase I should like to think that the disabled person will get a similar increase.</P>
    <P>My complaint is that because all those other beneficiaries such as the unemployed, the blind, the widow, the orphan, and so on, come under the social welfare code the focus every year is on those people and none of them are missed.  They all get something. The disabled people do not come under the social welfare code and they are forgotten.</P>
    <P>I have been in this House since late 1957 and I have seldom heard anybody talk about the benefits for disabled persons.  I am alive to that situation because I am interested in that class.  I found that although they got their £1 in 1953, which was paid in 1954, they have got no more money since 1960.  Six long years have elapsed during which they got nothing because they were forgotten.  Maybe it was nobody's fault but the fact is that they were forgotten.</P>
    <P>If the disabled persons came under the social welfare code I know they would have got increases in those years.  I want to see the gap closed in relation to what all the others got during those six years, so far as disabled persons are concerned.  They got 2/6 over the past three years and I do not despise that 2/6.</P>
    <P>I argued the matter here and the Minister was good enough to indicate that he would keep those people in mind for the Budget.  I appreciate that attitude.  The people I speak for, who are totally disabled are a burden on <Col N="448" /> their families.  A lot of them have to be lifted from bed to chair, and have to be fed and dressed.  Someone must always be there lest they should fall into a fire or something like that.  If those people were in homes, it would cost the local authority probably £10 a week for each one of them.</P>
    <P>People who are bedridden, and lots of them cannot get around, need little luxuries, no matter how small, to tide them over.  You know what it is to be in jail, with nothing to do.  Lots of people who are confined in jail would prefer to be out working.  The cell kills them.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister is willing to accept the principle of the motion in so far as the non-contributory old age pensioners are concerned.  I am willing to accept that.  He said he would deal with it during the Budgetary period.  I do not see anything wrong with that as it will be in a few months' time.  It will not be terribly costly.  There is not a great number of seriously disabled persons and the fact that half the amount is payable by the local authority makes it easier on everybody.  I made the same case a year ago when we were accepting recommendations for the Health Committee.  Actually this proposal was favoured by that committee.</P>
    <P>I do not say the Opposition are callous.  I know they are political and the game is that everyone has a &ldquo;go&rdquo; at everyone else with his eye on a vote.  I have no doubt they are as sympathetic as I am towards this class of person only unfortunately a little politics are mixed up in it.</P>
    <P>Other classes of beneficiaries have had three and four increases whereas the disabled persons got none because they were forgotten about.  Surely it costs at least as much, if not more, to keep a 100 per cent disabled person as it does a non-contributory old age pensioner, and so on?  I want at least parity and to ensure that henceforth when one class gets an increase the other classes will get as much.  I do not want to dwell on how pitiful it can become when one knows such people and realises the feelings of their families.  So long as I have the Minister's <Col N="449" /> statement that he accepts the principle of this motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking earlier this evening, I mentioned the importance of career guidance officers. We must examine this matter very carefully.  We must ask if there is any record in any rural national school of the progress being made by a boy or girl reaching school leaving age and his or her suitability for a certain type of employment.  Try as they may, national teachers are not and cannot be expected to be specialists as regards the suitability of pupils for a particular type of work.  Because of that, it would be well if the Minister would bear in mind, when people are being sent abroad on specialised courses, that a number of officers from his Department <Col N="450" /> should receive training for this special work.</P>
      <P>Equally important would be the keeping of a special file or record regarding the progress of each boy or girl, and when the boy or girl is leaving school, the record should be available to the guidance officer for examination and for discussions between him and the child's parents.  I would not be in favour of a hit or miss affair.  I know it would cost money and that we would need many inspectors, and I know that an inspector would probably have to spend many days in each school examining the file of each boy or girl who has reached the school-leaving age, but ultimately all of that would be worthwhile.</P>
      <P>At present there is this awful vacuum&mdash;parents not knowing the capabilities of their child, and very often believing that the boy or girl is exceptionally clever but blaming the school teacher if the child fails to pass an examination.  All this is happening because there is no real co-operation between all the parties concerned regarding the future of boys and girls leaving school.  If we could adopt this system, it might mean that ultimately boys and girls would not be put into jobs which are dead-ends.  If boys and girls by such advice and guidance can be led along the road to suitable forms of employment, then their future years will be happy and content, and equally important the economy will benefit by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Deputies, I am glad to know, from the Minister's answer to-day, where these new technical school buildings are to be erected.  It is only natural that we in Cork are happy about the result.  Beyond that, I do not intend to discuss vocational education on this Estimate.  It is not that I consider it unworthy of discussion&mdash;I believe it is vital that we do discuss it&mdash;but because I am disappointed with the Minister.  I believe there was never a better Minister for Education in this House than the present Minister but I do not believe in expressing praise when we must be critical.  Last May, the Minister held a press conference. I am not condemning him, but I think it would have been better if <Col N="451" /> he had come first to the House.  I am not saying that the press should be denied any available information but Ministers, probably in all Governments, seem to adopt the line that has been common practice for many years in England and America, that is, to go to the public first and then come back to the elected representatives.  Therefore, I consider that only when the Minister's full proposals are known here, can we discuss them in their entirety.</P>
    <P>They may be very good&mdash;I hope they are.  The Minister can be sure of one thing, that is, the 100 per cent co-operation of Labour Deputies.  Perhaps we may be critical in so far as we may think his proposals may not go far enough but I suppose it is a healthy sign if we want to go further.  Perhaps when the Minister is introducing his Estimate for the coming year in the next month or two, we may hear more about the matter.  Then we will be in possession of more detailed information. Because of that, I do not propose to discuss any matter affecting vocational schools tonight.</P>
    <P>In regard to secondary schools, I shall just say I am in agreement with the many members who have drawn attention to the inadequacies of the capitation grants.  No matter what I might say, I would merely be repeating what other Deputies have already said.  In the years during which the Minister has been Minister for Education, he has been tremendously successful, but I should like to see a greater spirit of co-operation between his Department and the various secondary teachers' organisations because co-operation can bring great results.  I shall leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has had an opportunity of examining the situation which affects boys and girls, but particularly boys, arising from the introduction of a new system by the Minister for Finance.  Kerry and Cork, and, I suppose, Clare to some extent, were once able to send their quota of young boys up here to the Civil Service. The tragedy now is that the number of vacancies in the executive officer grade are very limited and the so-called re-organisation of the Service <Col N="452" /> has affected the Department of Education and must affect the Minister when boys are being denied the right to sit for examinations for the clerical officer grade.  I should like the Minister to study this matter between now and when he introduces his Estimate, to find out what the position is as against what it was in the secondary schools &mdash;in the Christian Brothers' schools and many other schools&mdash;which used send their boys for good positions which have now been closed to them. Unfortunately there are very few alternatives available.  I know that the alteration was not caused by the Minister for Education but the Minister and his Department must have noticed a falling off in the employment which was available to these boys.</P>
    <P>Another minor matter which I should mention is one to which I referred many years ago and it would be well if the Minister could have a word with the people concerned about it.  About September every year, every newspaper is cluttered up with advertising material from various secondary schools, convents and so on, relating to the examination results which have just been announced.  That in itself is all right but what is unfair is the publication of names with asterisks after them denoting honours.  I think it is unfair&mdash;and I do not mind what school is involved&mdash;to the pupils, some of whom may, by a few marks, just have failed in the examination.  It can cause jealousy in parishes between parents. Surely these schools should be satisfied with stating they presented so many pupils for such an examination, so many got honours, so many passed, leaving the names out altogether.  If they want to publish the names, then do not segregate and show A as having got honours, B as having just got through and C, the child of a neighbour, as having failed.  Advertising is big business with many schools.  I should like the Minister to take some steps to prevent this publicity because, to say the least of it, it is causing a great deal of annoyance in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I come now to the most thorny question of all, the Irish language.  In this House, and outside it, people hold <Col N="453" /> different views.  Throughout the 26 Counties, people are divided in their approach to the subject of Irish.  Since I became a member of this House, I have held to a certain line.  I have never offered any apology to anyone for doing so and may God grant that I shall never have to change it.  At the moment, however, I find myself at a crossroads.  Here, I should like to tell a true story.  It may provide an answer to those who are most critical of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Two years ago, I happened to be in the west of Ireland.  Moving down towards the Minister's county, I passed through the village of Spiddal. It was a pleasure to hear two men there speaking in Irish.  One man was having a few words with a neighbour who was engaged in drawing seaweed. Eventually they parted company and the man drawing the seaweed went down to the strand with his donkey. His wife had filled a bag at low water. What struck me most forcibly was that that man talked to his wife in Irish; he talked to a little boy in Irish.  Now the donkey was slow to move and I noticed that he spoke to the donkey in English.  It was to the ass he spoke English.  Whether or not the donkey came from the Gaeltacht, I just do not know but the episode goes to show that in Spiddal, at any rate, the only one who did not understand Irish was the donkey.</P>
    <P>I said I find myself at a crossroads. Looking back now on our school days, there are those of us who realise that what we learned then was what I might describe as Irish Irish.  There were no aitches in it.  Whether he likes it or not, the Minister for Education has a responsibility.  We have had changes over the years.  My only ambition now is to try to get to the root of the trouble and see where we are going. Are we divided so much, one against the other, that those who are against Irish can point the finger at us?</P>
    <P>Go through the old Irish books. There is no aitch.  There was no aitch in an tAthair Peadar, an tAthair Peadar who was such a pleasure to read.  Irish then was written in Irish characters.  See the difference today. It is a big difference.  Take the simple <Col N="454" /> word &ldquo;&rdquo;, it appears today as &ldquo;chaith&rdquo;.  We are told that the introduction of the aitch is for the purpose of modernising and improving the language.  We cannot have it both ways.  Take the words &ldquo; sé&rdquo; that is now &ldquo;chuaigh sé&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister is that an improvement?</P>
    <P>I have in my possession an old Irish-English dictionary of 1822 or 1823, a big volume by O'Reilly.  There is no such thing as an aitch in it.  Presumably the people were modern then and apparently Irish was all right then. Apparently the Irish we were taught by those excellent teachers who studied Irish and did their best to encourage a love of the language in the boys and girls in their charge was good enough.  Remember, they were teaching Irish as it was well and truly known, and without any aitches.</P>
    <P>Quite candidly, I worry as to whither we are going.  I have in mind a little girl of six.  She has been at school for about two years.  She is only one of many.  This is not a case of just one school because I thought it only right and proper to find out what was happening in different schools in order that I might make a comparison.  This small child started off in the ordinary way.  Last year there was a change and the children were switched from ordinary spelling to phonetic.  I admit that when I heard these little children pronouncing the letter &ldquo;c&rdquo; as &ldquo;k&rdquo;, I was stumped.  They do it in Cork, whatever about the other counties.  When we were going to school, we were told there was no such thing as the letter &ldquo;k&rdquo; but only &ldquo;c&rdquo;. But little girls between the age of four and five were told that a &ldquo;c&rdquo; was a &ldquo;k&rdquo; because they were spelling in Irish. They were told to pronounce &ldquo;e&rdquo; as &ldquo;eh&rdquo;, &ldquo;o&rdquo; as &ldquo;ogh&rdquo; and &ldquo;u&rdquo; as &ldquo;ugh&rdquo;.  These children may get over that, but now what do we find?  Little children, who were making a hand even of these phonetics, are faced with something that is going beyond the bounds in regard to Irish.</P>
    <P>Let us take this example.  The teacher is giving an English lesson.  He tells the children that &ldquo;c-a-t&rdquo; is pronounced &ldquo;cat&rdquo;, that &ldquo;a-n&rdquo; is &ldquo;an&rdquo;<Col N="455" /> and that &ldquo;a-i-r&rdquo; is &ldquo;air&rdquo;.  The children are doing their best to learn these words as written in English.  An hour afterwards, they are doing Irish.  The same word is written in English.  The Irish letters are forgotten.  This time &ldquo;c-a-t&rdquo; is down again but now they are told it is &ldquo;cat&rdquo; with the Irish pronunciation. The word &ldquo;a-n&rdquo; is down and they are told it is &ldquo;an&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;a-i-r&rdquo; is down and they are told it is &ldquo;air&rdquo;.  Are we to continue in that way?  Who is responsible for it?</P>
    <P>I know some people are vindictive about the Irish language. Whether through ignorance or something else, we hear them claim, for instance, that Ballyvourney Irish is different from Connemara Irish.  But we know that an Englishman from London and one from Yorkshire could hardly understand one another.  We do not have to take notice of such carping criticism.  But it is a sad thing for Ireland when little children have to write Irish in English letters and put in &ldquo;h's&rdquo; all over the place.  It is also heartbreaking for genuine enthusiasts of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I know there are extremists on both sides of the fence.  There are some who are vicious in their opposition to the language and some vicious in their love of the language, ready to condemn anyone who says a word against it.  The saving of the language can only be left to those trying to steer a middle course, those who believe in the language, who want the language, but who must be critical of these impositions on the children by persons behind the scenes.  Their Irish is so different from that of the man who wrote:</P>
    <P>Bhí fear ann fadó darb ainm dó Séadhna ....</P>
    <P>or the man who wrote:</P>
    <P>Beir beannacht óm chroí go Tír na hÉireann</P>
    <P>Bán cnuic Éireann óig.</P>
    <P>What was wrong with the Irish of those days?  What was wrong with the mentality of the people who wrote such beautiful Irish?  What is wrong with those who slaughter the language and try to make fools of little <Col N="456" /> children year after year in the schools?  What is to happen to weekly papers such as <i>Amárach</i> in which the true Irish appears week after week? It is a paper that gives me great pleasure because the Irish there is the Irish we learned with no &ldquo;h's&rdquo; in it, so different from the newspapers and periodicals putting in &ldquo;h's&rdquo; everywhere and writing everything in English letters.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to say the Minister is as anxious to see Irish prosper as anyone, but I say the tampering with Irish as we knew it is ruining the language.  Let us come together before it is too late to see to it that the cranks prepared to alter the language to suit ourselves are put in their places and the old traditional ways of writing and talking Irish retained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a general feeling of disappointment and dissatisfaction throughout the country at the silence and inactivity of the Minister and his Department since the headline-hitting pronouncement made last May regarding the future of Irish educational policy, particularly with regard to the new idea of comprehensive schools.  The problem of bringing Irish education into line with modern developments and of gearing our educational policy to meet future needs is a colossal one. Silence and inactivity are two things we do not want at present.  There are numerous problems to be tackled in the field of education.  During the course of this debate, which has been a prolonged one, every aspect of those problems has been referred to by other speakers.  In the primary schools we have the problem of over-crowding, bad buildings and the consequent need for the extension of existing schools and the acceleration of the school-building programme in general. These are very big problems waiting to be tackled.  In regard to secondary education, we have the inadequacy of the present facilities and the inadequacy, in particular, of the capitation grant.  In this matter of secondary education we must make a determined effort to ensure that secondary education is made available to all who seek it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> To reach that desirable objective, we still have a long way to go.  Then in the fields of vocational and technical education, there is need for reorganisation, need to bring our technical schools into line with modern developments, to provide new courses, to meet new advances in various fields of technology.  However, the most serious deficiency in our educational system is the absence of adequate research facilities and the absence of adequate statistical information on the availability, demand and other aspects of education.</P>
    <P>This lack of statistical information and of research facilities has come very forcibly to light in recent times in the course of the discussions on the question of comprehensive schools. After the fullest examination of the present facilities available, rather than pick out certain areas and decide to put a new comprehensive school in such a location, maybe there is another approach to any given location.  Maybe if the present facilities were extended and if suitable transport were provided, the problems could be solved in a certain area.  There are numerous questions which cannot be answered because of the lack of scientific surveys and statistical information.  It is a matter of vital necessity that full-scale research units should be set up within the Department of Education.  It is important that it should examine the problem and then set about tackling it. As the Americans have put it: you must know how to show how.</P>
    <P>On this question of educational research, it would be remiss of me if I did not pay tribute to the work of the Federation of Irish Secondary Schools.  Within the past year, they have produced two documents which are very valuable contributions to educational research.  While complimenting that organisation and paying tribute to them, I maintain it is only going half way to solving the problem and it is most unfair if this question of educational research is left in the hands of voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of education in which I am most interested for reasons <Col N="458" /> which I am sure the Minister knows well is that of university education. The facilities available at the present time are totally inadequate.  In most parts of the country university education is the prerogative of the well-to-do or the brilliant few who are fortunate to secure scholarships.  In the field of university education, just as in the field of secondary education, we must accept the principle of equality of opportunity.  At present that is being denied to a large proportion of our secondary school-going pupils.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of this fact because of efforts which have been made by a public-spirited body of people in the constituency which I represent who have carried out research into the question of the facilities for university education in Limerick and the surrounding areas.  The Limerick University Project Committee has over the past three or four years carried out an educational survey of Limerick City and County and the adjoining counties. That survey has shown that there are 14,000 secondary school pupils in this area, a figure which represents one-sixth of the entire secondary school-going population of the country.  The vast majority of those 14,000 pupils will never have a chance of pursuing a university course.  Do we intend to continue the pesent policy of denying the opportunity of pursuing a university course to such a large section of our people?</P>
    <P>I am aware that this campaign to secure a university for Limerick has in certain higher places&mdash;let me put it that way&mdash;been looked upon with a certain amount of amusement.  There are people who consider that this campaign is being directed by a small group of daydreamers or idealists.  I want to make it quite clear that we in Limerick are deadly serious on this matter.  The survey carried out shows there are 14,000 secondary school-going pupils in this area.  We have established beyond all doubt that there is an excellent case for the provision of a constituent college of the National University of Ireland in Limerick.</P>
    <P>The case for the establishment of a university college in Limerick was put <Col N="459" /> before the Commission on Higher Education two years ago and an invitation was extended to members of the Commission to go to Limerick and to examine the case on the spot.  Up to the present that has not been done. The latest information I have is that members of the Commission intend to visit Limerick.  I sincerely hope so.</P>
    <P>We have found it strange that members of the Commission on Higher Education have visited Northern Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Holland and Germany to study higher educational facilities and have not yet come down to examine the case that has been put for the establishment of a college in Limerick.  I put it to the Minister that no other body in this country has put before the Commission a case so bristling with facts and figures and that it is up to the Commission to visit Limerick and give our case the consideration it deserves.</P>
    <P>We do not want our claim for a university in Limerick to be decided behind closed doors here in Dublin. We do not want a repetition of what happened during the past year, when a member of the Commission on Higher Education came to Limerick and, in the course of a lecture on another subject, made an attempt to belittle our claim.  Subsequently, when challenged in the public Press, he discreetly withdrew.</P>
    <P>Limerick's claim to a university is based on the simple principle of equality of opportunity for all in higher education.  Our claim, as I said, is backed by factual and statistical evidence.  If the Government accept the principle of equality of opportunity in higher education for all our post-secondary students, Limerick's claim must be recognised, and justice must be done.</P>
    <P>I want once and for all, to make it quite clear that the idea of a university for Limerick is not just wishful thinking by a group of idealists.  The demand for a university is widespread and unanimous, and it is supported by every public body and organisation in the area.  As I said, to put it in a nutshell, we want a constituent college of National University.  I believe <Col N="460" /> we are entitled to it and we are determined to keep on fighting until we get it.  So far as Limerick's claim is concerned, the people will not take &ldquo;No&rdquo; for an answer.</P>

      <P>Because of the delay in the presentation of this Estimate, this is probably not a very valuable debate to bother about.  Presumably we will be hearing from the Minister again very shortly, and we will have another opportunity of discussing the points at issue.  At the same time, I should like to say a few words at this stage, because of a recent statement made by the Minister in regard to myself.</P>
      <P>One is in difficulty as a Deputy at Question Time in so far as the Minister is given tremendous scope and a Deputy is restricted.  Fortunately there is no such restriction now, so long as I keep within the rules of order.</P>
      <P>I very much resent the Minister's approach to being questioned on his activities, at Question Time in the Dáil.  Recently he used a particularly facetious answer in order to develop his theme, as he put it. He said that the Deputy was against any improvement in education, and he went on to say that the only person who was wasting his time was the Deputy.  The Deputy was asking a particular question and looking for information to which he was entitled, and that question will come back to the Minister tonight.  That is a function of a Deputy in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Minister is in a very difficult position because he came into this House deeply bedded down in the tail feathers of Mr. de Valera in County Clare.  He was a particularly obscure Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There was nothing but the evidence of the Minister's inefficiency, the Minister's futility, the most futile of all being the present incumbent.</P>
      <P>Futility, incompetency, inefficiency are all the one thing but there is another more serious charge I should like to make against the Minister.  I put down a Parliamentary Question last week to the Minister and I shall read in detail his answer because what arises from it is rather important.  I asked him whether applicants suitably qualified under the terms of the advertisement for the post of Curator of the National Gallery made application for the post; if so, how many; whether they were considered for appointment; if so, why no appointment was made; why it had been found necessary to readvertise the post; whether the terms of the second advertisement were identical with those of the first; and if not, how they differed.  The Minister replied to me in the following terms:</P>
      <P>The position of Director of the National Gallery was advertised in July last.  When the applications were received the Governors and Guardians of the Gallery felt the scope of the competition should be widened by offering a higher scale of salary for the post.  Such higher scale of salary having been sanctioned, the post was readvertised early this month.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not hard of hearing, I hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>What is wrong with the Deputy now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Patience, patience; I am going on to deal with it.  It will be noted that in that question I asked whether the terms of the second advertisement were identical with those of the first, and if not, how they differed, and the total of the Minister's reply was that a higher salary scale had been sanctioned.  There was no reference whatever to any change in the terms of the advertisement.  The <Col N="464" /> advertisement issued in July for a director stated that the salary for his very important post would be £2,300 to £2,800 for a man.  The post is whole-time, pensionable, and these are the desirable qualifications: (1) a university degree or equivalent qualifications from an art history institution of international standard: (2) knowledge of at least one modern continental language; (3) knowledge of the Irish language; (4) experience of art gallery administration with knowledge of the care of pictures.</P>
      <P>Those were the terms of the first advertisement.  The second advertisement had the change in salary as mentioned by the Minister&mdash;for a man £2,500 to £3,275.  Then, there was this important difference: there were essential qualifications&mdash;the Minister did not mention this and there was no mention of essential qualifications in the first advertisement.  Among the essential qualifications were: satisfactory experience of art gallery administration, with knowledge of the care and display of pictures; general suitability otherwise to discharge the duties of the position.</P>
      <P>The desirable qualifications in the second advertisement were: a university degree or equivalent qualifications from an art history institution of international standard, a knowledge of Irish, a knowledge of a modern continental language.  The Minister did not give me that information in reply to the Parliamentary Question.  He concealed those facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the position, as I understand it, and the Minister can correct me if I am wrong.  To the first advertisement there were two replies. They were from people who answered the requirements of that first advertisement <Col N="465" /> completely in accordance with the specific terms of the advertisement. One of them was from Liverpool, the Deputy Director of the Liverpool Walker Art Gallery, with a degree, numerous publications to his credit, <i>prima facie</i>, excellent qualifications. The other was a lady from Belfast, from the Art Gallery in Belfast, a scholar, moderator in history, an M.A. in history of art from a London university. She had also worked in the Tate Gallery.</P>
      <P>This is the charge I wish the Minister to investigate: it is alleged&mdash;my report on this is from the person involved&mdash;that two members of the Board of the National Gallery went to a Mr. White and they offered Mr. White the job on certain conditions. They offered him the job but he was unwilling to take it because he did not like the salary&mdash;it was not high enough. I want to say right at the outset that as far as I can gather, Mr. White has behaved with the most complete and absolute innocence and integrity and in accordance with the highest possible standards, and there is no question of any imputation against him whatsoever.</P>
      <P>It was Mr. White who was approached and he made no move in the matter.  If he wants a higher salary that is his business; if they want him badly enough let them give it to him. The difficulty about Mr. White is his qualifications.  He spent a period working for a tobacco company, two years working for the Municipal Gallery here and, as far as I know, he has no degrees of any kind.  He is an extremely enthusiastic believer in art and as far as I know, a most energetic Curator of the Municipal Gallery. Those are his qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That is your statement of his qualifications.  It would not be the first time you attacked somebody under the privilege of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

    <Col N="466" />
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a modicum of honesty about it.  I want the Minister to investigate it.  I want to know whether the Minister has been a party to this in any way, whether he was aware that this had taken place, if he approved of the first set of qualifications, if he felt the first set of qualifications were intelligent qualifications which would be likely to get a good, suitable person; I want to know if he believed&mdash;and he presumably sanctioned them&mdash;in the efficacy and the wisdom of these qualifications. Having done so, why did he not see that the two people were called at least, having had the basic qualifications? Whether they were appointed or not was unimportant.</P>
      <P>The important thing was that certain basic qualifications which these people had were advertised for and those two people were turned down without interview. Why did that happen?  They were not called for interview&mdash;merely informed that the position was to be readvertised.  This is a very serious position.  I do not know to what extent the Minister is involved: I am not making any charges against the Minister until he has had an opportunity of replying.  I know the name&mdash;I have been given it&mdash;of one of the people who made this approach to Mr. White. For the time being I do not wish to disclose that name.  If the Minister wishes to investigate these allegations and feels I should give him the name of the person against whom I am making this allegation, I shall be prepared to do so, so that he can be facilitated in his investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important post.  It carries a salary of £2,500.  On the face of the evidence I have, it reeks of jobbery.  It has, I think, an even more serious significance in that I know that my colleague, Deputy McQuillan, repeatedly questions the Taoiseach and Mr. MacAteer is continually hectoring the authorities in Northern Ireland on the question of religious apartheid in the North of Ireland.  If these facts are true, as set out by me, surely we have given the people in the North a perfectly giltedged charge to make against the Dublin authorities that when it comes <Col N="467" /> to jobbery, we are certainly in every way their match?</P>
    <P>That is the position as I see it for the present.  Any further information I have I shall make available to the Minister, should he wish me to do so. I think it is a matter which should be the subject of an inquiry; it would be very wrong if an appointment were made in the circumstances.  It is clear that a very serious wrong has been done to these two people who <i>bona fide</i> felt this was an honest attempt to find the best man for the job and I think, probably as most people do&mdash; as a race we are regrettably good at this kind of thing&mdash;we seem to have lost our sense of humour because those who drew up this advertisement, I should have thought, would have been mindful of the cynical Dubliner when they inserted at the bottom of the advertisement this ultimate in cynicism: &ldquo;Personal canvassing of members of the Board is prohibited.&rdquo;  That should be good for a laugh with Jimmy O'Dea any day, especially when members of the appointing body are canvassing the prospective appointees.</P>
    <P>Such hypocrisy&mdash;and God knows we have a fair record of it in affairs of this kind&mdash;must surely be one of the best specimens extant.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Minister's absurd suggestion to me that I spend my time wasting his time and that I was against any improvement in the education provisions, I wish to draw his attention to the debate in 1958, five years ago, where he will find that between 35 and 40 columns are taken up by me in discussing the Estimate for the Department of Education.  In that debate, I made many of the suggestions which are now common property and being made by everybody on all sides of the House.  It was a contribution based on statistics and factual information and it was the product, in the main, of information which at that time I received with courtesy from a reluctant Department but a well-mannered Minister.</P>
    <P>The only thing I am seriously concerned about is a suggestion by the Minister that it is about time that people stopped saying&mdash;this was in <Col N="468" /> June or July&mdash;that the majority of our people do not go further than the national school.  That seems to me to suggest complacency on the part of the Minister and the satisfaction of the Minister with the present state of affairs.  I attach no serious significance to the Minister's protestations about what he is going to do when he grows up, the day after to-morrow and so on, because I have listened to that for a long time from people occupying his post, but I am concerned about the suggestion that post-primary education is to any significant degree available to our young people.</P>
    <P>I shall give the Minister some facts so that he may reconsider his optimistic assessment of his Department's achievements and failures over the past few years.  How do you decide, in the absence, as one Deputy recently pointed out, of an intelligent, serious, statistical section in the Department of Education, a section in any way useful and properly staffed, what the exact position is?  It is very difficult to find out the true position regarding education. We can find out only whatever suits the Department's PRO, that is, the Minister, whatever rosy picture he wants to paint of the Department's inactivities.  The position is capable of statistical foundation and analysis but when we come to ask a simple question and an important one, such as: &ldquo;How many children are at present in classes in the city of Dublin?&rdquo; whether it is upwards of 40 or 50 or 60 or 70, the Minister does not know. He does know but he does not care. It is easy, as is true of so many Departments of State here, to rest on another man's wound.  It is some other person's children who are going to the slum schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Dáil today that that problem is being dealt with but the Deputy is not interested in that, but in statistics.  To him, these children are just statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asking that question for the past ten years and I have been getting the same answer and so far as I know, nothing significant is happening&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;except that there is a continuing movement of population from the deserted villages of rural Ireland into Dublin, with the result that whatever the position was when I first asked the question, it is infinitely worse now and the Minister does not even know the size of the problem.  He does not even know the extent of the problem.  So that is one of our difficulties in trying to deal with the situation in regard to education. The indifference of the Department to its own responsibilities over the years has been such that whenever they wanted any kind of advice at all, they looked into their own hearts, they found themselves being reassured of their doing a very good job, they would carry on and think that that was all that was required.</P>
      <P>Anybody who questions or criticises is told he is &ldquo;wasting my time&rdquo;, he is taking up the time of these busy bureaucrats.  God only knows what they are doing.  They certainly are not running the Department of Education.  But, these are the only replies one gets from the Minister&mdash;inferences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I think it is possible by use of inferences of one kind or another to try to decide what does happen to the youngsters who end school at 14 years of age.  There is one fact which would have been interesting if the Minister had pursued it in any way, if he could bring it up to date.  I do not know what the position is now. All I know is that there has been no significant change.  In spite of the Minister's scholarships scheme, there has been no significant change in the apparatus of our educational system since certain figures were made available and they were figures available on travel permits in regard to status of people leaving the country.  In relation to females they were: 55 per cent were domestic: 34 per cent were factory workers.  The rest were nurses, clerical workers, and so on.  That is, 90 per cent&mdash;nine out of ten&mdash;of these youngsters whom we send out of this country&mdash;as Mr. Hauser said the other day in his survey regrettably, some of them to become prostitutes on the streets of London&mdash;are being sent out by the Department of Education with <Col N="470" /> the only qualification to earn their living their bare hands.</P>
    <P>That is an achievement for an educational system, is it not?  The poor youngsters.  Who could blame them when they end up, as so many have done, in the way that they have done?</P>
    <P>In relation to men, unskilled labourers represented 13 per cent; agricultural workers 70 per cent.  The rest are industrial workers.  I suppose they were coolie labour industrial workers. They may or may not have been. Seventeen per cent were skilled workers&mdash;I will put it that way&mdash;and the other rough 80 per cent&mdash;eight out of ten&mdash;of these young boys went out and the diploma we gave them, the degree we gave them, the qualification we gave them in order to fight their corner in London, Liverpool, Birmingham and everywhere else was, again, their bare hands.  And nobody cares. Nobody took any serious steps to see that if we cannot stop emigration at least we can try to ensure that when these youngsters do emigrate they are not doing the coolie labour in those countries, that they are able to take up their jobs, whether it is as office workers or professional workers or other workers, at a status which most of them are perfectly well talented for and equipped for in their minds.  It is merely an accident of birth that they end up as coolie labourers, an accident that they were born in the Republic of Ireland which has no regard for the intellectual, physical or technical capacity of the vast majority of its young people, a society which is based on the strictly completely utilitarian materialist philosophy that if you can pay for it you can have it.  It does not matter whether it is comfort in old age or health when you are sick or education when you are a youngster, if you cannot pay you cannot have.  That is a beautiful upending of the Christian virtues which we so loudly profess from time to time.  It would make you vomit.</P>
    <P>That is one, it seems to me, reasonable, indirect assessment of the position in regard to this educational apparatus created by the joint efforts of successive Ministers and successive <Col N="471" /> Governments over the past 40 years. That is their achievement.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that our post primary education compares favourably with other countries.  I am sure other Deputies have given these figures but they are worth repeating: Expenditure on education, 1960-61: Scotland, £95; England and Wales, £87, North of Ireland, £69; Republic of Ireland, £26.  That again, unable as we are to get at the facts because of the failure of the Department of Education to provide us with the facts, is indirect, irrefutable evidence in my mind, that compared with these other countries our expenditure being one-third of what the other countries' is on their youngsters, our effort can reasonably be said to be at least one-third of theirs and the Minister at this thought yawns his head off.  What a comment on his interest in his Department's failures over the years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The position then is that we have not spent the money, we have not bothered ourselves finding the money.  We have been able to find it for other, I would consider less essential objectives, but, as far as we are concerned, we do not think that there are votes in education.  Consequently, there is no need to educate our youngsters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose most Deputies have asked the Minister, and I do not suppose they will get any information from him&mdash;they will have to go to whatever is the lucky Chamber of Commerce dinner or will have to join the Union of Journalists in order to get summoned to a Press Conference&mdash;but, somehow or other, no doubt a few of us may be told what are his future plans in regard to the comprehensive schools.  Certainly, apparently, Leinster House is the last place where we are likely to hear about it.  Most Deputies have commented on the Minister's silence on his wonderful programme for the creation of comprehensive schools all over the place.  I do not think anybody was taken in very seriously but, one assumed, on the <Col N="472" /> whole, one ought to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that he was not merely playing Party politics, that the election was on at the time and he was pushed into the front line and the troops were under pressure and he was asked to do a little line pulling with an announcement of what he intended to do in regard to educational facilities.  We assumed that it was not, strictly speaking, a political trick on his part.  We assumed wrongly. If the Minister had made any serious advance in relation to his provision for the grand comprehensive schools, whether it is a cockeyed scheme or not, he would have told us because there are two by-elections pending, and we would have heard all about it.</P>

      <P>If the Minister would shut up interrupting me, the Deputy would hear it.  It is very difficult to discuss such a nebulous proposition as these comprehensive schools.  However, they certainly are in no position to alter seriously the sad depressing picture which I have already given in regard to the broad picture of the education of our children at present.</P>
      <P>I gave the end product of our schools.  A skivvy or a manual labourer are words with a really offensive connotation, I know, but is it not appalling that that, in the majority of cases, is what our primary schools turn out &mdash; domestic servants for Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to nail one thing once and for all and that is this question of the post-primary education and the very high percentage which the Minister alleges our children get.  This was dreamt up by the Department a long time ago.  The Minister is not the first <Col N="473" /> one to think up this piece of ammunition. I should like to read out the answer to a question which I received today from the Minister.  Here are the figures for the amount of time a child spends in one of these post-primary educational institutions:</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that an education of that kind should be called an educational course.  It is simply a pastime for these youngsters.  It certainly will not convert them into anything significant in the line of a money-earning profession, occupation or craft.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of these people have crafts, trades and professions and attend the vocational school part-time. If the Deputy objects to that, it is another thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the provision of scholarships is completely inadequate&mdash;not only the number of scholarships but also the amount of those scholarships.  We live in a country where most of the population are Catholics and most of them happen to have large families.  For that reason, it is a very big sacrifice for a man, no matter to what grade he belongs, but particularly to the white-collar worker or the manual worker, to say to a child of 14, 16 or 17 years: &ldquo;You go on and try to get into a secondary school and then try to get into a university or Bolton Street, or one of these places.&rdquo;  That man will be at the loss of that child's tiny earnings, admittedly, but some earnings, if he went out as a messenger boy or a newspaper vendor or whatever it might be.  A man with a big family&mdash;the bigger the family, the bigger the sacrifice&mdash;is at the loss of those tiny earnings from 14 to 20 years, or whatever period it might be that the child would be at a secondary school or university.  He has to feed and clothe the child and to provide it, I suppose, with pocket money now and again&mdash;and he has to do that for the second, third, fourth, fifth, up to <Col N="476" /> the ninth or tenth child.  Quite clearly, most families find they simply cannot do it.</P>
      <P>As a result of the absolute inadequacy of scholarships made available by the local authorities, the family cannot afford to be at the loss of the income and certainly they are not in any way compensated for the loss of that income by the local authorities' relatively tiny contribution.  A lot of people say that the Brothers who run the secondary schools do not ask very high fees.  That is quite true.  It is a pity they have to ask any fees at all. Whatever the fee may be, whether £2 or £3 a term, or a year, it is not the most important thing to the parent. The factors I have mentioned are even more important than the fee.  The fee, of course, on top of that, adds to the difficulty of the parent, especially where there are four or five sons.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I think that while the Minister is floundering around in his indecision about the future pattern of our educational services, he should try to use the short cut to giving youngsters a better chance of higher education, the better opportunities to higher education given to all of us who have been lucky enough to get it.  He should try to extend in a very big way the scholarships available to young children so that any child who passes a particular standard in the Leaving Certificate could automatically qualify for a scholarship, but a significant scholarship, a scholarship which would make it possible for that child&mdash;an assessment can readily be made in relation to the needs of the young person who is growing up to make him completely independent of a parent&mdash; to make him independent and at the same time, make it possible for the parent not to be called on to make too great a sacrifice for developing that child's mind to the fullness to which it was intended it should go when God gave him a mind, in a craft or profession or whatever it might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the gravest sins you can commit against a human being is to take this wonderful thing, the human mind, and foreshorten it, to destroy it at a certain age, to prevent its development <Col N="477" /> at the age of 14 or 15, or whatever it is, and where its normal intellectual development might lead on to create a physicist, a mathematician, a fine physician, an architect, an administrator, or any of these things which so many of these children are quite capable of becoming, if we would only give them the opportunity, if we were not too mean or too selfish to give them the opportunity, because there is plenty of money in the country, it appears, to be spent on many other things like drink, racing, tobacco and such things.  I believe the priorities should be the development of the young mind, giving the opportunity, the realisation of the ambition of the youngster who wants to develop his talent whatever it may be, whether it is the talent of the mind or a talent in the form of an art or craft in the hands.</P>
    <P>This we deny to a very considerable number of our children and each year we hear this&mdash;we are served up with it and the Minister will know what I am talking about&mdash;this <i>placebo</i> in order to lull us asleep for another year with the idea that there is a wonderful scheme around the corner.  Most of us have been waiting for a very long time and such schemes have not turned up. In the meantime, the boats are being loaded with these youngsters going off to these awful unknown places, cities like London, completely unprepared for the strains and stresses of life in that type of society.  It is the greatest crime which our society has committed against our youngsters in the past 40 years.  Our failure has been a real crime against the innocents.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the Minister has this extraordinary attitude.  I know he is in grave danger.  I think there has been a vendetta going on between the controllers of the secondary schools and his Department for a very long time.  It seems to me that he has allowed himself to be drawn into that vendetta.  He is very foolish to allow that.  I have had my own experience in a Department and he knows my attitude to voluntary bodies generally. Ideologically, I do not agree with them, but I take this view as a practical politician: my attitude always was <Col N="478" /> that these people may not be doing a very good job, or a job that I think is done well, but at least they are making some contribution towards dealing with the problem which needs attention. The attitude we had in the Department of Health always was: &ldquo;We have enough on our plate already without trying to take away in any way from what these people are doing or to take the responsibility which they are willing to take&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attitude to consultation is a puerile one; it is an immature one.  The essence of consultation is the acceptance of your own&mdash;possibly this may sound arrogant&mdash;superiority, the fact that you are able to make up your own mind.  There is nobody higher than the Minister in his Department. The religious orders, secondary school teachers, the ordinary primary school teachers, Deputies and Senators, the ordinary general public, the parents and pupils, all may have their own ideas; they may be right or wrong, but we all have the right, first to express these ideas and, secondly, to a fair hearing by the Minister.  There is nothing wrong with listening to people. God knows, I have listened to people from all sides; sometimes I take their advice and sometimes not; but the essence of the Minister's position is that he must make the final decision. Again, nobody has fought harder than I have to establish that principle in this House, that nobody outside this House will make the final decision on any important question or policy concerning the community except the Minister in charge of the Department, that that power is vested in him under the Constitution and nobody can take it from him.</P>
    <P>In the sense of that security, why is the Minister so shy of meeting other people, of discussing this matter with anybody who has any view on it? Listen to their views, sift their ideas, steal their ideas, use their ideas, reject their ideas&mdash;but there is nothing wrong with a man in his position, no humiliation, no loss of position, no <i>lése majesté</i> in listening to somebody.  He may gain little or nothing but he has lost nothing by doing so.  Some may be hotheads but some are people who <Col N="479" /> have been in this particular line of education for a very long time.  Why is it the Minister will not consult with any group or body within reason who are anxious to discuss the very important changes he proposes to make in regard to our educational system?  It is possible that he could create a sort of crash programme for extending educational opportunities to these youngsters who are doing one or two hours a week in a vocational school, and get them going in a proper training schedule in a secondary school as a result of consulations with the existing secondary school authorities.  Ask these authorities to what extent they can extend their amenities, to what extent can they provide additional facilities; ask them, if we were to provide the money for capital building, would they be able to speed up the provision of these amenities.  If we increase the transport services&mdash;if, as is stated in one of the memoranda, the radius is increased from six miles to 12 miles&mdash;will they supply the amenities in the school?</P>
    <P>These seem to me to be simple propositions which might prove to be workable propositions.  They are certainly propositions made <i>bona fide</i> to the Minister to help him in his present dilemmas.  To what extent has he consulted with the existing authorities in relation to his proposal with regard to comprehensive schools and in relation to the new announcement he made today with regard to a national plan for technological education?  He made that announcement, of all times, at Question Time.  He suddenly blossomed forth with this national plan for technological education.</P>
    <P>One does not know the real cause for that extraordinary decision.  However, what about the proposal?  To what extent has it been discussed with the vocational committees throughout the country?  Do they agree with it? Do they think it is feasible?  Do they think it is practicable?  Are the areas right? Can he give us any more detail of this blueprint?  He says some of the provisions are imminent.  The blueprint must be very far advanced. Perhaps he can give us more details <Col N="480" /> in his closing speech about what he proposes to do.  Where does he propose to get the teachers?  What courses does he propose to follow?  What will his objectives be with technological colleges situate in the heart of rural Ireland?  He may have sound answers to these questions, but I think he should do us the common courtesy of telling us about these things on his Estimate and not let us learn them from Press conferences, chamber of commerce dinners, or golf matches in County Clare, or wherever he happens to be when these ideas strike him.</P>
    <P>I want now to talk about something which is special to myself and on which I am giving a completely personal view.  It is not the Labour Party view, as far as I know.  It is in relation to corporal punishment.  I have spoken on this on many occasions, but I think it is worth repeating.  Are we ever going to take the rod out of teaching? I do not think the Minister knows this, but he will not get a single, reliable, up-to-date child psychologist who will defend the use of corporal punishment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I said this is a purely personal view.  Deep political differences are not involved. I do not know what the Minister's attitude is for I have never heard him speak about it, but my attitude to corporal punishment is that, naturally, I do not care for touching a child at all.  I wonder does the Minister give it any thought.  A child is either a rational child or an irrational, sick child.  If the child is a rational child and if one puts a point to him&mdash;&ldquo;Don't burn your fingers&rdquo; or &ldquo;Don't pull down the kettle off the range&rdquo; or &ldquo;Don't make a noise&rdquo; because someone is trying to sleep, and so on &mdash;the child will accept that as a reasonable proposition from a parent whom he has reason to respect.  Would the Minister agree with that basic proposition?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us leave it that it is used with their consent.  I have tried to find out what is the rationale of corporal punishment.  I have never succeeded in finding out from anybody. On what reason is it based? What is the justification for its use? There are many countries&mdash;indeed, in this regard, we are the exception&mdash; in which corporal punishment is not tolerated at all in the schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me a dreadful thing that an adult should beat a child.  It seems to me to be the opposite of all the teachings about protectintg the weak.  We always say that is the Christian ethic&mdash;protecting the weak, caring for the sick, and so on.  Yet, we use physical force in order to compel a child to take a particular line, a line which may even be a wrong line. There are many parents who are not correct in their behaviour.  We know that quite well.  Many parents do not live impeccable lives.  They do not have impeccable standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said physical force was used to make a child take a particular line.  I have never had a case on my desk in which a teacher tried through force to make a child <Col N="482" /> take a particular line.  Has the Deputy had some experience?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have.  The Minister is clearly as impenetrable as most of his predecessors.  Time will alter us all as it has altered us in regard to so many other things.  If corporal punishment is insisted upon, the most serious damage it does is the destruction of the very important emotional nexus which should exist between the parent and the child or the teacher and the child; and the child, being very clever and very ingenious, as most children are, thenceforward does everything to make certain it will never be caught again. But there is all the difference between not doing what is wrong and not being caught doing what is wrong.  Therefore, the end result of beating is that the child ends up a hypocrite and that whatever he wants to do he goes on doing, sometimes caught but most times continuing to do this wrong thing, if he wishes to do it.  I believe persuasion and reasoning is a much saner and more modern approach to the treatment of the child.</P>
      <P>One of the things I believe corporal punishment does is to brutalise the adult who beats the child.  Of course, it teaches the child that, in the final analysis, brutality or force is the best possible argument.  That, of course, to me, as a democrat who believes in the power of persuasion, inadequate though that may be, is the complete antithesis of the democratic idea that you must be able to reason with anybody, whether a child, a young adult, an adult or an old person, and by intelligent reasoning, convince him you are right and to accept your point of view.  I put forward on many occasions views different from the majority of the people in this House.  But there is that simple condition: the views held by the people in this House.  In fact, the views I have just given on this question are the views held by a very big majority of child psychologists and educationists throughout the world. The curious thing is&mdash;it is not a curious thing, really&mdash;that your view is the exceptional view.</P>

      <P>I do not know how it is that any Minister could go into the Department of Education and remain as complacent as every one of them has remained over the years in regard to the question of building schools.  As far back as I can remember I have been asking questions and, on the whole, receiving courteous answers from the then courteous Ministers. Invariably, it was a question of the number of schools requiring major structural repairs or replacement&mdash;one is as bad as the other.  There are approximately 900 to 1,000 schools between the two.  The Minister thinks that funny, too?  He has an extraordinary sense of humour.</P>

      <P>The record of the Department is this.  In 1953 grants were sanctioned by the Department, but were not spent by the Board of Works, to the total of £1.9 million. In 1955, grants of £3.2 million were unspent and, in 1957, £3.9 million were unspent.  I have the greatest admiration for Deputy O'Malley.  I think he is a good Parliamentary Secretary, an efficient one, who is interested in his Department and is running it extremely well; but I do not see how, with the best will in the world, he is going to make any serious change in the activities of the Board of Works when it comes to the building of schools. It is quite clear they have failed completely over the years to clear up this chronic, running ulcer of rotten decrepit schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the late Deputy Moylan telling us years ago that one thousand schools were unfit for human habitation. That is still virtually true, and he is dead a long time now.  We have <Col N="484" /> had a remarkable expansion in the building trade.  The Taoiseach talked about it the other day.  It is moving, he says, at top pitch at the moment. But what is it building?  Intercontinental hotels, all sorts of luxury establishments of one kind or another in Shannon, West Cork, Dublin, Donegal and various other places.  I am not objecting to these things, but, again, surely it is a question of priorities?  Surely in a sane society, concerned for its young people, concerned for its own good, it would be regarded as quite wrong and intolerable that one thousand derelict schools should be in existence at any one time in that society?</P>
    <P>I do not know how many children could be put in a school.  Say the average is 50 or 60 and multiply that by one thousand.  Those youngsters have to spend their educational lives in one of these horrible houses or schools, to which we would not go ourselves and to which we would not send our own children.  How can we tolerate this for other people's children if we are not prepared to do it for ourselves, just because so many of us have had access to Belvedere, Blackrock, Clongowes and all these other places? Why is it we are prepared to look on when lovely little children in the back streets of Dublin and of our other cities and towns are driven into these horrible hovels in order to try to get an education?</P>
    <P>Of course, they learn the dreadful aesthetics of living in such surroundings. They cannot get any sense of appreciation of the beautiful and the lovely because they never see it.  One of the extraordinary and inexplicable facts about the INTO is that they have accepted this position and do not tell their teachers that, where a school has been declared condemned, their teachers should be withdrawn from that school until the Minister replaces it.  Some serious action should be taken so that some end is put to this completely dilatory inefficiency of the joint activities of the Department of Education and the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>The money, apparently, is there.  It is not being spent fast enough.  What is the reason for that? What projected building programme have you for the <Col N="485" /> next five years or ten years?  When are you going to get rid of this backlog of one thousand schools requiring replacement or major repair?  What will happen to the youngsters in them? Have you any feeling for the youngsters who have to go to these horrible places to be educated or for the unfortunate teachers who have to work in these insanitary and unhygienic buildings?  How can they take any serious interest in their job if they are working in these conditions?  I am absolutely amazed at their continued patience at the position.</P>
    <P>Anybody who tells me this is not a privileged society can be shown many aspects of this society, but probably in our schools the difference between the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo; is most clearly seen: the wonderful buildings in our secondary schools, in the Belvederes, in the Clongowes, and so on, the magnificent playing grounds, the swimming pools&mdash;every possible recreational amenity.  Then go down to Church Street, Blackhall Place or any of these places and you will see youngsters swinging around lampposts on the end of ropes&mdash;the two societies, the two nations, 40 years of achievement of failure by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency, Ringsend School have asked the Minister on many occasions what action he proposed to take about it and the only action is the usual, no action.  The school is there, and as far as I can see, he does not intend to make any significant change in it in the foreseeable future.  Meanwhile, the unfortunate people see next door to them the biggest hotel in the city, the Intercontinental being erected.  Opposite, there is the American embassy.  While that is their business, we should have some concern for our young people and, above all, the Minister should have some concern for these people.  He should feel a personal sense of responsibility that these scabrous type of buildings should still be there and our young people should have to go to them.  We give them little enough.  They go to classes of 50, 60, or 70 pupils in which they learn little or nothing.  At <Col N="486" /> least while they are there, they should be comfortable.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the teachers tolerate from the Department the size of so many of the classes in the city of Dublin.  I know well it is easy for me to talk about corporal punishment when teachers are faced with 70 infants whose parents beat them.  I suppose it becomes a serious problem for the teacher working in overcrowded, unheated buildings, but that is no justification. That is merely another indictment of the Minister.  It is not the children who should be punished for the Minister's failure or the Department's failure.  The Minister deserves to be criticised and to be told of the magnitude of the failure of his Department, of his own personal failure since he took over that Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne dealt very well with the absurd decision not to give recognition to teachers who took training in Britain.  There is absolutely no justification for that attitude.  As Deputy Byrne pointed out quite rightly, most of us got our post-graduate training in Great Britain and were glad to get it there.  We came back then and we were able to give the benefit of our experience in looking after our own people here.  It seems to me to be a particularly mean-minded remark on the part of the Minister when he said if we took this step, we would encourage people to go abroad and we might not get back the best of them; it might be that we would get back the rejects of another system.  That is a completely scandalous remark but it is typical of the superficial thinking of the Minister on this important question.</P>
    <P>One of the most important things the Minister must learn to do is to appreciate that he is in charge of a very run-down Department, a Department whose status and prestige in the country it would be difficult to conceive as being lower than it is at present because of this failure in practically every field in which it operates.  That this contempt for the Department's activity is fully justified can be proven to anybody who chooses to examine the position as it is in this country and, most of all, who examines the products <Col N="487" /> of the educational system, the failure to provide equality of opportunity, the creation of a rigid class system, of privilege for the wealthy, the perpetuation of the old pre-Rising son-of-the-manse mentality.  If you were born in the right bed, then you went to the top because your parents could afford to put you at the top.  In our society, no matter how talented or how gifted a youngster might be, if he is not lucky enough to choose the right father and mother, the right bed to be born in, then the emigrant ship and the doss-house in Camden Town or domestic service in Lyon's Corner House is the only prospect which this so-called Christian society offers to the unfortunate youngsters.</P>

    <P>It is regrettable that a Deputy should say that the standard of Irish at the present time is due in any way to the fact that the standard of teaching is not what it should be.  If that is the case, the training colleges which have been training teachers and the best advice which could be given, are at fault.  The teachers have been carrying out the mandate as they got it, and teachers have been saying for years that there should be more emphasis on the spoken word.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley's statement tonight that the fact that our young children are not talking Irish is the fault of the teaching in the schools would hardly bear critical examination.</P>
    <P>I should not like to let pass a reference made by Deputy Dr. Browne.  He has what I can only describe as a bee in his own bonnet and is continually speaking about beatings.  The most severe type of punishment that can be used is punishment mentally inflicted, and that was practised here tonight very successfully by him&mdash;or at least he attempted it.</P>

    <P>I introduced the Estimate in Irish and gave a translation in English so that there would be no bickering about the use of Irish.  Since I cannot have a translation of what I say at the end, I deal with it in English.  There is a wide range to be covered but tonight it is important for me to deal with Deputy Dr. Browne who, I notice, has departed rather hurriedly.  He covered the whole range of what politics in Ireland should be and launched some personal attacks on what he called corrupt practices, brutalities and teachers making children take a line &mdash;he did not say indoctrination&mdash; through physical force.</P>
    <P>While a lot of this must be excused &mdash;and I do excuse what can happen when a man starts imagining things&mdash; I must deal with what he said about the Governors and Guardians of the National Gallery.  I agree that I am the responsible Minister for the National Gallery, but the Governors and Guardians constitute an autonomous body, established by law, to which the Government make appointments. The people on it have been appointed over the years&mdash;many of them in my term&mdash;and are people of repute, all people of standing and all people who give their services to the Board voluntarily.  I am keenly aware of their continuing interest in the welfare of the National Gallery.  None of them has anything to gain from his position on that Board.  As I say, they are an autonomous Board and when they are making an appointment they make the conditions of the appointment, but the moneys come through me and so they are sanctioned by me.</P>
    <P>The salaries must be sanctioned by me but the changes in the advertisements referred to, other than the change in salaries were made by the Governors.  They had a perfect right to do that.  However, I sanctioned the <Col N="490" /> extra salary in order to attract a better qualified or more suitable person for the post.  The governers had told me the first advertisement did not attract what they regarded as the most suitable and best qualified applicants possible. They were deeply concerned with filling this post with the best possible person, and that is as it should be because they are the ones best able to judge the qualities of the applicants. If they felt that by raising the salary they would get better qualities then they had a right to do it without incurring the charge of corrupt practice. The mud has been thrown and I doubt if anything I can say can protect them any more than it could protect anybody else from attacks launched on them under the privilege of this House. However, it is my duty to defend them to the best of my ability.  My only relationship with them is in the matter of sanctioning the salaries.  The rest of what the Deputy said I shall deal with when I come to the details concerned.</P>
    <P>There has been such a wide discussion on the Estimate that I shall deal mainly with the broad set-up of our educational system.  Firstly, I think I should deal with the primary school, which is the first step in the child's education.  In spite of what Deputy Dr. Browne said&mdash;it was a contradiction of what every other Deputy had to say&mdash;there has been a very great improvement in the number of school places through the building of new schools and the major reconstruction and improvement of existing structures.</P>
    <P>Thus, the number of school places was roughly doubled a few years ago, and since then we have been on the road to seeing the clearing off of a backlog which was there for a long time of old and unsuitable schools. We started off on that backlog a long time ago &mdash; at the beginning of the State, in fact.  Nobody knew exactly how many schools needed to be replaced, but there was a general impression that it was around 1,000. From the experience we have had of replacing schools, we have learned that it is more likely the number will be nearer 2,000.  The general situation of the rebuilding of schools, priorities <Col N="491" /> and so on, brought about the situation where each year the number of schools being replaced was only about equal to the number of schools which were falling for replacement, so we had a backlog over a long period even when we were building new schools, no inroads being made in the backlog itself.</P>
    <P>It has only been since we were able to almost double the programme that we have been cutting into the backlog of old unsuitable schools and progressing on the road to seeing the end of them.  There have been big problems of professional staffs in the planning department; there has been the problem of finance.  These problems will be overcome by new techniques, and as Deputies will have noticed, during the year we introduced a new type of school building which can be produced industrially.  It was planned and produced by the Office of Public Works in co-operation with a Dublin firm&mdash;Messrs.  Crowe, I think.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of these new techniques, the replacement rate will be even faster.  There is no question of complacency.  Every Deputy has set his mind to getting rid of the old unsuitable school buildings, and we are doing this as quickly as is physically possible.  I do not think there is any other way and if there is another way of speeding things up, it will be adopted.</P>
    <P>This year saw the greatest rate of provision of new schools and it is intended that there shall be a further increase in the drive next year.  Perhaps many schools would have lasted longer if better cared for.  Last year we introduced the system of painting grants to managers who can now get a grant to paint the inside of a school every four years and the outside every eight years.  These grants are contingent on other maintenance work being done.  This should go a long way towards preserving the new schools.</P>
    <P>Heating and cleaning of schools was mentioned by Deputy Barron.  Again, we give grants for this and I can now also announce that we intend next year to give a substantial increase in those grants.  I am so close to next year's Estimate that I am dealing with both <Col N="492" /> at the same time but it is intended to give a substantial increase in heating and cleaning grants and that will fall to next year's Estimate.</P>
    <P>In Dublin and perhaps in other cities, there is the problem of large numbers of classes in national schools. I told the Dáil today that the average class, if we take the number of pupils and the number of teachers, is 29.9 pupils per teacher throughout the country as a whole.  In Dublin you do meet those very large classes the existence of which I in no way condone. I do not think they should exist and over the last five years as teachers were made available I and my predecessor have been able to announce an improvement in the teacher-pupil ratio. As the teachers were available we allowed the schools to have an extra teacher to improve the ratio.  Over the past three years, the benefit of this fell on the large classes in the larger schools.  I had hoped in time as teachers became available we would handle the problem in that way but now, as a result of work done by officers of my Department in surveying the situation and as a result of information received, I am led to hope that reorganisation of classes with perhaps control of enrolment or distribution of enrolment plus the addition of teachers and here and there a temporary building added on to the school, will help us to solve that problem in Dublin in a reasonable time and much quicker than if we had to wait until extra teachers were available to improve the ratio.</P>
    <P>Somebody suggested a parents' committee. I dealt with this before and my attitude is that as Minister I must have somebody who is completely responsible to me for the management of a school.  I have in one case dealt with a committee and I had the experience of three different groups coming to see me as the same committee, negotiating with them and reaching agreement and then the committee come back and say: &ldquo;We do not agree with the rest of the committee&rdquo;.  You must have one person charged with management of schools and responsible to the Minister. After that, if there could be a group, <Col N="493" /> it would avoid a lot of trouble which we have.  One Deputy tonight spoke of punishment of children and I think a parents' committee working with the teachers, could avoid much of that trouble and also avoid something which I see quite frequently&mdash;others may not &mdash;and that is the teacher accused in the wrong and found after investigation to be blameless but exposed not only to my investigation but too often to questions in the Dáil.  A committee could be of help in that.</P>
    <P>But there are problems in this.  No parent has a right over the children of other people.  Unless you get a good representative committee, you might find people who are inclined to know how to rear everyone else's child, taking over the committee.  I can see the point in having a consultative committee as long as there is one person, the manager, responsible to me and in authority, and if he selects a committee to help to improve relations and make smoother the running of the school, I could agree with that.</P>
    <P>It was suggested tonight that civics should be taught in the national schools.  Civics is part of Christian doctrine and history but I feel it should be taught and it is one of the subjects which would be added to the curriculum if we could get the extra half hour which I have suggested should be added to the school day.  Physical education and rural science would be others.  They are all desirable subjects if you have extra time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am seeking extra time.  I understand from An tAthair Ó hUallacháin that when his studies are completed, it should be possible to reduce the time spent in teaching Irish and still teach it better and with better results.  This, again, would be an advantage in that it would allow us to introduce other subjects.  I think the standard of Irish taught in the national schools is good.  I imagine that the average child&mdash;perhaps not all of them &mdash;from the average national school has such a knowledge of Irish that if an adult had the same knowledge of <Col N="494" /> a continental language, he would be very happy about it.  This is a credit to the teachers and to the pupils.  We have standardised and graded the books and I believe the teachers are satisfied that the standard of Irish among the children is rising.</P>
      <P>I do not know if there was anything else in relation to the national schools. There was the question of punishment. There is not as much punishment as there is publicity of it but there are cases where I am satisfied that there was punishment out of the ordinary or in the wrong and I deal with these cases quite severely, according to their merits, if you like.  I do not publish what I do and I do not believe that it should be part of the punishment of a teacher to have his name dragged through Dáil Éireann and the public Press.</P>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Dr. Browne is not here.  Unlike him, I do not like talking about people when they are not present.  I will wait until he is back, tomorrow, and then I will talk about him.  I do think that he is wronging a great number of people when he comes in here dragging people's names through this House, giving an impression that teachers are a kind of indoctrinators, making children take a certain line under threat of physical force.  I do not understand him.  He seems to think physical force is wrong but this mental violence to which he subjects these people&mdash;he has done it to the art teachers and the other teachers&mdash;the anguish they have to go through&mdash; this seems to be all right with him. To me, it seems to be all wrong.  With him, children are all right but adults must have their characters taken away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the school-leaving age was raised during the debate and the question of a transition between primary and post-primary education. I find, in reading between the lines, when people ask questions about it, that they think in terms of compulsory education as being always in the primary school, that anything compulsory must be primary and after that you pay for it or you do not and you do not get it at all.  Once you think in terms of having schooling beyond 14 <Col N="495" /> years of age, you have to think in terms of post-primary education.  The raising of the school-leaving age involves other questions that people do not seem to realise.  They think you raise the school-leaving age and everybody stays where he is in school.  This cannot happen.  You raise the school-leaving age by having teachers and classrooms and a range of courses above the primary level available.</P>
    <P>Also, raising the school-leaving age means making education up to, say, 15 years of age compulsory.  It is the compulsory thing that comes into our side of it as a Dáil.  It is making it legally compulsory.  I gave the figures today in the Dáil.  At the moment, about two-thirds of the children in the 14-15 age group are attending school voluntarily.  There is no need to make a compulsory law for them. If the other one-third, or roughly one-third, wanted to go to school now, there is no room for them.  We have to provide the room.  So there is no good in making a law for that.  What we have to do is make provision and I am certain, because our experience in the past few years showed it, that as we make room, it will be taken up voluntarily, and if you fix a compulsory school-leaving age of 15, it will be necessary only for a very small number because most of our children are anxious to go to school up to 15 when the accommodation is available.</P>
    <P>I have some figures on the age groups to make that clearer.  I had a look at the figures of people attending post-primary education because one of the morning newspapers yesterday carried an article which said that the Minister&mdash;that is, I&mdash;in his reply to the debate on the Estimates&mdash;I quote now:</P>
    <P>is not likely to stress the fact that three-quarters of the children in Ireland receive no formal secondary education and that two-thirds of them are deprived of technical education as well.</P>
    <P>I am not likely to stress that because it is not a fact.  It is quite incorrect and misleading.  I shall give the facts.  I <Col N="496" /> have given these facts before&mdash;not in the same form&mdash;but I have given the facts of the case but the old story keeps coming in all the time.  According to the 1961 census, there were in the 14-15 age group 57,503 persons.  Of those, there were 36,624 in full-time attendance at school in February, 1962, that is, 64 per cent.  Of these 36,624, 32,268, or 56 per cent of the age group, were receiving post-primary education.  The position, therefore, for the 14-15 age group is that 56 per cent are receiving post-primary education, 64 per cent are in full-time attendance at school.  That is the figure for last year.  Things are improving.  Each year there are more.  In the older age group, 15-16, according to the census, there were 56,462 persons.  Of those, 26,111 pupils were attending school full-time, that is, 46 per cent.  Of these 26,111, 25,662 were receiving full-time post-primary education or, in other words, of the 15-16 age group, 47 per cent are receiving full-time post-primary education.</P>
    <P>In addition to those in those two groups, there are children under 14 in post-primary education, a total of 23,070 that is, in secondary education, and 4,404 in full-time vocational education.  Above the age group, over 16, there are children receiving full-time secondary education, 25,327, and full-time vocational education, 5,596. These extra figures might confuse the issue.  I want to deal with the figures in the 14-15 and 15-16 age group because these are the people concerned in the raising of the school-leaving age.  There is a common error people make in estimating the percentage of our children who get post-primary education.  They do it as a simple sum. They take the number of children in primary schools, that is, 500,000, and then they take the number in post-primary schools and divide one into the other.  This looks reasonable enough but you cannot express the number of people in secondary schools as a percentage of the people in primary schools because the primary school covers a ten-year age group and the post-primary covers an age group of, say, from two years to six years.  That is why you get these <Col N="497" /> inaccurate figures.  The attendance can be expressed only as a percentage of the age group that could be there.</P>
    <P>This is an annual event with me&mdash; making statements on this&mdash;and it is necessary each year to do it because again and again the story comes back based on the other sum.  All these figures add up to the fact that about 64 per cent of the children aged 14 to 15 years are in full-time attendance at school; that they are using the accommodation we have made available; that, in the past few years, as accommodation became available, they filled it and, at the rate we are going in providing school accommodation and teachers, we should, at the end of this decade, have that age group in full-time attendance at school and it will be possible then to raise the school-leaving age to 15 and to make it compulsory.</P>

      <P>My talk has been in vain&mdash;the compulsory school leaving age.  When you go up to 15 years, you will have to provide a wider range of courses.  You will have to provide secondary courses and vocational courses as well as the course in the national school.</P>
      <P>I have given some idea of the post-primary figures and the opportunities. I suppose I should talk about what we need to do in the post-primary level and what I announced we shall do. First, I suppose I should explain that at post-primary level we have had for some time two almost separate departments&mdash;the first is the secondary and the other the vocational and technical. These have been almost water-tight departments all the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A child wanting continuation education had these opportunities open to him.  He could go to a vocational school.  In many parts of the country he could, at a small fee, go to a secondary school.  If he had money, he might go to a secondary school no matter what the fee.  He could win a scholarship to a secondary school&mdash; these were limited.  Later than that, <Col N="498" /> he could have a university course if he had the money or if he had great ability and won a scholarship.</P>
    <P>Coming on this scene it is not an easy thing to formulate a new plan.  You had secondary schools and vocational schools in two water-tight departments. You had a scholarship scheme which was not satisfactory and places taken up in secondary schools and universities with people paying for them. Time was bound to be necessary to form some system of complete education. As an interim measure, this Government decided to increase the opportunities for scholarships.</P>
    <P>The last Dáil passed the Scholarships Act which allowed the State to help local authorities with their scholarship schemes.  The net result, roughly, was that the number of scholarships was increased by about 300 per cent. Their value was brought into line with the fees of schools because hitherto many of the scholarships were of no value to the really badly-off person because, being for such small amounts, they were of use only to a person who had some money.</P>
    <P>The figures are, roughly, an increase from 500 odd scholarships to secondary schools to 1,700 odd scholarships since the Scholarships Act became law.  This was the immediate and only way of dealing with the situation.</P>
    <P>When you increase the number of scholarships available you are coming down from the very brilliant to the less brilliant pupil.  If you have an adequate number of scholarships you will have a situation which ensures that everybody with ability will get secondary education.  We have not reached that yet but, by so increasing the number of scholarships, we have ensured that opportunity has been opened to a very much bigger number of clever children who do not have to be really out and out geniuses to get scholarships, which was the case when they were so scarce.</P>
    <P>The big problem of so changing our system, deciding how and where to invest in it, is something one could not do with a wave of a wand.  There are some things that one can see quite clearly should be done.  But, in the <Col N="499" /> very complex situation which we have here in our education in Ireland, careful study must be done.  I must warn the House that a great deal of money must be spent on education in Ireland and it cannot be thrown away.</P>
    <P>There is no part of our educational system which could not improve with more money and any expenditure will have to be done in a planned way after a thorough investigation and as accurate as possible projections on our future needs and on what future Government activity should be.  With that in mind, and realising that the greatest economic asset we have is the ability of our people, we were the first country in Western Europe to participate with the OECD in a scheme for surveys in respect of economic investment in education.  This scheme applied to countries which are already classed as developed or advanced educationally.</P>
    <P>The progress of the national team which has been engaged in the survey and the methods they have employed are regarded so highly that OECD has awarded a number of scholarships to foreign students to come here in order to study the methods being adopted by them.  We hope to have the results of their survey available to us this year.  Some time before that survey was set up a Commission on Higher Education was established.  We hope they will have completed their examinations and deliberations this year, too.</P>
    <P>A thorough study has been made in so far as it is possible to make a complete study of our educational set-up and future needs.  There will be recommendations on what the State should do.  Where money should be invested, how many university places should be available&mdash;all these will be on a sound basis of thorough study and will be coming to us during this year.  They will sign-post clearly the direction in which we must go, the areas where we must spend our money, the increased money which we must spend.  As I say, the House will have to face up to the fact when we have a clear idea, and when it is clearly in focus where we are going, that a great deal of <Col N="500" /> money will have to be made available for education.  In the meantime, while waiting for these&mdash;somebody said we should set up a commission to postpone them and just to make a lie of that&mdash;I went ahead with plans which would fit in, no matter what recommendations were made.</P>
    <P>Last May I announced my plans for post-primary education as a blueprint, a broad outline.  Some Deputies thought I announced this with the purpose of influencing the Dublin North-East by-election but anybody with the slightest idea of what is involved in formulating an educational plan could not honestly think you could time its completion to the date of a by-election.  Funnily enough, Deputy Browne who accused me of announcing it for the by-election accused me of staying silent for the coming by-elections, so that either way I would lose.  Heads you win; tails I lose.</P>
    <P>It would be a very stupid person, as I say, who would imagine that you could formulate an educational plan in time for a by-election.  It requires a lot of time and those who have read it will have seen the number of problems which had to be dealt with in formulating it.  It was essential that this broad outline be formed and announced; there could be no progress in the details until that was done, until there was general acceptance of it.  It was very well received. That was about eight months ago and since then, two committees have been operating in the Department of Education, one working out revised programmes in various subjects and the other carrying out detailed surveys in relation to the areas in which the comprehensive schools mentioned in the plan would be situated.</P>
    <P>The work of planning the programme is well advanced.  The programme, as Deputies will remember, is a programme for a common examination which can be taken in a certain range of subjects, from the vocational school subjects, the secondary school subjects, as now taught, and the comprehensive school subjects which will be the total range.  Therefore you can imagine that it takes <Col N="501" /> some time to work out that type of new programme but the work is very well advanced.  The work of the committee in relation to the areas in which the schools will be situated has reached the stage at which negotiations with the local interests involved have been entered into in relation to the placing and organisation of comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a new type of building, a new curriculum and a new system of control, and here again a person who expected this to be completed within eight months is more than impatient, when you consider that when we want an ordinary vocational school it may take anything from three to ten years from the time it is decided to build it to the time its erection is set in motion.  The plan, as I say, involved a common examination at intermediate certificate level which could be <Col N="502" /> taken by children coming from comprehensive schools, from the secondary schools or the vocational schools. There would be a core of subjects common to all and a range from which others could pick.  In the three year course in the comprehensive school, children would be guided to the subjects most suited to his or her aptitudes by a system between the teacher and trained people.  We hope to evolve&mdash; I think Deputy Colley asked about this&mdash;our own testing and it would not be a mechanical testing but something that would go on over three years.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
