    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether it is a fact that the EEC Court of Justice has ruled that the signing of the Rome Treaty involved a transfer of sovereign powers in specific sectors from National Governments to the Community and that therefore member States could not enact legislation that was incompatible in any respect with their previous obligations under the Rome Treaty; whether consideration has been given to the question as to whether an amendment of the Irish Constitution would be required before the Government signed the Rome Treaty in any form of membership or association; and, if so, with what result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Communities on the 15th July, 1964, in the case of Costa versus ENEL, the Italian electricity authority.  The Official Report of the judgment of the Court is not yet available but such information as has been published does not suggest that the Court's decision raises any new constitutional issues.</P>
      <P>In view of the postponement of action on our application for membership of the European Community, consideration of what amendments, if any, would need to be made to the Constitution in that connection has been deferred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware that in EEC countries such as France, Italy and the Netherlands there has developed a pattern of severe inflationary pressures; and that price movements and trade patterns have brought about significant disequilibrium in the Community and the likelihood of a further deterioration; and whether in the circumstances the Government consider it justifiable to adhere to their repeatedly declared intention to seek full membership by 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The economic developments in the European Economic Community referred to in the question do not appear to be such as to necessitate reconsideration of the Government's policy in relation to membership of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether it is a fact that Spain, Nigeria, Austria, Morocco and the eighteen independent African States have sought or established agreements for association with the EEC; and if a similar type of association is now to be sought by the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the countries mentioned have sought or established arrangements of one kind or another with the European Economic Community.  As regards the second part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a question addressed to me in this House on the 18th November, 1964.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the concessions made by the British Government to its EFTA partners in regard to the 15 per cent levy will be available to Irish industrial exporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There have not been any concessions announced by the British Government exclusive to members of the European Free Trade Association in relation to the 15 per cent temporary import charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="269" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach's attention been directed to the allegation that appeared in a certain English newspaper that the British Government had agreed with the EFTA partners that industrial goods for export, on foot of contracts completed between the parties prior to the announcement of the 15 per cent levy, would be admitted exempt from the levy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think the Deputy has misread the announcement. An arrangement has been made, and is incorporated in the British Finance Bill, which exempts suppliers of goods to British customers under contracts which required that these goods would be supplied at prices inclusive of any customs duty, from an obligation to pay the temporary surcharge, but the surcharge would presumably be payable by the importers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understood the publication, there was some concession made to the EFTA partners on the lines indicated by me, that on foot of contracts completed, the levy would not operate on the goods subsequently delivered.  May I take it, however, that if there is any mitigation of the impact of the 15 per cent on industrial goods, representations will be made to obtain a corresponding mitigation for Irish industrialists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever changes are made in the British legislation will be generally applicable, I understand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Government will watch the situation and, if any concession is given to the EFTA partners, they will seek the same for us?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether any revised estimate of the cost to the health service of the provision of a choice of doctor for the lower income groups has been made since a reply of 13th February, 1963; <Col N="276" /> and, if so, what is the amount of this revised estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to increases in remuneration generally and in some prices since the estimates of cost referred to in my reply of 13th February, <Col N="277" /> 1963, were made, it is thought that the figures given in that reply might now be revised upwards to £1.1 million or £1.8 million a year, depending on the type of scheme.  I would stress, however, that these figures merely give an indication of the order of extra expenditure involved in this type of scheme and should not be regarded as firm costings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the amount of the increased expenditure to date incurred by each local health authority following the issue of his Department's circular of September, 1961, to the effect that persons not included in the general medical register may in certain limited circumstances be entitled to free or partially free drugs or medicines; and the amount of such expenditure incurred in the past three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The information given in the reply is in respect of the calendar years 1962 and 1963.  I have been unable, in the limited time at my disposal, to obtain the information in respect of the current year to date, or in respect of the past three months, but if the Deputy repeats the question <Col N="278" /> in the New Year, I expect to be in a position to supply these further particulars.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will note that the information for the years 1962 and 1963 is incomplete in respect of some health authorities.  The authorities concerned generally supplied the medicines and drugs in conjunction with the dispensary services and did not keep separate records of expenditure on such items. Health authorities should, however, be in a position to furnish full information in respect of the current year as they were requested in a supplementary circular letter issued from my Department on the 24th July, 1964, to keep full records of the cost of medicines and drugs supplied in hardship cases.  That circular also requested health authorities to take all reasonable steps to ensure that persons who might wish to obtain medicines and drugs as hardship cases were aware of the facilities available.</P>
      <P>As the reply is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>EXPENDITURE by health authorities in supplying medicines and drugs under Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, in cases of hardship to persons not covered by general medical services cards.</P>

      <P>As I explained in reply to previous similar questions by the Deputy the number of medical practitioners normally engaged in active medical practice in the State cannot be stated accurately.  The number of medical practitioners according to the 1961 Census of Population was 2,952 which compares with the figure of 2,921 obtained from the 1951 Census.  As I stated on the earlier occasions <Col N="285" /> referred to, the Census figure is believed to include a number of doctors not in active practice.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that the amount received by health authorities in the financial year ended 31st March last by way of charges under section 15 of the Health Act, 1953, and section 231A of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, was £520,000.  This sum represents the direct loss of income which would result if the charges were abolished.  It is not possible to estimate closely the saving which would accrue in the administrative costs of assessing and collecting these charges.  Replies to an inquiry which my Department addressed to health authorities indicate that the saving might be in the region of £60,000 a year.</P>

      <P>I am aware that due to the numbers involved, difficulty has been experienced by the Dublin Health <Col N="287" /> Authority in providing an adequate dental service for national school children in respect of defects discovered at school health examinations.</P>
      <P>The measures to be taken to remedy the situation are a matter for the Health Authority in the first instance.  In my replies to previous questions put by the Deputy, I referred to a comprehensive review of the dental services in their area which was being undertaken by the health authority.  I am informed that shortly after his appointment, the Chief Dental Surgeon of the health authority carried out a survey of the services and, in an interim report, has put forward certain recommendations which are designed to secure an immediate improvement.  Arising from these recommendations, I have recently approved a proposal of the health authority for the employment of a number of private dentists on a sessional basis to provide services in their own surgeries for national school children, from certain outlying parts of the city, referred to them by the Health Authority for treatment.  I understand that a further recommendation for the employment of additional permanent staff was recently approved by the general purposes committee of the health authority and will shortly come before the health authority; in that connection I am prepared to consider sympathetically any reasonable proposal that may be submitted to me for sanction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a report in the newspapers of the verdict in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have naturally taken cognisance of the verdict of a jury as <Col N="288" /> reported, it does not dispose me to alter my opinion that on present evidence smoking to excess appears to be highly dangerous to health.  In this connection, it is pertinent to point out that the newspaper report to which the Deputy refers also contains the information that the deceased person, whose estate was involved in the case, died of lung cancer and was &ldquo;a three-packets-a-day smoker&rdquo;.  Therefore, notwithstanding the finding of the American jury, I shall continue the campaign which I have initiated to discourage smoking, and to impress on children and adolescents, and on their parents and others who may be in a position to influence them, that, on the basis of statistical evidence, gathered in a number of scientific investigations in different countries, the highest medical authorities are convinced that smoking is dangerous to health in that it may give rise to lung cancer, heart disease and other morbid conditions and should be discouraged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 36 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>By the second half of 1960, it had become clear that because of the impending resignation on age grounds of many members of the Garda Síochána, the provision of extended and improved training facilities was a matter of great urgency.  While it would have been possible to carry out a scheme of reconstruction at the Depot in the Phoenix Park, this would be a major undertaking, and would have involved the provision of a temporary alternative training centre, which obviously would have been a difficult and costly matter.  In these circumstances, and in view of the desirability of decentralisation, it was decided to transfer the training centre to Templemore. As the pressure of existing commitments on the professional staff of the Office of Public Works made it impossible for them to handle the project in the time required, it was not possible to follow the normal practice of having the work planned and contracted for by that Office.  In the circumstances, a firm of private architects, together with a quantity surveyor and heating and lighting consultants were appointed by the Department of Justice to prepare the necessary plans and specifications, etc., and to supervise the execution of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was considered that the work could most expeditiously be carried out by means of a contract providing for a schedule of rates, with bills of approximate quantities.  This, I am advised, is a type of contract commonly used for, and particularly suited to, a project of the kind involved here, and its adoption ensured the commencement <Col N="293" /> of the scheme with a minimum of delay.  Specifications and adequate plans were available at the time tenders were sought, but, in accordance with the invariable practice in all major building contracts, supplementary detailed drawings were prepared for the information and guidance of the contractor as the work progressed.</P>
    <P>Based on the lowest acceptable tender received, it was estimated that the total cost of the work, as initially contracted for, would amount to about £385,000, exclusive of architectural, etc., fees, which were estimated at approximately £41,000, made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The fees were calculated at the minimum rates laid down by the relevant professional associations.</P>
    <P>The present estimated cost of the works which have, in the main, been completed amounts to £576,500, exclusive of professional fees.</P>
    <P>Of the estimated increase of, approximately, £191,000 over the figure of £385,000 referred to earlier, about £150,000 is due to additional works which had not originally been included in the contract but which, from the initiation of the project, had been in contemplation, and which were, in the final analysis, considered by the Department of Justice to be essential to the provision of a fully-efficient and up-to-date training centre.  These works, which were carried out at the rates provided for in the contract, included the provision of a swimming pool, open and covered handball-alleys, basketball courts, rifle-range, bedding-store, driving school, etc.  The balance of £41,000 is accountable to increases in wages and the prices of materials, which occurred subsequent to the placing of the contract, and to variations in the extent of the work actually executed&mdash;for example, on the structure's being opened up, it was found <Col N="294" /> that ceiling joists on the top floors were defective and had to be replaced, spine walls to stairs had to be rebuilt, and brick arches at landings had to be replaced in concrete.  A price variation clause is, of course, a standard provision in building contracts.</P>
    <P>As the amount of the professional fees payable in respect of a contract is calculated by reference to the final cost of the work, the initial figure of £41,000 has to be increased.  It is now estimated that the appropriate figure will be in the region of £60,000, made up as follows:</P>

    <P>The exact amount cannot, however, be given until the final account for the project has been settled.</P>
    <P>While the total expenditure involved may seem high, I am satisfied that, taking into account the amount of work which had to be carried out, it was in no way excessive or unreasonable, and when regard is had to the benefits accruing from the decentralisation of such an important branch of the State service as the Garda Training Depot, it cannot be disputed that the cost of the scheme is justified in the extreme.</P>
    <P>I might, perhaps, add that it has been estimated that, at a minimum, the present-day cost of providing new accommodation and facilities similar to those which are now available in Templemore would be of the order of £800,000, exclusive of professional fees and the cost of a suitable site.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential that first-class facilities should be provided, but could the Parliamentary Secretary say why such a substantial amount, £150,000, of supplementary costs were found necessary after work had commenced on the building?  Surely it means that a very important part of the building had been omitted in the original planning?  Why did it become evident only at a very late stage that <Col N="295" /> this very expensive and probably necessary addition was required? Whose fault was it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be a certain amount of confusion on this matter.  There certainly was confusion when the matter was before the Committee on Public Accounts.  I should like to explain in regard to the reconstruction and the renovation of the existing building that the original tender was £202,000.  Increases in wages and materials came to £12,500.  The only variation or &ldquo;extra&rdquo;, in building parlance, in the £202,000 was £3,850. This is in regard to the old work.  The new building provided for in the original contract came to £82,000.  Wage and materials increases took £5,500 extra.  The only variation in that contract was the reasonable amount of £2,028.  In the mechanical services subcontract, the original estimate was £100,738.  Wage increases involved an extra of £5,000.  The variation entailed an extra £5,007&mdash;a little over five per cent.  During the progress of the contract there were additional new works which were not planned originally but were envisaged.  These works, as I have already read out, included an indoor swimming pool, an indoor and outdoor ball alley, basket ball courts, rifle range, a driving school, a bedding-store, underground petrol tanks and washing bay, garage equipment and hoists.  That was not in the original contract. It was a completely new contract.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to establish the fact that the increases in this contract were quite normal, not at all exorbitant and, in the main, less than five per cent.  It is pretty good in a substantial contract that the increases for extras amount to only about five per cent.  The contract for these new works&mdash;swimming pool, ball alleys and what I have read out&mdash;was for <Col N="296" /> £104,000.  Wage increases imposed a statutory obligation on us to pay an extra £12,522, including materials. That was unavoidable also.  In regard to the mechanical services contract, additions consequent on the indoor swimming pool and the other things I have read out cost £24,000; the requirements of the fire officer; maintenance of boiler plant and so on came to £14,000; the increase under the price variation clause amounted to £2,450.  I trust I have shown that there was confusion in the Committee of Public Accounts and that these variations were quite reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Dillon reads these figures he will understand that in respect of the original contract of £385,000 the approximate <Col N="297" /> final cost was £419,000.  Of that sum only £10,000 was an extra on variation in the contract&mdash;£10,885 on a contract of £385,000.  Of this amount there was an increased cost represented by an increase in wages and materials of £23,000 which the contractor was statutorily obliged to pay.</P>
      <P>I may further add that my Office, which was in close contact with the developments on this contract, were cognisant of instances which took place in the past and which were commented on by the Committee of Public Accounts as far as the affairs of my Office were concerned.  We were deeply conscious of the fact that in 1951, for instance, when the Coalition Government decided to acquire Shelton Abbey for use as a Forestry School a contract was placed at that time for £2,899. The work was finally completed at a cost of £110,000.  We were also aware that in November, 1949, a tiny breach occurred in embankments protecting the tidal waters of a tributary of the River Shannon in Clare and it was estimated that the repair of the breach would cost £445.  By the time the Government of the day made up their minds the final cost was £101,048.  Of course, we were also aware of the necessity to watch these matters carefully because we recalled that in 1948 there was a dredging plant that consisted of a bucket dredger, a pontoon dredger and four barges purchased from a local authority for £6,000 and an expenditure of £4,300 was incurred on towage, dry-docking and watching.  The plant was to be overhauled and auxiliary equipment was to be purchased to make the plant an effective working unit.  The original estimated cost of rendering the plant fit for service, including the purchase of auxiliary plant, was £33,000.  The final estimate amounted to £126,000.  Two of the barges sank on the way to Dublin.</P>

      <P>Five inspections in all were carried out in this case.  At the first inspection on 7th June, 1963, it was found that the applicant had not decided on the extent of the works he wished to carry out.  A second inspection was made on 6th September, 1963, at the applicant's request, and grants of £100 and £140 were allocated for works which included the conversion of the house into two separate units. Following representations received from the Deputy on 12th October, 1963, a further inspection was carried out on 8th November, 1963, when it was found that all the works specified were not completed.</P>
      <P>On 16th January, 1964, the applicant notified the Department that the work was completed and the Inspector again visited the premises on 8th February, and reported that certain outstanding items still remained to be done.  The applicant was advised to carry out these works and to notify the Department on completion.</P>
      <P>The applicant did not notify the Department of completion, or return the allocation form claiming the grant, and the final inspection was made on 29th September, 1964, following further representations from the Deputy received on the 2nd idem.  The payment form was subsequently returned by the applicant on 9th October, certified by the inspector on 30th October and payments issued to the applicant on 20th November, 1964.</P>
      <P>The delays and additional inspections in this case were largely due to the failure of the applicant to advise the Department at the appropriate times in relation to the extent of the works to be carried out and the date of their completion.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government why a person claiming a reconstruction grant is not permitted to roof a back kitchen with asbestos; and why it is necessary to use a felt roof made outside the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of back kitchens it is not normally possible to provide the required minimum roof pitch of 30º, due to the restricted area generally available.  The most satisfactory solution is to provide a timber and felt roof at a very low or flat pitch.  The primary consideration in regard to the acceptance of any material for roofing purposes, is that such material should have the longest possible lifetime and, in view of the shortcomings of corrugated asbestos roofs in this respect, their use is not permitted for grant purposes.</P>
      <P>The felt used on such jobs is required to be of Irish manufacture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill to amend and consolidate the law relating to the devolution, administration, testamentary disposition and distribution on intestacy of the property of deceased persons.  It is proposed to assimilate the law respecting real and personal estate so that realty will devolve and be distributed in the same way as personalty. The existing rules of intestate succession, which provide for the descent of realty to the heir-at-law and the distribution of personalty to the surviving spouse, issue and next-of-kin, will be abolished and replaced by new, simple and uniform rules which will be applicable to all property.  The Bill includes important new provisions designed to prevent a testator from disinheriting a spouse and children.</P>
      <P>The existing statutory law governing succession to property on death is contained in a large number of enactments, the earliest of which dates back to 1226.  These enactments are being repealed or amended in consolidated form.  When the Bill is enacted, the whole of the statutory law of succession, both testate and intestate, will be contained in one Act of the Oireachtas.  Thus, apart from anything else, the Bill represents an important step in the task of statute law consolidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed Act will apply to the estates of all persons dying after the commencement date specified in section 2.  The original idea was that this commencement date would be the 1st January, 1965, but, of course, it is now clear that a later date will have to be provided.  My present feeling, subject to whatever views Deputies may have on the subject, is that the new commencement date might be the 1st of January, 1966.  However, this is a <Col N="320" /> matter we can discuss at a later stage. It will be necessary to allow a fairly long period to elapse after the Bill passes both Houses of the Oireachtas in order to give people plenty of time to become familiar with the new law.</P>
    <P>The Bill intimately concerns every member of the community, and I think I can say that it is one of the most important measures of law reform ever to be brought before this House. Because of the important nature of the proposals which it contains, the text of the Bill was circulated at the beginning of the Summer Recess so that everybody would have ample opportunity to study its provisions before it came to be discussed by the Oireachtas.  At the time, it was clearly indicated that the Government would welcome comments on the Bill, that they would be quite prepared to consider criticisms and that they would examine any amendments that were shown to be desirable.  It has been gratifying to find that widespread public interest in the Bill has been evoked and that a great deal of helpful and constructive criticism has been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Justice, I have carefully considered all the suggestions and proposals that have been put forward.  I have had discussions with such bodies as the Incorporated Law Society and the National Farmers' Association, and I have studied in detail the various comments made in the columns of the newspapers and in correspondence received in my Department.  I have also consulted a number of independent experts on the law of succession in this country.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill that have attracted most attention are those in Parts IX and X purporting to give the spouse and issue of a testator &ldquo;legal rights&rdquo; to fixed shares of his estate.  As I have already announced publicly and as will be seen from the supplementary explanatory memorandum recently circulated to Deputies, I have obtained the approval of the Government for the preparation of a number of amendments which are designed to meet the objections and criticisms directed at these particular <Col N="321" /> provisions of the Bill.  I shall be dealing with the proposed amendments in greater detail when I come to talk about the relevant Parts of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a highly technical one and for that reason it was accompanied by a full explanatory memorandum, which I trust Deputies have found helpful.  Explanatory sidenotes have been inserted in the Bill itself showing the provisions which are new to the law and the existing statutory enactments which are being amended or consolidated.  In the circumstances, I do not think it is necessary for me to go into any great detail on the individual provisions of the Bill, and I propose, therefore, to confine myself to a general elaboration of the principles involved.</P>
    <P>Part I is the preliminary and general Part and deals with such matters as commencement, interpretation, jurisdiction of the courts and repeals.  Section 5 deals with the problem which arises where two or more persons die in circumstances making it uncertain which of them survived the other or others.  In such a case there is at present no legal presumption as to the order in which the deaths took place. This lacuna in the law gives rise to inconvenience and uncertainty when it comes to determining rights of succession to the property of the deceased, particularly where the deceased were husband and wife.</P>
    <P>In England, in the Law of Property Act, 1925, an effort was made to solve the problem by providing that the younger of the persons should be deemed to have survived the elder.  This rule has proved unsatisfactory in practice and has led to undesirable results. For example, during the last war a childless married couple were killed by a bomb.  Neither left a will.  The estate of the husband, who was the elder of the two, consisted of a sum of money and personal chattels.  By the legal fiction created under the 1925 Act the husband was deemed to have died before the wife, so that all his property passed on intestacy to the wife and then, by virtue of her intestacy, to her relatives.  The parents of the husband received nothing.</P>
    <P>In a recent case two testators, a man <Col N="322" /> and his wife, provided for the situation in which their deaths should coincide, both indicating that, in such circumstances, their property should go to their respective next-of-kin.  In fact they both died in a common disaster, but because the order in which they died was uncertain, the statutory rule laid down in the 1925 Act applied and operated to stultify the husband's expressed wishes, all his property going to his wife's relatives.  In 1952 the English rule was altered in so far as it applied to the deaths of a husband and wife where the elder of the two was intestate.  In such circumstances the younger is now deemed not to have survived the intestate.</P>
    <P>After a careful study of all the possibilities, we have decided that the best solution for the problem is to provide that, in cases of uncertainty, the persons concerned shall be deemed to have died simultaneously.  Section 5 of the Bill so provides.  This is the rule adopted in the German civil code and it has been operating satisfactorily since 1900.  There is a similar rule in the Swiss civil code.  In the first of the two English examples which I have just mentioned, the rule would have operated in such a way as to make the property of the deceased husband pass to his own instead of to his wife's relatives.  In the second example it would have operated to give effect to the testamentary wishes of the deceased husband and wife.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill states the existing jurisdiction of the High Court and Circuit Court.  I am satisfied that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court should be substantially increased.  The figures I propose are £5,000 in the case of personalty and £100 rateable valuation in the case of land.  The necessary amendment can be moved on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the devolution of real and personal estate on death.  Devolution is the legal term applied to the system under which the property of a deceased person vests in his personal representatives, that is to say, in the executors whom he has appointed in his will or, if he has not appointed executors, the persons whom the court appoints to act as administrators <Col N="323" /> of his estate.  Up to 1959, only personal property, including compulsorily registered land, devolved on the personal representatives.  Real property, that is to say, unregistered freehold land, passed immediately to the heir-at-law or devisee as the case might be. The Administration of Estates Act, 1959, provided that, in the case of estates of persons dying after 1st June, 1959, all property whether real or personal, should devolve on the personal representatives of the deceased.</P>
    <P>The duties of personal representatives are to pay the debts and funeral expenses of the deceased and to distribute the balance of the estate to those persons who are entitled thereto. The advantages of the system of devolution are threefold.  Firstly, it facilitates the protection and preservation of the deceased's property pending its distribution.  Secondly, it affords an opportunity to creditors and debtors of the deceased to have their respective rights and obligations properly adjusted. Thirdly, it provides effective machinery for the distribution of the balance of the deceased's estate.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill re-enacts the existing law and provides that all property both real and personal of a deceased person shall devolve on his personal representatives.  Section 13 provides that, where a person dies without having made a will, or where, having made a will, he dies leaving no executor surviving him, his property shall, until the grant of letters of administration in respect thereof, vest in the President of the High Court.  This is a clarification of the present law.  It is a fundamental principle that the ownership of property should at all times vest in somebody and not lie <i>in vacuo.</i></P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the abolition of all surviving feudal rules and canons of descent applicable to real estate.  This change will chiefly affect unregistered freehold land in urban areas.  Since 1891, freehold registered land, that is to say, the bulk of rural land in Ireland is distributed in the same way as personalty.  In so far as urban freehold property is concerned, the present law of succession belongs <Col N="324" /> to the Middle Ages.  Rules of primogeniture and male preference were designed for the feudal conditions of English society, but these rules are quite unsuited to the state of society in which the overwhelming majority of Irish people now live.  Rules that were intended for the preservation of feudal estates are inappropriate in a world in which the feudal obligation is no longer a factor and in which freehold property in urban areas more often than not consists of a bungalow, a flat or a semi-detached house.</P>
    <P>The removal of all remaining distinctions between real and personal property for the purposes of devolution, descent and distribution continues the process of assimilation of the law respecting the two types of property. The change will mean a great simplification in the rules of law and practice governing succession.  So far as the existing rules distinguish between real and personal estate, they no longer serve any useful purpose but they do make the law more confused than it need be.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with executors and administrators and, in the main, provides for the re-enactment of the existing law.</P>
    <P>Part IV provides for the consolidation, with amendments of the existing law relating to the issue of grants of representation.  Section 27 provides for alterations in the existing law as to the persons who shall be entitled to a grant of administration.  The High Court has always exercised a wide discretion in this matter, the overall principle adopted being that &ldquo;the grant follows the interest&rdquo;.  However, for the purpose of achieving greater flexibility, it is proposed that the order in which persons are to be entitled to a grant of administration shall be regulated by rules to be made by the President of the High Court.  In granting administration, the Court will ordinarily be bound by these rules, but it will have a discretion to depart from the rules where special circumstances so warrant. Provision is made in section 30 for the issue of grants of representation to trust corporations.</P>
    <P>I come now to a matter to which I attach the greatest importance, namely, <Col N="325" /> the need to provide adequate facilities whereby grants of representation may be obtained easily and cheaply, particularly in the case of small estates. It is desirable on social grounds as well as from the point of view of economic policy that the transmission of property on death should be a simple and inexpensive process for the ordinary person.  In the case of rural property, it is essential to the success of the Government's efforts to promote farming progress and efficiency that the titles to land should be clear and certain.</P>
    <P>At the present time, representation is taken out in only four cases out of every ten deaths of persons over 21 years of age.  Even allowing for instances in which people die leaving estates which are so small or of such a nature that the taking out of grants would not be warranted, it is clear that there is a considerable number of cases in which representation ought to be, but is not, taken out.  Such cases turn up regularly in the Land Registry, and difficulty and inconvenience are often caused to the parties to a transaction because representation has not been taken out promptly following a death.</P>
    <P>It must, I think, be assumed that the failure to take out representation is in very many cases due to the difficulty and inconvenience involved. There is also the general feeling that the process is an expensive one.  If it were made easier to take out representation, many people who are not at present prepared to put their affairs in order would do so.  In this connection, it ought to be borne in mind that the law in regard to the devolution and administration of the property of deceased persons is in the interests of the community as a whole.  Nevertheless, if people show themselves unable or unwilling to comply with the law, it is the clear duty of the State to come to their assistance by providing the requisite facilities.</P>
    <P>In order to meet the situation, section 37 of the Bill proposed to provide for an extension of the existing facilities whereby grants of representation may be obtained in a relatively cheap manner in the case of small <Col N="326" /> estates by applying to the local Customs and Excise officer under section 33 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1881.  These facilities are not at present being availed of to any appreciable extent.  In 1962, for example, there were only 156 such applications, whereas the total number of grants issued was almost 13,000. The reasons that the facilities are not being used appear to be threefold. Firstly, the ceiling of £500 is too low having regard to the present value of money.  Secondly, the number of Customs and Excise stations in declining and they are now too few and far between to provide an adequate service. Thirdly, the existence of the facilities does not appear to be generally known to members of the public.</P>
    <P>To remedy the position, section 37 of the Bill proposed to increase the limit of £500 to £2,000 and to substitute arrangements whereby applications would be made either directly to the County Registrar for the area in which the deceased resided or to some other officer to be appointed for the purpose by the Minister for Justice.  Since I took office I have had discussions about section 37 with various interested groups, including the Incorporated Law Society and the National Farmers' Association.  In the light of those discussions, I have come to the conclusion that the object of the section can better be achieved in another way.  My proposal is to delete the section and to establish district probate registries on a regional basis throughout the country. In addition, I propose to have stated clearly in the Bill the existing law whereby anybody seeking to obtain a grant of representation may make a personal application for the grant either to the Probate Office in Dublin or to a district probate registry.  There are at present only six district registries, which are situated in Castlebar, Cavan, Cork, Kilkenny, Limerick and Waterford. New registries will be set up in other centres so as to give a countrywide service.  Each new registry will be located in a specified Circuit Court office.  The County Registrar designated will be the district probate registrar for the region and he will deal with personal applications for grants of representation, <Col N="327" /> irrespective of the value of the estate.  He will prepare the papers necessary to obtain the grant and will, as far as practicable, assist applicants by giving them information and directions as to the course which they are to pursue.  He will not, of course, be able to give applicants legal advice.  Where a grant involves difficult questions of law or needs a direction of the court, or where the distribution of the property of the deceased is a very complicated matter, the applicant will have to consult a solicitor in the ordinary way.  The existing special probate fees for personal applications will be reexamined, and I envisage that in the case of small estates the fees will be not much more than nominal.</P>
    <P>The present right to make personal application for a grant of representation is contained in Rules of Court. The right was first granted in Probate Rules made in 1879.  Over the years the tendency has been to limit the number of local district registries and this has restricted the exercise of the right to make personal applications.  It is important that the right of personal application should be preserved, on the general principle that every citizen should be free to conduct his own legal business and facilitated in doing so. What I propose, therefore, is to reverse the present trend by establishing a number of additional district probate registries in county towns.  This will facilitate the making of personal applications and will also, I may say, facilitate solicitors acting for clients.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with the administration of the assets of deceased persons and continues the process of the assimilation of the law relating to realty and personalty by providing that real and personal estate shall be administered in the same way.  All the property of a deceased person is to be available for the payment of his debts and to satisfy legal rights under Part IX of the Bill.  Provision is made for the amendment and simplification of the law in regard to payment of a deceased person's debts.  Insolvent estates are to be administered in all cases in accordance with the rules for the time being in force in relation to <Col N="328" /> bankruptcy.  A new order of priority is being established for the application of assets in the case of solvent estates. This new order, which is provided for in section 47 and in Part II of the First Schedule, will be simpler than that under existing law and will be common to both realty and personalty.  Section 48 provides that any property of a deceased person which, at the time of his death, is charged with the payment of money shall be primarily liable for the payment of the charge.  This proposal involves the extension to all property of provisions in the existing law which are applicable only to realty.</P>
    <P>Sections 52, 53 and 54 lay down a code of law as to assents and conveyances by personal representatives. These sections provide, in the main, for the re-enactment of the existing law, but subsection (3) of section 53 introduces an important new provision to the effect that a conveyance of unregistered land by a personal representative shall, in the case of a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser, be conclusive evidence that the person in whose favour the conveyance was made was, in fact, the person entitled to have the land vested in him.  Thus, where a purchaser buys land from a vendor who is a beneficiary, he will no longer be obliged to concern himself with the terms of the will or of the intestacy under which the vendor acquired the property, but need only see to it that the land devolved on the personal representatives and that they, in turn, vested it in the vendor.</P>
    <P>Under section 55, the personal representatives of a deceased person are to be given a general power to appropriate any part of the deceased's estate, in its actual condition or state of investment, in or towards satisfaction of any share or interest in the property.  This has been the law in England since 1925 and in the North since 1955.</P>
    <P>Section 56 contains an entirely new provision which is primarily designed to protect the interests of widows.  It proposes to give to the surviving spouse of a deceased person the right to require appropriation of the family dwelling house in satisfaction of his or her share or interest and of the shares or interests of any infant children <Col N="329" /> for whom the surviving spouse is a trustee.  There will be exceptions to the general rule in certain circumstances as provided for in subsection (3) of the section.  The general purpose of the section is to allow the spouse to retain the family house, provided, of course, that, where the dwelling is worth more than the share to which the spouse is entitled, he or she will have to make up the balance in order to exercise the option.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in section 57 that, where an infant is entitled to a share or interest in the estate of a deceased person and no trustees have been appointed by the deceased, the personal representatives&mdash;or a trust corporation or any two or more persons appointed by the personal representatives&mdash;will be trustees of such share or interest.  These trustees will have full powers, without recourse to the court, to apply the share or interest, or the income therefrom, for the advancement or benefit of the infant during minority. They will, in particular, be able to carry on any business in which the infant is entitled to a share or interest.</P>
    <P>Section 63 of the Bill provides for the enlargement and statement in statutory form of the doctrine of advancement and the rule against double portions.  The law requires that children must bring into account any money or property they have received from the deceased in his lifetime by way of advancement or portion or upon marriage, if they wish to share in the distribution of the estate.  It is proposed that the enlarged doctrine will apply to any share or interest whether on intestacy, under a will or as a legal right.  The section as at present drafted provides for the application of the law to the share or interest of a spouse, but, on reconsideration, I feel that this would not be appropriate and might, indeed, give rise to difficulties.  Accordingly, I will be proposing on Committee Stage that the section be amended by the deletion of the reference to the share or interest of a spouse.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill proposes important changes in the rules governing the distribution of property on intestacy. The present rules are complicated and <Col N="330" /> confusing but I shall endeavour to explain them as simply as I can.  Under the Intestates' Estates Act, 1954, where a man dies intestate leaving a widow but no issue, the widow is entitled absolutely to the first £4,000 of his estate.  In the great majority of cases this means that the widow takes the whole estate.  Subject to the widow's right, the property of a person who dies intestate is distributed in accordance with rules which vary according as the property consists of realty or personalty.</P>
    <P>Realty&mdash;which, as I have already explained, nowadays consists in the main of freehold house property in urban areas&mdash;descends to the deceased owner's heir, who is ascertained in accordance with highly complex rules having their origin in feudal conditions. Under these rules, males are preferred to females, the elder male is preferred to the younger, females of the same degree all take equally, paternal ancestors are preferred to maternal ones, relatives of the whole blood take before relatives of the half blood, and so on.  A surviving spouse has certain rights which are prior to those of the heir.  Thus, a widower is entitled to a life estate in the whole of his deceased wife's realty, provided that she was seised in possession of an estate of inheritance and that issue of the marriage capable of inheriting has been born alive.  This right is known as a tenancy by the curtesy, or, more fully, a tenancy by the curtesy of England.  A widow is entitled to dower, which is a life interest in one-third of the whole of her deceased husband's realty, provided that he was seised in possession of an estate of inheritance, that issue of the marriage capable of inheriting might have been born alive, and that a declaration in bar of dower was not made by the husband during his lifetime.</P>
    <P>The existing rules for the distribution of personalty &mdash; which includes most agricultural freehold land and all leasehold land&mdash;are those laid down in the Statute of Distribution, 1695.  They provide that a widower takes the whole of his wife's personal estate even where there are issue also surviving.  A widow, on the other hand, takes only one-third <Col N="331" /> of her husband's personal estate and the issue take two-thirds.  Where there are no issue, the widow takes one-half of the estate and the next-of-kin take the other half.  This is, of course, subject to the widow's prior right to £4,000.  If an intestate dies leaving neither spouse nor issue, his father is entitled to the whole estate whether or not the mother also survives. If the father is dead, the mother, brothers and sisters share the estate equally.  Children, but not remoter descendants, of a deceased brother or sister take their parent's share.  If the mother, brothers and sisters are all dead, the children of the brothers and sisters take the estate in equal shares.</P>
    <P>The new rules of intestate succession laid down in Part VI of the Bill will be applicable to all property, both real and personal.  They are simple and uniform and are so framed as to accord due recognition to the important position which the wife occupies in the Irish family.  The existing distinction between the rights of inheritance of husband and wife and of males and females is being abolished.  Section 66 provides that, where both spouse and issue survive, the spouse will take the personal chattels and two-thirds of the remaining estate and the issue will take the remainder.  If there is a surviving spouse but no issue, it is proposed that the spouse will take the whole estate. If there are surviving issue but no spouse, the issue will take the whole estate.  Section 67 proposes to place the father and mother of an intestate on an equal footing as regards succession rights.  Thus, if an intestate dies leaving parents but no spouse or issue, the estate will be distributed between the parents in equal shares.  One consequence of this change is that the intestate's brothers and sisters, or children of deceased brothers and sisters, will be entitled to share in the estate only if the intestate leaves neither spouse nor issue nor parent surviving.</P>
    <P>In certain other jurisdictions, notably Northern Ireland, England and Scotland, the device has been adopted of giving the surviving spouse of an intestate a minimum monetary <Col N="332" /> sum plus a fraction of the remainder of the estate.  In Northern Ireland, a surviving spouse with issue gets £1,500 plus the personal chattels plus either one-half or one-third of the remaining estate, depending on whether there is only one child or more than one child. In England, a spouse with issue gets £5,000 plus the personal chattels plus a life interest in one-half of the remaining estate.  In Scotland, a spouse with issue gets £2,500 plus one-third of the moveable estate plus the dwellinghouse and the personal chattels. In Northern Ireland, a spouse without issue takes £5,000 plus the personal chattels plus one-half of the remaining estate.  In England, the same spouse takes £20,000 plus the personal chattels plus one-half of the remaining estate.  In Scotland, he or she takes £5,000 plus the dwellinghouse and personal chattels plus one-half of the movable estate.  This device of giving the surviving spouse a minimum sum plus a fraction of the remainder of the estate is not being proposed in the Bill. In the first place, to give a wife with children a sufficient monetary sum in Irish circumstances would, in fact, mean giving her two-thirds or more of the average estate.  Furthermore, monetary sums are not satisfactory, as they need to be revised from time to time to take account of changing money values.  What we are, therefore, proposing in the Bill is to adopt the system of fixed fractions of the total estate. This has been traditionally the system in this country and is also the system on the Continent.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that Part VI is concerned only with distribution of the property of an intestate and does not in any way affect property that has been disposed of by will.  If, therefore, any person considers that the rules of succession set out in this Part of the Bill would produce results that are not appropriate to his own family circumstances, his remedy is to make a will disposing of all his property.  If he does so, then, so far as he is concerned, Part VI of the Bill is of no effect.  The fact of the matter is, however, that, for one reason or another, almost fifty per cent of the people in this country die without making wills, and the purpose of <Col N="333" /> this Part of the Bill is to make for these people, so far as is possible, the sort of arrangements that they might themselves have adopted if they had made wills.  It must, of course, be appreciated that any general rules of this kind can provide only for the normal situation. The best that one can hope to do is to draw up rules which will approximate as closely as possible to the likely wishes of the average reasonable person in a normal set of circumstances.  Statutory rules of succession cannot possibly provide for every exceptional case.  On the other hand, if they are to operate effectively, they should be simple and easily understood by all.  The new rules proposed in Part VI of the Bill have been prepared with these considerations in view.  I would invite the attention of Deputies to the fact that, for convenience, a comparison between the existing and the proposed new rules is given in Appendix A on page 12 of the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under Part VII of the Bill the existing statutory law relating to wills is being consolidated with a number of important amendments.  It is proposed in section 76 that a person under twenty-one years of age who is married will be able to make a valid will.  Under section 77, the present requirement that both witnesses to the signing of a will must be present at the same time is to be abolished.  In a work entitled <i>Reform of the Law</i> prepared by the Haldane Society and published in 1951, it is claimed that this requirement has resulted in innumerable wills being held invalid and that, while it is supposed to prevent fraud, it probably facilitates far more fraud than it prevents.  I have found that views on this section are divided, and I shall be interested to hear what Deputies have to say on the matter.</P>
    <P>It is provided in section 84 that a will shall not be revoked by the subsequent marriage of the testator if the will was made in contemplation of that particular marriage, whether so expressed in the will or not.  It is also proposed that will shall be capable of being revoked by writing on the will itself in terms revoking it, or showing <Col N="334" /> an intention to revoke it, and signed by the testator.  It seems ridiculous that a will should remain valid even though the testator has crossed it out and written the words &ldquo;this is revoked&rdquo; across it.</P>
    <P>Two important changes are proposed in the law relating to the interpretation of wills, Firstly, extrinsic evidence is to be admissible to assist in the construction of, or to explain a contradiction in, a will.  This is provided for in section 89.  Secondly, in the case of doubt as to the interpretation of a gift in a will, the interpretation according to which the gift will be operative is to be preferred.  Provision to this effect is contained in section 98.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to repeal and not reenact the existing law concerning privileged wills of soldiers and sailors as contained in section 11 of the Wills Act, 1837, and in the Soldiers and Sailors Act, 1918.  Under these enactments, members of the defence forces &ldquo;in actual military service,&rdquo; and mariners and seamen at sea, enjoy a dispensation from the ordinary rules and formalities which require that a will shall be in writing and be witnessed, and which prevent a person under twenty-one years of age from making a valid will.  The enactments in question were applied by section 5 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960, to Irish troops serving with armed forces of the United Nations. The dispensation of making a &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; will was granted to soldiers and sailors, so far as personal property was concerned, by the Statute of Frauds, 1695, and was copied from Roman law.</P>
    <P>Julius Caesar is said to have given the privilege to his legionaries in the field.  The reason was, no doubt, that a soldier on active military service was likely to be in danger of death and without sufficient time to make a formal will.  Be that as it may, continuance of the privilege will no longer be justified in view of the new rules of succession proposed in Part VI. These rules are fair and reasonable. There should no longer be any reason why a person should have a horror of intestacy, as the Romans had, or why he should be encouraged to make <Col N="335" /> a hasty will.  A will made informally and without sufficient consideration of the various contingencies may produce unfortunate, and even tragic, results. Furthermore, the interpretation in England of the existing law about &ldquo;privilged&rdquo; wills has been a source of considerable difficulty and has resulted in curious and anomalous decisions.  The privilege extends to a member of an army of occupation in a foreign country, even though fighting had ended many years earlier, but not to a wounded soldier in a hospital in his own country: and it extends to a typist employed on an ocean liner as well as to a seaman attached to a ship which is permanently stationed in harbour.</P>
    <P>Part VIII of the Bill will amend the present rules of international private law in this country relating to the formal validity of wills.  The purpose of the proposed changes in the law is to enable this country to adhere to the Convention on the Conflicts of Laws relating to the form of Testamentary Dispositions drawn up at the Hague in October, 1961, under the auspices of the Hague Conference on International Private Law.  It is provided in Part VIII that a will shall be valid as regards form if the form complies with the internal law, either of the place where the testator made it, or of a nationality possessed by the testator, or of a place in which the testator had his domicile or habitual residence, or, in so far as immovable property is concerned, of the place where the property is situated.  The existing law in this country is rather doubtful, as the Wills Act of 1861, known as Lord Kingsdown's Act, is considered to be of imperfect application, if it applies at all.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the provisions of Parts IX and X of the Bill.  These Parts contain the provisions that are designed to protect the spouse and children of a testator from disinheritance.</P>
    <P>Freedom of testation has come to be regarded by some people as a fundamental and inviolable right inherent in property.  In fact, there is no real moral or historical basis for this view.  On the <Col N="336" /> contrary, the protection and preservation of the family as a continuing institution demands that the right to dispose of property by will should be subordinated to the just claims of the testator's spouse and children.  In a country such as ours which recognises the very special position of the family as a moral institution forming the necessary basis of social order, freedom to disinherit one's wife and children is a paradox which cannot be defended on any ground.</P>
    <P>The will as we know it is an invention of Roman law.  Under the Roman system, however, freedom of testation was considerably restricted by the rules as to <i>legitima portio,</i> or the legal portion, which could be claimed by a disinherited spouse or child.  Complete freedom of testation is a peculiarly English idea which, apart from England and Wales, is only to be found in countries forcibly brought under British rule.  I should like to quote for you in this regard a passage from a recent book&mdash;&ldquo;British Justice: The Scottish Contribution&rdquo;&mdash;by Professor T.B. Smith of Edinburgh University.  He says, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Whenever British rule has been extended to a territory with an established legal system, that system has been maintained, with certain modifications to eliminate doctrines shocking to English ways of thought. Thus subject peoples have been liberated from such practices as the burning of widows, and in other jurisdictions from the necessity of providing for them.  The concept of freedom of testation was spread with missionary zeal.  A man must be left free to cut off wife and children with or without a shilling, and to benefit in lieu the local Hunt or the fair but frail comforter of his declining years. Thus it was that in Ceylon, Quebec and South Africa the established rules which secured to close relatives legal rights in the estate of a deceased were abolished.</P>
    <P>In England freedom of testation was introduced only very gradually and did not eventually find a place in the law until the seventeenth century.  In so far as real property is concerned, rights to curtesy and dower continued to exist <Col N="337" /> in England until 1925, and it is only since 1833 that a right to dower could be barred in a will and only since 1882 that a right to curtesy could be similarly barred.  It was necessary in 1692 to pass a special Act of Parliament enabling the inhabitants of the province of York, other than freemen, and in 1696 another Act enabling the inhabitants of Wales, to dispose of their personalty freely by will, notwithstanding the then existing claims of a spouse and children to their legal shares.  This freedom was extended in 1703 to the freemen of York, but it was not until 1724 that freedom of testation was given to the citizens of London.  In Scotland, freedom of testation in unknown, and the Scottish system of legal rights has been maintained under the Succession (Scotland) Act, 1964, which has just been enacted by the British Parliament.</P>
    <P>Old Irish law knew nothing of freedom of testation.  The will was introduced by the Church, but only in order to allow a person to bequeath portion of his property&mdash;the &ldquo;dead's part&rdquo;&mdash; for ecclesiastical or charitable purposes. The present Irish law of succession in respect of personal property dates only from 1695, when the Irish Statute of Distribution was enacted.  Section 10 of that Statute is of considerable historical interest inasmuch as it provided for the abolition of the &ldquo;Custom of Ireland by which only one third, or a moiety, of the personal estate of a deceased person is subject to the party's disposition by will&rdquo;.  The Custom is described at some length in the section. If a man died leaving a wife and children, his estate was divided into three equal parts where of one part belonged to the wife and another to the children. The remaining third was disposable by will.  If the deceased left a wife only, or children only, his estate was divided into two parts whereof one part belonged to the wife or to the children, as the case might be.  This excellent Custom of Ireland was abolished four years after the Treaty of Limerick and at the outset of the Penal Laws.</P>
    <P>The sanctity of inheritance as the great safeguard to family security is a theme which runs continually through the history of property.  Laws <Col N="338" /> of succession everywhere are but an attempt to express the family in terms of property.  It is recorded in the Old Testament, in the Book of Numbers, that the Daughters of Salphaad came to Moses and claimed a right of succession to their father, who had left no son.  They pleaded so movingly that Moses brought their cause before the Lord and judgment in their favour was pronounced as follows: &ldquo;The Daughters of Salphaad demand a just thing; give them a possession among their father's kindred, and let them succeed him in his inheritance.&rdquo;  In Germany, before the Christian era, there was an established custom whereby the movable property of a deceased person was divided into three parts, one of which was given to his wife, another to his children and the third burned or entombed with the corpse.  After the rise of Christianity, this share was devoted to pious uses for the salvation of the soul of the deceased&mdash;at first as a matter of course and later by testamentary disposition. This system of thirds once applied generally throughout England, where it may have been introduced under Norman influence after the Conquest. As we have seen, the system also prevailed in this country until it was abolished in 1695 by the Statute of Distribution.  The system still survives in Scotland.</P>
    <P>Deputies may well say: &ldquo;This historical material is all very well, but is there any real demand today for what is proposed in Part IX of the Bill?&rdquo; The answer is that there quite definitely is such a demand.  I am aware of this from the many letters that are received in my Department from widows who have been disinherited or insufficiently provided for by their husbands, and from children who have been similarly treated by their parents.  I should point also to the widespread welcome which was forthcoming in the Press and elsewhere when the Government's intention of introducing legislation to deal with the matter was first announced.  Then there is the resolution which was unanimously adopted by this House on the 6th November, 1963, calling for the introduction of legislation to <Col N="339" /> prevent a person from disposing of his property by will without making adequate provision for a dependent wife or child.  I want to emphasise, however, that even if there were no positive demand for legislation of this kind, I would still regard it as incumbent on the Government to have the existing law altered.</P>
    <P>Article 41 of the Constitution recognises the family &ldquo;as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.&rdquo;  The Article pledges the State to &ldquo;protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.&rdquo; Under the same Article, the State recognises that, by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved; and the State undertakes to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.  These principles cannot be reconciled with a system of law which allows a man to ignore the mother of his family and to leave his property to strangers.  And it is no answer to say that most people do, in fact, provide for their wives and children in their wills, when, as we know, there are those who do not.  One might as well contend that there should be no law to prevent unusual crime because people do not commit such crime except very occasionally.  There are, unfortunately, some who argue that each of us has a right to do what he likes with his own property, forgetting that property has its duties no less than its rights.</P>
    <P>The Federal German Constitution contains similar provisions to those in our Constitution in regard to the protection of marriage and the family. The great German and international authority on the laws of succession throughout the world is Professor Murad Ferid of the University of Munich.  He points out in the leading commentary on the German Civil Code that, if German law did not already provide for legal portions for the <Col N="340" /> immediate relatives of a deceased person, it would, by reason of the family provisions in the Constitution, be the duty of the State to amend the law.</P>
    <P>When the present Bill was being prepared, the question naturally arose as to which system of legal rights ought to be adopted for this country.  Before a decision was reached, a careful study was made of the systems in force in other countries.  Some systems, such as those of Scotland, France, Spain, Switzerland and Brazil, exclude from testamentary disposition a fixed portion of a deceased person's estate, that is to say, they reserve a share of the inheritance for certain classes of beneficiaries. Other systems, such as those of Germany and the States of New York and Louisiana, do not provide for any reserve share, but on the precedent of Roman law, allow a claimant to apply for a definite part of the inheritance if he chooses to do so.  These two types of systems are generally described as systems of the <i>legitima portio,</i> since the share which the beneficiary may take is fixed by law.  A third approach to the problem is to give certain dependants the right to apply to the court if they wish to do so and to empower the court to award maintenance at its discretion.  This system originated in New Zealand in 1908 and is the system now in operation in Northern Ireland, England and in eight of the Canadian Provinces.</P>
    <P>The system of legal rights operating in Scotland affords a good example of the <i>legitima portio</i> method.  The Scottish system of legal rights is basically the system of thirds to which I have already referred.  If a man leaves both wife and children, his movable estate is divided into three parts.  His wife is entitled to one part as her <i>jus relictae</i> (the wife's part), and his children to one part as their <i>legitim</i> (the bairns' part).  The remaining third (the dead's part) may be disposed of by the testator in his will.  If he leaves only a wife or only a child or children, the reserve share is one half of the movable property.  There is a system of hotch-pot between the children (<i>collatio inter liberos</i>) to ensure equality between them.  Posthumous <Col N="341" /> children may take, but illegitimate children are excluded.</P>
    <P>Officers of my Department visited Scotland some time ago for consultations with Scottish experts on the law of succession and to study the legal rights system at first hand.  They found that the system operates remarkably well and that the need to enforce legal rights seldom arises, precisely because the existence of the rights ensures justice for spouses and children.  The operation of the system was examined some years ago by a Committee of Experts headed by Lord Mackintosh and appointed for the purpose by the Secretary of State for Scotland.  On the basis of the recommendations made by that Committee it was decided to retain the system, subject to certain modifications which did not, however, affect the general principles on which the system is based.  The modifications were introduced in a new Succession Act which was enacted earlier this year.  When the Bill for this Act was before Parliament, strenuous efforts were made by Scottish interests to have legal rights extended to the whole of a deceased person's estate, but this proposal was rejected in Westminster.</P>
    <P>In France, the method of protecting the members of the family is to withdraw from the deceased's testamentary power a fixed portion of the succession, the size of which varies according to the number and relationship of the claimants.  This portion is known as the hereditary reserve and it is set aside for kinship relatives within certain degrees.  The remaining part of the estate, known as the disposable share, can be disposed of by the testator in his will.  Except where there are no claims at all, the reserve share is always at least a quarter and at the most it may be three-quarters of the estate.  Accordingly, if a testator attempts to bequeath away the whole of his property, the disposition is ineffective. The French system provides a remarkable example of the recognition of family ties, and it is not without significance that these ties are very strong in France.</P>
    <P>The aims of the English law of family provision are strictly limited <Col N="342" /> and its basis is very different from a <i>legitima portio</i> system.  Firstly, it does not create any reserve in the succession or seek to limit the testamentary power of the testator in any way: it merely gives to certain dependants the right to apply to the court if they wish to do so.  Secondly the law does not impose on the testator the duty to provide for any particular person in his will nor does it give to any member of the deceased's family a definite right of inheritance.  The persons who may apply to the court are a wife or husband, an unmarried daughter, an is, by reason of some mental or physical disability, incapable of maintaining him or herself.  The power given to the court is a discretionary one, and it is only if the court has found that reasonable provision has not been made for the applicant that any possibility of a successful claim will arise. Thirdly, the share to be taken by the applicant is not fixed beforehand by the law.  The court has a discretion as to the amount it will award&mdash;and even as to whether it will make any award at all.  Finally, the Act does not seek to relate the claims to any right on intestacy by distributing the capital of the estate.  In most cases it is the income that is appropriated, and then only for so long as the applicant's need of it continues.</P>
    <P>It might be thought that a system on the English or New Zealand model, being less rigid in conception than the Scottish or Civil Law systems, would be more satisfactory in operation.  In fact the reverse is the case.  To start with, no system can be satisfactory which obliges the members of a testator's family to go to court to obtain what should be theirs as of right.  It is generally agreed that the extent to which any law gives rise to litigation is a measure of the failure of that law.  The bringing of legal proceedings is an expensive process and in this connection it must be borne in mind that in this country approximately three-quarters of all estates are genuinely small ones&mdash;that is to say under £2,000 in gross value&mdash;which can ill afford to bear legal costs.</P>
    <P>Another important consideration is <Col N="343" /> that recourse to the courts can be a forbidding, and even a frightening, prospect for many people.  Furthermore, in those countries which operate a system of family provision on the lines of that in England, experience shows that different judges tend to take different views of what constitutes a just and reasonable provision for a member of a testator's family.  This has given rise to anomalous decisions which have tended to lessen the effectiveness of the statutory provisions and to nullify the intentions of the legislature. The New Zealand, English and Canadian statutes have necessitated a considerable amount of legal decisions as to the correct interpretation of what to the layman appear to be simple expressions.  Indeed, the British Privy Council has on certain occasions been called on to decide cases arising under the New Zealand legislation.  But perhaps the most serious objection of all is that recourse to the courts has involved in those countries the raking-up of all sorts of embarrassing family circumstances, including acts of unkindness and unfaithfulness and past squabbles, which are better not resurrected. For this reason alone, I feel that legislation on these lines would be positively anti-social in its effect in this country.  It is the unanimous opinion of leading authorities&mdash;including, I may say, prominent English lawyers&mdash;who have studied the matter that systems of family provision which are based on the exercise of judicial discretion are unsatisfactory and are least capable of achieving the protection of the family which should be the common aim of all civilised communities.  It is simply untrue to say, as some critics of the present Bill have said, that the English Inheritance (Family Provision) Act, 1938, provides a satisfactory system. A. G. Guest has the following to say in a learned article in the January, 1957, issue of <i>The Law Quarterly Review:</i></P>
    <P>Family obligations do not function only when a wife is in need, nor do they necessarily cease when a child grows up or marries.  The ties of family duty are not so easily severed. A system which distributes a fixed share of the estate regardless of need <Col N="344" /> more effectively recognises the true nature of the duties which arise.  As it is, the caprice of old age or a petty family quarrel will often result in a breach of this duty where the applicant is not under one of the disabilities mentioned in the Act.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this comment speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>Having carefully considered the various methods of family provision operating in other legal systems, the Government came to the conclusion that the <i>legitima portio</i> method as exemplified in Scottish law achieves the most satisfactory compromise between individual and family rights and best accords with Constitutional safeguards for, and present social attitudes towards, family and property responsibilities in this country.  Amongst the main advantages of such a system are that it is simple, cheap and effective in its operation.  Above all, it avoids the expense and heartbreak of applications to the courts involving the resurrection of old family dissensions long since forgotten.  Accordingly, Part IX of the Bill provides for the adoption of a system of reserve family shares, based generally on the system for movable property operating in Scotland, but extended in scope so as to be applicable to the entire estate of a deceased person.</P>
    <P>In determining the size of the reserve shares it has been necessary to give careful consideration to the arrangements for distribution on intestacy.  In this country approximately one person in every two with property to leave makes a will.  It is essential, therefore, that the reserve shares granted to the members of a person's family, where there is a will, should be related to the shares to which the members of the family would be entitled on intestacy, This is the principle followed in other countries that have adopted <i>legitima portio</i> systems.  In Canada, certain of the States which have a family maintenance system have also adopted an alternative system of fixed shares related to intestate shares.</P>
    <P>Part IX of the Bill in its present form provides that the surviving spouse and issue of a person dying fully or <Col N="345" /> partially testate will have legal rights to two-thirds of the deceased's estate, being one-third for the spouse and one third for the issue.  Where the deceased is survived by his spouse only, or by issue only, the survivor or survivors are given legal rights to one-half of the estate.</P>
    <P>These particular provisions have attracted a good deal of public comment and criticism.  While there is general acceptance of the need to restrict a testator's freedom to disinherit his spouse and children, the view has been widely expressed that the proposed provisions would impose unduly rigid limitations on the discretion which every testator should have to divide his estate amongst the various members of his family in the manner best suited to the particular needs and circumstances of the case.  It has been argued that a married man should not be compelled to leave anything to his children where, in fact, he wants to leave all his property to his wife; that he should not be compelled to leave anything to adult children who are no longer dependent on him; that he should be allowed to choose between his children, having regard to the position in life of each child; that he should have no obligation to grandchildren or remoter issue; and that, where he is the owner of a farm or family business, he should be free to leave the farm or business to one member of his family unencumbered by charges in favour of the other members.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset, I have obtained the approval of the Government for the preparation of a number of amendments to meet these objections and arguments. I propose to introduce these amendments on Committee Stage.  With the object of ensuring that members of the public will be fully aware of the Government's intentions in regard to the Bill, I indicated publicly the general nature of these amendments and I invited further comment on the Bill in the light of the changes that are proposed.  An outline of the proposed amendments will be found in the supplementary <Col N="346" /> explanatory memorandum circulated to Deputies at the end of last week.</P>
    <P>Firstly, I propose that absolute entitlement to legal rights should be confined to a spouse and dependent children.  The effect of this will be that children who are settled in the world and able to provide for themselves will have no claim on the testator's estate as legal rights, except where the testator leaves less than what I am going to call the &ldquo;non-disposable part&rdquo; of his estate within his family. This non-disposable part will be two-thirds of the estate where the family consists of a spouse and children, and one-half of the estate where the family consists of a spouse and no children or children and no spouse.  The family will have a right to the non-disposable part of the property, but the testator will have greater freedom in the disposition of this part between the different members of the family.  Subject to the entitlement of the spouse and dependent children to their legal right shares, the testator will be free to allocate the balance of the non-disposable part of his estate any way he wishes within his family.  In addition, he will have no legal obligations towards grandchildren or remoter issue.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I propose that section 111 of the Bill be amended to provide that where a testator leaves two-thirds or more of his property to his spouse, dependent children who are also children of that spouse will not be entitled to legal right shares.  Dependent children who are not children of the surviving spouse will continue to be entitled to these shares.  The effect of this amendment will be to allow a testator to leave all or the bulk of his property to his wife, trusting her to look after the children and to make the best possible provision for them.  An exception is being made for stepchildren. For one thing, the cruel stepmother is proverbial.  Moreover, stepchildren have no rights of succession to their stepmother's estate.  And, if the stepmother re-marries, she is less likely to protect her stepchildren than she is to protect her own children.</P>
    <P>Consequential on the proposal to <Col N="347" /> confine absolute entitlement to legal right shares to dependent children, I propose to provide that where a testator leaves such children, the legal right share of each child will be a proportionate part of one-third or one-half of the estate, depending on whether there is or is not also a surviving spouse.  For the purpose of calculating the share, all the surviving children of the testator will be deemed to be dependent.  This means that, if, for example, the testator leaves a spouse, two dependent children and two non-dependent children, the legal right share of each dependent child will be one-quarter of one-third, that is to say, one-twelfth of the estate.</P>
    <P>Where a testator completely disinherits his wife and children, she and each of the children, whether dependent or non-dependent, will be entitled to legal right shares.  It is up to the testator to distribute the non-disposable part of his estate amongst his wife and children.  Under the amendments he will be able to leave his property to his wife, or to his wife and dependent children, or to his wife and all his children.  However, the wife and dependent children are being given an absolute entitlement to legal right shares.  The amendments will be so drafted as to ensure that a child, whether dependent or non-dependent, will not be entitled to claim against any bequest made to his mother under the will.  Where a testator leaves non-dependent children and no spouse, these children will be entitled to one-half of his estate but he may bequeath this half or all of the estate to any one or more of them as he thinks fit.</P>
    <P>Section 117 of the Bill was designed to prevent a person from disposing of property during his lifetime so as deliberately to defeat or substantially diminish the legal rights of a spouse or child.  This section is one of the key section in this Part of the Bill and is essential if people are to be effectively prevented from disinheriting members of their family.  I may add that similar provisions to those contained in the section are to be found in the systems of other countries.  At the same time, having examined all <Col N="348" /> the comments and criticisms concerning the section, I am satisfied that it is unduly rigid as it now stands.  I am, therefore, proposing that the section be amended by reducing the ten year period to three years and by excluding from its operation (1) premiums paid under an insurance policy for the benefit of a spouse or child of the testator; (2) an assignment of pension rights in favour of the testator's spouse; and (3) a family settlement made for the benefit of a spouse, or for the benefit of a spouse and children, or for the benefit of children, of the testator.  Where the spouse is alive, the consent of the spouse will be necessary.</P>
    <P>The ten year period at present specified in the section has been criticised as two long and likely to give rise to complications.  I suggest that three years is a reasonable period.  It is incidentally, the period for estate duty purposes at the present time.  Moneys payable under an insurance policy for the benefit of a spouse or child do not form part of a deceased's estate, and it is only right that the premiums should be clearly exempted from section 117. Assignment of pension rights ought to be treated on the same basis.  I propose to exclude family settlements in order to facilitate the practice of keeping a family business or farm in the hands of one member of the family and also in order to encourage an ageing farmer or businessman to hand over his farm or business to one of his children.  The stipulation that the spouse, if alive, must consent to the settlement will provide a valuable safeguard against injustices being done to her or to any of the children.</P>
    <P>The broad effect of the proposed amendments which I have outlined will be to give a testator much greater freedom in the disposition of his property within his family, while at the same time preserving valuable safeguards against the disinheritance of a spouse or dependent child.  In all the public comment that has been made on the Bill, there has been virtual unanimity that a married man with children should be able to leave all his property to his wife, trusting her to make the best possible provision for the children. His right to do this will be ensured by <Col N="349" /> the amendments.  I believe that, when the Bill is amended in the manner which I have outlined, it will meet with ready acceptance from a majority of the community.  We are all agreed that there is a need to deal with the social problem of disinheritance: the only difference of opinion lies in the method of achieving this objective.</P>
    <P>Taken together, the proposals in the Bill as to intestacy and legal rights involve, in effect, the introduction in this country of a matrimonial regime under which property on marriage will, in the ultimate result, become the property of the husband and wife, and of the children until they reach the stage of being non-dependent.  I envisage that the position will be somewhat the same as in France where husband and wife, in the absence of a pre-marriage contract, own their property in common. The pre-marriage contract is now very rare in France.  French matrimonial property is divided on death between the estate of the deceased and that of the surviving spouse, and the children are entitled to a reserve share out of the estate of the deceased parent.  In other legal systems that do not have community of property as between husband and wife, there is a growing tendency to accept the principle that the surviving spouse has a greater claim on the estate of a deceased person than the lineal or collateral kin.  It will be agreed that this principle accurately reflects the true nature and importance of marriage and of the status which marriage confers on both partners.</P>
    <P>Before leaving Part IX, I should like to refer to sections 113 and 115.  Section 113 allows a spouse to renounce in writing her legal right share either in an ante-nuptial contract or at any time during the marriage.  A child who has reached the age of 21 years may also renounce in writing his legal right share.  I do not anticipate that this section will be used much in practice. Nevertheless, it is a valuable section.</P>
    <P>Section 115 provides for the right of election.  A spouse or child will be able to elect between a bequest in the will and the legal right share.  In default of election, he or she will take under the <Col N="350" /> will.  I propose to amend the section to allow a spouse or child to accept a bequest in partial satisfaction of a legal right share.</P>
    <P>A major problem in dealing with the law of succession arises on the question of unworthiness to succeed.  This is the subject of Part X of the Bill.  If a spouse or child is to be given a reserve share, the testator must not be allowed to withdraw that share.  The spouse or child should have an absolute entitlement to the share and should only be deprived of it on the same grounds as would justify deprival of an ordinary intestate share.  Having carefully studied the provisions in other legal systems, we have come to the conclusion that there should be three grounds of worthiness to succeed.  These are the grounds which are provided for in subsections (1), (2) and (3) of section 119. Firstly, a person who has been guilty of the manslaughter or murder, or attempted manslaughter or murder, of the deceased will be excluded from any share whatever in the estate, whether under a will, on intestacy or by way of legal rights.  This follows the existing law and is based on grounds of public policy.  Secondly, a guilty spouse in divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> proceedings, or a spouse who has failed to comply with a decree of restitution of conjugal rights, will be excluded from any share as a legal right or on intestacy.  I am at present considering enlargement of this ground so as to cover desertion by a spouse for two years or more. Thirdly, a person who has been found guilty of a serious criminal offence&mdash; meriting two years' imprisonment or penal servitude&mdash;against the deceased, or a member of his or her family, will be excluded from any share as a legal right or on intestacy.  It is to be noted that in the case of the second and third grounds which I have mentioned, the person concerned is not excluded from a share under a will.  This is because a man may wish to forgive the acts concerned and, if he does, there is no reason why he should not be allowed to make provision for the offender in his will.</P>
    <P>Subsections (4) and (5) of section 119, which provide for disinheritance <Col N="351" /> by a testator of a spouse or child who is guilty of dissolute or dishonourable conduct or of one of his children who is better off than the other children, have been criticised on the basis that they will inevitably lead to litigation involving the disclosure in court of embarrassing family circumstances.  It is claimed that, in addition, they would be difficult of interpretation and proof. I think this criticism is valid and, in deference to the views expressed, I am proposing that the subsections be deleted.</P>
    <P>Part XI of the Bill provides for miscellaneous amendments of the law dealing with limitation of actions in respect of the estates of deceased persons.  Section 122 proposes that, where two or more persons beneficially entitled to a share or interest in land enter on the land, they will, for the purpose of acquiring title by possession, enter as joint tenants, not only as against excluded persons but also as between themselves.  Under existing law it would appear that next-of-kin who acquire title by possession do so as tenants in common in respect of their own shares and as joint tenants in respect of the shares of excluded next-of-kin.  Under section 123, the general limitation period for claims to the estate of a deceased person or to any share or interest in the estate is being reduced from 12 years to six years.</P>
    <P>The provisions contained in Part XI of the Bill have been inserted in an effort to meet conditions peculiar to rural Ireland.  They are framed to cure difficulties that arise in regard to the title to land where, for example, some members of the family remain at home on the farm, while others leave to take up professions or to work in towns and cities at home or abroad. Coupled with the proposals as to advancement in section 63, the provisions contained in Part XI should ensure that the proposed rules as to intestate succession and legal rights will not prove incompatible with the achievement of the unity and security of land ownership which is necessary to farming progress and efficiency in the circumstances of this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> Part XII of the Bill provides for the consolidation of miscellaneous existing statutory provisions relating to the Probate Office and the district probate registries.  These provisions do not I think call for any special comment on this Stage.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the main features of a Bill which, as the House will appreciate, encompasses a vast and complicated area of private law.  It has not been an easy Bill to explain, and I am grateful to Deputies for the patience with which they have listened to my attempts to deal with the more important of its provisions.  I need hardly say that a great deal of time and effort has gone into the formulation of the proposals that are contained in the Bill.  We have examined in detail the laws of succession at present obtaining in the North, in England, Scotland, France, Germany, Switzerland, the United States and Canada. We have considered the relevant provisions of the French, German and Swiss civil codes, and some of the world's recognised experts in this field of law have been consulted personally. We are particularly indebted to Dr. Cohn of London and Frankfurt, Dr. Ferid and Judge Firsching of Munich, Professor Halliday and Dr. Meston of Glasgow, Professor MacRitchie and Dr. Willock of Aberdeen and Professor Smith of Edinburgh.  All were unstinting in their help and advice, and I am extremely grateful to each and every one of them.</P>
    <P>Where it has been thought appropriate to do so, provisions contained in the laws of other countries have been adapted and included in the Bill.  It would, of course, be a serious mistake to import ideas from abroad into our legal system simply because these ideas have worked satisfactorily in other countries.  Quite obviously the laws of any community should be based on activities within that particular community and should reflect the social and ethical principles of its people.  I must emphasise, therefore, that in drafting the Succession Bill the underlying aim has been to devise a system of succession which will be suitable to Irish needs and compatible with the traditions, beliefs and values of our people. <Col N="353" /> As I stressed at the outset, the Bill is one of vital interest to every member of the community.  Every section &mdash;indeed practically every line&mdash;of the Bill is important and, consequently, as the Bill progresses through the House, I shall be more than happy to have any suggestions which Deputies may care to make for its improvement.  I can assure the House that I will consider all such suggestions very carefully. Of its very nature this measure is one which is more suitable for discussion on Committee Stage, and, on that Stage, I shall, of course, endeavour to furnish any additional assistance which the House may need in dealing in detail with the various provisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in the form in which I propose to have it amended, should bring our law of succession more into conformity with the needs of present-day society.  I ask the House to give it a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment standing in my name:</P>
      <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;while Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the law should require that adequate provision should be made by testators for dependent spouse and children, the Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill unless Part IX, and the provisions consequential thereon, are deleted because of their utter unsuitability to Irish conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say that I should like to have been in a position not only to congratulate the Minister on his appointment as Minister but also to congratulate him on his first major undertaking as a Minister in this House on the introduction of a Succession Bill.  I am sorry I cannot do the latter but I have great pleasure in doing the former.  I cannot congratulate the Minister in connection with this Bill because I believe the House and the country have been treated in a disgracefully cavalier fashion, perhaps not by the Minister, but by the Government, in relation to this Bill.  Deputies find themselves to-day <Col N="354" /> faced with the fantastic position that we are now being asked, on the Second Stage, to approve in principle a Bill which the Minister, in effect, has told us is not the Bill which it is intended to enact.</P>
    <P>The Minister, even before he came into the House, had announced his intention of moving several amendments on Committee Stage but he did not even then give the complete picture and today we have had two or three further amendments mentioned by the Minister in the course of his speech. The method adopted by the Government in dealing with this Bill is a complete travesty of procedure.  Instead of the ordinary Parliamentary procedure, the House is, in fact, being asked to participate in a grotesque face-saving operation for the former Minister for Justice.  In inviting the House to participate in that face-saving operation, the present Minister is making a mockery of all our Parliamentary procedures.</P>
    <P>The speech which the Minister has just made is a far greater justification than I myself could make of the amendment standing in my name.  It vindicates fully the judgement of the Fine Gael Party in putting down this Second Reading amendment to the Bill as originally drafted, circulated and published by the Government. All of us will remember, and the Minister referred to it himself in the course of his statement today, how this Bill was ushered in with a fanfare of trumpets at a press conference in July last.  Within five months after that, a new Minister for Justice having been appointed, the Bill as originally drafted and published by the Government has been gutted and it was solemnly buried by the present Minister at another press conference.</P>
    <P>I suppose the appropriate music for the second fanfare would have been the Funeral March.  Perhaps there is some significance in the fact that the Minister chose Friday, 13th November, as the date to give his press conference. The decent and dignified thing for the Minister and the Government in connection with this Bill would have been to accept the Second Reading <Col N="355" /> amendment put forward by us, to withdraw the Bill, to scrap it completely, and come back to the House with a new Bill, with fresh proposals.</P>
    <P>While the present Minister as a practical lawyer certainly shows a much more commonsense approach to this problem than the rather more fanciful theorising of his predecessor, nevertheless he should not lend himself to this kind of nauseating face-saving operation being performed in connection with this Bill.  If the Minister wants a proper Bill, he should scrap this one.  He should start afresh with a new Bill; otherwise he is building on rotten foundations.  He is trying to patch something that does not take patching properly.  The result from the Minister's point of view is that, instead of bringing in a Bill which will stand up over the years, which will be of benefit to the people of this country, he is going to have his name associated with a Bill built on rotten foundations which, ultimately, is not going to stand up.</P>
    <P>I propose to examine the foundations on which the Minister is building.  In other words, I propose to consider the Bill which is before the House and, notwithstanding our knowledge that the Minister does not intend standing over that Bill, it is necessary to ask the House to examine what is there and on what the Minister is building.  The present Bill is one which the former Minister &mdash; on re-reading the Dáil Debates, I do not know whether he was joking or serious&mdash;told the House when he brought it in contained proposals, that, by their excellence, would be such that the majority of Deputies would be forced to accept them.  The actual phrase he used was:</P>
    <P>they will, by their excellence, have the undoubted approval of most Deputies.</P>
    <P>In his press conference when he announced the terms of this Bill in July last, the Minister's predecessor painted a picture of himself and his officials spending long hours searching out the succession laws in all the countries of Europe.  He said they had examined the succession laws of every country <Col N="356" /> they possibly could.  I have no doubt they did.  I give them credit for any research work of that sort.  But, having done that, they had come to the conclusion that the proposals put in this Bill were, apparently, the best that could be got.</P>
    <P>The present Minister and the Government in their headlong flight from the controversy aroused by the original proposals are now adopting the attitude of saying they really did not mean it, that the original Bill was only a proposal put up for discussion. That kind of talk is utter nonsense.  If either the present Minister or his predecessor had more experience of parliamentary procedure, they would know what most Deputies know: if the Government want to put up proposals for examination by Deputies and to ascertain the views of the people, the proper way to do it is by publication of a White Paper and not by putting it solemnly in the form of a Bill which is presented to the people as the Government's proposals.</P>
    <P>Instead of doing that, instead of publishing a White Paper containing the Government's proposals, or even their provisional proposals, in order to have those proposals examined by bodies such as the Incorporated Law Society, the Bar Council and the general body of people interested in this vital question&mdash;it is a vital question and the Minister is quite right in emphasising the importance of legislation of this type as affecting the fundamental rights of every individual&mdash;the former Minister rushed into his press conference with his proposals.  He did that, I assert here&mdash;and I would like to be corrected by the present Minister if I am wrong&mdash;without any adequate consultation, for example, with the Incorporated Law Society.  It is the governing body of the solicitors' profession and, whether the former Minister likes it or not, those are the people who have most to do with the question of wills, advising people with regard to the making of their wills and advising with regard to their rights arising from that.  There was no proper consultation at all by the Government with the Incorporated Law Society before their <Col N="357" /> previous proposals were formulated and published.</P>
    <P>I understand that the present Minister has at least paid that body the courtesy not only of accepting their views in writing and considering them but of meeting them and discussing their views with them.  That is a change for the better so far as the administration of the Minister's Department is concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to look for a few moments at the short, miserable life history of the first proposals which were published in connection with this matter.  I have referred already to the statement of the Minister's predecessor regarding the excellence of the proposals he intended bringing in.  I refer now to the Official Report of 6th November, 1963, where, at column 1031, the present Minister for Agriculture, who was then Minister for Justice said:</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the proposals in the Bill which I shall bring before the House will be those best adapted to our Irish circumstances.  It is certainly my aim&mdash;and I hope I shall succeed&mdash;to recommend a law of succession that will be among the most enlightened in the world.  I feel it would not be altogether appropriate for me at this stage to give an indication in advance of how exactly we propose to deal with this problem of inofficious wills, but I feel sure that, when the proposals come here, they will, by their excellence, have the undoubted approval of most Deputies.</P>
    <P>Having given that kind of advance &ldquo;blurb&rdquo; to the publication he was about to bring out, the former Minister then went to his press conference in July, 1964.  He referred, quite rightly, to the importance of the proposals.  I want to emphasise that, because these, or any other proposals such as these which deal with a person's fundamental rights to own property, to deal with property and to dispose of property, are of vital importance to the people. At this press conference, the former Minister said:</P>
    <P>We have studied every system we know of in the world and this represents <Col N="358" /> the Government's proposals to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>That is reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 11th July last.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the proposals contained in the Bill which we are now considering, various bodies found it necessary to examine the proposals carefully&mdash;the various legal bodies throughout the country, the National Farmers Association, organisations of one sort or another as well as private individuals&mdash;and it became quite clear that the proposals which the Government thought so excellent that they would command the approval of the majority of Deputies did not recommend themselves to the majority of the people in this country.</P>
    <P>We in the Fine Gael Party gave the Bill the type of examination which any Bill of this sort warrants.  We studied it carefully.  We considered the implications of the proposals, the effects which, in our view, they would have on the people.  As a result of our consideration and deliberation, we put down the amendment which I am now moving. During all of the period when that amendment was on the Order Paper of the Dáil, when there was what virtually amounted to a public outcry against the Government's proposals, the Government and every member of the Government stayed mum; not a word was uttered in public.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to give the present Minister for Justice credit for fighting tooth and nail against the proposals as they originally stood behind the doors of the Fianna Fáil Party room.  He was probably not alone in that.  I hope I am not giving him undue credit but I believe that the proposals as originally framed never recommended themselves to him as a practical lawyer, as a man who had experience in the courts of this country, as a man who by reason of his profession and avocation was called on&mdash;I was going to say from time to time&mdash;I hope very frequently, to advise on questions such as this.  I think that many of his colleagues were in the same position.  But he was not in control then.  The present Minister for <Col N="359" /> Agriculture was still Minister for Justice and there was no let up, no suggestion of a let up, at all from Government sources.</P>
    <P>Then, the resignation of the former Minister for Agriculture came about. I wonder does Deputy Smith even now realise the extent to which he has saved the people of this country from the proposals that were originally made and that are in fact enshrined in the Bill which we are discussing and from which the Government have decided now to depart.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;certainly had an effect.  It was not until 9th October, 1964, reported in the newspapers of 10th October, that there was any further reference, that I know of in any event, publicly, by Government speakers to the Succession Bill.  The former Minister for Justice, Deputy Haughey, having become Minister for Agriculture, went along to the Dublin North-East Comhairle Dáil Ceanntar of Fianna Fáil and spoke there about the Bill.  Apparently, he wanted to set up the succession and to see to it that his successor as Minister for Justice was not going to let him down regarding the Succession Bill because, when the former Minister for Justice spoke to this august body of Fianna Fáil supporters in Dublin North-East, there was no suggestion, as recently as 10th October last, of any amendment of the Succession Bill.  It was suggested, true enough, that the Government would not now insist on the Bill coming into operation on 1st January, 1965, but there did not seem to be any other concession in the mind of the former Minister for Justice.  He did, of course, have quite a lot to say with regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> There is one thing he said that I want to direct the present Minister's attention to, in the hope that, before this discussion finishes, he will dissociate himself from it.  The Minister for Agriculture is quoted in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 10th October last as saying:</P>
    <P>The discussion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>This is regarding the discussion that had been taking place on the Succession Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>has on the whole been excellent though the ordinary man may have wondered as he followed the debate why if, as is alleged, the Bill is going to lead to a great deal of litigation so many lawyers have been attacking it.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of unworthy jibe at the legal profession that comes so frequently from Government benches. It was an unworthy jibe to come from a man who up to a few days before that had held the post of Minister for Justice.  I hope the present Minister will dissociate himself completely from it.  He is, as I say, a practical lawyer, a man who has practised in the courts of this country.  Even if the former Minister did not realise it, the present Minister will realise that, by and large, most of the lawyers in this country want to keep their clients out of court rather than bring them into court and that it is no part of lawyers' business to try to push their clients into court and that if they criticise a Bill because it will lead to litigation, they do so in the knowledge that they themselves might be the losers if they can succeed in getting the Bill amended but that their clients will be the gainers.  That should be made clear to the former Minister.</P>
    <P>However, I wanted not so much to underscore what seems to me to be an unwarranted jibe by the former Minister at lawyers in this country but to point out that, as recently as 9th or 10th October last, there was no indication that I could see by the Government that they intended amending the Bill.  Some days later, the <i>Sunday Express</i> of 18th October presented an article.  I want to be quite fair to the <Col N="361" /> former Minister.  I do not know to what extent this article purports to be an interview with the present Minister for Agriculture but it certainly purports to quote him with regard to the Succession Bill and what his hopes were on leaving the Department over which the present Minister now presides. According to this article, the former Minister is quoted, as recently as 18th October, as saying:</P>
    <P>I want to see action taken on the horrible system of ground rents.</P>
    <P>I hope the present Minister will not be as dilatory as his colleagues have been in taking action in that matter. They have been assured in advance of the fullest support from this side of the House for very many years.  However, he went on:</P>
    <P>And I want to see my Succession Bill get through the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>There was no question of any amendment then.</P>
    <P>&mdash;because it lends a new aspect to justice.</P>
    <P>Then the picture was painted of how strongly the former Minister was fighting to get his Bill through the Dáil and the steps he was taking to correct any erroneous impressions or misapprehensions that any ordinary member of the public had with regard to it.</P>
    <P>The article goes on:</P>
    <P>The Succession Bill aims at altering the present law of inheritance.</P>
    <P>That, apparently, is not a report of the Minister's remarks but is part of the article.  Then it says:</P>
    <P>When Haughey heard that the wife of a man he knew&mdash;a housewife, with no political connections&mdash;was opposed to the Bill he rang her up to explain what it was about and advised her to read it in full before condemning it.</P>
    <P>He then said, and this is a quotation:</P>
    <P>It ensures that a woman gets one-third of her husband's estate and that the children get one-third.  This is to ensure that in the case of a second marriage children by the first marriage are not neglected, and <Col N="362" /> anyway the wife becomes the trustee ... this surely is just and right.</P>
    <P>The next comments are not those of the Minister but a quotation from the article:</P>
    <P>And then for one of the rare cases on record, the gay, debonair, astute politician was heard to complain bitterly: &ldquo;Here I am trying to help women just like that, to save them from that pagan principle of `It's my money, I can leave it to whom I like and damn the sufferers... ' and she objects.  It's bad enough having to fight it through against professional opposition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On 18th October, the former Minister for Justice was full of fight.  He wanted to see his Succession Bill getting through the Dáil.  The next thing we heard of it from official sources was a statement released by the Department of Justice less than a fortnight after the quotations I have been giving of the remarks of the Minister for Agriculture.  Less than a fortnight later, it is disclosed in a statement from the Department of Justice published in the daily newspapers on 31st October, 1964, that there are to be wholesale amendments to the Succession Bill.  Deputy Smith had resigned.  I do not know whether it was a coincidence or not but on the same day there appeared the report of conventions for a by-election in East Galway.</P>
    <P>Shortly after that, on Friday, 13th November, the present Minister for Justice gave his press conference in which he decided that the Minister, Deputy Haughey, was not going to get away with it, that no matter how hard he fought, whether or not he wanted to see his Succession Bill going through, the present Minister would not have it and he announced at his press conference that there would be several amendments.  I do not say this as any criticism of the Minister.  I say it because I believe it to be accurate. I think the terms of the statement he made in his press conference and the appendix which he issued at that time are virtually word for word the same as in the second explanatory memorandum <Col N="363" /> issued with this Bill, with one important exception which I do not understand.  At his press conference, the Minister mentioned there was to be an amendment to section 6 of the Bill to increase the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  That was for some reason left completely out of the second explanatory memorandum.  I did not know whether the Government had again changed their mind in the last fortnight until the Minister spoke today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned it today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I find when he speaks to-day he says what was suggested in the press conference statement is, in fact, going to be done, so possibly it was an error and I shall not make any point about it. That is the history of the Bill to date.</P>
      <P>I want to examine now what were the &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; proposals which the previous Minister put up.  It was proposed, and it is to some extent still in Part IX of the Bill, to impose very severe limitations on the right of a person to dispose of his property by will.  It was proposed, and still is, to establish fixed shares for spouse and children.  It was also proposed to class as suspect for at least a period of ten years any voluntary settlements or dispositions made which were intended to defeat the fixed legal shares being proposed in the Part IX of the Bill. The effect, of course, is that a man who left a wife and children could dispose of only a third of his property by will.  The State was to decide, and still is in many cases, what was to happen to two-thirds of the estate.  The testator could dispose only of a third. This is being done now in order to deal with a problem that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to minimise the problem and I certainly think it is entirely wrong to exaggerate it.  The problem is the problem of the undutiful or inofficious will.  In his press conference the former Minister spoke of the problem as though it were a very widespread one.  He is reported as saying that a considerable amount of injustice resulted through the failure of testators to make sufficient provision for their <Col N="364" /> wives and children.  I think that greatly overstates the position here.</P>
    <P>There is a problem and it is a problem that should be dealt with.  It is a problem which we on these benches ask the Government to deal with, but it would be entirely wrong to suggest that the problem is a very widespread one resulting in a considerable amount of injustice.  The proposals of the Government go away beyond the problem that exists.  To my mind the Government have approached this matter in the wrong way entirely. The proper thing for the Government to do was, first of all, to assess the size of the problem and, having assessed it, bring in their proposals to remedy the particular problem.  That is not what the Government have done.  It is not what they chose to do.  They chose instead to bring in a Bill designed not merely to remedy the problem&mdash;that was only incidental as far as the Government proposals were concerned &mdash;but to interfere with everybody in order to remedy a particular situation that exists only so far as a few are concerned.</P>
    <P>We, having considered these proposals, particularly the proposals in relation to Parts IX and X of the Bill, put down the amendment which I have moved asking the Dáil not to give a second reading to this Bill until those Parts and the consequential provisions are deleted.  Now, whether the Minister is prepared to admit it or not, he has accepted the terms of the amendment. He is telling the Dáil, in effect, that he will get away from Parts IX and X, as drafted in the original Bill, and he will modify these proposals to a great extent.  The fundamental mistake the Minister's predecessor made was that he forgot he was legislating for this country and he went searching out succession laws all over the world.  He was finding out what succession laws suited in different parts of the world, how they operated, and whether they were satisfactory or unsatisfactory, and he forgot apparently that here in this Legislature we legislate for the Irish people and whether or not a particular system operates satisfactorily in Scotland, Switzerland, or Germany <Col N="365" /> is quite irrelevant to the work we are supposed to do here for our own people.</P>
    <P>We have suggested in our amendment that the proposals contained in Parts IX and X are utterly unsuited to Irish conditions.  I believe that is so and I believe that, even as modified, that is still so.  The Minister instead of scrapping this Bill and bringing in a fresh one has built, as I said earlier, on rotten foundations.  Now the Minister is quite entitled to ask me to give the reasons why we came to that conclusion. Some of the reasons he has given himself already.  We believe that the proposals are unsuitable, first of all, because the people have, thank God, a regard for the permanence of marriage.  They have different ideas with regard to the permanence of marriage from those which obtain in some other countries.  Secondly, the particular form of our economy, based to a large extent on small farms and small holdings and on the small and medium sized businessman, is not such as is suited to the proposals put forward by the Government.  Thirdly, we believe, and I think the Minister will agree with me in this, that there is a high sense of duty and justice, including social justice, amongst the ordinary people here.  That is quite evident in the types of wills that are made and which can be regarded as the average, normal wills here.  Grave injustice to the spouse or dependant children is not widespread despite what the Minister's predecessor said in his press conference. It exists in a very limited number of cases, but it is not widespread. Most would regard it as being extremely rare but, to the extent that the problem is there, it should be remedied, and we want to see it remedied.</P>
    <P>Another reason why we believe the present proposals are utterly unsuited to our economy is because we here in this country, small and all as we are, have a problem of Partition and, if the Government are serious about wanting to see Partition ended, then it is sheer lunacy to have any radical difference between the succession laws north of the Border and South of the Border.</P>

      <P>That is a completely different position.  I am talking about our wanting to see an end of Partition.  Legislation of this sort will make more permanent the artificial boundary that exists between the north and south of this country. We also believe it is unsuitable to Irish conditions because we believe the average testator is the best judge of the family's circumstances which he wants to meet when he is making his will.  Any Deputy who is a lawyer, such as the Minister, and Deputy de Valera and I, know full well that the average testator here as often as not discusses the proposed provisions with his wife and family before he goes in to discuss them with his solicitor.  Testators have that high sense of duty and social Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opening remarks on this day week, I ventured to say that in his speech introducing this measure Deputy Dr. Browne dissociated himself from the Labour Party.  Deputy Corish contradicted me and later told me not to talk nonsense.  Deputy Corish's words to that effect will be found at column 234, volume 213 of the Official Report.  I have since looked up the Official Report and I find at column 91 of the same volume, Deputy Dr. Browne is reported as saying:</P>
      <P>I do not, I suppose, have to tell the House that this is a Private Member's Bill and that it does not represent Labour Party policy.  It is my own personal production.  The Labour Party accept no responsibility for it whatsoever: the individuals may have their own views on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is not a declaration of separation, independence or dissociation, <Col N="367" /> what is it?  I took it as a declaration of independence.  I said Deputy Dr. Browne had warned the House that he brought this Bill in as an independent member, whereupon Deputy Corish intervened to correct me saying: &ldquo;As an individual member.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be seen from the passage which I have read that neither of us was correct.  Deputy Dr. Browne did not use the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; or &ldquo;individual&rdquo;.  He stated his position in the formula which I have already quoted, a formula which I construed as meaning that Deputy Dr. Browne had dissociated himself from the Labour Party and had introduced this Bill as an independent member.  Deputy Corish construed Deputy Dr. Browne's words as meaning that he had introduced the measure as an individual member.  What does it matter? Whether Deputy Dr. Browne meant that he was speaking as an individual or an independent member, what distinction can be drawn between them? It would be a nice exercise for those who are devoted to semantics to say by what razor-edged definitions he would distinguish between the words and show them to have different meanings. However, it does not matter.</P>
    <P>What does matter is, I think, the interesting relationship between Deputy Dr. Browne and the Labour Party he has so recently adhered to, for in politics the Deputy pursues his wayward way with the promiscuity of a young Hollywood star who enters upon a fervid association to advance her career and, when advantage has been gained, disowns the relationship.  It is all done with the most consummate titillation of public curiosity: stories are fed to the press, statements are made indicating that the honeymoon is over and that a certain incompatibility has developed between the blissful partners and finally one has resolved to do something on her own.</P>

      <P>Is that not precisely what Deputy Dr. Browne <Col N="368" /> intended to convey in introducing this Bill?  If anyone has any doubt, let him read the passage for himself, or rather let me do it for him:</P>
      <P>I do not, I suppose, have to tell the House that this is a Private Member's Bill and that it does not represent Labour Party policy.  It is my own personal production.  The Labour Party accept no responsibility for it whatsoever: the individuals may have their own views on it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne has gone so far in that passage as to pre-empt his colleagues of the Labour Party&mdash;I presume they are still his colleagues&mdash;from claiming any part of the credit that may attach to the Bill. Most probably, however, many of them are rather relieved, in view of the disavowal of Party affiliations in this matter, that no part of the discredit will attach to them.</P>
      <P>Referring to the Bill now before us, let me remind the House that Deputy Dr. Browne has said: &ldquo;It is my own personal production.&rdquo;&ldquo;An ill-favoured thing, Sir&rdquo;, sayeth Touchstone, &ldquo;an ill-favoured thing, Sir, but mine own.&rdquo; The Deputy said the Labour Party accepted no responsibility for it whatsoever. May I congratulate the Labour Party on their wisdom and return to consideration of the Bill and the speech with which it was introduced by its only begetter?  Here we may know how concerned the Deputy is about his public image.  He informed us with some emotion that a number of people believe that he &ldquo;appeared to get a certain delight out of restricting individual freedoms&rdquo;.  The Deputy is quite correct.  That is the posture in which he projects himself to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many indeed are now inclined to think of him&mdash;and I say &ldquo;now inclined&rdquo; because quite frankly they did not at one time think of him in those terms&mdash;as a killjoy, a barebones, a man with no joy or laughter in himself and one who begrudges these to <Col N="369" /> others.  That may or may not be a true picture, as I will readily admit, but it is the one which the Deputy himself has impressed upon the public mind. It is the image which he has created, and I am bound to say that this Bill which he boasts is his &ldquo;own personal production&rdquo; will deepen and intensify that image.</P>
    <P>Moreover, in the light of the Bill, it is of no avail for the Deputy responsible for it to protest that &ldquo;he should not like to interfere with individual freedoms.&rdquo;  The public to whom he speaks will not take him at his word.  Instead they will look at this proposal of his and judge him by his actions.  When the Deputy says, as he did last Wednesday: &ldquo;Anybody who knows me will realise that I should not like to interfere with individual freedom,&rdquo; the public are likely to scoff because they will have before them this Bill which is the Deputy's &ldquo;own personal production&rdquo; and which is, in fact, designed to operate to that end.</P>
    <P>It is true that Deputy Dr. Browne in his advocacy of his Bill was careful to direct his attack not on smokers in general but at the tobacco manufacturers and, secondly, the brewers.  He may have been pleading in trying to defend himself against the charge that this Bill, his &ldquo;own personal production,&rdquo; is not directed against the cigarette-smoking public since it does not prohibit or restrict the sale of cigarettes but is directed against cigarette manufacturers only, but I doubt if that plea will impress the public.  Quite cynically, the public will recall the old proverb that &ldquo;there are more ways of killing a cat than choking it with butter,&rdquo; and more ways of interfering with individual freedom than imprisonment and more ways of cowing a child into doing one's will than beating it. One may, for instance, terrorise it with blood-curdling tales of what will befall it if it should venture to disregard one's wishes or advice.</P>
    <P>The measure which Deputy Dr. Browne proposes to us&mdash;the Tobacco (Control of Sale and Advertisement) Bill, 1964&mdash;is a measure designed to terrorise the cigarette smoker and to make him refrain from doing something <Col N="370" /> which the Deputy has convinced himself he should not do, no matter how much he may want to do it and no matter how much he may like it. Deputy Dr. Browne, smokers are likely to say, does not like smoking, does not smoke himself and wishes that nobody will smoke either.  They will correctly assume, I think, that he wants the Government to terrorise them, to intimidate them into refraining from doing something they enjoy, something that is a great comfort to them, soothing and relaxing, something that they like very much.  In these circumstances, what avail is it for the Deputy to protest that he does not &ldquo;like to interfere with individual freedoms?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The public will look at this Bill and, I think, will say, and rightly say, that in order to compel them to live according to his standards and to become non-smokers like himself, Deputy Dr. Browne is demanding that Dáil Éireann should compel cigarette manufacturers, every time a person buys a packet of cigarettes, to serve him with a death notice.  That, of course, is exactly what this Bill is designed to do.</P>
    <P>Now that the purpose of the Bill has been precisely defined, we may consider some of the arguments which its sponsor put forward in submitting it to the House.  With a discursive speaker like Deputy Dr. Browne, it is difficult to know where to begin.  It is particularly difficult to do so with his speech on this Bill.  In it, he dealt not only with cigarettes and cigarette manufacturers.  He had a swipe at regulations I made in 1958 under the Health Act, 1947, in relation to medical preparations.  He had another swipe at the Medical Preparations (Control of Sales) Regulations which I made in 1963.  Athletes who visit tobacco factories felt the lash of his tongue, notably Christy Ring and Gael Linn for participating in a film showing what a magnificent game hurling is. Deputy Dr. Browne's wrath then fell on every aspect of our sporting life&mdash; horse racing, golf and &ldquo;certainly GAA football and hurling.&rdquo;  Naturally, he did not spare his <i>bete noire,</i> the cigarette <Col N="371" /> manufacturers, any more than he spared the brewers, in his attitude towards the natural inclinations, simple joys and the harmless pleasures of those who do not agree with his outlook on society.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne assumes the role of a Hindu Brahmin.  It is not surprising that in this role so far as those who engage in the quite respectable occupations of brewing, cigarette manufacture, advertising and even athletics&mdash;at least those who do not accept the gospel according to Deputy Dr. Browne&mdash;are concerned, he makes it patent that he regards them as low caste untouchables, persons to be spurned and rejected.  What the Deputy says is in most cases rank nonsense.  So long as tobacco is allowed to be smoked, it must be allowed to be sold and accordingly to be manufactured. If it is legitimate to manufacture cigarettes, to sell them and to smoke them, why should it be made illegal to advertise them?  True enough, we must have regard to the statistics which are put forward to support the contention of those who hold that cigarette smoking is dangerous to health.  Therefore, playing for safety, we may perhaps try to regulate the style and makeup of advertising matter and to control the media employed.  It has been agreed that this should be done. A code has been drawn up to regulate the content and presentation of advertisements for tobacco, and particularly for cigarettes.  Here, I should like to express my appreciation of the readiness with which the manufacturers concerned co-operated with the officers of my Department and of Telefís Éireann in drawing up a reasonable but, I am certain, quite effective code of standards to regulate the advertising of cigarettes in Ireland.  A few minutes ago, I asked the question: &ldquo;If it is legitimate to manufacture cigarettes, to sell them and to smoke them, why should it be made illegal to advertise them?&rdquo; Deputy Dr. Browne has on many occasions declaimed against permitting cigarettes to be advertised and demanded that such advertisements should be prohibited.  His purpose is clear: it is, of course, to hamper their <Col N="372" /> sale.  The purpose of this Bill is to hamper their sale and to discourage their purchase, a first step towards, of course, the suppression of smoking altogether.  To do this, the Deputy proposes to employ the most ghoulish stratagem imaginable.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Dr. Browne had his way and this Bill were to pass, then, as I have said, every packet of cigarettes passed over the counter would carry a death notice.  He would condemn smokers to live <i>in terrorem.</i> What way is that to treat an adult population and on what grounds would Deputy Dr. Browne dare to do this?  On the basis of statistics&mdash;which, admittedly, may be interpreted as supporting his thesis but which nevertheless are very far from conclusive.  I want now therefore to raise the question: by what right does the Deputy propose to limit an individual in the exercise of his freedom, of his own freewill, or to intimidate him against exercising that freedom? It is true that the Deputy has cited what the State does in relation to certain vices, certain practices of addiction, certain frauds, and for the elimination of certain hazards and certain social evils but in every one of these spheres, the abuses which the State endeavours to prevent, there is an element of moral turpitude, an element which nobody, so far as I know, not even Deputy Dr. Browne, even though he has equated cigarette smokers with opium smokers, has asserted to be characteristic of smoking and that I think goes to the root of the matter.  I said before in this House in April, 1962, and I quote from column 1683, volume 194 of the Official Reports:</P>
    <P>The trouble about smoking is that the decision to smoke or not to smoke is a personal one, to be taken by the individual.  No nation has yet found an unfailing method of influencing the génerality of its people to do what common sense dictates in the interest of personal health. Smoking is not a disease.  It does not inevitably give rise to disease, and where it does, the disease is not communicable.  It does not endanger the public safety; there is no turpitude <Col N="373" /> attaching to it; and it cannot be held to be contrary to public morality.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat there is no baseness, no depravity, attached to it and if it may injure anyone, it will be the smoker himself and this indeed in the vast majority of cases, the overwhelming majority of cases, is far from certain.  It will injure no other person. It is far otherwise with the example cited by Deputy Dr. Browne.  He has told us that cigarettes can be called a drug to some extent and he has argued that as we restrict the sale of cocaine, hashish, marijuana and opium, he supposed a certain comparison can reasonably be drawn between the two.</P>
    <P>I have never seen a case of addiction to any of these drugs but presumably Deputy Dr. Browne has.  At least he implied as much when in a letter to a newspaper last month he declared:</P>
    <P>It is true that there are many doctors who are nicotine addicts, just as our profession, with nurses, has a high incidence of other forms of drug addiction.  This has never been advanced as a case for the freer use of cocaine or morphia amongst the public.</P>
    <P>As I say, I have never had experience of a person suffering from the effects of hashish, cocaine or opium, or any other drugs, but I have always understood that under the influence of these drugs, the devotees are reduced almost to the subhuman, that their reason is overthrown, their wills destroyed and their appetite for the drugs insatiable.  Does Deputy Dr. Browne expect us to believe that cigarette smoking can so debase a human being? That is the justification he offered in this House for this Bill.  He says a certain comparison can be drawn, a certain equation can be established, between the opium smoker and the cigarette smoker.  On no other basis than the fact that these are equivalent to each other is there any justification for the Deputy's measure.</P>
    <P>I ask him: does he expect adult people to believe that the cigarette <Col N="374" /> smoker can debase himself to the level to which an opium smoker may?  I do not believe the Deputy is so foolish; yet he has said that he &ldquo;supposed a certain comparison can reasonably be drawn between the two&rdquo;.  There is no analogy whatsoever between drug addiction and cigarette smoking such as Deputy Dr. Browne has suggested but has not tried to establish.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to section 65 of the Health Act, 1947, to the licensing laws and to the regulations dealing with the control of medical preparations.  It is true that all these measures are restrictive in their nature. Some impose the need to supply information in relation to certain medical preparations; others prescribe that certain preparations will not be sold except upon prescription and on compliance with certain other conditions.  The general purpose of these restrictions is to safeguard the public at large from the hazards arising from fraud through quackery or injury through the indiscriminate and unwarranted or ill-advised use of certain therapeutic substances.  They have no similarity.  The aim or purpose of these regulations has no resemblance whatever to what the Deputy proposes to do in the Bill.  The purpose the Deputy hopes to achieve in this Bill is quite cearly the purpose of leading the State on, step by step, to the stage at which it will be possible for him to say &ldquo;Suppress cigarette smoking altogether.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I was talking about the regulations and I mentioned that their purpose was to prevent people being defrauded by certain medical substances being used by ill-advised persons and those who sell them are obliged by the regulations which I made to publish on the package or container thereof the constituents of the preparation.  The regulations made under the section also prohibit the publication of advertisements for medical preparations in a manner which might lead the advertised preparations to be used for the treatment, etc., of certain scheduled ailments, infirmities, injuries or defects.  The scheduled ailments which were about <Col N="375" /> 40 in number include such diseases or conditions as Bright's Disease, cancer, diabetes, gallstones, gastric or peptic ulcers, paralysis, poliomyelitis, sinus infection, tumours and uraemia, all of which enriched many a quack in the past.  Can Deputy Dr. Browne say that the purpose of his Bill is to prevent quacks from enriching themselves by claiming virtues for what they are selling, healing virtues in fact for what they are selling?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne also referred in a general way to the inquiries which had been undertaken in many countries to establish the relationship between cigarette smoking and cancer and other conditions, but although he referred at some length to these inquiries, all authoritative inquiries, he refrained, very wisely, from quoting them.  He rang the changes like a tolling bell-ringer on the words &ldquo;cancer,&rdquo;&ldquo;coronary&rdquo; and &ldquo;bronchitis&rdquo; but quoted from none of the reports which resulted from the inquiries which he mentioned and for good reason, because those reports go far to demolish the case&mdash;not the case for persuading people to reduce their smoking&mdash;which he made for the harsh and repressive and indeed repulsive measures which he has proposed in this Bill.  The authors of these reports admit&mdash;indeed they stress and emphasise&mdash;that not all smokers are affected by lung cancer, coronary heart disease or bronchitis.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote, as an antidote, or at least as an answer to some of the wild statements with which Deputy Dr. Browne adorned his speech in introducing the Bill, the following extract from the Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service of the United States of America, page 193.</P>
    <P>Throughout this evaluation, it has been recognised that a casual hypothesis for the cigarette smoking-lung cancer relationship does not exclude other factors.  This is attested to by the fact that a small but not insignificant percentage of cases of lung cancer does occur among non-smokers. Some estimates in retrospective studies and most of the <Col N="376" /> prospective studies indicate that approximately 10 per cent of the lung cancer cases are in non-smokers. Doll has provided a higher estimate of 20 per cent.  Furthermore, the inability to account for the higher lung cancer incidence in the lower economic classes entirely by disparities in smoking habits, which do exist, does imply other causal factors.</P>
    <P>Not only did Deputy Dr. Browne throw great stress upon the association of lung cancer with cigarette smoking, but he also referred in the same alarming terms to the association which is presumed to exist between smoking and bronchitis.  Referring to bronchitis, the report of the Royal College of Physicians of London, another authoritative document, reads, and I quote from page 30:</P>
    <P>The strong association between smoking, especially cigarette smoking, and the incidence of chronic bronchitis does not necessarily mean that cigarette smoking is the chief cause or the only cause of the disease.  There is ample evidence implicating other factors.</P>
    <P>On page 34 the same report contains a table indicating the death rates per 100,000 persons from coronary disease amongst British doctors in relation to their smoking habits.  This table indicates, for example, that in the age group 55 to 64 years, the death rate from coronary disease per 100,000 was, for non-smokers, 734 and for smokers of from one to 14 cigarettes per day, 850. For smokers of from 15 to 24 cigarettes per day, there is a drastic decline to 541 and for smokers of 25 or more cigarettes per day, the death rate was 820.  It seems to me that those figures present a rather puzzling complex.  Let me repeat them.  In the age group 55 to 64 years, deaths amongst doctors from coronary heart disease per 100,000 were as follows: non-smokers, 734; smokers of one to 14 cigarettes per day, 850; smokers of 15 to 24 cigarettes per day, 541; smokers of 25 or more cigarettes per day, 820.</P>
    <P>The remarkable thing about this table is that in that particular age group the mortality rate among the <Col N="377" /> heaviest smokers is a little less than among the lighter smokers and not 14 per cent more than in the case of the non-smoker.  He would be very glib who would try to make scientific deductions from these figures with the same assurance as Deputy Dr. Browne did as to the relationship between smoking and lung cancer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; I should have said coronary disease.  The Deputy is quite right.</P>
      <P>I would like to consider now what the Deputy proposes to do in this Bill. He asks the Minister for Health from time to time, when it appears necessary to do so, to make regulations in regard to all or any of the following matters:</P>
      <P>Requiring that, if any tobacco or tobacco products are sold or offered for sale by a tobacco manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer and in the opinion of the Minister contain substances likely to cause injury to health, the deleterious nature and origin of the substances as may be specified in the regulations shall appear on the label or the container in which the tobacco or tobacco products are sold or offered for sale.</P>
      <P>First of all, what is the Minister required to do?  He is required, when a substance is offered for sale by a tobacco manufacturer, to ascertain whether it contains such substances as would, in his opinion, be of a deleterious nature.  He has then to ascertain the origin of the substance and then to specify that the nature of this substance will appear on the label or the container in which the tobacco or tobacco products are offered for sale. That means that the Minister will have to test every consignment of tobacco that comes into the country in order to satisfy himself whether it contains deleterious substances and what these deleterious substances are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having ascertained this, he will then have to prescribe that these substances will have to be indicated in a detailed manner on the container of <Col N="378" /> the cigarettes.  There are many substances in tobacco, many minute substances, some of which in another environment may be carcinogens but none of which has been established as being a carcinogen in tobacco.  If that had once been established, there would be no quarrel between the Deputy and myself.  We would be perfectly certain that tobacco was, in fact, the cause of lung cancer and these other diseases. But the real kernel of this problem is that while these substances may in another environment produce these effects they have not been shown to produce cancer when they are burnt in tobacco.  If they have then there must be something rather extraordinary because people who do not smoke at all are equally subject&mdash;the figures I have prove it&mdash;to all the diseases which the Deputy has referred to in order to intimidate the House into refraining from opposing this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are these substances with rather bizarre names such as benzo-pyrene, dibenzopyrene, etc.  Several of them might be carcinogens and some others might be carcinogens.  All these long chemical names are to appear according to Deputy Dr. Browne, on the tobacco package.  Not only that but their quantity is to appear on the package.  We all know the size of a tobacco package.  How are we going to get all that information on the package? What size will it be?  Who will read it?  If this is to be a practical measure, if there is any justification for it, Deputy Dr. Browne should resort to the device I suggested to him on this day week.  It would be much more economical and more impressive to print on the tobacco carton a death's head, a skull, and underneath let us have the motto: <i>memento mori.</i></P>
    <P>After all, this idea of trying to intimidate people by the fear of death is a rather over-rated one.  It is long outdated.  Most people know that you may be killed if you go in a bus or fly in an aeroplane.  Come to think of it, the mortality rate on aeroplanes is much greater than the mortality rate from cigarettes.  Yet Deputy Dr. Browne does not try to dissuade us from using aeroplanes if we happen to <Col N="379" /> be in a hurry to go some place.  The same thing applies to railway trains and motor cars.  A motor car in the hands of an unskilled driver is a much more potent killer than cigarettes.  At least, there is no doubt as to whether the car killed the person or not, whereas there is a grave element of doubt in relation to all this talk about lung cancer and other morbid conditions and cigarette smoking.  Instead of putting us to the trouble of printing a long list of chemical substances, the names of which people will not read or, if they do, will convey nothing to them, on cigarette packets, it would be far better for the Deputy to imprint a skull and crossbones or a death's head.</P>
    <P>It is clear when you consider the Bill and all the impracticable aspects of it that Deputy Dr. Browne did not consider this measure at all when he put it down.  Somebody told him what the Department of Commerce in America was going to do.  Somebody told him a Bill had been introduced in the British House of Commons.  The Deputy, with his usual flair for publicity, said that was a good stunt.  Then he came in with this Bill without considering at all whether it was possible to administer it or operate it.  I think the Bill is unnecessary.  I think it would be impossible to operate.  I think the people of this country would disregard it.  If the Dáil were foolish enough to stultify itself by passing it, I think it would conduce to no good and merely irritate the people; and, because they had been told they cannot smoke in this rather ham-handed, ghoulish, repressive sort of way, they would probably smoke more heavily than ever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health spoke for 45 minutes without coming to the Bill.  Those 45 minutes were mostly taken up with abuse of the mover of the Bill.  It is well-known that if you have a bad case, if you cannot answer the case made by your opponent, it is better to abuse him than stick to the case.  In this instance we have had 45 minutes of abuse and misrepresentation by a Minister who did not know what he was talking <Col N="380" /> about.  The Minister on a number of occasions referred to drugs such as hashish, cocaine and marijuana but pointed out he knew nothing about them.  It is generally known that one of the effects of indulging in any of these drugs is that the unfortunate addict immediately enters into another world in his own mind.  He becomes exuberant, able to take on all-comers, filled with a sense of his own importance and, at the same time, he is full of nonsense.  I know the Minister is not a drug addict, but I see nobody in this House who shows greater signs of being a drug addict.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have taken this measure seriously.  It deals with something dangerous to the health of the community.  Instead, we have the Minister taking a delight in misrepresenting the aims of the measure.  He has adopted the role of a mischievous imp, but it does not suit him at this stage. I shall give only a few examples of his misrepresentations.  I could go on for 45 minutes rebutting his suggestions and misrepresentations.  He sought to suggest, and, indeed, he was quoted last week in the daily papers as suggesting, that this measure was to prevent the people from smoking.  That is the only part that appeared in the papers as a result of his comments last week.  In fact, there is nothing in the measure to prevent any individual from smoking as much as he likes, or as often as he likes, or whatever cigarettes he likes.  What is in the measure is an attempt to restrict those who seek by dishonest means and by dishonest publicity to persuade others to adopt a habit which is dangerous to health.  Is there anything wrong with that?  The restriction, in fact, is not on the person who is persuaded by advertising and other means to smoke; the restriction is on the person who advertises wrongly and on the manufacturer who makes false claims for his product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that in this measure there is no question of preventing manufacturers of tobacco or those who advertise for them from advertising and praising their cigars or pipe tobacco or the users of pipe tobacco.  There is no mention in this measure of those two items, cigars <Col N="381" /> and pipe tobacco, which are used extensively.  It is not considered that these items are dangerous to the health of the public but it has been established, I think, to the satisfaction of most people that the cigarette habit and the use of cigarettes can be very dangerous to the individuals in the community who are unfortunate enough to be addicted to the habit of smoking cigarettes.</P>
    <P>Is there anything wrong in suggesting that there should be a measure of control over the propaganda which is let loose on the public today to smoke cigarettes?  How many times in the night on Telefís Éireann is a good programme interrupted for the purpose of broadcasting an advertising slogan to the effect that a cigarette is cool and healthy and good for one?  How many times is it suggested to viewers, young and old, every night on our national television system that a cigarette is good for one's health?  It must be remembered that there is only one programme for the community, that there is no choice of programme.  Is there any harm in suggesting that that dishonest type of propaganda and advertising should be cut out without delay?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne deserves the greatest credit for his move in this regard.  Despite what the Minister and other members of the House may think, the majority of the public would be behind a move to restrict this type of dishonest propaganda and completely untrue advertising that takes place on behalf of the cigarette manufacturers.  The Minister here, although I believe he is a non-smoker, has fallen for the propaganda of these people that a cigarette is good to relieve one's worries.  I have been as addicted to cigarette smoking as many people.  I have been a very heavy smoker.  I laboured under the delusion for a while that a cigarette was good to calm one's nerves.  In fact, that is the danger of the cigarette habit, that one's nerves cannot be soothed or one's mind eased unless one continues to smoke cigarettes and a person will smoke more and more according to the pressure on him.  That <Col N="382" /> is the real danger of allowing dishonest advertising of the type we see being allowed on Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the position in the neighbouring country.  I look at the BBC programme whenever I get the chance.  It is an example to us that there is no advertising of cigarettes on that medium.  In fact, there is no advertising at all.  If we need money to run the national television service, we should not take money under false pretences.  We should not take the wrong type of money, which is being poured into the coffers of Telefís Éireann for dishonest advertising.</P>
    <P>One of the purposes which this Bill hopes to achieve is the discontinuance of that type of fraudulent advertising. Many members of this House would be behind that purpose.  Let us be clear.  There is no suggestion in this measure of compulsion as far as the general public is concerned.  The aim is to prevent the public from being brainwashed by the very slick advertising methods in use today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne mentioned the fact that some of the best brains in the country are being devoted to this type of professional advertising.  I do not intend to deal with advertising in general because that would be outside the scope of this Bill but some day it would be worth discussing in this House.  Although in other forms of advertising the little lies that are told may be little white lies, when it comes to a question affecting health and where a habit may be formed, such as cigarette smoking, which has been proved to be dangerous, restriction is no harm at that stage.  There are many instances of legislation to prevent other habits and other actions which are not in many respects as dangerous as the cigarette habit.</P>
    <P>The Minister sought to suggest that this Bill sought to set up a terrorist apparatus of some sort.  That is the expression he used&mdash;a terrorist apparatus. What does he describe as a terrorist apparatus?  One that seeks to prevent, as I have said, the type of propaganda to which I have referred from persuading the public to indulge in this habit.  I know for a fact that <Col N="383" /> there are many citizens who are anxious to give up smoking and who find it a very difficult thing to do.  To add to their difficulties, they find themselves, at their very weakest moment, when they should be helped, faced with advertising which puts them back on the old routine.  People should be helped by keeping the thought of cigarette smoking out of their minds as much as possible rather than be subjected to pressure day and night by propaganda to the effect that cigarette smoking is a wonderful aid to digestion, to peace of mind, and so on.</P>
    <P>Let me comment at this stage on the Minister's remarks about the code which is being established as a result of a little confab between the cigarette manufacturers, his Department and Telefís Éireann.  That code, whether it will be a good or bad code, has come about purely and simply because this Bill has been on the stocks for the past 12 months.  It was a well-known fact.  It was well known to the tobacco manufacturers that this House would discuss this measure within a short period of time.  The code which has been established came about because of the fact that these people felt it was better to head off the criticism before the Bill would reach the Dáil.  We have seen examples of that type of thing happening before in respect of other matters. It is one of the advantages of having power in this House to put down a Private Member's Bill or a Private Member's motion and it is one of their privileges that should be guarded very jealously by Deputies.  It is one of the few means of bringing pressure to bear, where necessary, on people outside this House.</P>
    <P>As far as the code is concerned, I hope it will be of some benefit but, at any rate, the credit for that code, poor and all as it is at the moment, must lie at the door of Deputy Dr. Browne.  I know he will not get credit for it from the Minister or from the tobacco manufacturers but the general public realise that, were it not for the fact that this Bill was about to come before the House, no code of any description would have been adopted <Col N="384" /> by the tobacco manufacturers.  In fact, what did happen was that the Minister and his Department consulted the tobacco manufacturers and told them: &ldquo;This is going to be a very awkward business in Dáil Éireann.  There is bound to be a certain amount of support for this measure.  It would be very diplomatic at this stage if you got together and devised some method of heading off this criticism which will face us all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What did they do?  They got a very reputable legal man to act as umpire in this matter.  He will be paid, naturally enough, by the tobacco manufacturers.  They will be judge and jury on the question of what should or should not appear in advertising. The general public will not have any say, and the Minister for Health got down on his knees and licked the boots of the tobacco manufacturers a week ago outside the House and, tonight in this House, salaams humbly and says: &ldquo;Thanks very much, gentlemen, for this code.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He has just spent 45 minutes telling us there is no danger at all to health in smoking.  He produced figures here which&mdash;I do not say he said this&mdash; implied that, as far as the death rate among smokers was concerned, those who smoke most live longest.  However, in his heart of hearts he knows that the day is not far off when the line of action suggested by Deputy Dr. Browne will have to be taken.</P>
    <P>I think there are quite a number of people in the House who if given freedom from the Party Whip would show they, too, are aware of the necessity for restrictions being imposed, particularly on the advertising of cigarettes. I was rather annoyed at the attitude of the Minister for Health.  I would not have spoken on the lines on which I have spoken were it not that the last time the Minister spoke he said&mdash;and it was quoted in some of the newspapers&mdash;he did not think we were entitled to go to the lengths to which they went in America on the question of prohibition.  What bearing had that on this Bill?  Prohibition in America was for the purpose of preventing the public from drinking alcohol and he <Col N="385" /> sought to suggest to the public mind that was the aim of this measure.  It was a dishonest manoeuvre to suggest that Deputy Dr. Browne was out to prevent the man in the street from having a cigarette if he wants it.</P>
    <P>There are cinemas, theatres and other places where people are not allowed to smoke unless they go out to the foyer, corridor or elsewhere. There is nothing wrong with that. There are railway carriages where smoking is not allowed.  That is not always observed but it could be enforced.  There are restrictions like that in operation but nobody suggests we should go to the lengths to which they went in America on the question of prohibition.  However, the mind of the Minister was so poisoned against the mover of this measure that he sought to suggest to the public that Deputy Dr. Browne wanted to bring about conditions similar to those applying during the prohibition days in America.</P>
    <P>If the Minister could hang that interpretation on the Bill he knew it would kill any criticism of the tobacco manufacturers and the advertising campaign for as long as he is in office. That is what he sought to suggest. Perhaps it is a very good political point to make.  Perhaps in politics the main idea is to make a political point and show how smart and quick you are with the tongue.  If that is the case the Minister is a winner.</P>
    <P>The Minister also sought to suggest that the Deputy who moved this measure is the killjoy of politics. I may be wrong but in 50 years' time when people consider who has done most for the health of the people, it will not be hard to know whom it will remember the best or the longest or who will be remembered with the greatest affection.  It is not the man with the quick and bitter tongue who comes in to make this or that political point and who does not follow it up with hard facts and a well thought-out case.</P>
    <P>When all is said and done, I would say the majority of people would agree with this, that some restriction on the advertising, in particular, of cigarettes <Col N="386" /> is desirable.  We would all like to see the number of cigarettes smoked reduced. Even the heaviest smokers among us would like to see ourselves being helped without being disciplined. We must think of the Minister for Finance and, indeed, the Minister for Health has to think of that, too, because there is up to £30 million coming into the kitty from tax on tobacco.  Not all of that is for cigarettes.</P>
    <P>Whatever the loss&mdash;and it would be a big immediate loss to the Exchequer &mdash;it could be offset within a very short time.  I am satisfied that the financial advisers to the Government would be well able to plan an alternative type of tax.  It is not beyond their ingenuity to work out an alternative to compensate for the temporary loss of revenue if there was a reduction in the amount of money coming in to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Every member of the House will agree that the people who give up cigarettes at times, for instance, during Lent, find that from the financial point of view they are no better off.  I think a financial wizard would agree with me that if people stop smoking cigarettes they do not save the money which they used to spend on cigarettes.  It burns a hole in their pockets and they spend it.  It is up to the financial experts to devise a means of getting their hands on that money.  I am not going to make any suggestions at this stage but I have certain ideas as to what could be done.  There are people in this House and advisers outside it who know what can be done and how money can be got.  A great deal of money is being spent today in this country even by people who cannot afford it. Although the difficulties which would confront the Minister for Finance might appear very formidable they can be overcome.  The financial end of it would solve itself with the passage of time and the various services which are depending at the present time on the tax on cigarettes would not suffer in the slightest.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say on this Bill. I hope the Minister will allow a free vote so that Deputies can express their <Col N="387" /> views and there can be no excuse that the Party Whip was involved.  I appeal to Deputies to give the Bill all the support they can at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker finished by asking for a free vote. Nevertheless he wants to interfere with the freedom of people in the matter of smoking, not directly, of course, but indirectly.  That is the position as I see it.  It is more than likely that excessive smoking is injurious to health.  So is excessive eating and excessive drinking. Anything of the so-called good things of life taken in excess have an adverse effect on the health of the individual who indulges in the excesses.</P>
      <P>There is a certain amount of comfort and a certain amount of pleasure in moderate smoking.  I was a smoker; I have not smoked of late because I found I was not smoking in moderation. I do not think legislation is the proper way to cut down smoking.  It was suggested by the last speaker that the Minister for Finance and his colleague, the Minister for Health, would not like to do anything which might have a depressing effect on revenue from cigarettes and tobacco. I do not subscribe to that view.  People in responsible positions, such as Ministers of State, legislate for the betterment of the people.  That is the aim of every Government, irrespective of what Party or Parties constitute the Government.  When it comes to public health versus income to the Exchequer, public health comes first.</P>
      <P>No conclusive data has so far been forthcoming to prove that smoking adversely affects health.  There is no conclusive proof certainly that smoking in moderation is injurious to health.  It is quite commonly accepted, be it right or wrong, that a cigarette or pipe gives a certain immunity from infectious disease.  I am not a medical man and I do not know if that is true&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One always finds in <Col N="388" /> every society people who are ready and anxious to back up every new idea just for the sake of backing it and irrespective of whether or not it is a good idea.  The position here is amply safeguarded.  We have an outstanding man in our present Minister for Health.  He has under him a staff that can be relied on to take all the precautions necessary to safeguard public health.  He has the situation under control but, should the situation ever threaten to become serious, I have no doubt that he and every member of the Government and every responsible official of his Department would not hesitate to take all the steps necessary to safeguard public health.</P>
      <P>Now, I am only human and I can make a mistake, but I feel that the motive in bringing in this Bill was not so much public health as public publicity.  I have heard it remarked that certain things may secure popularity for politicians and I should not mind if it were a matter of politics, but, as far as I am aware, the proposer of this Bill has gone in very much for self-glorification and popularity regardless of everything else.  I may be wrong in that, but it is my view.  I do not claim to be infallible.  Whether I am right or whether I am wrong, I do not think this Bill is necessary in existing circumstances.  If we pass legislation to cut down on the use of tobacco and cigarettes, might we not, later on, come in here on some pretext or another to pass legislation to cut down the consumption of tea drinking, or coffee drinking, or something else?</P>

We must credit the ordinary people with being sensible even though as human beings they may make mistakes at times.  So far as we can help it, we should do nothing by way of legislation to fetter the freedom of the individual in his everyday life.  I am definitely in favour of fettering the freedom of the individual who wants to do something that would endanger the public peace, or the security of the nation.  Right or wrong, I think there is no need to introduce legislation of this kind and I ask the House to reject it.</P>
      <P>We must let the people enjoy themselves. There is great enjoyment in smoking in moderation.  There is great enjoyment in sports or amusements in moderation.  There is great enjoyment in social drinking in moderation.  We should leave things as they are and let the people themselves decide what they are going to do.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak on this Bill because when I came along the corridor I put my cigarette in the bowl outside the door, but the last speaker has induced me to get to my feet because I think he misrepresented what the Bill proposes. It does not propose to prohibit the smoking of tobacco.  It does propose to limit the appeals that are made to potential smokers.  Any legislation discussed here must be reasonable if it is to be successful, and I believe there is a thread of reason running through this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to decide what to do because we are all victims of various bad habits, and smoking is one of the pleasant habits as Deputy Meaney said.  The Bill contains no interference with personal freedom because an individual is free to smoke or not to smoke.  There may be some interference with the manufacturer of the article in the area in which he pitches his appeal.  Having looked at some smoking advertisements on television particularly, I think we should start thinking about the subject at any rate.  If Deputy Dr. Browne has done nothing more than that, perhaps he has done a great deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal of glamour and attraction about the way the enjoyment <Col N="390" /> of cigarette smoking is conveyed on television and in advertisements in other media.  The people who smoke are always good-looking and young, unlike Deputy Meaney or myself.  There is a kind of rugged air about the man who smokes a cigarette, almost a suggestion that he is on the road to good health by smoking.  Four or five of my friends are doctors and in the past eight or nine years they have ceased to smoke, I suppose because in their profession they see people suffering from the effects of smoking. When I offer them a cigarette they say: &ldquo;Have you not come to the age of reason or the age of sense yet?&rdquo; Although I am old enough I admit I have not done so in regard to smoking. Perhaps the pitch of the appeal could be circumscribed in some way to counteract the glamorous kind of atmosphere that surrounds smoking in the pictures we see.  It is always young people who are smoking in those pictures and they are obviously aimed completely at the teenagers who are moving towards the age when they will become new customers for the tobacco manufacturers.  If an agreement could be reached which would severely limit that type of appeal something would be accomplished.</P>
    <P>More should be done to limit the amount of smoking permitted in public places.  Heavy smokers who smoke in public places embarrass others.  That is a type of rudeness but it is so common and general that for the sake of our own sensual indulgence in tobacco smoking we brush that rudeness aside and indulge ourselves.  It would be interesting if the Government Whip who is now sitting in the Minister's seat would talk with his Party and allow a free vote of the House on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in entire agreement with Deputy Meaney when he says it is excessive indulgence in anything that causes the harm.  I do not think anything in the Bill would prevent excessive indulgence in smoking. Publication of a formula on a packet in time comes to be taken for granted and not read.  Apart from the fact that I believe it is the Minister's job to take any necessary steps because he has his expert advice, quite candidly I do not think the suggestion in the Bill would act as a deterrent to anyone who indulges in excessive smoking.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that excessive smoking is harmful and I believe the necessary publicity drawing attention to the danger of what is harmful, if indulged in excessively, is a much better deterrent than having a formula on a packet of tobacco or cigarettes which are on sale.  The trouble, I would say, is how to bring this danger to the notice of the younger people who have not yet started or who are about to start smoking.  I doubt if any formula published on the packet will deter them.  In fact, it may have the opposite effect of making them believe that this is something which is really worthwhile because it is to some extent prohibited and I do not think it will have the effect of preventing young people from starting to smoke.  If I were a young boy today and had not yet started smoking, I should not start.</P>

O'Higgins).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When we broke off discussion on this matter, I was listing a number of reasons why we in Fine Gael put down this amendment and why we considered that the Government proposals, as originally introduced, were utterly unsuited to Irish conditions.  I mentioned a number of them.  I think I was mentioning, when we broke off, that one of our reasons was that we believed that the proposals as drafted were bound to give rise to considerable litigation, family dissension and unpleasantness of that kind.</P>
      <P>So far as the question of unnecessary litigation is concerned, I think it is fair to say that I believe the amendments which the present Minister for Justice proposes to introduce will obviate it to a large extent.  In any event, it is fair to say that the same objections on that particular ground to the original proposals do not lie at least as strongly against the modified proposals which the Minister proposes to ask the House to adopt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main grounds why we felt the original proposals would be quite unsuited to conditions in this country was the provision which was implicit in the original proposals that a testator could not leave his entire estate to his wife, if he chose to do so. <Col N="393" /> I think it was clear to anyone who had any kind of knowledge of the ordinary run of wills, certainly in the city of Dublin and I think the same would be true of other large urban centres, that what would be regarded as the normal will of, for want of a better expression, the middle income bracket was the will leaving everything to the wife.  That also is being remedied in the Minister's proposals. To that extent, the objection which we had to the original proposals does not exist to the proposals which the Minister now puts before us.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the coin, so far as rural areas are concerned, the Minister will probably agree with me that a perfectly normal average type of will in rural areas in this country is the will of a small farmer who decides to leave the bulk of his estate, which is the farm, to a particular son&mdash;it might be the eldest son or it might be one of the younger sons who has shown a particular aptitude for farming or because possibly the eldest son has gone on for one of the professions, the priesthood or into a training college to become a teacher.  In any event, I think the Minister will agree that it is quite a usual, normal and average type of will to find in rural areas in this country that the farmer will leave his farm as a unit to a particular son and probably make provision for his wife, if she should survive him, either that she will have some share in it or certainly that she will have, as a minimum, a right of residence and support on the farm. That, as I say, in our circumstances is a normal will and, I believe, a perfectly proper will.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not remedied that situation in his proposed amendments. All he has done is this: he says that you cannot leave it by will but that you may do it by deed, provided you get the consent of the spouse.  I think that provision certainly does not meet the objections which have been put up to the original proposals&mdash;not, let me say, primarily by lawyers who seem to be a bugbear of the former Minister for Justice but by other responsible organisations and individuals, such as, <Col N="394" /> for example, the National Farmers Association.</P>

      <P>I know that the Minister extended to them the courtesy of seeing them, as well.  They may feel that the Minister has gone some distance to meet them.  I do not think he has gone sufficiently far to meet them.  I believe the logic of the situation presented to us now by the Minister is entirely faulty.  Either it is right or it is wrong that a man should be entitled to dispose of his farm to one of his sons.  If it is right that he should be entitled to do that, it is right that he should be able to do it by deed or by will and if it is wrong that he should be entitled to dispose of his farm to one of his sons, then it is wrong that he should be able to do it by deed or by will.  The Minister is asking the House to adopt a ridiculous attitude by saying it is right if you do it by deed and wrong if you do it by will, subject to the modification that if you do it by deed, you must get the consent of the spouse.</P>

The fact remains that the category of people of whom I am speaking at the moment will not be allowed to do what they are entitled to do now, namely, to leave the farm as a unit to a particular son. In the second explanatory memorandum issued by the Minister, the same phrases were used as in his press conference statement.  The Minister appears to be adopting the attitude that because he will permit deeds of family arrangement to be entered into by a farmer or a businessman during his life, he is conferring a benefit on them.  Let us think what we are doing. In fact, they have that right now and the Minister is taking it away from them to a great extent.  We should recognise that fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is limiting that right.  The Minister is saying that a man can do it by deed, by family settlement, by family arrangement but he is in fact saying: &ldquo;You cannot do it by will; you can do it by deed or family arrangement&rdquo;. Is not that the size of it?</P>
      <P>As I say, I do not think the Minister has met that case nor has the Minister met another objection which we had to the original proposals, except in a roundabout and completely incidental way.  The case frequently arises where a testator, for some reason which he believes to be good, and more often than not is good, wants to give preferential treatment to one of his children, either because of particular family circumstances, which may be known only to the testator and his family or because a particular child has remained at home to care for the parents when others have gone away. The parents feel that that child is entitled to some type of reward by means of preferential treatment.</P>
      <P>There is still an objection to doing that under the Minister's proposals. Admittedly, the Minister has now come down to the point particularly that legal shares should be the right of the dependent children only.  The Minister means by dependent children, children who are under the age of 21. That leaves greater freedom of disposition which may enable a man to make the type of provision I am talking about.  But, to a large extent, the objection on that ground still remains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was urged in objection to the original proposals&mdash;to some extent this objection is still valid with the Minister's amendment&mdash;that they were a disincentive to thrift.  I believe this was particularly so in the case of the original proposals because the original proposals had set fixed shares for children irrespective of age and irrespective of their own particular circumstances. No matter how he conducted himself, a person who was a child of a comparatively wealthy family knew that he was going to get a share, come what may.  To some extent that objection <Col N="396" /> remains, not by any means to the extent to which it existed before.</P>
    <P>There is also another difficulty, that is, when you have this kind of complicated legislation being introduced, the difficulty of the testator who, either because he left it too late, through being dilatory or because he was suddenly taken ill, or involved in an accident, makes a deathbed will. At the moment he can make a simple will without having to go into fractions, without having to evaluate his estate or to get someone else to value it for him.  He can make his will according to his concept of fair play and justice, which, again, let me repeat, is remarkably high among testators in this country.</P>
    <P>The person who is faced with the position of making a deathbed will has to think of a whole lot of things. He has to think what is the value of his property, what is the value of this or that portion of his estate.  He has to think if he makes such and such a will, is he offending against the new rules which are being introduced which say a widow must be entitled to so much and the dependent children entitled to so much?  That objection still remains.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely sure either whether it is right in making legislation of this sort which proposes completely to alter a person's right of disposing of his property by his will, that it should be made to operate on existing wills.  The proposal was, until today, that this Bill was to apply to every will of a person who died after 1st January next, irrespective of when the will was made.  The Minister has indicated&mdash;and in fairness to his predecessor, he indicated it also after he had become Minister for Agriculture &mdash;that he is no longer adhering to a particular deadline.  He has indicated that he would be prepared to accept a year from 1st January next.  There was an objection which, again, let me say in fairness, does not exist now arising under Part X of the Bill whereby if a person did want to disinherit a member of the family, it was <Col N="397" /> essential that a great deal of washing of dirty linen should take place in public.  I was interested to hear the Minister's remark today in making his case against the system that obtains in England.  It struck me that the Minister's remarks on that were certainly very relevant to the proposals which his predecessor had included in Part X of the Bill so far as the disinheriting clauses of the Bill were concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also modified now section 117 with regard to voluntary disposition.  He is modifying it only to the extent of cutting the period from ten to three years and of excluding certain things like insurance policies, pension rights and deeds of family arrangements where consent of the spouse is concerned.  I think there is still an objection to this section.  It still means that all the voluntary dispositions, made in a perfectly genuine <i>bona fide</i> manner for the wellbeing of the family will be suspect for a period of three years.  It will be quite impossible for a voluntary donee of property in those circumstances to raise credit on it because his title is not clear for a period of three years. That is a valid objection which existed to the original proposals and which exists equally strongly, but not for the same length of time, to the Minister's modified proposals.</P>
    <P>The overriding objection to the original proposals, which still exists to the Minister's proposals, is that in questions of testamentary disposition, no two cases are alike.  It would be an extraordinary coincidence if you did come across two exactly similar cases.  All sorts of individual and family circumstances, which will be known only to the testator and his family, will exist and in those circumstances a general rule of the type being proposed, either in the original proposals or in the modified proposals, certainly seems to be somewhat out of place.</P>
    <P>I recognise there is a difficulty which must be dealt with and tackled.  When we in the Fine Gael Party moved a motion in these terms last November, we recognised that that difficulty <Col N="398" /> existed.  The motion we moved was:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that legislation should be introduced at an early date to provide that a person may not dispose by will of his property without making adequate provision for a dependent wife and/or children.</P>

      <P>Column 1029 in the Official Report of 6th November, 1963.  I think it is necessary that legislation should be introduced to make that provision, but the Government decided not to do that and not to bring in legislation which would be directed towards remedying the particular problem that existed.  Instead of doing that, they chose to bring in a comprehensive Wills Bill.</P>
      <P>There are many good features in this Bill and I shall deal with them shortly.  So far as the particular problem I have already mentioned is concerned, it seems to me that what was required, and what is required, is, first of all, an assessment of the size of the problem that exists.  Secondly, the Minister may take it that we are all in agreement that the particular problem of the inofficious, undutiful will should be remedied.  It is a question of method of approach, if you like.  I can see it is possible to have many different views, all equally sincere and perfectly honest approaches, to this question.  There may be disagreement, and violent disagreement, with regard to the methods. To that extent, I am sorry the Minister did not, first of all, circulate a White Paper which would enable orderly discussion and examination to take place, and, secondly, that he did not decide, when a Bill of this sort came along, to have it referred to some type of Select Committee for examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me state my attitude to this as briefly as possible.  I think it is one thing to say you must ensure that spouses and dependent children will be adequately provided for.  It is a different matter to say you can only do <Col N="399" /> that by providing that the State will dictate to a testator, with regard to a particular share of his estate, as to how that should go.  I have already indicated my view, and I believe it is the correct one, that while the problem does exist it is an exaggeration to say it exists on a great scale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we can approach this by agreeing on a number of propositions.  We are in agreement, first of all, that a man is, as a matter of right, entitled to the ownership of private property.  We are in agreement, secondly, that a married man has obligations and responsibilities towards his wife and children.  There is a third proposition which I believe to be valid but which, I think, judging by the performance in relation to this Bill, the Government do not accept.  The third proposition which I believe to be valid, and which I accept, is that in this country the great majority of Irish testators do make proper wills which make proper and adequate provision for their dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already said, and I can say this from personal experience, a very great number of testators go to the trouble of discussing the provisions which they propose to make, not only with their solicitors, not only with accountants, but with other members of their family as well.  They show a concern, not only that their wills or their testamentary provisions will be workable, but that they will be scrupulously fair as well.  I go from that to ask myself whether it is right that in the case of the vast majority of testators who do make proper wills, making proper and adequate provision for their dependants, that the State should interfere with their wills in order to remedy <Col N="400" /> a limited problem which, admittedly, is there.  My answer to that question is, &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  What is needed is an alteration of the law limited to the particular problem, not an alteration of the law of general application which will apply to everyone for the sake of getting at the few.</P>
    <P>So far as the inofficious will is concerned, I want to make it quite clear that I do not mind what type of provision is brought in to ensure that the situation created by that will will be remedied.  I think it would be quite proper for the Minister to adopt the system of fixed shares, to adopt, if he likes, the system of saying that if the will is an undutiful will it can be completely set aside and the entire of that estate will go in whatever proportions this House should decide to the spouse, or, if there is no spouse, to the children, or in different shares between the spouse and the children.  Approaching it that way, the Minister will be dealing with the problem that requires to be dealt with and, at the same time, he would be leaving without interference the majority of people who make good and proper wills.</P>
    <P>Let me say this while I am on the subject.  The Minister in his introductory speech today&mdash;and the former Minister on at least one occasion&mdash; referred to this country as being one of the few civilised countries that have complete freedom of testamentary disposition. As I understood it, these ministerial references seemed to indicate that there was something to be ashamed of in that, that there was something for which we should apologise.  I do not accept that.  It should be rather a matter of pride to us that we had that freedom of testamentary disposition and that it has not been necessary, in a general way, to legislate with regard to it.  It simply indicates, by and large, that in this country there has been a high sense of social justice which did not render interference by the legislature necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why the Deputy's amendment, then?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment was to deal with the particular problem of the inofficious will.  The Minister should deal with that problem without interfering generally with the wills of testators who make proper wills.  It is not everyone who will accept that view. People may advance very forcibly the view that once you are making an alteration it is better to let everyone know where he stands, to have a general rule so that everyone will know he has to conform with that rule.</P>
      <P>So far in this country, with the exception of the inofficious will, that has not been necessary.  It is a tribute to the social sense of our people that it has not been necessary: it is not something we should be ashamed of or in respect of which we have any need to apologise.  It is not a flaw. It is not something that should be subject to criticism.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned in his introductory statement that he had consulted a number of independent experts. I should have thought an expert was an expert: I do not know what &ldquo;independent expert&rdquo; means in this context.  A person is either an expert or he is not.  I should like to refer the Minister to a letter which appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> on 25th November last by a very eminent senior counsel who is certainly not a politician.  I do not know what his political views are or for whom he votes.  He is a person who most of us would regard as an expert in this field.  He wrote in the <i>Irish Times,</i> after the Minister had made known the amendments he proposed making to the Bill:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments now proposed by the Minister for Justice leave some of the most objectionable features in this Bill still standing and are such as to create new injustices.  It is still proposed to dictate to a majority of testators how they must dispose of a fraction, varying from one-third to two-thirds, of their property.  It is still proposed to invalidate dispositions not made for full valuable consideration and taking effect within a certain period before the testator's death or on his death, or later, if it appears to the court that the disposition was made <Col N="402" /> in order to defeat or substantially diminish the share of spouse or issue as a legal right.  It is proposed to delete subsections (4) and (5) of section 119 (which provided that persons guilty of &ldquo;dissolute or dishonourable conduct&rdquo; or&mdash;in the case of issue of the testator&mdash;who were adequately provided for might, in certain circumstances forfeit or lose their &ldquo;legal right&rdquo;).</P>

    <P>With regard to the details of the Bill, I should imagine, offhand, that threequarters of the Bill is unobjectionable. Many features of the Bill are very good and I would have no objection to them.  I would have no hesitation in commending them to the House as being an improvement on the existing <Col N="403" /> position.  I would urge on the Minister, however, to consider the case that is made and to consider withdrawing the Bill in its present form and coming back with a completely new Bill which will not have any of this whitewashing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <P>Before I finish, I should like to suggest to the Minister that the whole thing is rather topsy-turvy at the moment.  A number of modifications were suggested by the Minister at his press conference and subsequently in his explanatory memorandum. We have not yet seen the full force of the amendments he intends to make.  He mentioned in the course of his remarks today that there were three proposed additional amendments not dealt with in the explanatory memorandum.  I submit it is absolutely necessary in these circumstances that the Bill should be recommitted on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>On the Committee Stage we shall have an opportunity of seeing for the first time the full Government proposals. In my submission, we should see those and have them before us on the Second Reading.  In fact, we shall not have them until the Committee Stage and the first real consideration we can give to the actual amendments will be at that stage.  The Minister might now indicate whether he would be prepared to recommit on Report Stage.  However, that is a technical matter.  I am not entirely sure what the Minister intends to do with regard to section 37.  I rather got the impression today that that section is being withdrawn entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is doing that, the Minister is doing well.  He has improved the position which was proposed by his predecessor.  He also indicated today&mdash;neither did this appear in the explanatory memorandum&mdash;that there would be an amendment to section 63 dealing with advancement which possibly removes one of the fears had in that connection. <Col N="404" /> I understand the gift of spouse will not come under the advancement section.</P>
      <P>Section 77 also requires very careful consideration on Committee Stage. That is the section that deals with the witnessing of wills&mdash;the Minister mentioned it today.  There is no doubt the proposals in the Bill will simplify will-making. That is all to the good.  The question we have to consider is whether the simplification taking place will not open the door to fraud and mistake which, to a large extent, is guarded against in present procedure. At present it is necessary, as the Minister knows, to have a will signed in the presence of two witnesses.  Both must be present at the same time and all three parties&mdash;testator and the two necessary witnesses&mdash;must be there at the same time and must be able to see each other signing.  The proposal now is to get away from that, still to require two witnesses but witnesses who need not be present at the same time; one could sign at one time and another could sign later.  It may be that that proposal is a worthwhile one but I have the greatest doubts about it.  We can overdo the idea of simplification and that is one of the cases where we must certainly be on our guard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of detailed matters in connection with the Bill that are more opportune to be dealt with on Committee Stage.  I do think that the altered provisions with regard to intestate succession are, by and large, an improvement on the existing position.  I could never understand why, in the case of an intestacy, where the husband died leaving a wife and children, the widow should get only one-third and the children should take the two-thirds.  That position is being reversed under these proposals and that is a substantial improvement and one which should be accepted.  Also at present if a man dies leaving a widow and no children, the existing provision is that the widow takes a first charge of £4,000 and one-half of the remaining estate, the other half goes to the next-of-kin in equal shares.  It is proposed to alter that so that in future where a man dies leaving a widow and no children, the widow will take the entire <Col N="405" /> estate.  That is also a worthwhile amendment.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters of details that would take me a long time to go into and I do not propose doing so now because they are more proper for Committee discussion, but may I conclude as I started by protesting against the unreal manner in which this Bill is presented to the House, where the House is not being given an opportunity of seeing the entire of the Government's proposals as we should be given when we are asked to give a Bill a second reading?</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment.  I will say a few words as I am at it because the Minister is of the opinion that I held a certain view that was contrary to that held by my colleague.  Speaking last September 12 months, I said that there were some cases in which there was no provision for the widow.  Speaking in that context, I referred to a man with a large, valuable estate who deliberately left his widow or children out of the picture and I said that was a shocking state of affairs.  I do not think that the number has been very great&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister very properly described this as a very technical Bill.  It is a Bill that lawyers know most about.  It has been introduced by a lawyer and there are several supporters on both sides who, I suppose, will speak to it, but there are a number of people who are not lawyers and who have very positive views on the whole question.  Let me say right away that threequarters of the farms in Ireland have a gross value of under £5,000 and therefore when the State steps in and says that a man may not, without the consent of his wife, bequeath the farm or the small business or the trade to his son, it is doing something that is rather strange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a farmer with <Col N="406" /> £35 valuation.  It is a fair farm; the family has been reared on it&mdash;I am citing cases I know of without mentioning names&mdash;and the eldest boy works the farm with the father and mother.  He went to school until he reached sixth standard and then undertook the task of assisting the father on the farm.  He helped to educate two or three brothers.  I know of one case where one son has already gone to college and has obtained a post in the Civil Service or in the bank.  The eldest boy has been working all the time and has helped the father to pay for the education of the other members of the family.  The State now says that the father cannot bequeath that farm to the eldest son without the consent of the wife.</P>
    <P>That is a rather serious situation but is it not strange that the father can drink out the place without the consent of the wife?  He can gamble it, play poker with it and lose the whole thing without the consent of the wife.  He can go to the dogs with it and bet under the legalised system of betting and lose the farm without the consent of his wife and it will be perfectly all right, and there is nothing that this Bill can do to stop it.  Yet the Minister says that he cannot do what he wants to do and what in justice he should do.  Is it not true that in 90 per cent of the cases, as the Minister himself knows, the normal will for the small farmer to make is to bequeath the farm to the eldest son, the mother to be maintained in the manner in which she had been accustomed?</P>

      <P>I will take the Minister's word for it.  That removes part of my objection but, on the other hand, any general assignment is without the consent of the wife.  Family settlements are frequently made in which a son has been working on the farm for a long time and finally says that there will have to be some agreement. The farmer has to get the consent of his wife to make an agreement.</P>
      <P>Is it not true to say that where an estate is valued for £3,000 and where it is divided between a son and a wife that division is going to disqualify the widow from getting the widow's pension? Her share would be £1,500 and if the pensions officer can prove that there is an estate valued £1,500 which will go to the widow she is going to get it in the neck.  Therefore, this Bill will relieve the Department of Social Welfare of some of its responsibilities for widows' pensions.</P>

      <P>The Minister should see if this is so.  I am informed that the section does not cover the case I mentioned.  I admit that the person bequeathing the estate should make provision for the widow and for dependent children and I advocated that in the motion which was before the House last September 12 months. But there are some extraordinary cases.  Pride in this country is a thing that has queer results.  I know a farmer who valued his farm at £20,000 and who made a will bequeathing the farm to his son, some thousands to his wife and so many thousand pounds to each of three daughters based on that £20,000 valuation.  The truth of the matter was that the farm was not worth £4,000 but it went into court and the net result is that neither the son, <Col N="408" /> the widow nor the daughters got the farm.  By the time the courts were finished with it it was sold by public auction and that was the end of it.</P>
      <P>When one starts settling fractions the difficulties arise very quickly. I heard my colleague say that there should be a set figure.  That is extremely difficult to do and it is hard to legislate for this particular type of case.  The one I have mentioned is a recorded case.  One daughter sued for £2,000 and the others went for their £2,000 each, the result being that the son was left out on the side of the road.  There are other cases of which I know.  Normally the the owner of property should be allowed freedom of choice in this matter.  The Minister tells me that he has the right to bequeath it to the son who was helping or as he thinks best.  If that is correct, it does remove some of the objections I had to the Bill.</P>
      <P>There was one thing that did upset me in the Minister's speech.  He said he had taken the opinions and examined the systems obtaining in several countries.  He cited and thanked certain authorities for the help they had given him but I did not notice the name of one single Catholic social teacher in the lot, at least not one that I know.  The speech the Minister made on this Bill today could have been made by a British Secretary of State for Home Affairs or Secretary of State for the Treasury, it is that lacking in any reference, as far as I could see, to social teaching as we understand it.</P>

      <P>The Minister and his officials must have spent a considerable time on the preparation of his opening speech.  He went to tremendous lengths to justify the main proposals in the Bill.  He put so much preparation and research into it that one wonders whether this was done prior to the Government changing their minds on Parts IX and X, or afterwards.  If this work was undertaken prior to the publication of the amendments, it was so much wasted effort.  It demonstrates to me that it was public opinion, through the press, speeches and consultations, that induced the Minister to make these changes, which the House welcomes.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin wondered if a Catholic social teacher had been consulted, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands assured him that a Minister for Social Welfare in Germany, who was in fact a Catholic, had been consulted.  I do not think there was any necessity to say that.  The Minister went back even to the Book of Numbers in justification for some of the proposals included in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Where would you get better than Moses?  The Minister quoted the Daughters of Salphaad making an appeal to Moses and claiming the right of succession to their father.  The Minister also invoked the Constitution in justification of the major proposals in regard to the making of wills.  I take no objection to that.  The length to which the Minister has gone to justify his proposals <Col N="411" /> emphasises the strong feeling there has been, and still is, with regard to the main proposals in the Bill.  There has been much public controversy.  As it is essentially a Committee Stage Bill, plenty of amendments will be made.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy MacEoin, I find myself at a disadvantage.  This is a lawyers' Bill.  I do not mean to give the impression it has been created merely for the benefit of lawyers, but it is a Bill they can interpret more easily than Deputy MacEoin or I, if he will forgive me.  I had better make the usual complaint about the parliamentary draftsman.  Is it possible to get Bills of this kind into simpler language?  I know one cannot get Bills like this in words of one or two syllables.  Admittedly, the White Paper was of tremendous advantage, but it was not possible for it to give the whole picture and describe the many changes proposed in respect of wills generally or to make clear the major new proposals now contained in the amendments.  It is extremely difficult, especially when one finds Latin phrases.  I do not know why these phrases are still used.  Some of them, by reason of the elementary knowledge we may have of Latin, come easily to us.  But it is high time we got rid of these Latin tags and put these phrases into English.  I do not know the reason for the Latin.  It certainly confuses&mdash;maybe it is meant to&mdash;the ordinary layman dealing with legal matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I do not think I should be put to the trouble of having to go to the dictionary in connection with a Bill introduced here. The Minister anticipated that the Bill would become an Act by 1st January, 1965.  I am glad he said in his speech that he now hopes it will come into operation on 1st January, 1966.  I trust that is an indication of the attitude the Minister will maintain in this House in dealing with this Bill.  Even from the speeches today, it must be obvious to him that this is not a political Bill.  There are no kudos for the Labour Party in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> While I may preface my remarks by congratulating the Minister on his appointment to the Ministry and on his initial appearance here on a major measure, I think he could set an example to Ministers at present holding office by being a little more liberal and generous when it comes to a Bill of this kind.  If we are discussing the turnover tax, let us eat one another like gentlemen in our opposition to it or support for it; but this is not the sort of Bill that should engender any hostility between any of the three Parties in the House.  Therefore, the Minister should determine to be receptive to any genuine and sincere proposals made by this Party, Fine Gael and particularly by members of his own Party.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether they are unusual or not but they always seem to be very dead when it comes to the Committee Stage of any Bill.  I can appreciate that they do not want to appear to be stepping away from the Party line, but this is a Bill where the Minister has little or nothing to lose. In a delicate matter such as this, the Minister should be determined to allow the House to make this the Bill the House and the country want, not what he wants or what the former Minister wants, or even what the Government want.  The Minister must appreciate the fact that we represent a considerable number of people.  We, in the Opposition, represent, let us say, one-half of the people.  I do not say that Fianna Fáil have any sinister motive in introducing this Bill but I do not think they should, in this instance particularly, appear to want to shove their opinions down the necks of the Irish people on a very delicate matter such as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I must say that in the Bill as we now have it, apart from the amendments that have been announced by the Minister for Justice, the former Minister for Justice seemed to have little regard for the commonsense of the Irish people.  They might have had to accept it by reason <Col N="413" /> of the fact that it might have been passed by a majority, by those who were on the Government side of the House, but I think they would have resented bitterly the strong conditions and the very direct conditions that were to be laid down for the making of a will.</P>
      <P>I think I am right in assuming, as Deputy O'Higgins said and as the Minister said, that this is legislation for a small minority.  He says it is necessary legislation for a small minority.  It should be said and repeated in speeches on the Second Reading that it is not typical of the Irish people not to make adequate provision for their wives and for their children.  Therefore, it is right for us from all Parties to declare that this is no reflection at all on the vast majority of the Irish people but that the proposals contained in this Bill are to ensure that a very small minority will do what we think they should be required to do, that is, to make provision for their wives and for their dependent children.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that as far as I and my Party are concerned we cannot be very positive in our opinions on many of these sections because if one were to deal with the whole Bill in a Second Reading speech, it would take any of us hours to give our views, to churn the problems over in our minds and then to arrive at a solution.  That has to await the Committee Stage.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned, we will make up our minds on the various proposals as they come up on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has suggested certain amendments here in respect of the making of wills and the provision for wives and dependent children.  One-half of my mind says it is the right of every man to decide in making his will how he will dispose of his property or of whatever money he has&mdash;I suppose that is the first thing that springs to one's mind in considering a measure such as this&mdash;but, there immediately springs to one's mind the undoubted fact that, if a man does not provide for his wife and for his <Col N="414" /> dependants, there should be some regulations, some law, some authority to ensure that he will.</P>
    <P>I certainly do not say that the first proposal of the Minister in respect of the making of wills was proper and correct or acceptable to the Irish people.  I am not prepared to say yet that his second proposal, as it is worded, is acceptable to me and to the people whom I know.  Therefore, within Committee, I trust that with the combined wisdom or, if you like, experience of the members of this House we can evolve some sort of system to ensure (1) that a man will have the greatest possible freedom in the disposal of his money and (2) that in the disposal of it, there will be adequate provision for his wife and dependent children.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this commends itself to the Minister or not but I agree with the members of the Fine Gael Party who have spoken in this debate that it would have been far better if the Minister had brought in an entirely new Bill because people, when they come to consider this Bill, will not be thinking in terms of Parts I to VIII.  They will be concerned with Parts IX and X particularly. That is the whole Bill to them and it is rather a hotch-potch merely to amend the Bill by changing the main provisions and the provisions about which people are concerned.  They believe that these are the only provisions that are in the Bill.  The rest are necessary and welcome improvements. For that reason, it might have been better if the Minister had brought in a new Bill.  However, maybe it is too late for that.</P>

      <P>If the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party vote against it, I do not think our attitude should be changed by reason of the fact that we did not get our way in this but I do think it would have been better if the Bill had been scrapped and a new Bill brought in.  I do not know if it commends itself to the Minister or even to the members of the Fine Gael Party, but I think it might be a good idea if this Bill were submitted to a Select Committee of the House.  I do not want to denigrate the efforts of those who attend here in Committee.  We have had examples in the past of extremely good work being done expeditiously on the Companies Bill and the Electoral Law Reform Bill and perhaps the Minister and the Fine Gael Party would consider the suggestion that we put forward, in any case, that this Bill be committed to a Select Committee of the House for detailed examination and, again, on the assumption that there is an open and receptive mind on the part of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>Even though my notes include references to sections of the Bill, I do not want to take up the time of the House by going into these matters because this is a Committee Bill, whether it is dealt with in the House or by a Committee appointed by the House.  As Deputy O'Higgins said, three-fourths of the Bill represents acceptable, very desirable improvements&mdash;there may be changes needed here and there&mdash;and a certain amount of codification of the law and, for that, the Bill is welcome but my welcome for the Bill is not a 100 per cent welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the main proposals in the Bill are concerned, we will give our point of view here in discussion, and if the Minister is receptive and accepts our point of view or part of our point of view, combined with that of other members of the House, particularly of his own Party, I do not think he will have much trouble.  However, it is <Col N="416" /> essential that this Bill be approached with an open mind by all Parties in the House, particularly by the Minister, in order to ensure that we will, in fact, get a Bill that the vast majority of the Irish people will accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish has put very clearly and very forcibly what is undoubtedly true about this Bill, that it is, first, from, if you like, a technical point of view in the House, a Committee Stage Bill and, secondly, a Bill which affects the vast majority of the people in a very special and intimate way and that, therefore, if the House is to deal effectively with it, that dealing will take place on Committee Stage, and the Minister will maintain an open mind and will listen to any sensible suggestion from any part of the House.  It is because I know the Minister has an open mind and is anxious to get the benefit of any suggestions available in the House that I am speaking on this and want to question one or two provisions in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister's approach is that this Bill to be effective must be generally acceptable to the House and to the Irish people and that there can be no question of trying to ram the Bill through.  I have no doubt that that is the Minister's approach and that that is the kind of Bill we shall get.  Unfortunately&mdash;I think Deputy Corish made some reference to this fact&mdash;the Bill has been seen out of perspective because two parts of it which led to considerable discussion in the newspapers and otherwise appear to most people to be the only provisions or the only important provisions in the Bill.  But this, of course, is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, in my opinion, represents a further advance in the programme of law reform which has been undertaken by this Government, the ultimate objective of which is to ensure that the laws of this country, those which have been enacted by Oireachtas Éireann, are in keeping with the needs of this country in the second half of the twentieth century and are enlightened by an approach to social justice which <Col N="417" /> did not exist at the time that many of our existing laws were passed and which we have inherited from the British Parliament.  The Bill is doing a most important job in getting rid of old statutes, in not re-enacting those of their provisions which are not appropriate to our present requirements, and in introducing new provisions which are appropriate to our present requirements.</P>
    <P>It is also from a lawyer's point of view a considerable advance to have the law relating to the succession to property of all kinds contained in a consolidated measure.  It may appear that this last point is one of interest only to lawyers, but this is not so. While it makes life easier for them ultimately, it contributes to the benefit of their clients who constitute all of our people, sooner or later.  If the lawyer can do his work more efficiently and more expeditiously, this is to the benefit of his clients.  If our programme of law reform enables this to be done, if it does not ultimately result in the reduction of legal costs, it certainly will help to keep them from rising in so far as we are making it possible for lawyers to be more efficient.  For that reason also I welcome the steps being taken in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on some of the principles involved in the Bill. First, it is proposed to abolish the descent of real property to the heir-at-law. This is a reform which is long overdue.  Perhaps I might illustrate the necessity for it to somebody who is not familiar with what is involved by mentioning a case with which I am familiar.  A man purchased a plot on which to build a house.  It so happened that he had to purchase a plot from two different vendors in order to get the actual site he wanted for his house. He did it and built his house.  He subsequently discovered that, because one of the sites which he had purchased was a leasehold property and the other was a freehold, the dividing line was running through his kitchen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Col N="418" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This could not be overcome by any lawyer.  You buy what you get.  You cannot convert a leasehold into a freehold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The lawyer knew what he was doing but the point is that this man found himself in the position under the existing law that if he did not make a will, portion of his kitchen would descend to his heir-at-law and the remainder of his house would descend to his wife and children.  I suppose this is an extreme case but it illustrates one of the reforms that is long overdue.  This is the kind of thing that should not happen.  We cannot, of course, overtake centuries in a matter of a few years but getting rid of some of these anomalies is another reason why I welcome this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 37 is one on which I would ask the Minister to think carefully, to listen to the comments from all sides and weigh up the balance, because there is a balance to be weighed in this regard.  This is the section which is aimed at providing machinery to enable people dealing with small estates to obtain grants of probate or administration at low cost and this is a very laudable objective.  Let me say as a lawyer I do not wish ever to adopt a Luddite approach to law reform.  If it can be shown that reform of the law will improve the situation for the mass of the people and if, incidentally, the condition of the lawyer is being disimproved, this is too bad.  It is one of the prices the lawyers must pay, and I would certainly never attempt to defend or oppose any proposed reform on the ground that it would interfere with the rights or the ability of any lawyer to earn a living.  However, in this case I do think the Minister ought to consider whether what is proposed would not&mdash;apart from practical difficulties, and there are practical difficulties which I am sure will be pointed out to him on Committee Stage&mdash;result in less efficiency than the <Col N="419" /> present system, and perhaps greater cost.</P>
    <P>It is probably impossible to gauge any way accurately how much this provision will cost to administer or to gauge how much the same facilities being provided through the legal profession at present are costing.  I do not know how close one can go to this but unless one can put forward a very strong case to show that the proposals will be an improvement on the present position by way of efficiency and expedition and by way of cost, then the present situation should be allowed to remain.  The onus for changing the present law lies on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite my doubts about the necessity for the new provisions, I must admit that the existing provisions are not any real safeguard against people who set out to commit a fraud in connection with a will.  We know that from experience.  That is why I say the Minister will hear many views expressed pro and con and he will have to weigh up the feeling of the House.  It is, I suppose, a technical point more than anything else but there may be people in the House who can contribute something of substance. <Col N="422" /> I freely admit I am not contributing anything of substance on this particular point, but there may be some who will and, if they do, I have no doubt the Minister will take their views into account.</P>
      <P>I want to give a special welcome to section 84 which provides that a will is not revoked by a subsequent marriage if the will has been made in contemplation of that marriage.  This provision is long overdue.  I have always considered it a grave injustice that a will should be revoked in such circumstances.  On the one hand, the testator was obliged to make another will if he got married again but, in many cases, the testator was not aware of that provision and did not make another will.  Very often injustice was committed as a result.  For that reason I welcome this provision.  It represents a considerable advance.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the provision of section 89 providing that extrinsic evidence will be admissible in the construction of a will.  The existing law has always been unsatisfactory and unrealistic in this regard.  It seems to have been framed in a foolish endeavour to be consistent.  Arguments could be made for excluding extrinsic evidence in regard to certain matters, such as the construction of a contract or an Act of Parliament, but these are very different matters from a will and a will should not be dealt with on this allegedly consistent basis because it just does not work out in practice. The fact that there is a number of exceptions under the present law to this rule proves that the existing law is not geared to the requirements of the situation.  For that reason the reform proposed in section 89 is more than welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to welcome Part VIII of the Bill which will enable us to adhere to the Hague Convention on the conflict of laws relating to the form of testamentary dispositions.  If we can adhere to this Convention that in itself is a very good thing because it will mean that our law will conform to that of a number of European countries, or theirs will conform to ours, whichever way you like to put it. It is the recognition of our common <Col N="423" /> heritage in Europe.  It is bringing us into line with twentieth century Europe, which is where we should be. Apart from the inherent advantage in this it is also a considerable advantage from the point of view of the reputation of this country in Europe because it will be seen that we are taking active steps to ensure adherence to these Conventions and to the enabling of the European concept to be applied as between us and other European countries in a way which is more obvious in relation to law than it is in any other field.  The scope for cooperation is wider in the field of law than anywhere else.  I am very glad to say that under this Bill we are taking another step forward in this regard.</P>
    <P>The amendments to the original Bill which have been announced by the Minister are, in my opinion, a very considerable improvement.  I am not sure whether the working out of their actual details will result in further amendments coming before the House, but I have no doubt the Minister will be prepared to consider any amendments put forward.  He has made clear what the line of the amendments will be.  It seems to me the principle he is following is an excellent one, because he is dealing with one of the problems with which it was intended to deal, that is, the inofficious will.  He is providing sufficient flexibility to enable the average Irish testator to make his will in the way he wants to, and in the way he always made it. Some play has been made on what has happened in regard to this Bill, but I do not have to put forward arguments to show that it is really a Committee Stage Bill.  No one could have made that case better than Deputy Corish here tonight.  He made it perfectly clear that this is a genuine non-political, non-Party, Committee Stage Bill, and I could not agree with him more.  I do not think there is any real advantage, political or otherwise, to be gained by anyone who tries to suggest anything else.</P>
    <P>As originally circulated, the Bill was accompanied by an invitation from the then Minister to all interested persons <Col N="424" /> to put forward their views.  There was a clear recognition of the fact that this was a Bill which would intimately affect most of the people of the country, that it was non-Party, non-political, and that the widest possible measure of agreement in the country and the House was necessary, if the Bill were to be effective.  That was recognised by the then Minister in the statement he made.  Like many other people, I disapproved of some of the proposals in the Bill, but I was not in the least worried about the outcome.  I had no fear that the Minister would attempt to have everything follow his line, or that there would be inflexibility.  He made it perfectly clear that he was inviting suggestions, comments and constructive criticism.  Some months ago I appeared on a certain television programme on which these questions were put to me, and I made the very same observations.  I ended by saying I had no doubt that when Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann were finished with the Bill, it would be one for which there would be the widest possible acceptance in the country.  I had no doubt about that then, and I have no doubt about it now.</P>
    <P>It seems good to me in dealing with a Bill of this nature to adopt the procedure&mdash;I do not know whether it is new; I am not long enough in politics to know whether it is a new approach but I welcome it as it seems to me to be democracy in action&mdash; of getting the views of people all over the country, accepting them when they make sense, and putting down amendments. I grant the Fine Gael Party that there is a grave temptation to try to make something of it.  They succumbed to that temptation, but we do not hold it against them.  Perhaps if we were in their circumstances we might have succumbed too, but that does not mean that we can forget the actual facts of the situation.  It does not mean that we must not make clear what has happened, that is, that we have seen democracy in action in regard to the Succession Bill.  That is something of which we can all be proud, and perhaps some time later when this Bill is an Act and Fine Gael <Col N="425" /> have stopped trying to milk it for whatever capital they think is in it, we will see Deputy Dillon holding up this procedure as an example of how Irish democracy can work.  When he does I hope I will be able to say: &ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to pay tribute to the former Minister for Justice, now Minister for Agriculture.  I do not want to wander from the matter before us except to refer to the very considerable programme of law reform which he brought before the House, and the very energetic way he dealt with it.  I regard this Bill as a very considerable social advance because it contains a recognition of the position of a wife, which recognition I think has not been granted in our legislation heretofore&mdash; recognition of the wife as a partner who contributes to the marriage which is a partnership equally with the husband, and of her position as a consequence.  That is a very considerable social advance, in my opinion, and I want to pay tribute to the former Minister for Justice for having incorporated that whole basic approach in this Succession Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Colley must begin to learn that he is a junior member of the Government and that it is not good enough for him to get up here and say the Minister for Justice with whom he is serving is a bit daft. That does not work.  The Government come before Dáil Éireann as a unit, or they ought to, and not as a chaotic mess as they in fact are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The words I used were: &ldquo;a chaotic mess as they in fact are&rdquo;. Those who are not leaving the sinking ship are steering it in circles.  The fact is that this Minister is erecting a smoke-screen to cover the retreat of his predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of this is simple.  A motion was put down in this House about two years ago in the names of <Col N="426" /> Deputy M. J. O'Higgins and Deputy Ryan pointing out that the law relating to wills required some degree of reform in that there existed a possibility of capricious wills, depriving widows or dependent children of some substance under the testamentary dispositions of the husbands.  That was accepted by the House.  There was no division.  I would not deal any further with the background if Deputy Colley had not indulged in the customary backbencher gambit of saying: &ldquo;Molaim an tAire thar cheann an méid oibre a chuir sé sa Bhille seo&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am so sick of listening to Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party who know no more Irish than that, saying that, that I get weary when I hear the Parliamentary Secretary who speaks Irish very well translating that tag into English, and saying he must pay tribute to the former Minister for Justice for his marvellous programme of law reform. The plain fact is that there was set up in the Department of Justice a small group of civil servants, under one civil servant who has a yen for this kind of work, and a series of perfectly obvious Bills were presented to the Minister for Justice so excellently drafted that they were brought before the House, gave rise to no controversy, and passed rapidly into law.</P>
    <P>Then he got lazy.  When the same Committee produced this Bill, they submitted it to him and he was too lazy to read it.  He was too lazy to do his homework.  He went off to the Government with the Bill and they were also too lazy to do their homework.  This Bill was issued on the authority of an Irish Government, none of the members of which knew what it contained. That is a grave situation.  I could have understood it if the former Minister for Justice had said that this was a complex aspect of the law, that this was a long and detailed Bill and that these were the views of the Government on it, that he would like these views to be published as a White Paper with tentative suggestions for law reform, that he would submit these views to the Incorporated Law Society, the Bar Council, the NFA, the Irish Countrywomen's Association and anybody else who <Col N="427" /> asked for a copy, that he would invite all and sundry to send him their views on them and, that done, he would review the whole question and see if the White Paper gave rise to any serious <i>malaise</i> in the country, or any serious objection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <P>This Bill we have is what should have gone out as a White Paper.  If it had, then coherent proposals could have been made to the Government for the rectification of what ought to be a truly non-controversial Bill.  Dáil Éireann is now being asked to discuss the principle of a Bill when the Minister responsible for it says that he repudiates it and his Parliamentary Secretary says that he has not repudiated it half enough.  It is a most undignified situation in which Dáil Éireann finds itself and I defy any Deputy intelligently to discuss the Bill as we have it now.  We have in the Minister's White Paper a whole series of new amendments.  He has announced in his speech four additional amendments and the Parliamentary Secretary has secured assent from him for two further amendments.</P>

      <P>Now I am expected to discuss the principles of a Government Bill put before the House in this way. If that is not chaotic confusion, as Deputy Seán Flanagan said to another Minister recently, I do not know what is.  I have a certain sympathy with the present Minister because he is being used as a kind of a sheet with which to cover the Minister for Agriculture and his golden eggs but this is a bad thing for the House.  I invite the Minister to do the sensible thing, that is, to say that, as the Bill obviously needs extensive amendment and as it is obvious that what he first had in mind does not meet the wishes of the majority of the people, he is prepared to withdraw the Bill.  He should say that he would make whatever amendments <Col N="428" /> are necessary and then resubmit the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All the fundamental parts are gone.  The machinery sections, which are not controversial, remain, but Parts IX and X of the Bill are blown out of the ground.  It has now been announced that the important section dealing with the making of wills is to be dropped.  The Parliamentary Secretary came in here and he did not know the Minister's proposals; he has now dropped the practice which has been in operation for years in this country in which a small estate could be administered by a customs officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We had one in Ballaghaderreen until they took him away. In some parts of the country, they are more accessible than in others.  That system was in operation for years, although in some places people did not avail of it very much.  However, it was availed of in the case of some small estates.  The Minister has now introduced a new principle, that is, to introduce local probate registries approximately on a county basis and the county registrars will have a wide discretion to help and guide persons in this procedure.  But that is not in the Bill.  It was announced so casually that the Parliamentary Secretary, who was so anxious to help, told the Minister that this was something that ought to be looked into, only to <Col N="429" /> be told that it was no longer proposed. I like the Parliamentary Secretary.  I think he is a good Deputy and all of us in the early stages of our official careers have put a foot wrong but it is not right that we should find two members of the one Government contradicting each other on the Front Bench. That is the fault of the Minister for Justice in trying to push through the House a Bill in such a complex manner.  If we take the original Bill and superimpose on it the White Paper, the Minister's speech today and the amendments he has indicated he intends to make, you may get some kind of mosaic of what may be in the Minister's mind but that is not the Bill.</P>
      <P>I think Parliament is a system which works well, a system to which Governments, Ministers and Deputies should show deference and I do not think that Parliament will be promoted in the eyes of the people as a reasonable and sensible legislative system as a result of the manner in which this Bill has been presented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not right to <Col N="430" /> announce in advance that you have abandoned the principles of the Bill but you do not propose to withdraw it.  You should submit it to the House in some form which the House can read and understand.  The Minister knows that just as well as I do.  I will record then a very emphatic proposal against this House being asked to discuss the principles of a Bill which is in substance withdrawn.  I agree with Deputy Colley, the Parliamentary Secretary.  I agree that the proposal to abolish the ceremonial procedure in the making of wills is a retrograde and an improvident proposal.</P>
      <P>There are very many wills of a fraudulent character but not all wills are so.  There is no doubt whatever that the solemn procedure of a testator signing his will in the presence of two witnesses who sign it in the presence of each other does lend a certain solemnity to the procedure which removes or, certainly, mitigates, the temptation to people, actuated by avarice, to make false wills or to falsify them.</P>
      <P>I can see the argument proceeding on both sides of this case but as yet I have not been able to think of any persuasive argument which could be advanced for abolishing the old system and substituting the relatively easy procedure which was envisaged in the first draft of this Bill.  I believe the Minister himself now recognises that in seeking to honour the principle of protecting widows and dependent children from capricious wills he has gone too far.  He would like to lay down a whole set of rigid rules controlling the disposition of property.  It is quite intolerable in a way in our social circumstances but that does not close the eyes of many of us to the fact that capricious wills can be a real and tragic disaster for a family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember in my own personal experience a perfectly rational man, whom I could not imagine making the type of will he made, in which he left all his property to his children and nothing to his wife at all.  She was confident that she had the wherewithal to rear her family but suddenly found she had not the price of a postage <Col N="431" /> stamp.  All her property was in trust for the benefit of the children.  I do not know whether that was due to the incompetence of a solicitor or to the man himself.  That is something which is hard to understand.</P>
    <P>We all know of cases in which a man takes up with a woman and leaves his property to her.  He leaves his wife and children unprovided for.  Those are very rare cases but they are sufficiently frequent, I think, to require provision to be made to prevent their recurrence.  I believe the Minister for Justice should not have gone to the extreme which is proposed in Part IV of this Bill.  Mind you, the Fianna Fáil Party are very ready to pour buckets of whitewash over themselves and weep crocodile tears for what they have done.  The statement of the Minister for Justice, prior to his migration to the Department of Agriculture, gave us to understand that he seemed to be pretty rigid in his view that this was a great thing he was going to leave to posterity whereby to judge him.  It is gratifying that the attitude excited in the country amongst responsible people everywhere has been responsible for the attitude which the present Minister for Justice is now adopting.</P>
    <P>I want to make this matter clear. There is a tendency developing in this House to assume that this is a lawyers' Bill.  It is not a lawyers' Bill.  It is a Bill which affects the daily life of individual citizens, great and small, rich and poor.  I am not really deeply interested in the convenience of the solicitors.  They are well paid to take the necessary steps to carry out their clients' instructions.  Mind you, I hope the Labour Party will not fall into the error of saying this is a lawyers' Bill and that we should send it to a Special Committee.</P>

      <P>It is a very dangerous proposal to send this Bill upstairs to a Special Committee because it is not an easy Bill to evaluate.  It is a Bill in which technicians can very quickly make their views prevail if there are not sufficient ordinary men and women to say: &ldquo;We do not give a fiddle-de-dee for these doctrines which you declare sacrosanct.  We think it is bad to do this and we do not want to have it done.&rdquo;  Therefore, I cannot share the views of the Leader of the Labour Party that this is a Bill eminently suited for a Special Committee. It is quite true there are a number of technical Bills dealing with drainage, local government and other technical matters of that nature which can very often, with advantage, be sent to a Special Committee.  This is a Bill relating to the making of wills in which the least important party involved is the lawyer who drafts the wills.  The testators and beneficiaries are much more important and their voices ought to be heard with respect when we come to consider the details of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Colley, the Parliamentary Secretary, has gone because he had fears for the justification and evaluation of the distinction between realty and personalty. He told us a story of a man who bought his holding on a fee simple and found half his kitchen went to his legal heirs and the other half was distributed, as to one-third to the widow and two-thirds to the remaining children.  That reminds me of when the Government bought a site in Nigeria for £65,000 and then discovered it was on shifting sand and you could not build anything.  The dilemma of that gentleman was due to the fact that he did not have his solicitor draw up the will in a proper manner and not have one-third fee simple, one-third leasehold.  I have known of a case in which people thought they were buying fee simple and discovered <Col N="433" /> there were intolerable leases.  Those cases take place in the best regulated households but they do not represent the law.  People should know what they want to buy and should buy what they intend to buy.  If they build a house they are not building a house with theories attaching thereto nor should they build a house on shifting sand.  Only Fianna Fáil Governments and improvident testators do that kind of thing.</P>
      <P>In regard to section 84, I want to invite the House to consider what I have been describing before as Chesterton's law.  I do not know the origin of the theory that if you make a will and subsequently get married, the solicitor must chase you on your honeymoon all over the country to sign your will again before he lets you out of his sight.  It has happened to one or other of us.  There is always something grisly in seeing an unfortunate bridegroom re-executing his will after having signed the marriage register.</P>
      <P>I do not know the history of that.  I do not know how it grew up but before we casually abolish it by a short section of the Will Act as it is, I would like to hear that history.  G.K. Chesterton once said our society is full of strange archaic observances which one is tempted at first glance to sweep away as being incompetent, but never yield to that temptation, he said, until you first find out what made our forefathers ask for that observance.  It was because they were not fools, and they erected that observance for allaying some evil. They recognised the evil that then existed.  They erected the observance to allay it and the observance has been so successful that we have forgotten what the evil was.  Have we any reason to be assured that, if we sweep away what looks like an archaic observance, this evil will not re-manifest itself and we may not have the intelligence our grandfathers and great-grandfathers had to devise the appropriate remedy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would gladly concede that in the Statute Book there are archaicisms which might with advantage be removed today but somebody for some reason must have made this odd provision that a will made prior to marriage <Col N="434" /> ceases to be vaid after marriage. It is hard to see the obvious explanation of it.  Since it was done, there must be some reason for it.  Some abuse must have existed which this was designed to correct.  If we know the abuse and if we are now satisfied that that abuse could no longer arise in the society in which we live, with superior methods of communication and superior methods of recording and so on, well and good, we could sweep it away.  But I should like to be told why it was first instituted, and why should it now be decided to sweep it away before accepting blindly that it should be so disposed of.</P>
    <P>I should like to be in a position to discuss this Bill constructively, make suggestions and ask and raise queries without trying to obstruct the progress of the Bill through the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that it is expedient to pursue some of the topics raised by Deputy Colley but he did elect to go through one or two sections of the Bill.  Section 89 says:</P>
      <P>Extrinsic evidence shall be admissible to assist in the construction of, or to explain any contradiction in, a will.</P>
      <P>That would seem superficially a most reasonable proposal.  Ninety-nine per cent of average men would say that this is a most laudable reform and is long overdue.  I would ask them to pause and consider.  There has grown up over the years a pretty comprehensive rule of interpretation applicable to wills, one being that they are taken to speak from the date of the testator's death.  There are a variety of other technical rules, all well known to competent lawyers.  The average testator goes in to a competent lawyer and he explains what he wants done. This is cast by a competent lawyer into the language long accepted in the interpretation of wills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That competent lawyer proceeds to give expression to the testator's intention in the language which has been repeatedly tested in court.  Take any member of this House who sits down with a sheet of notepaper and writes on that sheet of notepaper in language he believes to be as clear as crystal what he wants done and let him get it witnessed.  The correct procedure is adopted to make it a valid will but <Col N="436" /> God knows what a High Court judge will declare that to mean by the time he has had access to extrinsic evidence.</P>
    <P>That is not all.  We know, as regards probate, any High Court judge in this country can set himself the task of determining by the examination of extrinsic evidence what a testator meant.  I venture to say if you took the whole High Court bench of this country, you would not find two judges of that bench who would give the same meaning to the same will after they heard extrinsic evidence.  I think that in matters of this kind the nearer you can get to certainty and to uniformity the better: the nearer we can reach the point of saying that no matter what judge is sitting on what bench the meaning of the words used in this instrument has long been interpreted on good advice, the better. Here is something full of danger.</P>
    <P>I am open to conviction.  Maybe I am wrong, but I sound this note of warning.  Most ordinary, rational people say this is a most obvious reform.  We have heard of the most extraordinary interpretations being given to wills and of wills which appear to us perfectly clearly to say one thing being held by the courts to say another.  We have to bear in mind that if the testator is made to say in the language of wills something other than he meant, that is due to the incompetence of the solicitor he had and not to the form of the language to which the courts have attached certain specific meanings.</P>
    <P>If we once depart from that&mdash;there are as many interpretations of wills as there are judges on the Bench&mdash;it will create a queer situation.  You can find two wills in virtual identical terminology. In Court No. 1 the judge declares it to mean one thing and in Court No. 4 the judge declares it the direct opposite.  Both have found themselves entitled to have acceptance of evidence.  I think I can sum it up by saying that the main dictum in the matter of wills is to approach as nearly as possible to objective truth.</P>
    <P>Any more approximation to the <Col N="437" /> objective truth than the evidence of human beings I think it would be hard to find.  It is the truth as the witness saw it and we can all see a different truth, honestly, on the same set of facts.  In regard to section 89, I would enter a <i>caveat:</i> come as near to objective truth as possible.  Extrinsic evidence can lead us down the strangest paths.  Deputy Colley, the Parliamentary Secretary, turned to section 103 which deals with the making of wills on board ships or aircraft.  Every time I hear the Minister for Justice having the impudence to tell me to do my home work! I have done my home work.</P>

      <P>I deprecate most strongly the procedure adopted in relation to this Bill. I still cherish the hope that the Minister may see the force of the contention I have advanced.  The proper course is to produce a new Bill.  If he does, I agree with other Deputies that there should not arise in connection with the consideration of such a Bill any matter about which there would be any political contention.  I recognise what I imagine Deputies on all sides recognise, that there is scope for honest difference of opinion as to what is the best machinery to provide against the rare capricious will which would do cruel injustice to a widow or dependent children.  I believe between our joint wisdom we can find a workable and equitable solution to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people will favour strongly <Col N="441" /> the British device which appears to have worked well, that is if the will appears to be capricious, it can be referred by the widow and the children to the High Court for determination as to what would be equitable and just. Others will take the view that there should be, in the event of a will being deemed to be capricious, some automatic fractionation of the estate, each fraction appropriated to a different section of the family.  That is a matter we could argue rationally and intelligently.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I have found myself in complete sympathy with both sides.  In theory, I would favour the reference to the High Court judge but when you come to examine that in practice and realise that you may get seven different interpretations from seven different judges&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;you may find yourself in a very embarrassing situation. I do not know that the law of testacy has not operated fairly equitably. There has been the one-third to the widow and two-thirds to the children but I think it is far too rigid when you are dealing with the general testamentary capacity of a rational testator.  What I am groping towards is some standard which would declare a will to be capricious whereupon some mandatory minimal provision would become operative for the spouse and the dependent children.  But I want to sound one note of warning.  Take the case of the parent who is deliberately deciding not to make provision for a particular child.  Now, he may have made ample provision during his life and made up his mind that, having done the best he could for that child, the child, the boy or girl, is incorrigible and he intends to do no more.  Having given most careful thought to the whole business, he has resolved to declare that he is cutting the child off with a shilling.  He may have said to his wife: &ldquo;you will have to provide for this boy now and see that he does not meet with disaster as he is being bereft of property; I am not going to give him any property <Col N="442" /> because it will be dissipated.&rdquo;  We are asking that he state in the will the grounds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very proper reform and it is evidence of the grave lack of thought on the part of a responsible Minister ever to have allowed it to be incorporated in the Bill.  It is his job.  It is the Minister's job to comb out the suggestions submitted by the civil servants attached to his Department who do their part of the job which is to put up ideas to him.  It is his duty as political head of the Department to interpret what is good and to accept or reject and then inform the Government that he was urged by his experts to put this view forward but he decided not to bring it to the Government because he did not approve of it.  This amendment is desirable but the fact that the proposal was first made without thinking and that the situation was created for a parent who, because of the failure of his child, cuts him off, that he was required to proclaim the reasons before the world is evidence of the very careless drafting of the Succession Bill as we first received it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will put our amendment to the House because we think the process of legislating this legislation can best be served by a new Bill which can then be calmly considered in Committee, if necessary re-committed, and treated as it ought to be treated, as a wholly noncontroversial piece of legislation.  In its present form it certainly is not that. <Col N="443" /> It is not only controversial but incomprehensible. It reflects gravely&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;gravely on the diligence and competence of the ex-Minister for Justice.  I pass no immediate stricture on the present Minister for Justice but he should be warned by the fact that his own junior colleague whom, I think, he will agree with me is an honest man, and a diligent Deputy, found himself, in discussing the Bill, in a dilemma not of his making but of the Minister's.  It is a dilemma in which every Deputy who takes an intelligent interest in this Bill will find himself unless the Minister presents a new Bill.  The end result may be the same but if the procedure which the Minister, in this exercise of face-saving, wishes to pursue for his Government, if we have a Committee Stage in which the Ministerial amendments are incorporated, then we ought thereafter to have a Recommittal and a Report Stage.</P>

So long as that document constitutes the basis of our discussions, we shall be in a continual sea of mystification and frustration. If the Minister really wanted a constructive approach to law reform, he would have a new Bill.  He could have avoided all this to-do today if he had come in at 3 o'clock and said: &ldquo;We might as well withdraw the Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question of whether or not the Bill is the type of Bill which should have been introduced is one which will be debated on the Committee Stage.  Again, it is rather a pity that the Bill, the second long Bill introduced in a short time in this House, was one which, no sooner had it been introduced, than Ministerial amendments started to pour in.  I grant that there has been a change of Ministers and that, I suppose, has produced a change of attitude to the Bill. However, we have had the Land Bill here for months on end.  Eventually we got through the Committee Stage <Col N="447" /> but at the last minute there came the really important motion in relation to the Land Bill in the form of an amendment. Will the same happen now in six months' time?  When this Bill has almost completed the Committee Stage, will the Minister get a brainwave and introduce something which will change the whole complexion of the Bill?</P>
      <P>As everybody seems to be agreed that this Bill is one which should have no political implications, is it not a pity that everybody here will approach it from a political point of view? Therefore we echo what Deputy Corish said earlier.  Why can the Bill not be submitted to a Select Committee&mdash; because eventually it will come back here?  I do not agree with the suggestion that the lawyers in the various Parties will be shouting in the Committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to see that Deputy Corry has rested from the battle tonight.  Otherwise we should not have the pleasure of hearing his sweet voice.  Quite a number of sections in the Bill commend themselves to everybody but there are a number which at present seem to be incomprehensible <Col N="448" /> to most people.  People will agree that the law in this country which allows any person to disown, as far as the division of his estate is concerned, the closest members of his family&mdash;maybe for a good reason or maybe for no reason at all&mdash;should be amended.  Most civilised countries have done this years ago.  That portion of the Bill seems to be quite good.  How the division is to take place is something we should be able to debate on Committee Stage and reach a final conclusion on.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister does not retain the section which proposes that the £500 be raised to £2,000 in the case of small estates which can be administered without going to law.  At present that administration is carried out by Customs and Exise officers, but it is almost non-existent because it is hard to find them.  I hope the Minister will appoint somebody who can be approached more easily for the purpose of having this done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Watch the lawyers on that and see if you want to send it to a Special Committee.  The Minister is thinking of the day he will be a lawyer again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has quoted the figures.  He says the present system is not being used.  The reason it is not being used is that it is not possible to get the Customs and Excise officers. I know people who travelled long distances to meet these people and found <Col N="449" /> that the officers were gone when they arrived.  All those complications can arise.  The Minister intends to have local officers available and, in addition, I hope it will be possible to do it with a central office in Dublin. Many people down the country can more easily get to Dublin than to some of these country towns.  That may not be appreciated by the lawyers but I think it will be appreciated generally. Whether or not it is right to bring up the limit I do not know, but it can be discussed.</P>
      <P>The original Bill suggested that a farm could be divided up into numerous small sections.  I think that is something the Minister for Lands would not agree to.  I think he would be perfectly right because that would not work.  The Minister for Justice was right in attempting to have it changed. The member of the family who has been settled, who has already left the household and who has got either some money or kind from the family when leaving, who has made himself independent by his own efforts, need not be included.  I think that is a good idea.</P>
      <P>I honestly believe that if this Bill is to do any good, the Minister will have to ensure we do not have a repetition of the Land Bill.  There are 129 sections in this Bill at present. I would like the Minister to assure us we will not find 129 Ministerial amendments before the Bill is finished. It is pretty complicated as it stands. There are some sections which do not seem to make any sense.  In his desire to improve the Bill as it goes along, the Minister could find himself in the situation in which his colleague, the Minister for Lands, found himself a few weeks ago&mdash;that he had so many Ministerial amendments, not to talk of amendments put in by other Deputies, that it was hard to recognise the Bill as the Bill originally introduced.</P>

      <P>The Bill was introduced as a result of a discussion in the House that something should be done to deal with the position of people dispossessed. Most of us were delighted when it was originally introduced but, when we saw the form of it, we felt it did not meet all we wanted.  The amendments the Minister proposes to <Col N="451" /> introduce will bring it much nearer what we hoped it would be.  The Minister announced four amendments, then two more and now a further one.  If this is only the start, we will see the amendments piling up until eventually we will have the same situation as the possessed.  Most of us were delighted Land Bill; it will be hard to recognise this Bill as the Bill originally introduced.</P>
