      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have provided valuable facilities and incentives to encourage the establishment and development of industries <Col N="213" /> in all areas.  It is for private enterprise to take advantage of these inducements and local interests should do their best to encourage private enterprise to set up industry in their own districts.  The Deputy may take it that any sound proposal that may be formulated by local or other interests for the establishment of industry in any area will be afforded all the assistance within my power.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate, however, that the decision as to the most suitable location for an industry must rest, ultimately, with the promoters who intend to invest their capital in the project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether any adaptation council has been set up for the motor vehicle assembly industry; whether there is any likelihood of the present quota protection for this industry being altered to tariff protection; and whether any progress has been made in plans for adaptation of the firms in this industry to meet any degree of greater competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The CIO did not recommend the setting up of an Adaptation Council for the motor assembly industry, and no Council has been set up.  A special Industry Committee was, however, established with the object, <i>inter alia,</i> of facilitating discussion between the industry and my Department in relation to problems which might arise out of the approach to free trade.</P>
      <P>In the special circumstances of this industry, it has been informed that the quota on motor vehicles would remain in existence unless and until some international obligation required that it be removed and replaced by a duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the possibility that the industry as a whole would have difficulty <Col N="214" /> in surviving in free trade conditions, I considered that the future of those involved in the industry might best be protected by the conversion of assembly factories to other manufacturing purposes providing equivalent employment, and I offered the industry that I would provide facilities for the importation of cars in an assembled condition to any assembler providing equivalent employment in this way.  I have recently reached agreement in principle with one assembly firm which has undertaken a new line of manufacture.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the failure of this company caused a certain amount of hardship and it was for the purposes of alleviating this that the Insurance Act, 1964, was passed.</P>
      <P>The Act provides that, in cases in which compensation is payable weekly under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, the High Court shall decide the amount which shall be payable out of the fund established under the Act.

In other cases the maximum percentage that may be advanced is 95 per cent.  Both these percentages are subject to the prescribed maximum loan limit of £2,250.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to, if the position is as the Deputy says.  However, it is true also that quite a large number of people do seek these loans, get them and as a result get their houses.  One would have to ask oneself how quite a number of them can get houses and not put down £500 or £600, while others say that unless they put down £500 or £600, they cannot get a house.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree the problem here is that the 95 per cent grant is made not on the basis of the actual price of the house but on the basis of the valuation placed upon the house by the Dublin Corporation valuer and that in a great many cases there is a wide discrepancy between the actual price paid for the house and the valuation placed upon it?  Would the Minister in those circumstances suggest to the Corporation that they might take a more liberal view in valuing these houses when they know what is the actual price being paid for them.  I admit at once you cannot bind yourself to accept any price however fantastic, but if the price is reasonable, the valuer should accept it as a closer guide line than it has been the practice to do heretofore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is probably a great deal in what Deputy Dillon has said but the administration of these moneys and these loans is the responsibility of the local authority.  The obligation is on them to determine what they regard as the value of the house for which a loan is being sought. So far as my own view is concerned, it is that where the valuation being placed on a house for the purpose of a loan is rather stringent in relation to the actual cost of the house, probably no great harm can be done by being a little more liberal without being unreasonably so.</P>

      <P>This is a matter to <Col N="224" /> which quite a few people have given a great deal of thought and, if I get proposals which prove that one-room flats will meet an existing need, and holding up the proposal would prevent a mitigation of existing circumstances, then it will not be held up in an effort to have two-roomed flats substituted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will explain why an inspector from his Department rejected a site offered to the Donegal County Council despite the fact that the engineering section of the county council had passed it as being a suitable building site and that the County Manager had initiated purchase proceedings by compulsory acquisition months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On 21st September last I confirmed a compulsory purchase order for the acquisition of six out of seven cottage sites scheduled in the order.  The remaining plot of land was omitted from my confirming order because I was advised that it was unsuitable in all respects as a site for a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister <Col N="225" /> appreciates that this lady&mdash;he knows her as well as I do&mdash;is very poor.  She applied for a house in August, 1961, and the county council, appreciating her difficulties, went out of their way to facilitate her.  The engineering section passed the site as suitable for a house.  Now, after three years, a member of the Minister's Department comes down and condemns the site. Surely this merits a better explanation than that the Minister has been informed that it is not a good building site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

I have gone very far into this matter of unsuitability and, in this particular case, I feel that, if there did not happen to be someone at the end of the line, like myself, to hold the baby, the site would not have been passed in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that <Col N="228" /> the Dublin County Council issue receipts for rates without specifying on the receipts the period in respect of which such rates were paid; and if he will have steps taken to ensure that in future all rates receipts state the periods for which payments were made.</P>

      <P>Spaces are provided on the particular form of rate receipt used by Dublin County Council to show how the money paid is allocated between &ldquo;arrears,&rdquo;&ldquo;first moiety current rate&rdquo; and &ldquo;second moiety current rate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When rates are paid direct to a rate collector, he invariably fills in the spaces on the receipt to show how the money is allocated.</P>
      <P>When rates are paid at the cash office of Dublin County Council the allocation of the money paid is not filled in on the spaces provided on the receipt.  The decision to omit these details from receipts issued at the cash office was taken by the county council officials to reduce pressure at the cash office, where approximately 50 per cent of the total rate collection is receipted, and to deal more speedily with the public attending there.</P>
      <P>This practice has been in operation for over five years and the officers of the county council favour its continuance for the convenience of the public.  I shall, however, have the matter discussed with them by an Inspector of my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the particular signs to which the Deputy refers are on the Leixlip road outside Maynooth. I understand that one (not two) of the signs was turned and has in fact been set right, but I am not aware that it was turned for any long period. I have already reminded local authorities of the importance of the proper maintenance of speed limit signs.  I do not think it necessary to issue a further general reminder to them at this stage. The matter will be borne in mind when the present review of speed limits on arterial roads is being put into effect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 30, 31 and 32 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many recommendations for the amendment of the Road Traffic (Speed Limits) Regulations, 1963, were received from technical committees throughout the country, including the technical committee for Dublin city <Col N="230" /> and county.  Examination of these recommendations, however, has revealed a lack of uniformity and a consequent need for further investigation.  In the time available it has been necessary for the present to limit this investigation to what are commonly known as the arterial routes.  It therefore covered routes, such as the Long Mile Road. It is hoped to have amending regulations affecting these routes made in the near future.  As neither Sarsfield Road nor the village of Rush is on an arterial route, they do not come within the present review.  They will, however, come up for consideration in a review of all other roads in towns and villages during next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the dangerous conditions, particularly on the Long Mile Road?  A number of school children come out on to that road and pedestrian wardens cannot possibly control the traffic.  Will the Minister use his influence with the Corporation to get the job of building that road under way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Long Mile Road is one of those which are, in fact, being dealt with presently.  I mentioned the others because, since they are not arterial roads, they may therefore be delayed some little time longer.  The Long Mile Road is being dealt with at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to section 88 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, under which the making of general bye-laws with regard to the duties of pedestrians is a matter for the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána in the first instance.  I understand that bye-laws under this section are being prepared by the Commissioner at the moment and will shortly be submitted to me for consideration.</P>
      <P>At present an approach to pedestrians is made by way of propaganda on the advantages of following such a rule on roads where footpaths are not provided.

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

Subsection (14) would apply to advertisements capable of being confused with traffic signs or which make traffic signs less visible to road users or which obstruct the view of road users so as to make the road dangerous to them.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is aware of the existence of a particular advertisement or particular advertisements causing confusion or danger to road users, I shall be glad to receive from him such details as will enable me to have the matter investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The determination of what counties or areas receive tourist road grants has been adhered to and has not been changed since the introduction of these grants.  To that degree I do not determine them but I probably could be said to determine the continuation of grants to those counties where they have operated for the past ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the progress there has been in the tourist industry in recent years and in view of the fact that some counties not already provided for have now become tourist counties, would the Minister, between now and the allocation of the grants generally, consider having a review of <Col N="234" /> the Twenty Six Counties to see whether those counties which did not heretofore receive these grants should now have them applied to them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the term &ldquo;tourist grant&rdquo; is rather a misnomer because it is only one of the considerations that were taken into consideration in the allocation of these grants to those counties to which the moneys have been paid for these years.  The congested areas came into it, as did the relative wealth or otherwise of particular counties and their ability to raise from their own funds the necessary money.  Then, particularly on the western seaboard, the existence of Gaeltacht areas to which approaches might be improved in order to increase tourism in these areas, were also given a certain weight, so that the name is rather misleading in that it is not strictly related only to tourism and the changing pattern and its increase might not indicate that a change would be necessary or advantageous&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my recent announcement as to the immediate steps proposed by the Government to meet the main recommendations in the Report of the Commission on Itinerancy.  These steps include the provision by local authorities, with the aid of generous State subsidies, of fully serviced camping sites for itinerants and the appointment of an advisory committee to advise on measures to promote the rehabilitation and absorption of itinerants into the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's intention that an appeal should merely be made to local authorities to provide serviced sites, or is there going to be an element of compulsion on the various local authorities to provide serviced sites throughout the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asking was it the Minister's intention to use compulsion or would just appeals be made to the local authorities?  If that is so, does he not see the danger that if one local authority provides serviced sites, they will get all the itinerants and I am afraid we are going to get them all in Dublin?  We have quite a number as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite a real difficulty in this matter.  The one thing I should say is that certain local authorities have indicated that if they did have the go-ahead for certain elementary requirements, they would go ahead with them as an interim emergency measure.  It is on that basis that I have said they may proceed with the provision of these first essential requirements.  I feel that the advisory council or committee which I have suggested may prove very useful in regard to such problems as the dispersal of these various facilities in different parts of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Corporation's request for a bridge order, referred to by the Deputy, was received in my Department on 6th December, 1961. The statutory report preliminary to a public inquiry was submitted in June, 1962.  Subsequently a number of questions, involving postponement of a decision on the application, were the subject of correspondence between the Corporation and my Department. When these questions were disposed of, my Department requested last March a detailed report on the traffic aspects of the application.  This was required because it was not evident that the traffic congestion at and in the vicinity of this bridge would be eliminated merely by replacing it with a larger structure and because, the present bridge being structurally sound, any public inquiry into the application for a bridge order must be mainly concerned with its merits in the context of traffic movement.  The Corporation have not accepted that such a report is necessary.  Since July last the Corporation have had available the services of an expert Traffic Consultant, and it has, therefore, been now suggested to them that the report already requested should be prepared as a matter of urgency by this consultant in order that the proposals for meeting present and future traffic requirements in the area may be based on the best planning and traffic advice available.</P>

      <P>Preliminary discussions took place last May between officers of my Department and officers of the British Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance on the possibility of reciprocal arrangements in regard to pensions. During these discussions, the question of the non-payment by the British authorities to persons living here of increases in their British retirement pensions was raised.  The problems involved in relation to the making of reciprocal arrangements are being studied on both sides and it is hoped to have further discussions at an early date.  It is not possible at this stage to say what the outcome will be.</P>

      <Col N="247" /> As intimated in my replies to the Deputy's previous questions on 3rd and 11th March last, the Ennis and Sweetman Estates (276 acres) and the Kennedy Estate (279 acres) did not vest in the Land Commission until 12th December and 7th June of last year.  The lands were let by public auction, the approximate letting prices per acre being £9.10.0 and £11.10.0 for grazing and conacre, respectively. Conacre lettings expired on 1st October, 1964 and grazing lettings will terminate on 1st December next.  It is hoped that schemes of division for these lands will be formulated by next Spring.</P>

    <P>NOTE: The particulars above relate to the main cable route between Dublin and Cork exchanges.  All the interruptions were partial, i.e., they affected some&mdash;not all&mdash;of the cable circuits in each case.  The effects of the interruptions on the service to callers were minimised by the use of alternative routes between the two cities.</P>

Murtagh, Rathmore, Aughnacliffe P.O., County Longford arising out of the death of her son Thomas in a road traffic accident; and if a greater sum was not justified in the circumstances of the case, particularly since the amount barely covers the expenses of the funeral and as Thomas was Mrs. Murtagh's chief support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that this sum of £60 does not cover the out-of-pocket expense or anything like it?  Is the Minister aware this woman had to travel at least three times to the Glen of Imaal where this unfortunate accident took place and that the only reason that she did not <Col N="264" /> proceed in court was that apparently there was contributory negligence on the part of the deceased boy?  A sum of £60 to the widowed mother of a boy killed on the road is not very great. When the Minister was paying anything, why only £60?

    <P>That whereas the Pawnbrokers Bill, 1963, was, on the 23rd day of June, 1964, passed by Dáil Éireann and was, on the 25th day of June, 1964, sent to Seanad Éireann, and <Col N="272" /> was, on the 1st day of July, 1964, rejected by Seanad Éireann,</P>
    <P>Now therefore Dáil Éireann, pursuant to section 1 of Article 23 of the Constitution, hereby resolves that the Pawnbrokers Bill, 1963, as passed by Dáil Éireann, be deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Pawnbrokers Bill, 1963, was passed by Dáil Éireann on 23rd June, 1964, and was sent to Seanad Éireann on 25th June.  The Seanad voted against giving the Bill a Second Reading and sent a message to this House stating that the Bill had been rejected.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances, under Article 23 of the Constitution, the Bill shall be deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, if Dáil Éireann so resolves within a period of 180 days, which runs in this instance from 23rd September, 1964.  Because of the importance of the provisions of this Bill I am seeking the adoption of this course and I believe it is proper that such a Resolution should be passed.  I am anxious that the provisions of the Bill be brought into operation as early as possible.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Minister for Justice should, as his first official act as such, take the action <Col N="273" /> which he has indicated in this motion. It is a little too ingenuous just to reel off the dates as he has done.  Anybody who takes the trouble to read the Report of the Seanad Debates of the 1st July, 1964 will see exactly what happened there on the Second Reading. The then Minister for Justice introduced the Bill with a speech of ordinary length during the course of which he was not once interrupted.  A Senator from the Opposition rose to speak on the Bill, following the Minister, but that Senator was interrupted no fewer than four times by the then Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;We have no objection.&rdquo; We in Fine Gael made it quite clear we had no objection but the Minister for Agriculture, in his then capacity as Minister for Justice, decided he was going to be just the steamroller and said: &ldquo;It will pass, just the same.&rdquo; I am sorry, as I said initially, that the new Minister for Justice should have lent himself in this motion to that attitude.  This could have been dealt with in the proper way by the Bill being sent back again to the Seanad and considered after the present Minister for Justice had dealt with it in the normal, courteous and polite way.  Instead of that, the motion is brought here for the deliberate purpose of ensuring that there can be no discussion on it in the other House. That, in my view, is discourtesy to the other House, which has arisen solely because of the bad temper of the present Minister for Agriculture, who was Minister for Justice at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>Some question was raised by Deputy O.J. Flanagan before we adjourned last night that the main proposals here are delegation of functions of examiners of title and they are designed for the purpose of expediting work in that <Col N="276" /> Department, mainly seeking items on the allocation of vendors' purchase money by the examination of title. That is the purpose of the section. There is, as Deputies will see, an appeal provided for by any aggrieved party but it is anticipated that this could considerably speed up the work rather than have to go before the Judicial Commissioner with all these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear what these matters are.  As I understand it, in relation to the draw from the Costs Fund, what will happen in future is that the Examiner will put down on the allocation sheets a draft for the figure for the Costs Fund and work out the basis of the allocation on that figure which he has made out from the Costs Fund.  If the solicitor for the owner or any of the mortgagees or any of the parties appearing in the proceedings, is not satisfied with the draw the Examiner has made, he has the right of applying, on the allocation itself, to the Judicial Commissioner for a variation of that figure. I am not absolutely clear about that particular part.  Is it only on the application they apply for a variation, or have they to go for a special motion on appeal from the decision of the Examiner?  It seems to me if they have to go for a special motion, it will make it unnecessarily costly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>They have to go with a special motion.  On the question of a draw, there are a number of other matters which are now being delegated to the Examiners&mdash;for instance, fixing redemption of claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of years' purchase, and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and determining the amount due, mortgages and so on. These matters formerly had to be dealt with by the Judicial Commissioner himself and therefore the purpose of this is outside this question of draws. It is to enable them to do this work expeditiously and unless a dispute arises, it will not be necessary for them to go before the Judicial Commissioner. If a dispute arises, it can go by way of appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="277" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the case the Minister is making without any difficulty.  If it is a mortgage for a fixed sum, then there is nothing to do but put it in priority.  The only argument would be about the order of priority or about the amount of accrued interest if there were a clause for half yearly rests, or something like that.  But in 90 per cent of the cases there cannot be argument about the amount.  I understood the practice at present was that it was automatically put on the allocation schedule by the Examiner at the fixed amount and that they went to the Judicial Commissioner to rule on it automatically.</P>
      <P>I cannot see, therefore, in relation to that, that this section is doing anything to expedite matters.  If there were a question, for example, of fixing the redemption of an annual charge only, there would be variation of the number of years' purchase that would be allowed.  Then it seems to me that while I approve of this method of fixing it subject to appeal, the method of having to go on appeal is making for unnecessary delay and making it unnecessarily cumbersome.  Surely it could be dealt with by the Examiner fixing the amount and, that being fixed, put it on the draft allocation schedule that goes to the Commissioner and the ruling on the allocation schedules by the Commissioner could also be the occasion on which he would determine the objection or appeal.  It seems to me that method would save a separate application to the Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appreciates that under the present practice when the Examiner has finished his work and made out the application, there still must be settlement of these matters by the Judicial Commissioner, which generally entails the attendance of the solicitor concerned as well as his dealing with the Examiner.  In future, the Examiner will rule on the allocation schedule as a whole and it would be only in matters where there would be a disagreement on the schedule with the Examiner that there would be subject for an appeal.  In that way it is, <Col N="278" /> in my view, bound to save a considerable amount of the Judicial Commissioner's time and indeed an amount of the legal man's time.  In the vast majority of these cases, they agree with the Examiner and the matter does not go any further.  Even assuming here and now that there is disagreement, it is only on the point of that disagreement that it would be necessary to go before the Judicial Commissioner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the cutting down of the roots of title formerly prescribed and follows one for 12 years in the first instance and 30 years instead of 40, depending on circumstances.  These roots can be dispensed with in small cases up to £2,000 under section 31 of this Bill but it is cutting down the prescribed periods for the roots of title and authorising a shorter roots of title than was the practice heretofore.</P>
      <P>It is a matter which I think will be welcomed by all practitioners concerned with this line of country.  Under section 50, subsection (3) of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, it is proposed to adopt a roots of title period of 12 and 20 years and the same thing is being done here.  I understand under the Law of Property Act in England&mdash; Section 4 of the 1925 Act&mdash;there is provision for a period of 30 years.  We are coming down to 30 years in one case and 12 in the other and this should in many cases ease troublesome titles for many owners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the drafting of the section, first of all. Subsection (1) begins:</P>
      <P>The Judicial Commissioner may, notwithstanding the provisions of the Land Purchase Acts or any other enactment, at his discretion, issue general directions to an Examiner authorised for the purpose of subsection (1) of section 15 of this Act, to accept...</P>
      <P>We have generally done that.  As I understand that, though the Judicial Commissioner authorises the Examiner to accept this short root of title, he is so doing under the provisions for appeal under section 15.  Therefore the commencement of the title with a good root as set out in paragraph (a) or (b) is not necessarily an absolute one before the Examiner.  As I read the section, bringing in a reference to section 15 means that the Short Title can only be accepted by the Examiner if there is no objection to it.  That does not seem to me to accord with the description the Minister just gave.</P>
      <P>I am not clear if that is so.  If not why is section 15 brought in at all?  I understand the Minister in his explanation of section 15 to say that we are now going to start with a short title of 12 or 30 years as the case may be. Before we discuss this section itself is it the intention that we will always have the short title or will we only have the short title subject to the appeal of the Judicial Commissioner?</P>

      <P>It is my intention.  I think the Deputy is incorrect in his interpretation.  It is the intention to provide for shorter title with section 16 and notwithstanding what was provided in prior Land Acts that a Judicial Commissioner can give this direction so that examiners may in suitable cases accept this.  That is my intention.  If on re-examination of the facts the Deputy has stated I feel that something should be done to clarify the position I will have it done.  That is my interpretation of it.</P>

Then it would be a question, if the Examiner disagreed, for an appeal.  This section is an enabling one to provide for shorter titles.

      <P>I accept the Minister's assurance because this is a drafting error.  I came across a case the other day which is still a little fresh in my mind.  A person had bought some property for a valuable consideration exactly 14 years before.  The assignment made at that time, I think, by mistake, left out a restrictive covenant that was in an assignment of three years previously&mdash;17 years ago&mdash;also for a valuable consideration.  It is, I <Col N="281" /> think, perfectly clear that there had been a genuine clerical error in the 14-year-old deed and the person who had got the benefit of the restrictive covenant 17 years ago, when he came to sell, went and examined the situation in a very friendly way.  Of course, a stranger would not look at it in the same way.  They discovered there was that mistake in the 14-year-old document. What I am trying to do is to ensure that if there were some mistake 12 years ago and it is proved, the person has some way of being indemnified. So long as there is some way I am satisfied.</P>

      <P>Section 34 of the 1931 Act, to which this section refers, states:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in the Land Purchase Acts, the following provisions shall have effect in relation to the distribution of purchase-money, that is to say:</P>
      <P>(a)  the Court may after publication by advertisement or otherwise of such notice as the Court shall consider sufficient direct payment of a claim in respect of which the Court is of opinion that the title of the claimant, though imperfect, is nevertheless such as to make it improbable that any claim adverse to such first-mentioned claim could be sustained.</P>

    <P>It goes on to provide for different types of compensation for different periods. That would be applicable under subsection <Col N="282" /> (2) of this section in the event of a shortening of the title.

In the framework of this question, the Judicial Commissioner may accept 12 years as the period of the commencement of title or else 30 years.  Is that another way of saying the Judicial Commissioner may accept the squatter's period of 30 years?  The marginal note calls it &ldquo;acceptable root of title&rdquo; but in paragraph (b), the subsection says:</P>
      <P>thirty years ending on the date on which the land or tenant's interest therein invested in the Land Commission,</P>
    </Speaker>

Then you would go back to 1st February, 1935.  Do you start with the first documentary evidence you have before 1st February, 1935 or with an affidavit of title saying &ldquo;Patrick Murphy was in possession of the lands as from that date&rdquo;?</P>

I also understand that there is protection given to the Public Trustee who is also Chief Examiner, by section 52 of the Land Act, 1903.  The wording of the subsection in that Act is almost exactly the same as the wording of this; so, in case there were any doubts, it was felt that this should be done because it was certainly done in that particular case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P>In page 11, lines 10 to 13, to delete from &ldquo;and,&rdquo; to the end of the section, and to insert the following: &ldquo;the Register of Titles shall, if satisfactory evidence of the exercise of the said rights in such period is not forthcoming, cause the entry of the said rights to be cancelled in the appropriate register.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It will be seen from line 10 on page 11 that as the Bill stands a farmer who wished to obtain control of shooting rights over his land would have to produce proof of the fact that they had not been exercised for 20 years.  It is well known that it can be difficult to prove a negative.  Also, we are faced with the difficulty that the allottees of the Land Commission and the Land Commission themselves will frequently have no positive knowledge of what the position has been over the previous 20 years.  If they seek proof among local people that a man has not exercised sporting rights for 20 years, they may be confronted with apathy or even opposition.  To remove this obligation to prove a negative, it is proposed to amend the section to allow the Registrar of Titles to take action if he has some evidence of the non-existence of the shooting rights and if on the other side of the picture, there is no evidence forthcoming of their actual exercise.  This is the purpose of amendment No. 35.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>With the principle in the amendment, I agree, but the amendment does not say that.  The amendment says that the Registrar shall remove it if he has evidence on one side but it does not say anything about the dominant tenant being able to adduce evidence in contradiction. All I want to be quite sure of there is that, if application is made, whoever is expressed on the folio&mdash;this will always be in respect of registered land, I think&mdash;it might not be as they might be reserved under the 1881 Act&mdash;they were not always registered under that Act&mdash;but 99.9 of the cases will be registered land&mdash;whoever in whose favour the right is expressed will get notice and that that person has the right then to adduce contradictory evidence if he so desires and that then it is for the Registrar to decide between the two sets of evidence, and I presume if the Registrar decides one way, either party has a right of appeal to the judge sitting as Land Registry Judge.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: That section 18, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware, first of all, that in relation to this section various people, particularly the National Farmers Association, have indicated that the period of 20 years is too long.  I must say that when I read the Bill I could not understand why the period of 20 years was taken instead of what, since the Statute of Limitations Act, 1957, makes virtually everything now 12 years.  It seemed to me it would have been more natural to have made this fall into the 12-year period.  The National Farmers Association asked for a period of ten years. I would not agree with them in that. I think the proper period is the period that is the statutory period generally of 12 years.  Certainly, so far as I am concerned, I would feel that a period of 12 years was more appropriate in clause (c) than the period of 20 years included by the Minister, unless the Minister can advance to me some very strong argument of which I am not at present aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, a point was raised in relation to this section at a meeting of the National Farmers Association executive in Kildare the other night, which was attended by Deputies Dooley, Crinion, Boylan and myself, in relation to this, that is, what exactly is the exercise of sporting rights.  The Minister will agree with me that he is introducing this section for the purpose of enabling farmers to own their own shooting rights and I think it is shooting <Col N="287" /> rights as such in which he is interested rather than the wide sphere of sporting rights.  Fishing rights, I know, are specifically excluded under the Act.</P>
    <P>The case that was put to me was this: if you had a pack of fox hounds, a pack of harriers or a pack of beagles and some member of the family of the person who had the sporting rights reserved to him under the folio went over that land, as it would be, by implied consent, if you like, but it would not be by asking, so to speak, first of all, that would be such exercise of the rights as would prevent this section coming into operation.  I do not think anybody wants that on any side of the fence, whether it is a jumping fence or a walking fence, or whether it is a political fence.  The gentleman who raised that at the meeting is the secretary of the Game Council in Kildare and I must confess that once he had raised it, I found it extremely difficult reading the section, to discover where I could point out to him that he was wrong because it is, I think, correct to say that sporting rights are defined in the Land Acts as being hunting, fishing, fowling, shooting rights and so forth.</P>
    <P>If there was any possibility whatever of the interpretation that was put forward that night being correct, it would, on the one hand most injuriously affect farmers whom the Minister and the House desire to benefit under section 18, and, on the other hand, mean that farmers would undoubtedly have to take certain action perhaps in relation to people going across their land which they would not wish to take.  It seems to me that the act of a person riding a horse over the land would retain the shooting rights for the owner of that land but that was not at all envisaged and is not at all desired.</P>
    <P>I know many cases in Kildare where there were sporting rights reserved and where the descendants of the person who was not entitled to the interest that was reserved, or their children, might be out riding and would go across the land.  It seems to me if they went across the land, it was exercising the sporting rights, which would <Col N="288" /> have the effect of preventing the farmer over whose land they were riding getting the sporting rights, though the rider, the farmer, the Minister, the House and the Registrar of Title would not so desire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is a good one which is made stronger by the amendment, but like Deputy Sweetman, I believe the period should be reduced to 12 years.  There does not seem to be any reason for the period of 20 years.  I should like to know where the Minister got it.  Did he take it out of the air?  There is a precedent for 12 years.  In the explanatory memorandum issued with the Bill, it is the matter of shooting rights that is mainly referred to and it is long after time that this question was dealt with. There is nothing so annoying to a small farmer as to have somebody crossing his land who might have had, or some member of whose family might have had, some connection with the land long ago who can still retain the sporting rights and, whether the farmer likes it or not, claim to be entitled to use the land for hunting, shooting and fishing.  As regards taking the hunting and shooting out of it, it is rather a pity the Minister did not go the whole hog and take the fishing out of it.  In page five of the explanatory memorandum, another matter is referred to:</P>
      <P>...in particular instances, the shooting rights over large compact areas of mountain or bog have been reserved to the Land Commission with a view to ordinary development &mdash;these will be retained and leased in the usual way to Sporting Groups, Gun Clubs, etc.</P>
      <P>It is the &ldquo;etc.&rdquo; that I am worried about.  When the thing was being done, it should have been completed and the sporting rights should have been passed to the owner of the land in every case.  In 1964 it is just too bad that people will still have to allow the descendants of those who in many cases were not very fair landlords to retain possession of sporting rights on their land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which I <Col N="289" /> mentioned to the Minister before in a different context and if you will permit me, Sir, I should like to refer to it again very briefly, that is, the allocation of certain rights to clubs or groups of people from outside the district. This is particularly true of the fishing rights.  People, particularly from Dublin city, come in to a district to fish and will not allow the farmer or any member of his family or his neighbours a day's fishing on this stretch of water.  It is wrong, whether the Land Commission or anybody else leases it to them.  When a person has a farm of land, he should get the entire rights to it, including the sporting and fishing rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Sweetman's point is very well taken. The main argument is that in 90 per cent of these cases, farmers would desire to give the right to people to cross their land, would like to see sport going on but they could find themselves in the position that in order to look after their own interest as far as these sporting rights are concerned, they would have to refuse to allow people to cross their land in the pursuit of game or vermin.  The Minister might well look into that.</P>
      <P>On the point about the period of 12 years, there is very little difference between the NFA suggestion and ours, a difference of only two years.  However, the difference between ten and 20 years is very great and Deputy Dillon is quite right when he says the trend of thought in 1964 is that people who own the land should own the sporting rights.  From experience, it can be said that 90 per cent of the farmers want to allow people to shoot and hunt and they really enjoy to see sport, even though they may not indulge in it themselves.  It may well be the Minister would be prepared to look at the matter again and maybe on the Report Stage do something for us in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard it as past the time when this section should be introduced.  What were known as sporting rights 40 or 50 years ago would bear no resemblance at all to what we have today.  This type of thing today <Col N="290" /> involves nothing but trespassers, poachers and rogues' rights and it is time to close the gap and eliminate those.</P>
      <P>We all know that what is everybody's business is nobody's business and the existence of these rights, which have a very doubtful past, means simply that places are overrun by poachers and trespassers who just shoot game indiscriminately and do damage.  I would appeal to the Minister to reduce the period to 12 years anyway.  Twenty years is too long a period.  After all we have had our freedom for 40 years and this matter should have been dealt with before now.</P>
      <P>There are other extraordinary pieces of writing in this explanatory memorandum. In page five there is this reference:</P>
      <P>...in particular instances, the shooting rights over large compact areas of mountain or bog have been reserved to the Land Commission with a view to orderly development...</P>
      <P>Whoever wrote that must not know much about the orderly development which takes place on these stretches of mountain and bog.  Of course, no such thing happens.  If that were published in the west, it would make most entertaining reading.  Where in the West are these stretches of mountain or bog developed by anybody, except perhaps by a few odd sporting people?  Then, because of laxity in the implementation of the regulations, someone goes out a night or two before the season opens and shoots up the whole place. If these rights are held by the Land Commission, and if they are being developed, I should like information to be made available here so that we will know what it is all about.  The west of Ireland seems to have been forgotten. I do not know whether British landlords had these rights and succeeded in retaining them after the land was given over.  Not only should the rights lapse but these people should be kicked out and there should be a section put in here to fire them out.  It is time that was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Tully said, it is a great <Col N="291" /> pity that something is not being done about fishing rights.  They are much more important than shooting rights. However, I support the section, but I ask the Minister to reduce the period to 12 years, or less, if possible.</P>

      <P>To take the points in order, I cannot accept that what has been propounded by Deputy Sweetman would work out in practice, but I shall have a look at the implications of the case made to him.  I do not think it could arise under the section.  There is one immediate answer.  If a descendant of one of the former owners has exercised a right of some kind in the way in which Deputy Sweetman suggests, then the owner is traceable and, under the existing law, that owner's rights can be compulsorily taken over by the Land Commission on the application of the tenant owner. A number of tenant owners are exercising that right at the present time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot concede that. Many more have made application since I informed the NFA of the existence of these provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as shooting rights are concerned, the proposal is simply a method of cancelling reservations of rights which have not been exercised for a period of 20 years by those entitled to them or appearing to be entitled to them.  Under the law&mdash;this is dealt with in the explanatory memorandum&mdash;the Land Commission, when they take over big estates, acquire the sporting rights, unless these rights are not in the one ownership but are reserved to a superior interest. Where the rights are taken over, the policy of the Land Commission is to vest them in the tenant farmers.  They <Col N="292" /> have done that, with the exceptions that have been mentioned here.  Where the Land Commission have important shooting or fishing rights, they advertise them, and they are taken in the main by local clubs or associations, whose rules are sufficiently liberal to cover everybody.  That is the new policy now laid down.  As the game movement develops, we expect many more clubs or associations to become interested in taking over these rights and rehabilitating the preserves.  It is the intention of the Land Commission to advise associations and clubs of any unwanted shooting rights in areas in which the Land Commission at the moment hold the rights.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leneghan and Deputy P. Hogan, I think, and some others, made a point about this 12 year period and suggested ten years.  The usual period in matters of this kind used to be 20 years.  That is why it is here.  I am not tied to 20 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the House should be somewhat slow in wiping them out without due examination.  I am not tied to 20 years, but, in considering the matter, I thought that in rights of this kind it might be rather dangerous to provide a shorter period.  However, I shall have another look at the matter between now and the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should make it clear that I am dealing here only with shooting rights. There is ample legislation covering fishing rights.  There is certainly provision <Col N="293" /> for the taking over of fisheries under the 1939 Act, should that policy be officially decided.  No Government so far have tackled that problem.  It is a very big one and it would be a very expensive one nationally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister visualises the way in which the section will operate is that the owner of the land will make application in some form or other to the Registrar of Titles.  Would it not be more normal to have a period of 20 years, and I favour 12 years myself, ending on the enactment of this Bill, because it seems to me that, as it stands, it is a period of 12 years ending on the date on which the owner of the land takes positive action?  It seems to me automatically that the positive action the owner takes is the application to the Registrar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The owner of the land can take that positive action only after this Bill is passed and comes into operation.  Therefore if one said 12 years, or whatever the period of years is, ending on the date of the application, it would mean that you would not have to have the designation in the alternative that there is in subsection (c) on the one hand, and equally, on the other, it would make it clear that it was the ordinary form of statutory title which is 12 years&mdash;I am not arguing about the period of years at the moment&mdash;from the time a person went to prove that he had that squatter's title.  It seems to me that it is unusual drafting to put the ending of the period here, either on the date of the Act or a date subsequent.  If you had it on the date 12 years prior to the date of the application, it would be the proper one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make another point.  Suppose an application goes in and between the date of this Act and the filing of the application, shall we say, in 1967, the owner of the shooting rights has regularly exercised those rights and built up a game farm on them but only started to build them up, to exercise those rights, after this Act became law and nobody was objecting.  He <Col N="294" /> built it up for three years and what he had done would all go for nothing.  It does not seem to me that that is the correct way of doing it.  I am all in favour of the rights being struck out in the case of a person who is not bothering about conserving the game rights but in the other case I think it would be better to have as the date the date of the application to the Registrar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I read subsection (c) in a different way:</P>
      <P>the said rights so reserved have not been exercised in the period of twenty years ending on the passing of this Act or in any period of twenty years ending on a date subsequent to the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>Surely that means that in 20 or 30 years once you come along with an application&mdash;forget about the 20 years for the moment&mdash;to the Registrar, it is for 20 years prior to the date subsequent to this Act.  That is my reading of subsection (c) of section 18.  That is the intention of subsection (c).</P>
      <P>I do not quite appreciate the other point made by the Deputy.  We are dealing here with registered rights on folios.  I do not quite understand the point about somebody who has started in comparatively recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am think-about is that a person starts a game farm and he gets the outlying rights from the outlying farms for the purpose of making a ring fence to prevent poaching on his land.  I can see difficulties arising then but I can see another type of difficulty arising.  As I read the section&mdash;I am not suggesting that the Minister wanted to draw it this way&mdash;you could come along in 1974 and have an argument as to whether the rights were or were not used in the 12 years prior to 1964.  I do not think that matters.  I think the argument you must have is whether the rights were or were not used in the 12 years preceding the time the man goes to the Registrar.  I want that provided for in some way.  If the Minister can assure me that this section means that, then very well.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to confirm the Land Commission's power to resell turbary rights, shooting rights, sealing rights, <i>et cetera,</i> by way of advances, in the same way as they resell parcels of land.  The resale transactions under our present law are covered in section 31 of the Land Act 1923 which states that:</P>
      <P>Advances may be made to the following persons or bodies for the purchase by them from the Land Commission of parcels of land...</P>
      <P>and then it goes on to name six different classes of allottees.  The section is silent about incorporeal hereditaments, and does not say anything about them.  Since 1923 it has been assumed that the rights of turbary, for example, could be allotted in the same way as fee simple.  It has been accepted that a simple vesting procedure can be applied to this and other allotments but while these practices have not been challenged, there is no authority for a number of them under the 1923 Act, in my view.  The purpose of this section is to include incorporeal hereditaments and for the Land Commission to be able to allot them in the same way as they are giving land.</P>

      <P>I am paraphrasing in polite language what the Minister would have said in somewhat impolite language and I agree on that account that I would not be able to quote him. Everybody assumed that this was so. Everybody assumed that it was proper for the Land Commission to deal with turbary rights in this manner.  I agree I assumed it and we all assumed it. Now, some doubt has been expressed by somebody.  As far as I know there has been no judicial decision but somebody has had some doubt and the Minister very properly comes along and opens this section with the phrase &ldquo;For the removal of doubt, it is hereby declared ...&rdquo; Of course he is right, in order to avoid having somebody take a new case.  I do not think there is any case on the stocks but it will avoid somebody going on a purely technical point to the Supreme Court, and avoid a lot of cost which would be involved.</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that 12 months ago the Minister for Lands would have been just as adamant on this point as he has been in relation to agistment and conacre lettings under section 12.  Why will he not do the same thing in section 12: put in a phrase &ldquo;for the removal of doubt, it is hereby declared that agistment and conacre lettings are not the subject of the prohibition contained in the section&rdquo;? This is the second time in the short space of an hour in which he has given me, out of his own mouth, an opportunity of convicting him; and I shall have great pleasure also on the Report Stage in referring to it again.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 11, before section 20, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>(1)  The powers of the Land Commission to expend money for the benefit or improvement of any lands shall, in addition to the matters mentioned in section 43 of the Land Act, 1923, and section 39 (as amended by section 32 of this Act) of the Land Act, 1931, include power to confer on the Land Commission and their licensees, and to define and extend or improve, ways and rights of way over any land whatsoever (including any accretion, through alluvion or dereliction, whether or not caused by drainage), for the purpose of facilitating passage to and from the sea or to and from a lake or river which adjoins lands sold or agreed to be sold under the Land Purchase Acts, whether such rights of way are or are not conferred as to be appurtenant to any land, and whether any terminal point of such ways and rights of way is or is not situate on lands sold or agreed to be sold under the Land Purchase Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The powers conferred on the <Col N="298" /> Land Commission by section 43 of the Land Act, 1923, and section 39 (as amended by section 32 of this Act) of the Land Act, 1931, and extended by this section, may be exercised for the purposes of conferring and defining&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  rights to park vehicles or to beach boats, and</P>
    <P>(b)  rights to moor or anchor boats.</P>
    <P>(3)  The powers of the Land Commission under this section to define and extend or improve rights of way to and from the sea or to and from a lake or river shall not be exercised compulsorily in relation to any right of way over land adjoining an occupied dwellinghouse which was in existence at the commencement of the period of one year ending on the date of the notice in respect of that right of way served by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment, which inserts a new section in the Bill, is to cover a gap which exists between the provisions of section 32 and parts of sections 34 and 41.  On page 15, lines 2-5, there is a provision for the acquisition of a landing place on the shore of a lake or river for the benefit of fishermen, and on page 17, lines 45-48, there is a similar provision about the resumption of tenanted land for the same purpose.  In section 32 and in the original section of the 1931 Act, which it amends, there is ample provision for the creation of rights-of-way to land.  None of these sections, however, empowers the Land Commission to create a right-of-way to water for the use of persons fishing or boating. In many instances and, perhaps, in most instances, the landowners would regard it as the lesser of two evils that the Land Commission should create rights over the land and water rather than that they should resort to outright acquisition; and it would be anomalous if the Land Commission could not take the less drastic action in suitable cases.  The new section covers three main activities associated with fishing: passing to and from the water; standing vehicles and boats; and mooring and anchoring boats.  In <Col N="299" /> these days when more and more attention is being focussed on the potentialities of our fisheries, I think it reasonable that the Land Commission should have the power to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>As with the existing procedures for rights-of-way to land, the new orders will provide for compensation and they will be open to objection by the land owner.  Objections are commonly talked out between the servient owner and the Land Commission officials, because these cases do not always justify the trouble and expense of formal hearings.  But a small minority proved impossible of settlement and must be listed for hearing before the Lay Commissioners who make final decisions on the merits and who may concede an increase in compensation where appropriate or may recommend some variations such as additional gates, fences and so on.  That is done under section 43 of the Land Act, 1923, and Order XL of the Provisional Rules of 1924.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the purpose of this is to give the Land Commission the same or similar powers as they now have for the creation of rights-of-way to land&mdash; to give them the same power for the creation of rights-of-way to lakes and rivers, to beach and anchor boats and to park cars.</P>

The Minister is well aware of what I am talking about&mdash;the narrow rights-of-way that have caused all the trouble up and down the country. Will he ensure they will be adequate for the usage for which they were intended, for the passage of machinery and so on?  Will he also ensure that before anything like this is done, the necessary consultations will take place with local authorities, so that, if at any future time the local authority decide to acquire the road or lane and make it a public road, that can be done with the least possible trouble?  Will he ensure that a road of the right size and type will be there for the local authority to take over and not have the present situation where small, twisted lanes are being built by the Land Commission and left there?  It costs more to turn them into decent roads than they originally cost.  If the Minister would look into that it would help a lot.</P>

However, this is rather a different matter because the local authority would not have any power, so far as I know, to acquire rights-of-way to some of these lakes, rivers and waterways.  But I do not see any objection in principle to the points the Deputy has made.  Indeed, for this purpose it would be necessary to have them sufficiently wide to take modern vehicular traffic, because that is the intention here.  I have in mind some well-known lakes that badly need access for the benefit of local fishing clubs and others concerned in this matter.  Without going into the matter too deeply, I think I can give an assurance that, if the local authority wants to take over and maintain any of these roads, we will be very happy that they do so.</P>

I would assume the roads referred to in this section are roads which would be of public utility, or otherwise they would not have been put into the Bill.  I am glad of the Minister's assurance that he has asked his officials to consult with local authorities, but there is at least one they have not consulted with on a recent occasion, causing a lot of unnecessary trouble.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully may be complaining about Meath constituency. I do not know anything about that except as regards one corner of the county.  But I know as far as Kildare is concerned we are littered with roads that have caused immense trouble from the time they were put in by the Land Commission. We have arrived at a method of dealing with them in Kildare now, but it is no thanks to the Land Commission that we have done so.  In Kildare we have brought up these roads to a standard and then taken them over, but the standard in which they were left by the Land Commission is, frankly, a standard that did not do them any credit at all.</P>
      <P>In the day of the pony and trap, they might have passed as reasonable tracks, but particularly in the day of the milk lorry which provides a substantial part of the income of the small farmers who are allottees, they are out of the question, with the result that in many cases in Kildare allottees have had to get together and look for a grant under the rural improvements schemes.  When some of the users refused pointblank to have anything to do with it, they had to pay for their neighbours, too, which, as the Minister knows, is a little too much.  That was the only alternative.  Unless a grant was obtained under the rural improvements schemes, the work done, and the road brought to a proper standard, the milk could not be collected and the position was that the allottees concerned would lose far more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some short time ago there was a <Col N="302" /> suggestion that the Land Commission were going to considerable trouble to get a better type of house for the allottees.  Unless I am mistaken, a model was displayed in this House.  I am not asking the Minister to display a model of a road, but I am asking him to make certain that the roads which are being put in by the Land Commission will bear some reality to modern conditions, and not merely be grass tracks covered with a sliver of gravel, and that there will be the proper width between the two fences on either side so that there will not be a need for the acquisition of additional land.</P>
    <P>As my recollection goes, a road taken by a local authority must be 11 feet wide in the clear.  Usually it is, but I have come across cases where it was not 11 feet wide in the clear.  The view of the Land Commission in relation to roads has been different from their view in relation to improvements in fences and the building of fences. Their attitude has been: &ldquo;The less we can get out of them for the roads, the better for everyone concerned&rdquo;. That is bad economy and results in a running sore being left behind which has to be cleared up by someone else at some stage.</P>
    <P>The allottees concerned with the new holdings being created in Leinster would be far happier to pay a little more and have proper roads built by the Land Commission which could be taken over by the local authority. Some roads are in such condition with holes, potholes and muck that no one can travel on them, particularly the milk cars which collect what is the most ready source of ready money going into the holdings of virtually every allottee.</P>

      <P>The original Bill contained a great deal of practically incomprehensible Civil Service jargon but the amendments seem to be the last straw.  Subsection (3) of amendment No. 36 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  The powers of the Land Commission under this section to define and extend or improve rights of way to and from the sea or to and from a lake or river shall not be exercised <Col N="303" /> compulsorily in relation to any right of way over land adjoining an occupied dwellinghouse which was in existence at the commencement of the period of one year ending on the date of the notice in respect of that right of way served by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>There may be people here who understand what that means, but I think it could be the foundation for one of the finest legal battles in history.  It reads:</P>
    <P>...shall not be exercised compulsorily in relation to any right of way over land adjoining an occupied dwellinghouse which was in existence at the commencement of the period of one year ending on the date of the notice in respect of that right of way served by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to try to interpret that because it does not make any sense to me, nor I am sure, to a good many others.  I think it could be interpreted in 50 different ways, which would mean that the whole section would end up in smoke.  I do not know what was intended by the civil servants who put in that priceless piece of jargon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor had his attention very seriously directed to the case of a right of way involving a number of Land Commission allottees in Errill in Laois where the Land Commission caused not only serious embarrassment but very serious financial loss by their failure properly to construct a road through the estate which was divided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is highly desirable when the Land Commission are dividing an estate and it is necessary to have roads constructed through the estate, that those roads should be constructed by the Land Commission in a manner which will meet with the approval of the local authority engineers, so that the local authority may take them over and be responsible for their maintenance. Many of the roads in Land Commission holdings are narrow and many of the bridges they provided are unsuitable, in my opinion.  We have now reached a period in modern farming when large-scale machinery is worked <Col N="304" /> by most of our farmers.  I have known of cases where it was impossible to take a combine across a bridge constructed by the Land Commission. That type of thing causes very serious inconvenience and hardship to the local land owners.</P>
    <P>The engineering section of the Land Commission should reconsider their attitude to the Land Commission policy of road making.  Now that this Bill is going through the House the Minister has an opportunity to review the whole question of road construction through estates that are being divided and allotted.  Arrangements should be made for greater Land Commission expenditure on roadmaking. The roads through most of the large estates that have been divided can to a great degree be described as patchwork. Some of them are without any proper surface.  Those roads, most of them rights of way, may have a reasonably good foundation but the surface consists of potholes, muck and sludge and cannot be described as satisfactory. When one considers the rates and the Land Commission annuity the allottees must pay, one would expect that they would be provided by the Land Commission with a proper entrance to their holdings.  Tractors, combines, motor cars, lorries, creamery lorries and beet lorries have to use those roads.</P>
    <P>The engineering section of the Land Commission must bear in mind that the roads they are now making on Land Commission holdings should be designed to carry heavy traffic.  The policy of the Land Commission to date in regard to Land Commission roads has been to get out of it as easily as possible and with the least possible expenditure and to throw the responsibility for the roads on to the tenant. Such a policy is penny wise and pound foolish.  I feel that the Minister is in agreement with the views that have been expressed from many sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Where roadways are improved under the rural improvements scheme, the local authorities are now taking over most of the roads.  In recent times, the Office of Public Works have been tarring as well as steamrolling <Col N="305" /> those roads under the rural improvements scheme.  Land Commission roads should be of such a standard that the county engineer can recommend to his council that they are in good condition and of sufficient width. The construction of Land Commission bridges should be such that the county councils can take them over for all future maintenance.</P>
    <P>We do not expect the Land Commission to repair roads and rights of way for which they are not responsible. I have often wondered whether they have considered putting all farm roadways in existing holdings for which they are responsible into a first class state of repair.  Would it not be desirable if the engineering section consulted the local authorities with a view to making some arrangements for the taking over of these roads for future maintenance by the local authorities, provided, of course, that all the tenants are satisfied, that there is no objection from any of the tenants and that the county council are of opinion that these roads should be taken over and maintained.</P>
    <P>Material for roads and rights of way is extremely costly.  Landowners and the allottees who receive holdings from the Land Commission are of the opinion that the great drawbacks in rural Ireland are the cul-de-sac, the right of way and the road which is not in good repair.  There is certainly great ground for grievance in most of the complaints.  Therefore, the Land Commission should review this matter and formulate a new scheme.</P>
    <P>I am sure the legal position in all cases is put right by the Land Commission before holdings are allotted. That being so, the Land Commission should see to is that as far as possible their allottees are provided with as good a road as may be to their holdings and that the same facilities as are enjoyed by those living alongside county roads will be available to them, bearing in mind that they must pay a county rate and are entitled to that facility.</P>
    <P>I trust that, from the passage of this Bill, there will be a new look in the road construction policy of the <Col N="306" /> Land Commission and that there will be a departure from the most undesirable practice of leaving roads and rights of way in a most deplorable state.  There should also be some question about rights of way which are not fenced off but where a number of tenants may have legal rights to go from one holding to another.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
      <P>In page 11, after &ldquo;section&rdquo; in line 47 to insert &ldquo;and as if for the references in subsection (3) of that section to the date of registration there were substituted references to the date of the vesting order&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On a study of subsection (2) in the context of the Registration of Title Act, it has been found that the wording of lines 45-47 in this Bill is not entirely satisfactory.  As stated in the explanatory memorandum, it is intended to confirm that an exchange carried out by means of a vesting order shall have a similar effect to an exchange carried out by signed documents under section 46 of the Land Act, 1923, in relation to the transfer of burdens and charges from the old holding to the new.  But in an exchange of land pursuant to section 46 the transfer of burdens does not take place until the migrant's new holding has been vested and the time has come to register him as owner of the new holding and the Land Commission as owner of the old.  This is the present position and it will also be the future position under section 51 (2) of the Registration Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This time lag between the carrying out of an exchange and the legal transfer of burdens and charges is not of great importance in the case of a <Col N="307" /> simple exchange but it could give rise to serious difficulties where a complex rearrangement, involving many interlocking exchange transactions, is being carried out.  In such a case it is most advisable that the burdens and charges on all the holdings should transfer simultaneously &mdash; each to its own appropriate holding as rearranged. These complicated cases are in the main dealt with under the vesting order procedure, so the amendment lays down that the transfer of burdens and charges will take place at the time of the vesting and will not wait upon the registration of all these varied transactions in Land Registry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>When Private Members' Time ceased yesterday I was speaking on this Bill. I do not wish to go over the points I then made. I had paid tribute to the very thorough way in which Deputy Dunne had introduced his Bill and said that I agreed with his points in connection with this struggle to preserve these buildings.  I touched on the subject that some people had the idea that these Georgian houses, or 18th century buildings, were somehow connected with Georgian society and Georgian aristocracy.  Since then, a speech was made by the former president of the Old Dublin Society, Mr. Desmond Moore.  He has gone into the question of the occupiers of these houses in the thorough way in which the Society works and he points out that these houses in Lower Fitzwilliam Street, far from being the homes of an unwanted and unwelcome aristocracy, were in fact the habitations of Dublin professional people.  He gave a number of names in the 1830's when the houses were occupied by families named Hughes, Darley, Daly, O'Hagan, Murphy and Driscoll. Another was Alderman Tom Makinney, Lord Mayor of Dublin.  He asks: &ldquo;Did you ever hear of aristocrats with names like that?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were Irish names of Irish people at that time.  In fact these houses were not in themselves magnificent examples of 18th century or early 19th century workmanship.  It is as a block that they achieved their town planning effect.  Their beauty comes from the fact that those 16 houses make a very charming and beautiful unbroken line.  There is no reason to think it is in any way perpetuating a part of Irish life which now, in a new state, some people wish to forget. That is not the case, but even if it <Col N="309" /> were these buildings are part of our Irish heritage and we should be very jealous of their preservation.  In this utilitarian age far too few objects of beauty exist and we should be, and many of us are, rightly jealous of those few remnants from the past which we have managed to preserve intact.</P>
    <P>A number of semi-state bodies have been given wide powers for the purpose of carrying on their various functions, among them the ESB.  They were given wide powers for the purpose of supplying electricity and carrying out the multifarious duties going with that, laying cables, crossing land and so on, but it is not really intended that those powers should be used for the purpose of what will result in spoiling irretrievably a section of historic and beautiful Dublin.  I ask the ESB to think again before they do this act which, when done, can never be undone.  Once those houses are pulled down, that section of Dublin will lose its unique claim to being one of the few places in the city where things have survived in all their former beauty unspoiled.  I ask the ESB to remember that the people for whom Deputy Dunne and other Members of this House speak are the inarticulate masses of Dublin citizenry just as much as the people who belong to the Old Dublin Society and the Georgian Society.  We are speaking for the ordinary man in the street who is very proud of his Dublin&mdash;and rightly so&mdash; and wishes to see it maintained unspoiled. I say that as a person who has had the honour of once occupying the position of first citizen of this capital city.  I am aware, as is every other occupant of that post, that Dublin citizens are very proud of their city and wish to see its beauty maintained and enhanced.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to remember the big petition which was signed and presented to the Government for the preservation of the houses in Lower Fitzwilliam Street.  I would ask him to take heed of the very real desire which the citizens of Dublin have to preserve the beauty of their city.  I know it is easy to say we are fighting to preserve things which are out of <Col N="310" /> date.  There are other beautiful aspects of the city such as the magnificent houses which have fallen utterly into decay but they have gone since that bad part of our history, the 19th century. The havoc wrought in the 19th century on the beauty of Dublin is irreparable.  We want to preserve these houses as a unique little section in the centre of the city, which is the pride and glory of many of the citizens of Dublin and a source of great pleasure to our visitors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to add a few comments to the contributions made on this Bill.  In the course of moving the Second Reading, Deputy S. Dunne stated that the Dublin Corporation rejected proposals for the demolition of these buildings.  Here are the facts.  When the ESB sought permission from the Planning Section of the Dublin Corporation, they made it quite clear in the plans that they envisaged the demolition of these 18 houses.  The Corporation planners, having examined the particular plans submitted to them, agreed in principle to the proposal.  Subsequently, when the detailed plans were submitted to the Corporation a dispute arose in the professional circles of the Corporation in regard to the design.  It was in regard to the design feature alone that the plans were rejected by the Corporation. Indeed, members of the Corporation had divided views about the whole matter.  The point I wish to stress is that the plans submitted, and approved in principle, were plans which envisaged the demolition of these houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB themselves, as far back as 1950, engaged the services of Sir John Summerson, the famous authority on Georgian architecture.  He favoured a competition for a design which was not in conflict with the preserved neighbourhood, but not necessarily Georgian.  The competition, which was eventually announced and competed for by well-known architects, produced a design in line with the advice given to the Board.  In 1954, the ESB were informed by the Chief Inspector of the dangerous building section of Dublin Corporation that the <Col N="311" /> whole structure in that street was in a critical condition.  The late Sir Patrick Abercrombie, the well-known town planning expert, made it clear there was no alternative to the construction of a new building.</P>
    <P>In view of these facts, I cannot see why all this outcry should be raised to preserve buildings which were clearly established as being uneconomic, in a dangerous state and unsuitable, particularly for office purposes.  I am sure Deputy M. E. Dockrell will recall some years ago, during the early years after the war, when the city was faced with a grave shortage of building materials, the Corporation decided to preserve Georgian structures in the Summerhill district.  We see the result there today.  They are very unsuitable and arouse a lot of criticism.  They were reconstructed at enormous expense.  I cannot see any semi-State body, public authority or local authority preserving and repairing something which is unsuitable, uneconomic and which would entail a tremendous capital outlay.</P>
    <P>I, like most Dubliners, am very jealous of the features of our city. Still, I should be practical and I cannot see in this age that we can preserve Georgian architecture forever. There was no outcry when the Corporation, in trying to deal with the Dublin housing problem, demolished Georgian houses in Dominick Street. There was no demand from any professional body that we should replace them with Georgian dwellings.  I feel the situation has been very fairly, reasonably and ably taken care of and that what has been planned would be practical from the point of view of the ESB, whose staff work in these offices. The design which has been approved will help to preserve the main character of the district.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker who asked why all the emotion was being generated about these dwellings put his finger on the mainspring of all this controversy because the debate centres around a proposal which excites controversy and, as in all controversy, there are opposing points of view.  The <Col N="312" /> last speaker expressed a point of view completely opposite to the view I hold. I am practically as emotional in this matter as I would be about proposals of a kind which would seem to me to be philistine or vandalistic.  A proposal to cover over the Grand Canal, for instance, would excite the same kind of reaction in me and I hope in the majority of this House.</P>
      <P>Nobody would grudge the ESB having a very good headquarters building but is it necessary for the ESB to stay where they are at all?  The Minister for Finance, in answer to a question today, on the matter of decentralisation of Government Departments, said the Government were examining the matter.  Here is something which does not require any examination. The ESB could go somewhere else. They could go more efficiently somewhere else.  Large organisations, we all find, tend to be subject to the mechanism of centralisation, of getting into the middle and operating from the centre out.  The ESB could create their own middle somewhere else.  We should begin decentralisation with the ESB on the basis of this issue alone.  I think any competent organisation should see the advantage of getting away from congested centres, particularly in large urban areas like the centre of Dublin. Transport alone would be an easier problem with which to deal.</P>
      <P>I think it is almost wasting the time of the House to elaborate on the advantages of taking these organisations out of the centre of Dublin.  It has been said so often in the House that we are hypnotised into the belief that there is some use in having them here in the middle.  If they could fit on the floor of the House, in they would come.  The ESB and all semi-State bodies have much wider duties.  The ESB should be aware of the standards required in a civilised community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that a suitable building for the ESB purposes would be one other than that which they use in Fitzwilliam Street, even with the alterations they will make.  If necessary, they should go elsewhere and provide themselves with an adequate building, perhaps on the outskirts of Dublin but not in Fitzwilliam Street.  This thing <Col N="313" /> has become a test of strength of wills in the country.  I think the manner in which the ESB have behaved throughout the whole affair has been deplorable, as well as the steps they have taken to achieve their ends.</P>
    <P>I was about to unhesitatingly praise the planning authority until I heard the last speech.  If the Dublin local authority are prepared to give way on the subject of the maintenance of the existing buildings, then I will not praise them.  It is a curious thing that in this Parliament, where we are surrounded in the debating chamber with 18th century Dublin Malton prints, of which we are so proud, the proposal of the ESB to destroy some of that heritage which exists in reality will get a hearing.  These prints are here for 40 years, long before I became a member of this House.  It has always given me great pleasure to see them and to know that people in this city dealing with the affairs of State had a feeling of the graces of the past. These prints are a continuing reminder of these graces.</P>
    <P>We are at the moment undergoing a major transformation of this House but we are taking every care not to disturb the facade of the House.  There is a reason for that and neither the Minister nor any member of the House need be told the reason.  It is a good historic building although it has a lot of physical faults.  Every Deputy is aware of that, but we are anxious to preserve the appearance of the building as it was 200 years ago.  By so doing I am sure we are spending a lot more money than we should spend in order to provide an efficient Parliament building.  In other countries much wealthier than ours, as in the United States, they actually went to the extent of reproducing the colonial type of architecture.  The building of the whole town of Williamsburg in reproduction is a tribute to what they believed to be the earlier part of their history.  The original buildings were rebuilt and are now run as museum pieces.</P>
    <P>All we have to do is go to the ESB and they will do the destruction for us.  It is part of a struggle going <Col N="314" /> on all over the country, and in other countries as well.  The trouble is that those whom you would expect to maintain the graces are people with competence and efficiency to get on with the job and to hell with appearance. The ESB are curiously insensitive to any kind of criticism that has been or will be levelled at them in this matter.  I have already referred to the doubtful manner in which they went around achieving their aims in this matter.  I suppose the Board is constituted of men who are primarily technicians or businessmen.  They have no time for these other things, and there are other things of course.  I am sure I spoke half a dozen times in this House on the despoliation of the urban and rural scene in this country by the ESB.  I have grumbled consistently about the way they have defaced our buildings, towns and villages with their ugly poles and wires&mdash;to hell with appearance as long as they get electricity delivered and sold.</P>
    <P>My curiosity was aroused by a newspaper production of a tidy town. Every picture showed that great care was taken by the inhabitants to make the place look attractive but every picture was defaced by an ESB pole and wires hanging across the buildings. I think people are now becoming aware of the ugliness we have permitted to grow up around us.  The job of the ESB in this regard and the way in which they do their work in supplying electric power is defacing the existing graces of all our interesting buildings.  They are going a step further and are tearing down these gracious old buildings and replacing them by more useful, efficient contemporary buildings.  I think it is an unnecessary bit of activity.  The ESB should think over the matter, the people of the country should think over the matter and Deputies here in Dáil Éireann should think about it. They should think about leaving Fitzwilliam Street alone and not allow future generations to label us as a generation of clodhoppers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say first of all I am very anxious that the best part <Col N="315" /> of Georgian Dublin should be preserved for reasons that have been given very adequately by Deputy Dockrell and in great detail and with great skill by Deputy Dunne.  Having said that, it would be quite impossible for me to accept the terms of this Bill to have Departments, and the Oireachtas itself, enter into the complicated function of planning for the preservation of Dublin and its reconstruction.  I think it would be entirely wrong.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to accept the terms of this Bill.  The preservation of the beauty of Dublin is, in my view, in the hands of Dublin Corporation and, in relation to Dublin Corporation, the Minister for Local Government has certain powers.  There it must rest.  It would be quite wrong if other Ministers, such as myself, who are in charge of various activities had also to enter into the picture.  Equally, it would be wrong if, once the Dáil has passed the present very elaborate town planning legislation, some particular feature of any part of the country were to come up for consideration here and that the Dáil itself should have to give consent. Everybody can imagine the lobbying that would go on and the confusion that would reign.</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly that initially this function is one for the planning authority.  The House already knows what happened about the arrangements in relation to these houses and the new building.  I want to make it clear that Dublin Corporation made an order under the Town and Regional Planning Acts, 1934 and 1939, granting general permission to the ESB to demolish Nos. 13 to 28 Lower Fitzwilliam Street and to erect a new office block in their place.  The permission was granted subject to the condition that the Board should submit detailed plans, illustrations and proposals before any work of a constructional nature was put in hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, there was nothing to prevent Dublin Corporation from adding a proviso to that general permission to demolish these houses whereby they could have directed that if it were possible to rebuild with the present facade strung on the outside, <Col N="316" /> the ESB should do so.  There was nothing to prevent Dublin Corporation under the law from limiting the statement of general power to demolish, of general permission to demolish, Nos. 13 to 28 Lower Fitzwilliam Street, with some kind of proviso saying they realised the buildings had become dangerous, decaying with woodrot, but, nevertheless, if the ESB were to reconstruct they should try to preserve the facade, leaving out all technical difficulties and the practicability of doing it.</P>
    <P>The fact is Dublin Corporation did not do it.  The fact is that great architects have disagreed on the matter and there is no doubt that the experts are not all of one view.  People are quite entitled to feel emotional, as suggested by Deputy A.  Barry, about preserving the Georgian features along the whole of Fitzwilliam Street, Merrion Square and the Holles Street Hospital area. If they wish to feel emotional in that respect, naturally they are entitled to do it but the fact remains that Dublin Corporation have already examined this.</P>
    <P>In 1955 it was recommended that if a new building were to be provided it should not be of a pseudo-Georgian nature.  In 1957, in the draft plan for Dublin, Lower Fitzwilliam Street was clearly excluded as an area for preservation by Dublin Corporation.  So Dublin Corporation, on which the responsibility must entirely rest in the ultimate, had already made up their mind in a very definite way in regard to this question of the demolition of these buildings.</P>
    <P>When the ESB lodged plans for a proposed new building, Dublin Corporation, in their wisdom or unwisdom, refused to accept the plans.  With some modifications, the plans were accepted by the Minister for Local Government on appeal to him.</P>
    <P>That is the history of the whole business.  If we are to have proper planning in this country it is no good trying to divert the responsibility from people who are doing the planning in the next four or five years. It would only result in endless delays and endless pressure groups with different <Col N="317" /> views.  The planning authorities must stay where they are under planning legislation.  Their powers were discussed at great length in this House during the passage of the new Planning Bill of 1963.  If, as a result, some beautiful buildings go, it will be very unfortunate but, nevertheless, the responsibility clearly lies on the planning authorities.  The Minister for Local Government has certain powers as the House well knows, but the initiative must come from the planning people themselves.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I should like to make one or two observations on the usual attack made on a semi-State body whenever anything controversial of this kind arises&mdash;suggestions that the State body is dictatorial, without a sense of responsibility and that the directors are overriding the wishes of the people.  The ESB are a most responsible body.  They may not be perfect but generally speaking they are a very responsible body with a very fine tradition in the history of this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to answer some points made which suggested that the ESB had acted with irresponsibility in regard to this whole question though, as I have said, I still regard Dublin Corporation as having the ultimate responsibility.  It has been suggested that the ESB could move out of Dublin to somewhere else.  If Dublin Corporation had refused to allow them to demolish these buildings, then a new situation would have arisen which would have to be examined afresh, but in actual fact the people who are to work in the new building of the ESB and those working in the present buildings must have an administrative and technical link.  Otherwise there would be enormous cost on the ESB.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the ESB are deceiving me when they say there would be very great technical and administrative difficulties involving the staffs of the present building and the new building. Someone suggested it might be possible to convert some of the houses into flats and that the ESB could take some space behind.  I understand that is not possible&mdash;that the development behind the houses makes it almost impossible <Col N="318" /> to convert these houses into flats.  If the ESB were to sell the whole area it would involve an enormous capital loss.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to get into a controversy with the Deputy but if he imagines it is easy to sell the contents of these houses, with all the technical gear, the cable connections and all the vast amount of technological equipment which is involved in an electrical function of this kind, there is another view about that.  I wanted to mention those facts in relation to the ESB.  I do not believe the ESB has acted unscrupulously in regard to this or that they have acted irresponsibly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not very much more to say, except this: I am very, very keen, and so are a great many of my colleagues, that the most beautiful part of Dublin should be preserved.  I do not need to go into the reasons.  They have been given very adequately by Deputy Dunne and Deputy Dockrell.  Of course, I completely condemn all the suggestions that have been made that because they are Georgian, they are not worth preserving.  Everybody knows the Dublin so-called Georgian architecture is the Irish conception of what, first of all, came from Greece to Italy and then from Italy to England and then from England to Ireland.  It is an international artistic concept which has been expanded and developed in each country through which its influence passed and I do not think there is anything particularly English about it.  That suggestion is ludicrous beyond conception.  A great many traditions came from other countries.  If we were to adopt that attitude, we would demolish our exquisite Romanesque abbeys because <Col N="319" /> the Romanesque arch came originally from the Middle East.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They are well demolished now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>All artistic creation&mdash; including a great part of our Celtic art&mdash;is to some extent an adaptation from some other source with some creative concepts that arise in the country itself&mdash;and everybody knows that.</P>
      <P>I agree with those who say that we want to preserve what is part of our history.  The vast majority of Dublin people would want to preserve what is part of their history in every sense of the term.  The Government, for example, are rebuilding the Royal Hospital at immense cost and it will be a folk museum &mdash; a perfect example of the Government's wish to preserve our historic tradition.  We are also reconstructing part of Dublin Castle at the same time.  There is no desire on the part of the Government to obliterate what is part of our history.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Having said that, I am speaking beyond the motion and with very great feeling.  I do not like to be a pessimist or a prophet of doom. I do not think I am when I am saying this.  I think all the people who have been, in their own view quite rightly, protesting about the preservation of this particular group of houses had better fairly soon form an association to make quite sure that the core of what is best in Georgian architecture in Dublin can be preserved through the Dublin Corporation, under the 1963 Act, declaring certain areas historic monuments, as Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Dunne know the position, because my own belief is, from having talked to architects who are realists about this, that it will be enormously costly to preserve the very central core, the very best of Georgian Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not an architect.  I do not <Col N="320" /> know what constitutes the best architecturally. I do know the enormous cost that has been undertaken by certain institutions in putting into perfect order the very much more perfectly built houses in Merrion Square.  I would not even like to tell the House the expenditure incurred by certain authorities, including a foreign Government, in putting one of these houses into order.  It is going to be a very big problem.  Some of these houses are coming to the natural end of their existence.  I think Deputy Dockrell knows what I am talking about.  It will take a united effort on the part of people who wish to preserve just the central core of Georgian Dublin, one or two of the most beautiful squares, some of the surrounding streets.  It will take all the effort that can be afforded by everybody interested in this matter to preserve these over the next 20 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I say it, and reluctantly, that when in 1957 Dublin Corporation definitely excluded certain streets from preservation at the then phase of the town planning legislation I am afraid they were being realistic because I am afraid it will be very difficult to preserve more than what I have said, the very minimum that is essential to preserve the Dublin we know.  I am not an expert.  I am only using commonsense and the knowledge that I have of certain individual expenditure by various institutions in putting back into order some of the much better houses in Merrion Square. It is a known fact that the houses that are under consideration here were jerry-built.  They were built of very much inferior materials and were of inferior construction to some of the houses in Fitzwilliam Square and some in Merrion Square.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own view is, as I have said, that when this controversy starts arising and when Dublin Corporation has to make the plan for Dublin, this very laudable effort to preserve Georgian Dublin should be concentrated on <Col N="321" /> seeing what can as a whole be preserved so that nobody can tear it down, so that there is a definite part of Dublin to be preserved and part to be rejected reluctantly but simply because of the prohibitive cost of putting it in order.  I believe this task will be very difficult.</P>
    <P>Once again, in conclusion, I say this responsibility must clearly lie with the Dublin Corporation and with the Minister for Local Government.  I hope that when the Town Planning Act, 1963, is taken full advantage of and planning is arranged, there will be a definite final concept and then it will be much easier to deal with individual items than it is at present.  The responsibility, in my view, lies with Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <P>When moving the Second Reading of this Bill, Deputy S. Dunne expressed the opinion in support of his case against demolition that no building that could perhaps provide living accommodation for people should be demolished at the present time.  I, too, am seriously concerned, as every public representative should be, about the plight of the many who are homeless in Dublin city and county today but, personally, I do not see any attempt to purchase, repair and preserve these buildings as providing any sort of worthwhile solution to the housing problem which exists in the city and county.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dunne, as one would expect, made his case ably but it is unfortunate that in doing so he did not present both sides of the picture.  He presented only that side of the picture that is favourable to retention of these buildings. He portrayed the responsible people in the ESB.  He did not describe them as irresponsible vandals but he referred to the &ldquo;vandal plan&rdquo;&mdash;I think those were more or less his words&mdash;of the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this whole rebuilding programme was considered by responsible, cultured and able people in the ESB and that every aspect of it was considered. I believe that in their consideration of the problem they were supported by the best possible professional <Col N="322" /> and technical advice that could be secured.  They, in their wisdom, decided that there was no course open to them except to demolish and rebuild this line of buildings.  I believe this decision was taken after very responsible consideration of the matter and the facts on all sides should be made known so that people will be fully informed of the problems with which they were confronted.  They should not be portrayed as people who are going around seeking to cause destruction, people who disregarded the beauty of the area.  I believe they were very sensitive to beauty and were very anxious to preserve it.  In 1955 this communication was addressed to the ESB:</P>
    <P>The attention of the Dangerous Buildings Inspector concerned, Mr. D. Nolan, was drawn to the condition of the roofs of a number of the above houses, and the Chief Inspector later accompanied him on an inspection of the whole block from Upper Mount Street to Lower Baggot Street.</P>
    <P>These are four storey houses over basements, built, I would say, in the early part of the last century.  They are of a much inferior quality and finish to the houses in Merrion Square and are all occupied by your Board's staff.</P>
    <P>The roofs of Nos. 16, 17, 18, 20, 25, 26, 27 and 28 are badly sagged and grouted, the rafters in some cases being broken, due to overloading with cement grout.</P>
    <P>The back walls of Nos. 26, 27 and 28 are badly bulged and have been secured in a temporary manner by the erection of raking shores.</P>
    <P>The floors of many of the rooms are sagged and the joists are very light; in one case 7&rdquo; x 1½&rdquo; joists cover a span of 20' 6&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In several of the houses there is evidence of recent settlements in the staircase walls and the walls dividing the front and back rooms, due mainly to partial foundation failure and the presence of perished bond timbers.  In Nos. 17 and 18 extensive <Col N="323" /> rebuilding of the walls in the basements has been carried out.</P>
    <P>The next paragraph should be particularly noted:</P>
    <P>A critical stage has now been reached in the lives of these houses, and your Board should consider the advisability of carrying out extensive shoring to the floors, walls and roofs of the affected premises, if it is intended to keep them in continued occupation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dunne has made the case very ably for retaining these buildings and I admire him for it.  We are all anxious to retain the beautiful spots in Dublin, and if this is one of them it should be no exception. However, every side of the question should be considered dispassionately and I am putting the case as I see it for the ESB, that they had to make this decision for which they have been severely criticised.  I am not competent technically nor indeed have I all the information that I require to do that but I know that this line of buildings, or some line of buildings adjacent to it, owned by the ESB contains what is described as the load dispatch department.  I cannot exactly describe what that department is but I know it is the nerve centre of the whole network of the ESB and that it represents in equipment something to the value of £500,000.  That has cost an immense amount of money to instal and it would cost an enormous sum and apparently cause immense disruption if it were to be moved to another site.</P>
      <P>As well as that, I believe the site itself is adequate.  Deputy Dunne made the case that the site was not adequate even when they would be finished. Apparently it is quite adequate, as far as can be estimated, for the coming generation.  The point was also made by Deputy Dunne that there was congestion, that there were car parking difficulties and so on.  Apparently it is proposed to make parking accommodation available for about 175 or 180 cars and no problem is anticipated there.</P>

      <P>That is a traffic problem but if the facilities are not being used by the ESB, they will be used by somebody else, and there will always be a traffic problem in the centre of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the Corporation's decision at some stage to refuse permission should be explained as well. I understand that at the meeting of <Col N="326" /> the Housing Committee of the Corporation at which that decision was taken, there were only four out of ten present and that could hardly be regarded as the considered view of the members of the Dublin Corporation. While I would be extremely anxious to see that no particular area of beauty was unnecessarily destroyed or demolished in the city of Dublin, I believe that in these circumstances the ESB had really no alternative but to demolish these buildings and to rebuild them.  It is the opinion of the responsible people in the ESB that the manner in which they are going to rebuild will, if anything, improve the general appearance of the area. and add much to the present vista.  I am sure there is something in what they say. I do not think they are setting out irresponsibly to destroy something.  The present height of the structure will be the height of the new structure.  The intention is to put up a line of buildings which will harmonise with the area.</P>
    <P>There is this to be said about the ESB tackling this job: if this property were put on the market it is conceivable it would be bought up by a number of interests and there could be then no overall or complete treatment of the area owned by the ESB at the moment.  Every aspect of this matter should, I think, be considered and fair judgment should be brought to bear upon it.  However, if the most eminent professional people cannot agree, it is hard to expect that we, in Dáil Éireann, can agree either.  On the whole, I think the ESB have made the only decision it was open to them to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to state at the outset that in anything I shall say criticising the ESB, I shall not be accusing the ESB of being irresponsible. I may accuse them of having been inefficient at some periods in their activities.  We all have a great admiration for the ESB, more especially on this side of the House because we look on the ESB as the creation of Front Bench Members of this Party.  As Members of Parliament, <Col N="327" /> representing our constituents and the Irish people, we will come in here and criticise the ESB, or any other State or semi-State body, whenever we like, and that applies also to Ministers and their Departments.</P>
      <P>I sometimes ask myself who it is that does these things?  How does a thing like this start?  Who or what causes it?  Whence are these ideas conceived?  Who decides they must have offices and the only place they can find for them is Fitzwilliam Street? When an idea like this is sold to one or two people in the Department, the next step is to sell it to a Minister.  I have noticed that the Minister who is present here now, when his officials make up their minds about something, he will go through with it with a tenacity worthy of better causes.  I have known him to come in here and stand over what some of these faceless men have done in other Departments, even though they were proved wrong time and time again.</P>
      <P>I admit that this may not be the best thing to do, economically speaking, if we are going to count the pennies, but it was the Minister himself who said we should preserve the beauties of this city.  The Minister's whole case and the case of my colleague, Deputy Clinton, is based on the ability of the officials of the ESB to be the arbiters in this matter.  I do not believe these men are infallible. In the city in which I was born and reared, we have a beautiful block built of cut stone by a former mayor in the last century.  Beside it we have planted what I describe as an ESB kiosk.  We have our oldest antiquity at the end of the quay, ancient and hoary old Reginald's Tower, and, right beside it, we have another rough concrete kiosk belonging to the ESB.  Perhaps it was some of the younger architects and engineers who were responsible for this.  Perhaps they are the people behind the scenes who are telling us what to do now with this beautiful Georgian facade in Fitzwilliam Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tried to duck the issue by saying this is a matter for the Minister for Local Government and the Dublin Corporation.  Let us examine the record.  I may have to go <Col N="328" /> a little far back.  Perhaps it would not be a good idea to leave it to the Dublin Corporation.  There is a stain on the escutcheon of the Dublin Corporation where the beauties of Dublin are concerned and that stain will take some rubbing out.  I refer to the bridge erected with the permission of the Dublin Corporation and spelling the complete ruination of one of the most beautiful river vistas in Europe.</P>

      <P>I know.  Times change, but men go on making the same mistakes.  It is with the greatest respect I say what I say now to the Minister.  We have been told about the utility of the project; we will have to count the pennies.  Everything that is not useful must be destroyed.  If someone comes in and hands in a report saying there is woodworm and the building is falling to pieces, the only thing to do is to take it down, break it up, and wreck it.  I am very glad surveyors went in to survey the <i>Asgard.</i> I am very glad they did not work along these lines.  They did not consider whether it was an economic proposition to restore the <i>Asgard.</i> They regarded the matter in the right light and they made the proper decision.</P>
      <P>This beautiful facade in Fitzwilliam Street should not be destroyed.  Even if the ESB preserved the facade and built the offices behind them&mdash;they have all their wonderful plant and machinery behind Fitzwilliam Street&mdash; I still think the best thing they could do is to shift the whole lot out.  Otherwise, they will be adding to Dublin's traffic problem in concentrating a large number of officials, technicians, and so on, there every day of the year. That is the kind of planning we should be thinking about when we are thinking of our capital city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the Minister to task on something else.  The Minister says we must have this.  I would say to the Minister that he must allow us as Irishmen coming from all parts of Ireland to have a certain interest.  This is our capital city.  We are very proud of it. <Col N="329" /> It is a magnificent experience to bring visitors or friends into Dublin and go through the wonderful Georgian squares.  If a group of architects, engineers or experts went into the General Post Office and said the building was no good for its present purpose and that it should be pulled down so that we could erect a modern building, with more storeys to it, I wonder what our reaction would be.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Timmons and the Minister talking tonight about pressure groups.  I wish Ministers would stop talking about pressure groups.  It is the right of the people to band together and bring their case before their own Parliament.  As long as we have pressure groups in this country, or what the Minister calls pressure groups, we will have a country; but when people band themselves together and make a request to a Parliament, that is not lobbying as we regard lobbying.  The picture I have is of professional people in Washington bringing pressure to bear on various Congressmen and Senators.</P>

What I was saying was that if Deputy Dunne's Bill was passed, the various pressure groups operating on the Dublin Corporation, the Minister for Local Government and on the Members of the Dáil who, according to the Bill, would have the ultimate decision in regard to certain buildings, would simply cause confusion.  I have no objection to pressure groups.</P>

Ministers come in here and refer to &ldquo;my officials&rdquo;, &ldquo;my officers&rdquo; and &ldquo;my engineers&rdquo; and that is like speaking <i>ex cathedra.</i> More heed should be paid to what people have to say and when people come to us as Deputies, we always look to see <Col N="330" /> if they are responsible people.  Surely Desmond Guinness, who got the Georgian Society together, could not be called irresponsible?  These are people with a great love for Dublin. They set up the greatest industry that we have and to which we can look proudly.  These are people whose generosity is boundless when it comes to Dublin.  This is the family which gave us St. Stephen's Green, the family that built flats for workers before anybody else thought about that.  Surely when a member of that family brought together a group interested in the period architecture of Dublin, he should not be passed by lightly?</P>

      <P>I will give the Minister credit because from what he said tonight, I can see he realises the beauty and worth of the Merrion Square houses and the St. Stephen's Green houses, but if we knock these down lightly, it will be like the beginning of the knocking down of the lesser abbeys in England.  They all went in the end. A stand should be made.  The Minister said that this would come under the 1963 Planning Act.  It will not look after these houses.  Even though that Act is a good one, I do not think local authorities will be able to apply it for a long time.  It is no use the Minister <Col N="331" /> stating that this is a matter for the Minister for Local Government; this is a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power who told us that he was responsible for his Departments and the ESB comes under one of those Departments.</P>
      <P>What I should like the Minister to do is to get the ESB to go out to virgin land and build their offices there, making them sufficiently large to allow for expansion.  That is what has been done in the great cities of America.  They no longer want to build blocks of offices or new skyscrapers in the centre of New York but to get out to areas in which there are parking facilities and so on and where it is easier to reach the offices. Recently an insurance company here built offices on the banks of the canal. They were looking to the future.  If they had acquired a site in O'Connell Street or Westmoreland Street and knocked down houses and built a skyscraper, you would nearly have to fight your way into the city to get into them.  If such a trend is allowed to continue, it will be impossible to get into Dublin.  The next thing they will be faced with will be the erection of fly-overs to bring traffic in and out of the city.</P>
      <P>Last night when listening to Deputy Dunne, I heard him mention that the curator of the Soame Museum was one of the experts who condemned this facade.  I want to register a protest against that gentleman coming over here and making such a statement.  I frequently visit the museum where he is the curator and it is a beautiful house.  It was the property of Sir John Soame who was one of England's great architects and he built what he thought was a perfect house and filled it with great treasures, including a great number of Hogarth originals.  He has put them in a very small picture gallery with a glass roof overhead and you just turn them over as you would the pages of a book.  The man who is in charge of this museum would not preserve these houses at all; yet he is in charge of one of the finest period houses in London.  I would not accept his views on this at all.</P>

The Minister says that the Dáil and Government Departments should not enter into the planning of Dublin, that it is a matter for Dublin Corporation. It certainly is.  But whether these houses stand or fall is now a matter for the Minister.  If he wishes, the Minister can give a direction to the ESB.  He is the man in charge of ESB.</P>

The Minister will go up with a pickaxe and knock out the first brick.  This type of expert has been proved wrong in the past.  I can tell a story about my own city which is relevant to this.  It concerns a magnificent building in Waterford. Experts said it was about to fall down. The man who could decide whether it would go or not did not want to knock it down.  He loved this beautiful building.  The experts brought him there one day and a piece of plaster fell on his head.  Then another piece. He did not know the scoundrels were dropping the plaster down.  Eventually, he decided the building was dangerous and that the experts must be right. He said: &ldquo;All right; this must go. We will build a new cathedral.&rdquo; They knocked down the old Danish cathedral in Waterford, but they had to blow it down with gunpowder.</P>

      <P>I am giving the Minister an instance of where the experts have been proved wrong.  I also direct his attention to the fact that other beautiful houses in this city have been saved.  We have that lovely house in William Street belonging to the Old Dublin Society.  The Minister has produced an expert who says that these houses in Fitzwilliam Street must come down.  The main reason why they should not come down is to preserve the vista.  The reason the Minister <Col N="334" /> says they must come down is that the ESB must build their offices there. The ESB should follow the American trend and go out to the &ldquo;green belt&rdquo;. They would have more room for expansion and their staffs would be better satisfied.</P>
      <P>The Minister tells us that this is a matter for the Minister for Local Government, but the Minister for Local Government does not give two hoots for these houses.  I know the Minister for Transport and Power has a grá, as Deputy Burke would say, for this type of house.  When I heard him speaking feelingly about these Georgian houses, I thought he was going to say he would look into this matter and that he would come back and tell us the ESB were going to do what we would hope they would do.</P>

      <P>The reason for bringing in this section is to deal with cases where agreements are defective or have been mislaid.  Where an allotment has been made by a purchase agreement, the usual method of vesting is by fiat of the Land Commission but some difficulties have arisen where an agreement is defective and it is not practical to have a new one completed, or where an agreement has been mislaid.  Some purchase agreements have been filled with junior office staff and it can happen that there was some mistake. If agreements have been mislaid, or some mistake is discovered, this difficulty has arisen and the easier remedy is to use a vesting order.  Some doubt has been expressed as to the validity of a vesting order where there was in existence a valid purchase agreement although it was lost.  The Deputy will appreciate that this is enabling procedure to deal with a practical difficulty that has arisen and to save trouble and expense where such difficulties have arisen.  That is the purpose of the section.</P>

      <P>This section is <Col N="336" /> designed to recoup from the Exchequer deficiencies arising mainly on remote islands and other such lands.  I welcome that provision.  No doubt it will give considerable relief to a number of persons whose circumstances can be described as bad.  We had the experience some time ago of a number of islanders off the coast of Galway who were sent to Limerick Jail for refusing to pay rates.  In similar circumstances. I feel they will be covered by this section.  Perhaps the Minister will give us a guarantee in that regard.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister hold out any hope that the section will cover people in congested districts, when they are confined under this Bill, whose land is of very poor quality, where the Land Commission or the Minister can be satisfied that it is yielding no great financial return to the owner, or whether due to family circumstances or other circumstances, it would be a hardship on such a person to make a payment.  I would be glad if such persons are covered under this section. Does the Minister hope to extend this section and, if so, can he tell the House who is likely to benefit from it. If people such as the islanders to whom I have referred will get relief under this section, I welcome it.  Naturally, Deputies on this side of the House are extremely anxious to help and facilitate persons whose circumstances are similar to the circumstances of the persons on the islands off the coast of Galway.  If the Minister can give us any further information we would be grateful.</P>

      <P>The section deals with the legal position so far as annuities are concerned and has nothing to do with rates, which are the concern of the local authorities, except in so far as the law provides for reimbursement to the local authorities where there was a deficiency in the guarantee fund which was set up to ensure that deficiencies in annuities did not finally fall on the rates.  The position is that the Land Commission have found it impracticable to collect annuities due out of certain holdings situated almost entirely in islands which are difficult of access.  As time runs out, they will <Col N="337" /> lose all title to these annuities which will cease to exist.  An annuity which has ceased cannot be a charge to the guarantee fund but we want to legislate positively about this matter.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, we can say that this section is in relief of certain liabilities on local authorities in respect of those people whose annuities cannot be collected on these islands.  The annuities which were formerly proper to the Purchase Annuities Fund accrued to the benefit of the Exchequer and they will now be lost to it.  No action is necessary in this matter. Where, however, the local loans fund or the land bond fund are affected it is necessary to provide a compensating source of income.  We are concerned here with these cases on these remote islands.  It is a relief to the local authority in respect of these people.  Deputies who are familiar with these islands know that in many cases the people do not pay rates at all.  Some pay and some do not pay. In many cases they do not pay annuities.  This is to relieve local authorities in cases of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section, it is proposed that the Land Commission should have power, on consent, to order the consolidation of any two or more holdings; that such holdings should become one for virtually all purposes and that they should be registered as one holding in the Land Registry under the Registration of Title Act.  The present legal position is that section 66 of the Land Act, 1923, provides only for the consolidation of lands subject to land purchase annuity.  Therefore, consolidations cannot ordinarily be effected with lands which were never subject to annuity or on which the annuities have been redeemed or amortised.  Allotments made on a cash basis cannot be consolidated with other lands held by the allottee. As part of the general land structure reform, and in keeping with the global subdivision control proposed in section <Col N="338" /> 12 of the Bill, it is desirable that there should be power to effect consolidation in all suitable cases without regard to these rather irrelevant technical considerations.</P>
      <P>This section depends on the consent of the owner or the proprietor.  The Land Commission will not be able compulsorily to consolidate his two or three holdings unless the owner is willing to do so.  Of course, this generally happens where the Land Commission are giving him some inducement to do so, in addition, by way of housing loan or by way of rearrangement.  It generally arises in that way.  It has happened in a number of cases that there is fragmentation, although the owner would wish consolidation, because of the different types of title under which he holds the different patches of land and it is to secure that situation that this secion is here.</P>

      <P>This section is designed to eliminate a source of dissatisfaction to landowners who receive payment in land bonds.  The Minister, no doubt, in his professional capacity, which is of long standing, and in his experience as Minister for Lands, will agree that there has been a good deal of dissatisfaction on the part of persons whose lands are acquired by the Land Commission and who are paid in land bonds.  I feel that over the years this has not been any great encouragement to the owners of land.  The Land Commission now have such a steady pool of land that we have instances of cash payments as compared to the amounts available for payment in land bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past, a good deal of hardship was imposed on persons whose lands fell into the hands of the Land Commission and who were obliged to take payment in land bonds.  Let us hope <Col N="339" /> that the dissatisfaction which has prevailed in the past in this regard will now finish and that on the passage of this Bill that very genuine grievance will be eliminated.  There have been many instances of landowners establishing to the Land Commission and to others very genuine grievances in this regard.  For that reason, we welcome any change that may do good.</P>
    <P>If the section we are now debating will relieve or, indeed, completely eliminate the dissatisfaction which existed in the past we may consider it a step in the right direction.  The Minister, the officers of his Department and, indeed, any Deputy who has been connected with the acquisition of land and particularly who came in contact with the owners of such land know that the position in the past has been most unsatisfactory in so far as the payment of land bonds is concerned. For that reason, we may hope that this section will eliminate any such grievances and that the persons who are dealing with the Land Commission will now have the guarantee from the Minister on this section that the unsatisfactory state of affairs that prevailed in many instances in the past will be remedied and that there is no likelihood of such grievances and dissatisfaction prevailing in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see the fair play in the Government's paying for land with land bonds and paying for everything else they buy with money. I cannot see why, if the Government buy a farm for £10,000 for land division, they cannot pay for that land with money and thus place the person who has received the money in the position of being able immediately to reinvest it or, indeed, perhaps to buy property which he can work himself to earn his living.  Land bonds are not an easily saleable commodity.  The unpopularity of the land bonds has to do with the trend in interest rates over the years.  From that point of view, it is perhaps not the fault of the people who first drew up this system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As interest rates went over the years, it is a fact that if you wanted to sell some land bonds that in earlier years <Col N="340" /> were issued at an interest rate as low as 3¾ per cent in some instances, you had to take something like £78 for £100 worth of land bonds.  Surely this is unjust.  This section goes a little way towards looking after any change in interest rates that might occur in between the agreement on price and the actual issue of the land bonds.  But can anybody, in fairness, see why the Government for below-the-line of expenditure should, for instance, pay something like a fertiliser subsidy to a fertiliser manufacturer in cash and when they take a man's farm, pay for it in land bonds?  I cannot see why.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this case may be made more appropriately on the next section and I shall try to expand it then but this small step forward holds out very little hope for those who might expect to get a fair deal from the Land Commission. Stocks and shares of all kinds can be fashionable and unfashionable and land bonds are notoriously unfashionable. From that point of view, you will find that a land bond that might bear just as good an interest rate as another security will not be as easily or readily saleable.  I feel that sections 25 and 26 could have been incorporated in a section providing that the Government would pay cash. I know the advantage to the Government that it does not have to provide a capital sum on the purchase of lands. By a simple book-keeping entry, it can postpone payment of this capital sum for a long period and by funding it in the charge for below-the-line expenditure that is made in the Budget each year, it can more easily produce from the Exchequer the money needed to purchase lands.</P>
    <P>This is not fair play for those who would prefer to have money which is always negotiable and which they could invest perhaps in industrial securities where they would have a chance of appreciation as inflation decreases the value of money.  This is the snag about any land bond: it remains the same.  If £100 is given in land bonds and if inflation goes on as it is going, on redemption the bonds will be worth something like £30.  That is the record.  The £1 today is worth something like 3/4d. or 3/8d. compared <Col N="341" /> with its value before the First World War.  If this trend continues&mdash;if it does not, every Government in the world and a lot of people will go broke &mdash;the issue of land bonds is completely unfair to the person who, mark you, is not a willing seller.  In 50 per cent of cases, those who sell land to the Land Commission are not willing sellers. Yet, when it comes to payment, the buyer decides on the form of payment. That is unjust and I intend to develop the point further on the next section because I believe that many people&mdash; very often old people&mdash;who depend entirely for their income on the interest rate on money they will get for their land are left in the position of having a steadily depreciating asset which they cannot sell.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I had better put on record the position under existing law, which is that land bonds were created under section 4(2) of the Land Bond Act of 1934 to supply the need over a specified period, usually the calendar year.  All prices agreed or fixed in the period specified are payable in bonds of that particular series. If, between the date of fixation and the date of possession, a new series of bonds is created with a higher interest rate, the owner or tenant feels aggrieved.  He may not unreasonably say the action of the Minister for Finance in creating a better bond has depreciated the earlier bonds and it is to cure that situation that this section is here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position generally about bonds is that we used roughly £1 million worth of bonds in the purchase of land last year in comparison with approximately £200,000 in cash.  Deputies may recollect that only in certain instances may the Land Commission purchase in cash under the 1950 Land Act.  There must be a rearrangement of holdings involved.  In many cases they are precluded from using cash for this purpose. These disabilities are being wiped out under other provisions of this Bill but I should like to point out to Deputy Donegan that at least 50 per cent of the land acquired in this fashion last year was acquired by voluntary agreement, which means <Col N="342" /> that the owners, who knew their business, were satisfied to accept payment in land bonds.</P>
    <P>I should also remind the House that however one may criticise fixed interest securities, the land bonds are Government securities with a six per cent yield which is fair enough and in accordance with the present day money market.  Deputy Donegan may be under a misapprehension about the next section because I do not propose to move it as I have already introduced and got passed through the Oireachtas a new Land Bond Bill under which we are creating £10 million worth of new land bonds.</P>
    <P>There is also this to be said about land bonds generally.  I considered how much of them might be used for the purchase of land and whether the system should be changed.  As somebody concerned with land division, I think it would be a very dangerous change to make.  The temptation to any Government who might find themselves in financial straits in future to cut back on the Land Commission and save a couple of million pounds in cash would be very grave.  I therefore regard the system we have of utilising land bonds as an insurance that the programme of land acquisition and division will be reasonably safe in the future as far as land bond creation is concerned and there will not be the temptation for a Minister for Finance in times of financial stringency to save at the expense of the land programme on which the country has embarked.</P>
    <P>It is the intention to issue the new land bonds in different series from time to time so that if there are changes, as has been suggested, in money values, such changes can be taken into consideration.  As things are now, most reasonable people will agree that a guaranteed rate of six per cent gives a reasonable return.  Steps are taken so far as possible to keep these bonds at par and they have been running at or about par fairly consistently in recent times.  I think Deputies will see this if they look at the records.</P>
    <P>I agree that many years ago there was a great sense of grievance.  I agree that people were paid in land <Col N="343" /> bonds when the price was very depressed but I would regard, as Minister for Lands, and indeed as a member of any Government, that practice as being unrealistic financially.  I have had experience of courts and of judges taking that matter into consideration in fixing certain values.  I do not believe there is any provision in law for them to do so.  Anybody familiar with the operation of these courts realises that that was done and it would be beyond human nature to expect a judge to ignore a very depressed form of currency if, on the other hand, he had to operate to give what was laid down by law as the market value for the land. So, whatever may have been the position in the past&mdash;and I accept there was hardship some years ago&mdash;that practice has now changed by the issue of different series of land bonds from time to time.  We have now provision for the issue of £10 million of them and Deputies need not fear the old position returning to us.</P>
    <P>At all events, if this trend continues, there will be more and more land coming in voluntarily from people who are obviously satisfied with payment in land bonds.  Secondly, the provisions in this Bill provide for more and more cash for land and the restrictions on cash proportions, which formerly existed, will be removed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Minister's position in this matter as his Government and himself have decided on this course of action but it is not fair play.  When the Minister says 50 per cent was acquired by the Land Commission last year, I would make two comparisons on that.  I would say, first of all, if you find a firm in voluntary liquidation, does that mean they want to liquidate?  I believe in 99 cases out of 100 they did not want to do so but circumstances forced them to do so.  That is the case in a very high percentage of the sales of land to the Land Commission.  They have to accept payment for the land in land bonds and later they find themselves in the same position as the company which goes into voluntary liquidation. <Col N="344" /> The real truth is that it is a misnomer. The people who sold land last year were not the people who wanted to sell.  These people had no choice but to accept the land bonds or, if they had the choice, it was to fight and accept a lower cash value and so their decision was that it was better to accept land bonds than to fight.</P>
      <P>I had a chat with a solicitor at home recently.  He said every old age pensioner who is knocked down by a car nowadays and gets a sum of money wants you to put it in industrials. When you put things in industrials, the value of the company and its earning power increases.  As inflation reduces the value of money, so the value of shares increases.  Land bonds, as I said, are notoriously unsaleable.  We have land being acquired by the Land Commission and being paid for by land bonds, which are steadily declining in value.  When the proposed time for redemption arrives, the money refunded is much less at the redemption date.  This to me is unfair.  It is an indication that these people whose land has been taken by the Land Commission are in fact second-class citizens.</P>
      <P>A Government cheque goes out for every other item.  How would civil servants like it if portion of their wages were paid in land bonds or work bonds?  This practice has gone on in this country for the past 25 years. I was speaking with a businessman a relative of whose was in negotiation with the Land Commission.  This matter will no doubt be concluded by voluntary sale which I do not believe is voluntary sale.  This man said to me, on the question of land bonds: &ldquo;All over the years, each Government has robbed the sellers and now you expect us to sell.&rdquo; If you give somebody frozen assets in practice all they are going to get is a steadily depreciating rate of interest, whether it is six per cent, five per cent or less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land bonds are not saleable.  It is true to say you can sell a Government loan, a National Loan, much more easily than you can sell land bonds.  I cannot see that the figure of six per cent mentioned by the Minister is a fair figure.  If the Minister has money, <Col N="345" /> he can buy stock for it.  He can buy it for £98 and take it out at par at three months' notice.  Any increase of interest rate would affect his investment and any inflation would reduce the value of the £.  Here we are with six per cent land bonds and the Government bookkeeping means we can spend £1 million next year in bonds and only pay out £200,000 in cash for cash purchases.  All we have to do over the next 30 years, whatever its redemption date, is to increase that amount.  The fact that the first Cumann na nGaedheal Government did it, the fact that the 1944 Act did it, does not ring a bell with me.  If this very important Bill goes through and becomes an Act, it will bring in many changes.  We, on this side of the House, would certainly be very pleased if the Minister would tell us in relation to this £1 million in bonds, of which he says £500,000 was paid out on voluntary sales, how many of the sellers were in fact in a position to refuse?  I am sure the records in his Department could give us the answer to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree in the case of the purchase of all land from land owners to give some choice as to whether they should be paid in land bonds or in cash?  It may be that some land owners prefer to be paid in six per cent land bonds.  I have no doubt that is the case.  Very recently an extensive farmer in my constituency who was a customer of mine was selling his farm to the Land Commission but he was selling it on the condition that he would be paid in land bonds. It may be there are people who elect to be paid in this fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to make a serious endeavour to eliminate grievances in regard to the payments for land in land bonds, perhaps there should be a new approach to the Land Commission, requesting them to inquire from the owner whether or not he desires to be paid in cash or in land bonds.  If he desires to be paid in hard cash, pay him that way and let the moneys be provided annually under the Estimate for the Department of Lands.  On the other hand, if he elects <Col N="346" /> to be paid in land bonds, that is his business.  That is what he finds more satisfactory to meet his and his family's requirements.  If people themselves elect to be paid in land bonds, they cannot afterwards say that they find the position unsatisfactory.  That is their own business.  If they desire to be paid in cash, that is their own affair. In order to facilitate land owners in this regard, the Land Commission should endeavour to leave the choice as to what form of payment they wanted to the land owners, giving them full market value for their property.</P>

      <P>The only difficulty I have experienced in my time was in dealing with small lots.  My experience is that it has been difficult to get the full par price for small lots but we experience no difficulty in selling any reasonably-sized lot of these six per cent land bonds, nor do people find any difficulty in using them as a full gilt-edged security in raising money from banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very fine for Deputy Donegan to talk about industrial equities and you can draw out the argument for donkey's years as to whether somebody should go for security with a fixed interest rate guaranteed by Government or whether <Col N="347" /> he should take the chance in the rough and tumble of the industrial market. Deputy Donegan may be fortunate enough not to have been holding industrial equities when he saw this awful notice, which he mentioned&mdash;in voluntary liquidation.  If he had, he would have had a different view as to whether he was wise or otherwise in investing in land bonds or taking his chance in the industrial jungle.  That is a decision each and every individual must make for himself in this field.</P>
    <P>I want to say this about the amount of these bonds used last year in voluntary sales.  To my own knowledge, in several voluntary sales in respect of which bonds were paid, they were not the type Deputy Donegan alleges and would have to be sold to the Land Commission anyhow.  Let me emphasise that under existing law and until it is changed in this Bill, they can buy at public auction only in certain limited circumstances.  In many places, to my knowledge, they were not able to buy at public auction but they came along to the owner afterwards, or the auctioneer and made a deal and that was a voluntary sale which was paid for in land bonds.  There were many of these transactions.  I am glad to say they are on the increase and there is every indication that this type of voluntary sale will increase.  It is also true to say that more land will be purchased for cash because of the removal of those legal disabilities which spring from the Land Commission in regard to public purchases under the 1950 Land Act.</P>
    <P>This section makes the provision that if the Land Commission issue a series in one year at six per cent and if there happens to be a sudden fluctuation in the money market and the next issue goes up by one quarter, then a man whose land in the first instance was taken over at £x in land bonds would have the privilege of being paid at 6¼ per cent if there was a new issue before his title was proved and taken over by the Land Commission.  The complaints in past years arose from the fact that there was one issue at the same rate for too long, without new issues at a higher rate to keep in realistic <Col N="348" /> touch with the money market existing.  All I can say of this is to assure the House that it is our intention in the Land Bond Bill to keep the land bonds at reasonable parity with the money market as it exists from time to time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had the experience the Minister thinks I might have had, namely, in stocks and shares. I never had anything but a large overdraft. The Minister speaks again about this question of voluntary sale after an auction.  If the Land Commission has interest in land with the powers they have, and will have when this Bill becomes law, it will be quite impossible to think of anything like a voluntary sale.  We had a long discussion, and a vote, here yesterday on a section which will allow the Minister to have lands inspected, and which will freeze these lands for six months.  On the first occasion he was going to freeze them for 12 months.  This is the position the voluntary seller might find himself in when he comes to deal with an officer of the Land Commission. Supposing one of us here met Cassius Clay and he said: &ldquo;Come in, Deputy so and so, or Minister for Lands, and have a bottle of beer.&rdquo; He then catches the Deputy by the shirt, drags him in and shoves a glass of beer in his face.  Is that Deputy voluntarily going in for a bottle of beer?  I was looking for a Pioneer pin on Deputy Dolan's lapel.  In the circumstances I have outlined, would Deputy Carter be going in voluntarily for that bottle of beer?</P>

      <P>This is the situation the seller will find himself in with the Land Commission.  The Land Commission can walk in and say: &ldquo;You sell me your land&rdquo;.  That man goes to his solicitor and is advised, but at the snap of a finger, the Minister can have the land inspected and that land is frozen for 12 months and that can go on for years and years.  Would that not be a most involuntary sale, paid for by land bonds?  That sale is no <Col N="349" /> more voluntary than would Deputy Carter's consumption of the bottle of beer forced on him by Cassius Clay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">

      <P>It is a very poor simile. We do not believe that for a moment on this side of the House.  An infant would not believe it.  We do not believe there is coercion in the makeup of the Land Commission.  What the Deputy has said is all nonsense. That has been proved time and time again.  If Deputy Donegan lived in the midlands he would be pleased to note that the vendor, the seller of land, is usually glad to see Land Commission officials present.  That condemns completely Deputy Donegan's argument about this matter of coercion, of voluntary or involuntary liquidation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made a comparison in regard to industrial equities.  We all know there is no comparison: we all know that a gilt-edged security remains a gilt-edged security and that industrial or commercial equities are regarded as high risks in the investor's mind because, as the Deputy says, the company can be in voluntary or involuntary liquidation within a week.  The fact that the Minister has tried in this section to bring land bonds up to date reminds us that during the period of the past three or four years the land bond market has been very still.  For that reason, it is wrong to say, and especially wrong to have it go out from this House, that there is anything wrong in accepting land bonds.  The farmers of this country are not fools. Therefore, I suggest that Deputy Donegan should amend his argument.</P>

The truth about it is that the average increase in share value, because of inflation in the British Isles, has been something of the order of six or seven per cent during the past ten years.  In other words, an industrial share worth 100/- ten years ago is now worth 107/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section which we consider to be not alone objectionable but absolutely undesirable. Let us consider for a moment the implications of this section.  It provides that power to decide on an inspection of land with a view to possible acquisition may properly be delegated by the Minister for Lands to an official of the Land Commission not below the rank of senior inspector. This is supposedly designed to expedite acquisition proceedings.  That is the excuse of the Minister.  To us it means we have now reached the stage in the history of this country where provision is being made in a Land Act to give such extraordinary power to the political head of a Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had in this country the British Government, the Cumann na <Col N="351" /> nGaedheal Government, the Fianna Fáil Government, the inter-Party Government of 1948 to 1951, again a Fianna Fáil Government, again in 1954 an inter-Party Government and now another Fianna Fáil Government, but this is the first time a Government have sought to place this extraordinary power in the hands of the political head of the Department.</P>
    <P>This is a dangerous power to put in the hands of any man.  Power to order an inspection of any man's land with a view to acquisition is something this House should never give to any individual Member of the House.  The Minister for Lands has been very cute in his alibi when seeking this power.  He says he wants it simply to expedite acquisition.  It is as good an excuse as any, but it is not the real reason why this extraordinary power is being sought.  It means that if any deputation make strong representations from any area to the Minister for Lands, without having due regard to the circumstances of an individual landowner the Minister may order an inspection.  I put this to the Minister: why not leave the position as it is where it is the Land Commission who order an inspection?  Who up to now has authorised the various officials of the Land Commission to carry out inspections?</P>
    <P>In my experience of dealing with the Land Commission, particularly over the past 22 years, I have found on every occasion that it was the Land Commission who ordered a senior inspector to carry out an inspection and were as independent of the Minister for Lands in this regard as they were of any Deputy.  But the Land Commission were always prepared up to now to listen to representations made by Deputies or by the general public or by landowners, their organisations and associations, their clergy, their solicitors or anybody who elected to speak on their behalf or on behalf of those who might be seeking land. On every occasion it was the Land Commission that decided when a farm would be inspected for the purpose of acquisition.</P>
    <P>Section 27 of this Bill entitles the <Col N="352" /> Minister for Lands to delegate an officer to inspect lands with a view to acquisition.  Does that mean that the Minister for Lands will have his own selected officers in his Department for the purpose of carrying out these inspections?  Up to now inspections have been carried out on the instructions of the Commissioners.  The change which the Minister is now seeking to introduce under this section is that it will be for him to select whatever senior officer he wishes.  Naturally enough, he is going to convey to the senior officer the reasons for carrying out the inspection or, as Minister, he will be entitled to withhold the reasons and merely give an instruction to a senior inspector of his Department to carry out an inspection.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain to the House why the Commissioners cannot delegate an officer to do this?  Why must it be the Minister?  Is this now a disclosure that the Minister for Lands has no confidence in the men who are authorising inspection of lands?  Is it the case that the Minister for Lands will make a confession to this House tonight that the inspections that have been authorised by the Land Commission to date have not been authorised in a satisfactory manner and that, because of that, he is now asking the House to give him the greatest power that this House has ever been asked to give to any Minister and the most dangerous power, that is, the right to send an inspector to inspect any man's land for the purpose of acquisition, for the purpose of reducing its value, for the purpose of arousing an organised effort by neighbours to secure land that might be divided, or, as might quite likely happen, on the eve of a general election, for the Minister to authorise a team of inspectors to go to any part of the country and inspect various farms, just as we have promises about the drainage of the Shannon and so on, for electioneering purposes?  In the knowledge of the fact that there are always more applicants for land than there are owners, the Minister would be sufficiently cute to send his inspectors to places where there is the greatest need, the greatest hunger, for land, <Col N="353" /> so as to make an effort to build up the local organisation of which the Minister may be a member.  That is disgraceful and dishonest.  It is a trick being incorporated into legislation by the House.  It is dangerous and mean. Section 27 of this Bill is a section which the House should seriously consider rejecting.</P>
    <P>I can see an even greater danger. The Minister for Lands as the political head of the Department is now going to authorise senior officers of his Department to inspect land but he told us last night, and he will probably repeat tonight, that it is the Land Commission that must acquire the lands, not he.  The Secretary of his Department, a civil servant, is to be one of the Land Commissioners.  How can a proper decision be given by the Land Commission if the Minister for Lands authorises the Secretary of his Department to authorise a senior officer to carry out an inspection and to report back to him, as Secretary of the Department, so that he may sit in judgment on the report, as chief inspector and senior civil servant of the Department?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands has already made it clear in this Bill and elsewhere that the Secretary of the Department of Lands is to be a Commissioner. Therefore, if the Secretary sends for one of his officials and tells him to carry out an inspection of a farm and to have the report delivered within 48 hours, that the Minister is interested and has ordered the inspection and is anxious that no time be lost in making a report available, immediataely that will convey, directly or indirectly, to the official that the Minister wants a favourable report. Assuming that the senior official does not give the report as the Minister wants it but furnishes a broadminded, honest report, it is bad, unsound and very dangerous that the Secretary of the Department should sit as a Commissioner to decide whether or not the lands are to be acquired.</P>
    <P>I have raised before the point as to whether or not the Secretary of the Department should be a Commissioner. I want to make it clear that I raise this matter out of no disrespect to the <Col N="354" /> present holder of that office, who is one of the most eminent authorities on land and one of the most qualified men in Ireland to occupy the position of Land Commissioner.  Nevertheless, it is wrong in principle that the head civil servant of a Department should have judicial decision on reports of officers who are under him and who are paid for carrying out his instructions and requests.  I feel the Minister has not considered sufficiently the serious consequences that this section is likely to have and the embarrassment it is likely to cause to the Secretary of his Department, whoever he may be.</P>
    <P>In the past, Secretaries of the Minister's Department have sat as Commissioners but, if they have, the Minister had not the power he is seeking in this Bill.  That is the difference.  Nobody in this House or outside it has any objection to the Secretary of the Department of Lands being a Commissioner. It is quite true that the Secretary of the Department of Lands must be kept up to date on all the activities of the Land Commission and we grant that the Secretary of the Department is kept fully informed of all such activities, but there are now new circumstances, circumstances which have not previously existed.  The Minister told us some time ago that the Secretary of the Department of Lands must be a Commissioner.  However desirable that may be normally, it is absolutely undesirable when the Minister has the power and the authority which he seeks under this section. The Minister knows very well that the circumstances in which either Mr. Deegan was or Mr. O'Brien is a Commissioner&mdash;the latter is at present a Commissioner &mdash; are made entirely new by the introduction of this section.</P>
    <P>The House is very eagerly awaiting a full explanation from the Minister as to the real reasons why he is seeking this power.  When I was speaking on another section of this Bill I made reference to the fact that this is a power being vested in the Minister which could lead to very serious abuses.  From time to time Governments change and Ministers change and while we may <Col N="355" /> have a guarantee from the Minister for Lands that he will act in the most commendable manner in relation to his order of inspections, we have no guarantee that his successor will do that.  Once this is on the Statute Book we have no guarantee that others who may occupy the exalted position of Minister for Lands will not order inspections at random for party political purposes.</P>
    <P>I do not see any Fianna Fáil farmer Deputy in the House at the moment but assuming any member is the owner of an extensive farm that could be the subject of an inspection on an order by the Minister, I feel this provision is one which should be very seriously opposed.  Everyone in this House knows the record which the Fianna Fáil Party have where threats and intimidation are concerned.  The greatest weapon of intimidation is the weapon which the Minister for Lands seeks in this section, the right to order an inspection of the lands of any landowner in Ireland, and the moment the section is passed it gives a feeling of insecurity to every landowner in Ireland who is not Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I put this to the Minister for Lands. What is to stop the Minister for Lands, when this section is passed, sending for one of his inspectors and saying: &ldquo;Go down and inspect the lands of Mr. So-and-So.  He is an active speaker in the Fine Gael Party&rdquo;&mdash;or in the Labour Party or in any other Party&mdash;&ldquo;and the moment you go down and inspect his land that will quieten him and keep him from speaking too loudly against the Party of which I, as Minister for Lands, am a member.  I can deprive him of every acre of his land if I so desire, and even if I do not intend to deprive him of his land I can make it embarrassing for him among his neighbours.  I can reduce the value of his farm overnight once I have the foot of any of the Land Commission inspectors inside his fence&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>On the other hand, assuming there was a Fine Gael Government and that the Minister for Lands, whether it would be myself or Deputy Donegan, authorised an inspection of the farm of the Minister for Agriculture at <Col N="356" /> Raheny, I imagine the very first man to be up in arms against the inspection of his establishment by a Fine Gael Minister for Lands would be the Minister for Agriculture himself.  I am sorry the Minister for Agriculture is not here tonight for the purpose of realising the danger in which his farm at Raheny might be.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party who are landowners have not taken a more serious interest in this section of the Bill.  It is wrong for any political Party to have such an extraordinary power and I only want to repeat what the Leader of this Party has said time and again, that is, that the right of inspectors to enter any man's farm should be on the invitation of the owner of the holding.  It is only right to place on record that after the next general election one of the first acts of the new Government will be to repeal this section.  The Minister is trying to convey down the country that this is a Bill designed to wage war on the 100-acre farm but this section is as detrimental to the man who owns five, ten or 20 acres as it is to the man who owns 300 acres.</P>
    <P>I want to say with the authority of the Fine Gael Party that this is a power which nobody seeks and nobody has ever sought, except the present Minister for Lands, and that it is a power which the next Government will repeal so as to put back into the hands of the Land Commissioners the right to cause an inspection to be made of anybody's land.  I am very much afraid that this section will be used over the next couple of years for Party political purposes.  That is why I oppose it so strongly.  That is why we feel in this Party that not alone should Fianna Fáil not be put in the position in which they can carry out an inspection of any man's lands but it should not be left in the hands of any Party to decide whose lands should be inspected with a view to acquisition or otherwise.</P>
    <P>That is why we will put this section to a vote.  We feel it is wrong.  We feel it is unjust.  We feel nobody wants the power except the Minister and the Minister has given no valid reason for <Col N="357" /> wanting this extraordinary power beyond the pious expression here and throughout the country that, the moment he gets it, it will expedite land division.  Perhaps it will, for all we know.  Perhaps the moment he gets this power, every single acre in the country, the property of every member of the NFA who spoke against Fianna Fáil, who organised the NFA in the teeth of Fianna Fáil opposition, and who voted against Fianna Fáil, will be inspected.  Perhaps there is a list compiled in the Minister's office of every single&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps there is a plan in the Minister's office that, the moment he gets this section, he will inspect one after another all these farms and, on the lines of Deputy Donegan's story, he will do Cassius Clay on them, one way or the other. If he cannot get their support in one way, he will force their support in the other; he will force it by the threat of inspecting their lands with a view to acquisition.  That is something so serious that it must be resisted not alone here but outside the House.</P>
      <P>Why did we achieve fixity of tenure?  Is not fixity of tenure one of the greatest blessings our people enjoy? Is not fixity of tenure one of the hopes young people have when they aspire to the ownership of their own holdings? Is not fixity of tenure the hope the father has for the family he is leaving behind him?  The moment this section is passed, it will wipe out with one stroke of the pen the fixity of tenure of every landowner, big and small.  I should be glad to hear from the Minister what his inward intentions are in relation to what he proposes to do in the way of ordering his staff around to carry out these inspections.</P>

      <P>I had no doubt that we would have on this section the usual song and dance from Deputy Flanagan. He has tried to terrorise people into the belief that some extraordinary power is being sought here by me for some sinister motive.  I should like to get the House back to the realities.  Section 27 provides:</P>
      <P>For the removal of doubt, it is hereby declared that the determination of the land to be inspected under subsection (6) of section 40 of the Land Act, 1923, as amended by this Act, is not an excepted matter for the purposes of section 12 of the Land Act, 1950; provided that the Minister shall not authorise (pursuant to subsection (2) of section 12 of the Land Act, 1950) an officer to make such determination unless the officer is an officer of the Land Commission and not below the rank of Senior Inspector.</P>
      <P>This section is designed to remove doubts from existing law.  The powers of the Lay Commissioners in regard to excepted matters are dealt with in the land code.  I want to quote now section 12 of the 1950 Act which sets out the excepted matters.  The section provides:</P>
      <P>(1)  The following matters shall be excepted matters for the purposes of this section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the determination of the persons from whom land is to be acquired or resumed;</P>
      <P>(b)  the determination of the actual lands to be acquired or resumed;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> (c)  the determination of the price to be paid for land so acquired or resumed;</P>
    <P>(d)  the determination (other than any determination arising in or being part of a re-arrangement scheme) of the persons to be selected as allottees of any land;</P>
    <P>(e)  the determination (other than any determination arising in or being part of a re-arrangement scheme) of the price at which land is to be sold to any such allottee;</P>
    <P>(f)  the determination whether a tenant or proprietor would be or would not be entitled to require the Land Commission to resume or acquire the whole of his lands and provide him with a new holding and the determination of the new holding to be provided for a tenant or proprietor whose land is resumed or acquired by the Land Commission;</P>
    <P>(g)  the determination whether or not a holding has been used by the tenant or proprietor thereof as an ordinary farm in accordance with proper methods of husbandry;</P>
    <P>(h)  the determination of the amount of any standard purchase annuity;</P>
    <P>(i)  the determination whether any particular holding of tenanted land or parcel of untenanted land shall vest in the Land Commission on the appointed day;</P>
    <P>(j)  the determination of the sporting rights, fishing rights and fisheries to be vested in the Land Commission, the prices to be paid for them, the persons to whom the fishing rights and fisheries are to be resold and the prices to be charged for them;</P>
    <P>(k)  the determination of the easements and rights to be conferred, defined, extended or extinguished and any questions of compensation relating thereto;</P>
    <P>(l)  the determination of the bogs for which turbary regulations are to be made and the making of the regulations;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> (m)  the determination of the highest offer to be made by the Land Commission in the case of a proposed purchase under section 27 of this Act;</P>
    <P>(n)  the determination whether or not a gratuity is to be paid under section 29 of this Act and, if it is to be paid, the amount thereof.</P>
    <P>In this subsection, the expression &ldquo;re-arrangement scheme&rdquo; means a scheme for the re-arrangement of lands held in rundale or intermixed plots whether with or without the distribution of other lands to facilitate the said re-arrangement, such other lands being either adjoining any of the lands held in rundale or intermixed plots or not more distant than three miles from any of such rundale lands or such intermixed plots.</P>
    <P>In not a single provision in that section is there any reference to the appointment of inspectors to go and inspect land as a reserved matter for the Lay Commissioners.  The excepted matters are clearly set out in this and other statutes.  There is not a single indication there that the power to make inspections is either a reserved or an excepted matter.</P>
    <P>There is, in fact, another subsection of section 12 which reads:</P>
    <P>Any power or duty for the time being vested by law (including this Act) in the Land Commission or the Lay Commissioners may, save in relation to excepted matters, be exercised or performed by&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the Minister, or</P>
    <P>(b)  any officer of the Minister or the Land Commission for the time being authorised, whether specifically or by reference to a class of such officers, in that behalf by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The only other reference that I can find in this Act to such reasons for inspection is in subsection (8) of the same section which says:</P>
    <P>The following provisions shall have effect in relation to schemes for the re-arrangement of lands <Col N="361" /> held in rundale or inter-mixed plots whether with or without the distribution of other lands to facilitate the said re-arrangement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  no such scheme shall be approved by virtue of subsection (2) of this section save by an officer;</P>
    <P>(b)  the Minister shall not authorise pursuant to that subsection an officer to approve any such scheme unless the officer is an officer of the Land Commission and not below the rank of Senior Inspector.</P>
    <P>That section is taken virtually word for word here to remove the doubts as to whether the matter of inspection of lands was an excepted matter or not. I challenge anybody in this House to produce any authority in the Land Acts in which it is clearly specified that the question of inspection was an excepted matter for the Lay Commissioners of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Let Deputies understand what we are doing here, what procedure we are trying to deal with.  The procedure at the moment is that some officer of the Land Commission gets a report about some place that should be acquired for the relief of congestion.  The file comes to the local officer and there is a section 40 notice served.  The local officer comes in and inspects the lands and it is only after this inspection and after that officer reports back to the Lay Commissioners that the question of whether the lands be acquired or not can be decided one way or another.  In the first instance the notice must be signed by the Lay Commissioners in Dublin.  Here we have this shuttlecock of documents which are gathering cobwebs up and down the country while these lands are being got rid of by the owners of the land and the Land Commission's intentions are being stultified.  The purpose of this section is to get rid of the red tape and remove the codology in this day and age and streamline the Land Commission machine.  There is no other purpose whatever.  I know that Deputy Flanagan has an imagination of which one might be proud but no matter <Col N="362" /> how he stretches his imagination he will have a job to get the people to accept these fears and this woeful picture he has painted of me signing orders and getting all the senior inspectors of the Land Commission to go down and inspect the farms of his political friends.</P>
    <P>Let me point out that this inspection can only be carried out by a senior official authorised by one of the senior inspectors of the Land Commission and I think&mdash;I am speaking from recollection&mdash;there are only four Divisional Inspectors in the country. These are the four top senior men, the four most experienced men outside the Secretary and the Chief Inspector in the whole Land Commission.  It must be one of these men who authorises the inspection so instead of having the file waiting to gather cobwebs going up and down to Dublin and in the meantime, as a result of that delay, finding the Land Commission's efforts to acquire these lands being frustrated and stultified, this section is being brought in.  I have pointed out that there is no specific provision that ever said, as far as we can judge, that this matter was an excepted matter but we felt it better, for the purpose of removing doubts, to make the law clear when we had a Land Act coming before the House and enable the streamlining of the machine in the manner I have described to the House.</P>
    <P>The people who have been shedding crocodile tears, both on the earlier discussion of this Bill and now on this discussion, as to cutting in on the excepted matters of the Lay Commissioners have very short memories.  I would invite them to go again and read their own 1950 Land Act in which they specifically took away from the Lay Commissioners the determination arising in connection with part of or any re-arrangement scheme.  Re-arrangement schemes and the settlement of rundale plots, which is the most important land settlement work in all the congested counties in the west of Ireland, were, prior to this Act, a reserved or excepted matter for the Lay Commissioners but when Deputy Flanagan's Party were bringing the 1950 Act before the Dáil we heard <Col N="363" /> nothing about what a terrible thing it would be to cut in on these alleged sacrosanct powers of the Commissioners. They had no hesitation in giving the then political head power to send in and decide what re-arrangement should be carried out in all these areas.  Then we have men like these alleging that under this section I am taking some revolutionary powers but the power taken away from the Lay Commissioners in connection with re-arrangement under section 12 of the 1950 Act is a mountain compared with the molehill I am asking the House to accept in the interests of good administration and in the interests of division in congested areas.  I would ask the House to accept the fact that this section is really for the removal of doubts and indeed, expressing my own opinion, I am of the view that this was never the reserve of the Lay Commissioners of the Land Commission.  It seems to me that it was a misnomer to call the Lay Commissioners judges because the status of circuit court judges was removed by Deputy Flanagan's Government under the Land Act of 1923.</P>
    <P>Let me say that there is a reason for this provision, a reason for the expedition of the work of the Land Commission, of enabling the Land Commission not to be frustrated in their efforts where people, as I said last night, jumped the gun when they found that the Land Commission were interested in acquiring their lands. The only purpose of the provision is to remove these doubts as to who has the power to authorise the senior inspector to go in.  But there were no doubts to be removed when these powers in connection with rearrangement schemes or their allotment or settlement were being removed from the Lay Commissioners by the Deputy's Party.  He voted behind Deputy Blowick in 1950 to take away all these powers from the Lay Commissioners. I should say that it is unnecessary for any more crocodile tears to be shed in this House on this issue or any more crying for the alleged three F's. There was no talk of the three F's when the political head was authorised <Col N="364" /> to deal with every rearrangement scheme in the country.</P>
    <P>I commend this section to the House.  It is essential for the expedition of the work of a Department that did not have a great reputation for expedition, and to meet the complaints which I get month in month out from Deputies due to the Land Commission's slow procedure and when many farms are being sold which should be taken over for the relief of congestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were no doubt, there would be no need to clarify.  The question of practice in this case is extremely important. Everybody knows that the whole principle under which the Land Commission operated was that the decision to acquire or inspect, or any other decision affecting the individual land owner, was treated as a reserved function. The Minister, who is also a successful solicitor, may give his legal interpretation of the 1950 Act, but that does not change one whit the practice pre-1950 and up to the present day of the Lay Commissioners and the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>The position now is that not only is the situation being changed by this definition, as the Minister likes to call it, but it has also been changed by the previous section, which deals with the inspection of land and its freezing for six months.  It is the Minister who will cause the inspection.  That is the factual change.  All the reading of the 1950 Act is of no avail, when you look at the Bill and see there is need for clarification and when you know the practice was quite different from what the practice will be when this Bill becomes an Act.  Let us consider how politics work in relation to this situation.  Politics, as we know, is the science of the possible.  It is the science, to be brutal about it, of what you can get away with.</P>

If the Presidency of the United States had changed last night, the situation would be that the entire top Civil Service would change and in would come the new man's aids and executives.  In this Bill we have a political figure taking a power which, if one were naive, one would say he would never use.  But we know the practical politician will use it.  That is the problem.  You might tell me to speak for myself, but maybe I am being a bit too honest.</P>

I do not think there is any other politician in this House who would behave differently.  You are putting a power into the hands of the Minister which he should not have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the position of the Secretary of the Department.  He will be a member of the Lay Commissioners, and a member of his staff, which he must control, will be delegated by the Minister, the political head, to decide which land will be inspected and which will be frozen for six months.  The first qualification <Col N="366" /> for the Secretary in this new situation is that he should be suffering from schizophrenia.  First, he has to have the Lay Commissioner's view; then he has to control his staff; then he has to realise that a member of his staff will be delegated to do something the Minister wishes.  He has to have three different points of view at different times.  He has to be in the position of turning on and off the tap at will, when he goes to meetings of the Lay Commissioners, when he has consultations with the Minister and when he deals with members of his staff delegated to look after the situation.  Is that right or wrong?  I say it is quite wrong that it should be done.  There was great worry a moment ago as to whether or not every politician was an absolute purist.</P>

These are things we all know about. We can pass them over and say we are wonderful people if we like.  What are we doing here but allowing the political head of the Department to have a say, however slight, as to whose lands shall or shall not be frozen?  I would rather be honest and say I have a good idea of what will happen, if not with this Minister who has had all these discussions about it, but with his successor or his successor's successor.</P>

    <P>Men in politics do not neglect to use the powers given to them.  Not so long ago, I complained bitterly to a great supporter of the Party opposite in respect of certain operations of members of that Party in a certain instance.  He looked at me and said: &ldquo;They are only applying modern business methods to politics.&rdquo; That is true.  I found myself in agreement with him.  All over the world, politics <Col N="367" /> is the science, and most certainly as far as the Party opposite are concerned, of what you can get away with doing.  I am not afraid to say that.</P>

      <P>In relation to the matter we are discussing, a political lecture is probably the only honest discussion we can have.  We are now giving to a political figure the right to invade the rights of a private individual&mdash;his right to own and sell land.  The decision of the Minister, who delegates to his officials the inspection of land, means you cannot sell that land for six months.  It means you put a label on it, as surely as there is a label on a bottle of Guinness, that the Land Commission are interested in that land.  That means that land will be bought at a very bad price and only by very few people.</P>

I think that is wrong.  I would most certainly object to anybody being prepared to say what we would do in certain circumstances.  As far as we in the Labour Party are concerned, section 27 is a natural follow on to the controversial section 13.  If you have one without the other, there is no point in going ahead with the Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not care whether it is something with which Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael agree or disagree.  I am putting the point of view of my Party.  I do not believe this section is put in to give the Minister the right to decide what land will be taken over, because it does not give the Minister such a right.  It gives the Minister the right to tell his officials that they are to inspect land. Can anyone tell me what Minister for Lands did not at one time or another say to the Land Commission that a certain farm should be inspected, and if that instruction were given, would it not be inspected?</P>

      <P>As soon as the inspector appeared, if the owner was a rogue, he ran off and got someone to buy it and left the baby in someone else's arms. That is the reason the section is put in. I disagree with dozens of different provisions in this Bill, but I agree that if we are to have the Bill, this change should be made.  The whole essence is that the procedure should be speeded up to stop land from passing into the hands of someone else.  I agree with the Minister on that point, and so do this Party.  This section is put in for the purpose of ensuring that land cannot be passed on to prevent the Land Commission from taking it over.</P>
      <P>I agree with the NFA that 12 months or six months is too long, but I do not think it could be done in one month.  I am quite satisfied this could not be done in one month.  I hope the Land Commission will be able to do it in six months.  They will want to move faster than they usually do to get it done in six months.  We all know of cases where, when an inspector simply passed by the road, a man decided he was after a particular farm and he went off quickly to find an auctioneer. If he could not find an auctioneer, he made private arrangements with someone else.  If we are to talk about honesty, we all know those are facts. When it comes to the final vote on the Bill, we will vote against it, but if the Bill is passed, as I assume it will, there are sections in it against which we are not prepared to vote.</P>

      <P>We on this side of the House are entitled to protest against the flippant manner in which the Fine Gael Party are treating this Bill.  This is a serious attempt by the Minister, who knows the position very well, to come to grips for the first time with the land problem.  It is a real assault on the depressed standard of living of some of our farmers.  It is the first time a real attempt has been made to put teeth into a Land Bill to ensure that a pool of land will be in the hands of the Land Commission to relieve the pressure we find in the country.</P>
      <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan, of course, is an auctioneer.  I do not want to be personal, but may I say, in passing, that the Fine Gael Party were quite personal when it came to dealing with politics and accused us of nepotism. We can catch that phrase in our hands, fling it back across the House, and say it is nepotism that has the Fine Gael Party in Opposition.  Fine Gael cannot have it both ways.  They must be either for land division, or re-arrangement, or against it.  I want to draw an admission from Deputy O.J. Flanagan whether he is for land division or against it.</P>

      <P>Any manipulation of land that has taken place in this country was through the offices of the auctioneers in the commercial market. It could not have taken place otherwise. What is the Minister trying to achieve?  His aim is quite simple. Being Minister for Lands, he must have some power, and having some power he must be in a position to delegate it.  If he cannot delegate his power to experienced senior inspectors, what use is he?</P>
      <P>Fine Gael believe in toothless watchdogs. That has been their policy all down the years.  They do not believe in a Bill with some teeth in it which makes a serious attempt to acquire and allot land, and to carry out re-arrangement in an orderly manner. We subscribe to the view held by no less a personality than the late Pope John.  When we try to provide legislation to carry out the wishes of the great majority of farmers, the great majority of the thinking public, and the great majority of the farmers' organisations, it is not good enough for Fine Gael to accuse us of trying to sabotage, as it were, the workings of the NFA.  That is completely wrong because we have on our side of the House as many members of the NFA as there are on the other side&mdash;in fact, more I think.  To that extent we have no difficulty in blowing that argument to smithereens.</P>
      <P>The Minister said at the outset, and practically every time he spoke on the subject, that he subscribed to the view of the family farm.  I want to quote now from a little booklet of comments and reflections by the Reverend Daniel Duffy, D.D.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely, and with <Col N="371" /> malice aforethought.  It sets out that the ideal aim is, roughly speaking, an economic unit.  In order to provide that unit, we are seeking provision in this Bill to acquire land, just to do that work, to provide, in so far as is humanly possible, a viable unit for every uneconomic farmer who requires it.  Indeed, if we include all of them, we can say that quite a number of them do require viable units.  What is wrong with that?</P>
      <P>To come back again to the point made by Deputy O.J. Flanagan that we shall impair and destroy the three F's, let me say that that, of course, is not so.  There is no substance whatever in that argument.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that any Government elected by popular vote of the people will not make an assault, in turn, on the people.  I could go one better than that and say that our aim is not merely to affirm the three F's but to ensure that those who live under the charter of the three F's will live in a reasonable standard of comfort.</P>
      <P>I would not mind if some of the arguments we have heard tonight were in fact related to the section under discussion. However, it is open to us on this side of the House to say that those arguments were merely miserable propaganda. There is a by-election in the offing, of course, and that is moving in the back of the mind of Fine Gael. This attempt here tonight is an attempt by them to create the usual confusion &mdash;the confusion that now exists even in the upper crust of the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister <Col N="372" /> for Lands is doing his best in an open, honest and forthright way to create, as he said, a viable unit for the farmer. If the Deputy lived in my county or indeed in the county next to it, he would know the problem created by the land pattern there He would further know that, arising from the difficulties of the Famine years and even in the years subsequent to the Famine, not merely had we uneconomic farms but, in certain circumstances, small farmers divided their farms and made two units out of one.  If the first unit was uneconomic, surely the second unit was bound to be doubly uneconomic.</P>
      <P>We are trying to even out the demographic pattern.  We are misrepre-presented merely for the purpose of creating doubt and despondency in the minds of the electorate of Galway. That is what the Deputy's speech was designed to do.</P>

He asked a straight question to which a straight answer should be given.  We are for land division; we are for the making of economic holdings.  We know there is a congestion problem and we shall endeavour to solve it.  Not alone do we intend to do that but we shall implement a scheme to give land to farmers' sons who are now landless and who are well prepared, financed and equipped to work land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that the word &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; may embarrass Deputy Corry, let us take the new Minister for Agriculture as an example. Let us assume that I receive a list of applicants for land from Donnycarney and Raheny who ask for allotments on the Haughey estate at Raheny.  I immediately send for the senior officers of the Department as a result of those representations and order an inspection of the Haughey estate.  I then submit the report to the Lay Commissioners, one of whom is the Secretary of my Department who had assisted in ordering and in carrying out the inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that this is not, as Deputy Carter and as other Deputies have said, a means of speeding up land division. We have seen that, over the years, Fianna Fáil's growth in rural Ireland was based on land division.  If they could get a farm of ten, 15 or 20 acres, with four applicants for that land, they would immediately have an organised Fianna Fáil cumann as a result.  They were not concerned with the owner of <Col N="374" /> the land and in many cases, they were not concerned with the four applicants: they were concerned with furthering their Party political interest. We have recently seen published in the papers a specimen application form for land which bears the recommendation and the signature of local Fianna Fáil cumainn.  The late Deputy Donnellan told us how the local Fianna Fáil Deputy used rake out the ashes of the turf fire and tell his listeners: &ldquo;This is Mick's; this is Pat's; and this is Joe's.&rdquo; Then John would come in and he would rub all the marks out with his foot and go over the ashes and divide it again saying: &ldquo;and this is yours, John.&rdquo; That may be very funny for Fianna Fáil Deputies but not for the unfortunate people of the country who, when this Bill is passed, will be dispossessed of their holdings because of the political views they hold.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with leaving the authorisation of an inspection of land to the Land Commissioners?  If the Minister and others tell us that the land policy has not been satisfactory in the past and not to their liking, is that a reflection on the men who have carried out numerous schemes of successful land division?  The Minister is availing of this opportunity to slight the members of the Land Commission who in my opinion have done a valuable amount of work in parts of the country.  That work is now to be taken completely out of their hands as regards inspection.  The Minister knows that in order to carry out the inspection of a farm it is sufficient to arouse local public interest for Party political purposes.</P>
    <P>There are many decent landowners who are terrified of this section because they do not share the political views of the Minister.  Anybody who knows Fianna Fáil's record in this regard cannot have a feeling of security on the land whether he owns five or five hundred acres.  This section is designed to give a power to the political heads of the Department that no Irish Government sought since the State was founded and that even the British Government did not seek when they were here.  What is the difference <Col N="375" /> between the landlord days and having a head landlord known as Micheál Ó Móráin?  This section gives Micheál Ó Móráin or any Minister for Lands the right to inspect Deputy Corry's, Deputy Moher's or Deputy Medlar's land and the land of every decent farmer but we know that while Fianna Fáil are in office the lands of Deputy Corry, Deputy Moher and Deputy Medlar are quite safe.  Assuming a Minister comes into office not so favourably disposed to those Deputies as the present Minister, what guarantee have they that a senior inspector will not walk their land and that they will not be reduced in value overnight?</P>
    <P>This is a dangerous power to have in the hands of any man.  It should only be vested in Lay Commissioners. Because of Fianna Fáil's record and their greed for power and because of their desire to bring people under their banner by threats, I venture to say that if this section is passed it will undoubtedly bring grist to their mill. We know one extensive farmer in particular in the Kildare constituency who was afraid his lands would be used for division and he is now one of the most active men in the Fianna Fáil organisation.  He simply joined the organisation in order to save his lands. How much more will people now flock into the organisation in order to save their lands?</P>
    <P>We have a public duty to safeguard the people against this kind of thing that we might describe as rotten administration.  This might be a good section for Tito or Khrushchev or Castro to introduce in their legislatures, or for any of these gentlemen who have a greed for power and the desire to crush all before them to secure it, but here we find we have in our own country an Irish Minister for Lands taking the same power to himself in relation to lands that Tito, Khrushchev and Castro have in their respective countries.  What is the difference?  The order of inspection with a view to State confiscation could not be more dangerous.  We have a duty to alert our people and see that they are made aware of the danger of their property being confiscated by the State.  Would any Fianna Fáil <Col N="376" /> Deputy like the State to confiscate his own private property?  No more than the other people who own land in the country.  I suggest it is the small farmer, who is put to the pin of his collar to eke out an existence, the man who must emigrate temporarily to seek a living abroad, who will suffer most severely as a result of power vested in the Minister for Lands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the man the Deputy wants to keep down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the man to whom we want to give more land and the man we want to help. The only way the Deputy's Party could help him was to force him to emigrate. We want to bring him back, settle him on the land and keep him there by making his life attractive and paying him for what he produces.  That is the great difference between Fianna Fáil and this side of the House. Fianna Fáil are quite satisfied to see people flying from the land, to see the smallholders who will be affected by this section, going and endeavouring to set their holdings because they cannot live on them.  We want to make life better for them and give them additions to their holdings enabling them to live in decency on the land.  That is our policy and that is what we propose to do.</P>
      <P>The Minister's explanation as to why he is bringing in this section to give him these extraordinary powers is not acceptable to me.  I do not believe for one moment that the Minister is introducing this section for the purpose of expediting land division.  He is bringing in the section because of his greed for power, because of the greed for power in his Party and because of their desire to hang on by any means, fair, foul or dishonest.  They have seen that by depriving a landowner of one of the three F's, fixity of tenure, they may be able to bring him within their power by the fear that if he does not join their ranks he will be dispossessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin told a story here last night about the man who voted in Longford in bygone days.  He recorded his vote according to his conscience but, because he did so, he was <Col N="377" /> dispossessed of his property.  I venture to say that if this Bill goes through in its present form and if the Minister gets the power he is now seeking there is many a small farmer who, if he disagrees with Fianna Fáil, will be dispossessed.  For the information of Deputy Carter, who talks about bye-elections, it is only right the people of Galway should be told&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point is, whether they believe us or not, we have a duty to tell them and it is up to themselves one way or the other.  The Minister tries to convey to this House that he always had power in the laws passed by this House to authorise inspection but that is something I could find in no statute.  Would the Minister quote me any single section of any Land Act since the State was founded, or before the State was founded, which authorises the Minister for Lands to inspect any man's land?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Minister did not quote any section which gives absolute authority to the Minister for Lands, as the head of the Department of Lands, to authorise an inspection of any man's lands.  I feel that this power is of such an extraordinary character that the Minister would be well advised not to press this matter hurriedly but to allow his Party to think over it for a while because it is as dangerous to them as it is to any other section of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Fine Gael were in office now and were bringing in the same type of legislation or seeking the same powers which the Minister is now seeking there would be an uproar by every Fianna Fáil Deputy who has only five acres of land or more.  The strange thing about this section is that the only single Fianna Fáil Deputy who spoke on it was Deputy Carter.  We pay tribute to him for having the courage <Col N="378" /> to get up and express his view.  I should love if I could encourage Deputy Corry to speak and give his honest views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not often intervene on questions dealing with land nor have I intervened much in the debate on this particular Land Bill.  I have been in this House for something like 19 years now and, with all due respect to the various Ministers for Lands, I always availed of the period in which they were answering questions to go out for a smoke.  I did this because it seemed to me that the whole business was most frustrating.</P>
      <P>I have heard wide criticism of the Irish Land Commission and its inertia. I have always had a certain amount of pity for the Minister for Lands who, in the heelhunt of answering his questions and the various Supplementaries, tells his questioners he has no function and that it is a matter for the Land Commission.  That has been the experience of most Deputies over the last 40 years no matter what side of the House they were on.</P>
      <P>I welcome this particular section because it gives the Minister for Lands some function.  It allows those who are mainly interested in the division of land an opportunity of holding the Minister responsible for some activities in connection with the inspection, acquisition and division of land.  He can say to the senior officers that there is such an estate in such a part of the country and he considers it should be inspected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan is a personal friend of mine but I do not believe in his forecast of gloom and disaster for the Irish farmers, whether they are big or small farmers.  I do not believe any Minister for Lands would act in the way Deputy O.J. Flanagan and Deputy Donegan have described.  I believe people would revolt against that to the detriment of Fianna Fáil. Fianna Fáil are wise enough to know that if they abuse this power they <Col N="379" /> would lose support rather than gain it. I do not know what is sacrosanct about a man's privacy in that an inspector can look at land to see whether or not it can be divided, because, whether anybody likes it or not there is land in this country which should be divided and should have been acquired long ago.  If this particular section of this Bill does that and if the present Minister for Lands takes the initiative and encourages this he should be applauded for it.  If the Minister abuses this section he will hear about it in the Dáil, at bye-elections or at a general election.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance initiates expenditure, I assume he is doing it for the good of the country, whether or not we say he is doing it for the Fianna Fáil cumann.  I do not believe the Minister for Lands is doing anything which is not good for the people of the country.  I am not a farmer myself but I have a garden.  If this Bill is for the purpose of doing good I applaud it.</P>
    <P>The Minister can tell his officers to acquire land.  As everybody knows&mdash; Deputy Flanagan included&mdash;he has sufficient faith in the Lay Commissioners to know they will act on good judgment and not be influenced when it comes to division as to whether land should be acquired.  They also will decide who should get the land.  I do not believe we are giving extraordinary power to the Minister.  As a matter of fact, we are putting responsibility on him to spur the Land Commission on to greater effort and, above all, get them to do the job quickly. There is this six months period during which they must decide.  I have heard questions from this and that side of the House to the Minister for Lands about the same old estates in Cork, Kildare, Roscommon, Donegal and Wexford for years and years.  I trust the insertion of this section in the Bill will ensure that if there is the possibility of getting a farm or estate in this or that county, a decision will be made quickly.  It is for that reason that we in this Party see no objection whatever in this responsibility being <Col N="380" /> given to the Minister to ensure that things will be done quickly.</P>
    <P>As far as the allottees are concerned we hope there will be a new look in the Land Commission, that they will work more quickly than they have worked in the past and that they will give land to really deserving persons, persons who need land, whether they be farmers' sons or men with uneconomic holdings.</P>

The people should decide once and for all on whether the elected representatives are to rule, or whether it will be left to some official in the Department.  Let us take the mask off and let us look it in the face. We come in here with the troubles of our constituencies and ask questions of a Minister, and the unfortunate man has to stand up and endeavour to define some idiotic action that was done and about which he knows nothing.  That is happening too often in this House, to my knowledge.  I can speak as one who has been here for the past 30 years.  I shall give an instance to Deputy O.J. Flanagan if he wants it.  At Whitegate, East Cork, there are 425 acres of land, the makings of a few good farms of the best land in East Cork.  We came in here and we appealed to Deputy Blowick to take that land over.  It was sold to an alien at that time for £7,000.  It was purchased from him by an Irishman, living in England now, for £17,000. He sold it to a German for £30,000 odd.  The Land Commission had to come in and take over that farm <Col N="381" /> about two months ago.  During the whole of that period, that land was used as one huge ranch, by a cattle dealer in England sending his cattle over there every year.  That is the way Deputy O.J. Flanagan, and his brother in arms, Deputy Blowick divided up the land in this country.</P>
      <P>I shall give another case.  There is a place down in Cloyne comprising 1,000 acres and I got after the Land Commission to have it taken over.  Lo and behold, after all the machines had been worked and all the twists and twirls were made, only 12½ acres out of this 1,000 acres were taken over by the Land Commission for division.  I can prove every word of what I say.</P>
      <P>We have to change and I think Deputy Flanagan will agree it is time for a change.  I came in here one day with three questions on the Order Paper and with these three questions I swept 1,000 acres of land out of the hands of foreigners in my constituency. There are about 1,500 acres more and I intend having them, please God, for Christmas.</P>

On Wednesday morning I went up to the Minister's office and a fortnight afterwards that farm was in the possession of the Land Commission for division.  It was about this time of the year.

Then he might go back and succeed in doing something for the unfortunates in Laois. But, of course, he knows nothing about land.  In my constituency you had a whole side of country with nothing but little pieces of land which the people could do nothing with, afraid to bring a woman in, until we got a proper Minister for Lands.  That is the kind of Minister we want, a Minister who will take responsibility and not run away from responsibility when he is questioned in the House. We do not want to be told: &ldquo;It is not my function&rdquo;, as we were by Deputy Blowick.  All we got from him was a grin across the floor of the House, a quiet smile for five or six years.</P>

If I had the kind of mind Deputy Flanagan has, as <Col N="383" /> indicated by his behaviour here&mdash;of course he does not believe in one-tenth of what he says&mdash;hang it, I would be ashamed to be a public representative.

I did not intervene in this debate before now because I consider that the whole key to this Bill is this section.  The key is the provision in the Bill giving the elected representative in this House who has the honour to be Minister for Lands, in charge of the Land Commission, the power as well as the name.  Let us have it.  I look on the provisions contained in this section as the first great benefit this Bill will confer on the country.  I only hope the example will be followed in every Department of State.  Let us have more of it.  Then, when we ask a question in the House, we will not be told the Minister has no function.</P>

The Minister is the man who has to face the people who put him here, not some gentleman protected by all the barbed wire entanglements that can be put up in the Civil Service.  The Minister has to face his people.  The other gentlemen have not.  They can sit quietly after doing the most outrageous things but the unfortunate Minister has to come in here and if I raise a question I am told by the Chair that the Minister is responsible for his Department.</P>

      <P>This section will make him fully responsible and that is the main reason why I am in favour of it. I have given instances of what happened in my constituency; I have repeated them time after time, day after day.  I know exactly where the shoe pinches.</P>
      <P>We want land divided so that the people can work and increase production. As I have stated already, a responsible Minister of State refused, in 1948, to purchase a 425-acre holding. This is 1964.  From 1948 to 1964 that farm has been run as a ranch simply because a Minister was not responsible to this House or had not the guts to step in.  It will cost the Irish taxpayer over £30,000 to buy a farm that was offered in 1948 for £7,000.  A large portion of that will have to be paid for by the unfortunate men going into it.  That is the sin of it.  The evil that men did is living after them.  That is the curse of it. There was the action of a Department and of a Minister of State in connection with a holding of 1,100 acres that was owned by an absentee landlord. They took 12½ acres of it for division. If I were in Deputy Flanagan's boots and the ghosts of those Ministers were rising up about me, I would clear out the door.  That is why I am glad that now, at last, we have the breakthrough and will have a Minister who will be responsible for the division of land.</P>

That is the kind of thing we are objecting to, that it would be in his power to nominate who was to go into it.

      <P>That is typical of the Fianna Fáil claptrap to which we have listened all down the years. Reference has been made to a farm that was not divided in 1948.  What was the man doing whose Party got into office in 1951?  When he asserts that the price was £7,000 in 1948, does he object to the price going up?  Or are farmers to be in the position that their land will stay at a fixed value?  The increase in the value of land has been an advantage to all farmers.  I should like the House to remember that we are not talking about Lord Clanrickarde.  We are talking about <Col N="387" /> ordinary Irish farmers who may have 40 or 50 acres of land.  It is for them that this Bill is being passed.  The Fianna Fáil Deputies object to the price of land having appreciated in the past ten or 12 years.  It was a great thing that it did because land was lying in the slough of despond after 16 years of Fianna Fáil administration.  Farmers were able to raise their heads again after being weighed down by overdrafts, with no chance of obtaining credit.  They discovered that the value of their land had appreciated so much that they were again viable for loans, not from the Agricultural Credit Corporation&mdash;the majority of people can get money there&mdash;people who do not want it&mdash;but from the ordinary banks. A farmer was in a position to say to a bank to which he owed money that he had, say, 60 acres and if the bank did not advance another £500 to enable him to purchase stock he could go to another bank and get it.</P>
      <P>We are not talking about big estates over the walls of which land-hungry men are looking.  We are talking about 45 and 50 acre farms.  We are talking about men who were broken and who are now trying to fight their way up and who in many cases have to leave their farms and go away to work.</P>

They are the people who are coming to me.  They are in a state of alarm and the Minister knows they are in a state of alarm. I would be afraid to give that power to the Minister for Lands that this section would give him, when we hear a Fianna Fáil Deputy stating here tonight that he could take it into his own head to inspect land with the lights of his car and could come up here and influence a Minister to take it over. It is amazing to me that the man who has stated here tonight that he knows everything about land law and all the rest of it was not made Minister for Lands.</P>

      <P>It was an obvious remark.  You could not blame me for making it.  He came in here and was able to make personal attacks on everyone in the House and on people outside the House.  That did not arise on the section either.  I am sure I do not have to write to Deputy Corry for a licence to come in here and speak about land.  He made a personal attack on me, asking what did I know about land.  It would appear that I would have to be a land lawyer like him before being allowed to address this House on the subject of land.  Anybody like Deputy Corry who comes into this House to talk about land division should look over his shoulder.</P>
      <P>We are all interested in settling people on land and in land division but I am not in favour of taking small farms or of giving the power to a Minister to take small farms from Irish farmers.  I would give the Minister power to take estates from people who were not using them properly or to take big ranches.  The Land Commission should examine its conscience.  They could probably go to Deputy Corry for some help.  People are in danger of having their land taken over because they will not farm their holdings properly.  The biggest sinner in this respect is the Land Commission itself.  There are thousands of acres of land of which the Land Commission have been in possession for years and they have let them to be mined for wheat and barley crops and they are now a disgrace to any country, full of weeds and pruiseach and they are the property of the Land Commission.  They were taken over a long time ago for division and have not been divided.  Evidently, this great and wonderful Santa Claus, Deputy Corry, was not able to get to work there.</P>

The total figure for 1970 is 475,000, as published on page 299 of Part II of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> At this stage the 1970 projections are tentative figures and it may become necessary to revise them according as more information becomes available.</P>
