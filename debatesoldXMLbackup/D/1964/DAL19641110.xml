      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>To-day's Order Paper includes a motion for leave to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for Vote No. 41 (Industry and Commerce).  This will be of a token character.  It is proposed, with the agreement of the Dáil, to move this Supplementary Estimate to-morrow when I will make a statement regarding the recent discussions with the British Prime Minister and outline the steps which the Government propose to take in the light of the situation arising from the imposition by the British Government of the temporary import charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Taoiseach proposes to make a more exhaustive statement tomorrow.  However, there are certain questions in relation to which I should be grateful <Col N="478" /> if he could in some measure release information today.  One is that in 1960, on his return from London, he informed the House that our relations with Great Britain were on a contractual basis and would involve regular consultation between the two Governments.  What steps were taken to bring to the attention of the Government of Great Britain the argument which the Taoiseach described as having greatly impressed the British Ministers, that is, that the impact of charges on trade was more severely felt in Ireland than in any other country and that the charges were contrary to the Trade Agreement?  What steps were taken prior to the visit to London of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce to bring these matters to the attention of the British Government in view of the regular consultations provided for under the 1960 agreement?</P>
      <P>We are all agreed on both sides of this House&mdash;and, indeed, the British Government, too&mdash;that the 15 per cent levy is a breach of the existing Trade Agreements, 1938 to 1948.  We are all agreed that it imposes heavy financial loss on us.  Is it by the Taoiseach's authority that the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Justice are making speeches in the country, one admonishing the trade unions and the other forecasting additional taxation?  If it is not by his authority, would it not be more prudent that the members of his Government would withhold speeches until such time as he has spoken of the joint Government proposals in regard to these matters?</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach further if he would agree with me and deem it expedient to express that agreement now&mdash;as of today&mdash;that it is vitally important at the earliest possible moment to reassure wage earners in the export industries affected by this levy that it is within our competence and that we intend to do whatever requires to be done to ensure that their jobs will be safe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to ask the Taoiseach whether it is not desirable at this early stage to be realistic in regard to these matters and to recognise, <Col N="479" /> apart from the financial loss this breach of our agreement will involve us in, that it also means that the whole basis which we have so carefully built up of Ireland as a safe base from which to exploit the British market has seriously been prejudiced by this new departure.  I should also like to ask if&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy asking questions or making a speech?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making a speech.  I am asking questions in respect of which I think it proper to inform the Taoiseach I intend to make a speech tomorrow.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is usual on a question asking for a statement.  So far as this matter is concerned, we want to help.  I would remind the Taoiseach that he would be well advised to recognise that at this time it is expedient that all sides should help if we are to avoid possible consequences&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>These are supplementary questions to which I might reasonably expect a civil reply.  Would the Taoiseach care to express agreement with the proposition that, while a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign is eminently desirable and deserving of general commendation, fundamentally that alone cannot preserve the markets which we have opened up and which we must not allow to be closed against us during this period?  I should like to ask the Taoiseach whether in the course of the discussions in London, the Government thought it expedient to suggest to the British Government that, if they could make no concession in respect of the 15 per cent tariff, some compensatory gesture might have been made in regard to the three months period for store cattle and in respect of carcase meat exports from this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lastly, I should like to ask the <Col N="480" /> Taoiseach this.  We are continually being told about restrictive practices. The true significance of that phrase depends very largely on who uses it. Would the Taoiseach consider this an appropriate time to institute inquiries, or a formal inquiry, into the whole question of restrictive practices of management and unions in industry so that appropriate agreed measures might be devised to eliminate waste and to increase the competitiveness of Irish industry in the time ahead?  I should be grateful if the Taoiseach could give us some preliminary information in respect of these matters.  It is of some importance to the country that such preliminary information in respect of some of them at least should be provided forthwith.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to press one question with the Taoiseach.  In my constituency&mdash;as I have no doubt is true in other constituencies&mdash;workmen have lost their jobs.  They have been given notice and are now without work.  I believe these jobs could be restored if from all sides of the House we were in a position today to say that we have the means and we intend to use them to preserve these men's employment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that many local authorities took into consideration the 12 per cent increase in workers' incomes in relation to the granting of medical cards, as a result of which numerous workers and others have had their medical cards cancelled, and are now worse off than before the increase was granted; and why local authorities were not instructed to raise the income assessment for medical card purposes so as to avoid the cancellation <Col N="482" /> of such cards because of an increase in wages, which was to cover the general increase in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The percentage of the population covered by General Medical Services Cards at the end of each quarter in the past year was ; September, 1963&mdash; 29.4 per cent; December, 1963&mdash;29.0 per cent; March, 1964&mdash;29.2 per cent; June, 1964&mdash;29.0 per cent; September, 1964&mdash;29.3 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is obvious, therefore, that the position is not as stated in the Deputy's question; otherwise the percentage of the population covered by medical cards would have shown a marked drop over the period.  Besides, from the information available to my Department it is clear that few, if any, persons could have lost their medical cards as a result of the ninth round increase in wages.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, requires health authorities to provide, without charge, general medical services for persons &ldquo;who are unable, by their own industry or other lawful means&rdquo; to provide the services for themselves or their dependants. The determination of eligibility for the services is a question for the appropriate health authority and from inquiries I have made I am satisfied that an income scale is not used in making such determination, each case being considered objectively and all the relevant factors being taken into account.  Even, therefore, if I had the statutory power to issue an instruction such as is suggested by the Deputy, which I have not, I do not feel that I would have any justification for doing so.</P>

      <P>The rates quoted at (a) and (b) have been calculated by reference to the county home type accommodation provided by local health authorities together with similar accommodation provided for old people by charitable voluntary organisations.</P>

      <P>A survey of the Suck has already been made but the results show that it is not possible to do drainage works on it without seriously worsening conditions on the main River Shannon in the critical section between Athlone and Meelick.  It has therefore been decided that a scheme for the Suck must await developments in relation to the main Shannon.</P>
      <P>The Smaghran river is a tributary of the Suck and can be dealt with only as part of a scheme for that catchment.</P>
      <P>A survey of the Boyle catchment which includes the Lung River was commenced in 1963 and will be continued next year.  It is expected that a scheme for the catchment will be ready by the end of 1967 and, if it proves acceptable, works will start in 1968.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is not as stated by the Deputy.  The Corporation granted general permission to the ESB under the Town and Regional Planning Acts for the rebuilding of these houses, subject to the condition that the Board should submit detailed plans to the Corporation illustrating their proposals before any work of a constructional nature was put in hands.</P>
      <P>Appeals against the Corporation's decision were received by me from a number of parties and, having fully considered the appeals, I decided that the Corporation were justified in granting permission and I disallowed the appeals and made an order on 10th July, 1963, confirming the grant of permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently, the Board lodged with the Corporation detailed plans of the new building, the design of which had been awarded first prize in an international architectural competition promoted by the Board.  The Corporation decided that the plans of the proposed new building were not acceptable for a number of reasons and on 23rd May, 1964, they made an order refusing permission for the rebuilding of the houses in accordance with the plans. The issue then was not whether or not the ESB should be allowed to demolish the existing houses.  That was settled <Col N="493" /> in 1962 by the Corporation's general permission to rebuild and by the confirmation in 1963 of that permission on appeal.  The question that remained to be decided was the design of the new building to be erected on the site.</P>
    <P>The ESB appealed to me against the Corporation's refusal to grant permission for the erection of the new building in accordance with the plans lodged by them and I decided that permission should be granted, subject to certain conditions aimed at bringing the new building more into harmony with its surroundings.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Clinton</b> asked the Minister for Local Government if, in view of the serious housing shortage and the necessity for removing all unnecessary obstacles to the solution of the problem, he will now consider leaving to the local authorities all decisions relating to the suitability and acquisition of sites for local authority housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The extent to which it is possible to delegate to local authorities responsibility for acquiring housing sites is limited by a number of considerations.  In compulsory acquisition, and in certain cases of acquisition for future use, confirmation or approval by the Minister is a statutory requirement.  As regards normal acquisition by agreement it is essential in the case of large-scale schemes, which would involve heavy State loan and subsidy outlay, that the Department should have an opportunity to consider the proposals before a final commitment is entered into in respect of the site.</P>
      <P>County councils were recently given authority to acquire sites for the housing of small farmers without reference to the Department and the possibility of extending this concession will be reviewed when local authorities have gained further experience of operating the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, including application of the planning considerations envisaged in the Act to housing developments in their areas. In the meantime there will be no avoidable delay in dealing with site acquisition proposals which are submitted to the Department in appropriate form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree in regard to the inspection of these sites at local level that the competent authority, and local officials who are on the spot and who, as I said previously, have full academic qualifications and experience in this respect, are the people to determine the suitability of sites?  In regard to compulsory acquisition the Minister should consult them.  Can the Minister see any reason for continuing the taking of action by <Col N="495" /> his officials following decisions taken by local officials?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as large scale development is concerned, it is immaterial whether the site has been compulsorily acquired or by agreement, in that large house-building by a local authority involves heavy commitments by the Government in both subsidy and loan.  While that is so, the responsibility rests with the Department of Local Government to arrange for the development of a place on a wide scale which involves large amounts of money so that they are satisfied before it starts that it is the proper thing to do.  The other argument is that local technical people are qualified to make these decisions, and academically they are so trained. That is not a fact.  Unfortunately the record does not point out that they and they alone, know what is right and what is wrong in all cases. We have a record and I do not mind anybody seeing it, where it was left entirely to the local people in relation to large scale development in various parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This question really has regard to the suitability of sites. The question arises then whether the people in the Department of Local Government are better qualified than the local people to decide on suitability.  In the present circumstances where so many houses are needed so quickly, could the Minister not suspend his power over the decision on suitability and acquisition for, say, a period of 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated recently that so far as rural houses for farmers are concerned, these sites were not subject to agreement, so that the local authority could go ahead.  Further to that, I am considering whether that may not be further widened to take in sites for rural houses, regardless of whether they are for farmers or not.  In so far as single houses, or even to the extent of two or three houses or small lots in various places in the country are concerned, it might be feasible to give full clearance there and allow them to go ahead.  So far as the larger schemes <Col N="496" /> of development are concerned, I do not hold out a hope that they will, in fact, be given a clear run in this particular case while the Government still carry their responsibility, both by loan and subsidy, to pay for the entire development.  I do not think it is quite right that we should be asked to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question on 16th June last.</P>
      <P>Persons who cease to be compulsorily insurable when their earnings exceed £800 a year usually continue to be covered for unemployment and disability benefits for 17 months after the end of the contribution year in which compulsory insurance ended.  In some cases, however, they may continue to be covered for as long as 23 months after their income has passed the statutory limit, depending on the point of time in the contribution year at which that event occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They can continue insurance for contributory widows' pension, and also for old age contributory pension if previously insured for that benefit, <Col N="499" /> by becoming voluntary contributors. While there is no provision in the Social Welfare Acts which would enable them to continue insurance against the risks of unemployment and illness, they could in regard to the latter avail themselves of the services provided by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.</P>

      <P>Mr. John Keating, 21 Grinell Terrace, Mullingar, County Westmeath, enlisted in na Buan Óglaigh on 16th March, 1944, and was discharged on 16th September, 1959. His conduct on discharge was rated as "Very Good".  The upper age limit for re-enlistment in na Buan Óglaigh for general service is 38 years and as Mr. Keating is over that age, his re-enlistment is not permissible under the terms of Rialacháin Óglaigh na hÉireann.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 27 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my disappointment that the Minister for Agriculture did not make a speech in some part of the country over the week-end announcing changes in regard to section 27.  Section 27 has been debated at very great length here. The Minister for Agriculture saw fit, when speaking at Loughrea, to announce a very fundamental change in the Land Bill, and one expected that after last week's debate on section 27, the Minister for Lands would have been prompted to introduce a change in this very important section, this important section to which the greatest opposition comes from this side of the House and, indeed, may I assure the Minister that opposition to this section comes from every single landowner in Ireland; whether he is the owner of a three-acre holding or a 1,000-acre holding, he strenuously objects to the right being vested in the Minister to authorise the inspection of what the owner considers to be his private property.</P>
      <P>We can most definitely suspect this section as an attempt to embark on a policy of interference with private property.  It is the next step towards confiscation of private property.  One might expect that type of legislation behind the Iron Curtain, in the Communist countries, but those of us who are believers in democracy, those of us who believe in free and complete ownership of property, whether house, land or other property, believe in the right of citizens to do as they like with their own property.  This section introduces State interference with private property and from that angle it is one we must very strenuously resist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I ask the Minister, as he will undoubtedly speak again on this important section, to give us one single reason for the inclusion of section 27 <Col N="523" /> in this Bill, beyond telling us that when section 27 is passed it will expedite the working of the Land Commission and speed up land division.  I do not believe a word of that.  I believe I am as familiar with the working of the Land Commission as any other Deputy and since this State was founded and since the first of our Land Acts was passed by our native Government, there have been schemes of land division in practically every county.  It cannot be said that these schemes of land division were in any way in need of a section such as the Minister is asking this House to pass.  I believe that without section 27 land division will be carried out as quickly as ever before, if not more quickly.  This section can only be described as unjust, unwarranted, unreasonable and unfair. It clearly demonstrates a real effort to interfere with private ownership and the rights of private ownership.  Over the weekend we were hopeful that the Minister, in consultation with his colleagues, would see the implication behind this section and, in the light of the opposition voiced against it throughout the country&mdash;I do not know if the Minister reads the leading articles in provincial newspapers&mdash; mend his hand.</P>
    <P>No one wants the Minister to have this power.  The land owners are against his having it.  I cannot understand his anxiety to have it.  There is something sinister in all this.  There is some evil disposition in the Government Party and that is illustrated in their seeking for and supporting the kind of power the Minister seeks in this section.  I cannot understand the anxiety on the part of any Minister to have a power of this kind vested in him.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister now to tell the House the truth in relation to this section.  He is deliberately concealing the truth.  There are other reasons apart from the lame excuse, which no one accepts, that the section is intended solely for the purpose of expediting land division.  We all know the Minister too well to swallow that.  That is not the real motive behind this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has <Col N="524" /> stated time and time again that the purpose of this section is to expedite matters and he refuses to listen to any suggestions from this side that he could get all the expedition necessary by increasing the number of Lay Commissioners.  The position is clear.  No matter how the Minister may delegate the right, he will have the right henceforth to walk in on anybody's land and freeze that land for six months.  He wanted 12 months in the first instance. We do not want any meddling on the part of politicians in land division.  We do not want any suspicion even that any politician can exert influence of any kind where land is concerned.</P>
      <P>I said the other night that a columnist in a Sunday newspaper produced a facsimile of an application form for land with a tail indicating which Fianna Fáil cumann the applicant belonged to.  In the context of land division and in the context of people believing, wrongly at the moment, that friendship with politicians can have an effect on their opportunities for getting land, surely it is highly unwise that we should create a situation in which, instead of having judicial people doing the job, we would have a delegation system from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember, too, that the administrative head of the Department will henceforward be a member of the Lay Commissioners.  In the past one man did hold that dual capacity but, after the passing of this Bill, the Secretary will always be a member of the Lay Commissioners.  Under this section we will create a situation breeding the suspicion that politicians can get land for people.  When land is to be divided, the local cumann gets together and all the applications are duly noted and sent forward.  I have gathered my boys together and helped them make their applications.  I did not tell them that I could influence the decision of the Land Commissioners in the slightest degree.  All I could do was ensure they prepared proper applications, giving the correct details.  That is all I could do.  Many politicians, however, give their constituents to understand they can get them land.  In fact, these politicians get more votes before land <Col N="525" /> is divided than they do after it has been divided because the end result is always one satisfied and four dissatisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Forty dissatisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Forty, 50, 60 dissatisfied.  Deputy P. Brennan has seen the same pattern develop as I have seen, and so has Deputy Sweetman.  So has the Minister and every other rural Deputy.  Under this provision the Minister seeks to create a situation of suspicion, a three-cornered situation in which he will delegate to an officer of his Department and, remember, the administrative head must implement the Minister's policy.  Land can be walked at the behest of the Minister. During the six months in which it is frozen, the Minister can speak to the Secretary and, if he can get across to him that acquisition proceedings should be started, the Minister is himself deciding whose land shall be acquired and whose not.</P>
      <P>Over the weekend I saw a hand-out to Fianna Fáil speakers in East Galway.  The hand-out inadvertently fell into the hands of the opposing Party.  At least 90 per cent of it dealt with the Land Bill and, of that 90 per cent, 50 per cent was on this section and the other section we debated earlier.  Expedition and everything else were very nicely glossed over.  We cannot tolerate a situation in which the people will believe politicians can get them land.  That is the situation the Minister is endeavouring to create. Even if the Minister should happen to be a virtual angel, the suspicion will nevertheless be there because of the three-corner situation this section will create, a situation in which the suspicion will be bred that politicians can influence the taking of a man's land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister intends to take unprecedented power in this section.  It can only be said that it will give him immense political power.  It will give him an opportunity to make landowners fear the power which the <Col N="527" /> Minister wishes to take unto himself, in addition to taking a similar power for the Secretary of his Department. He says that this section is brought in in order to increase efficiency and expedition in regard to the acquisition of land.  We have ourselves observed the operation of the system of acquiring land particularly since 1950 and it must be agreed that it is a very fast system.  All credit must go to Deputy Blowick and the inter-Party Government for bringing in such a fair Land Act as the 1950 Act.  That Act enabled the Land Commission to pay the market value of the land to the person from whom they wished to acquire it.  Similarly it gave the Land Commission power to bid for and purchase farms at public auctions.  These powers did not exist previously.  Instead, the Land Commission operated under various Acts which gave them compulsory powers instead of giving them the opportunity to treat owners of land fairly.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from previous sections which have been debated that if the Minister took this power, which under the section he is trying to take, land will be rendered valueless and almost useless to the owner because when the Minister has instructed his Secretary to have the farm visited, to have it walked, the owner will no longer have negotiable property.  Instead, he will, if you like, be suspended in mid-air for six-months.  He will not know whether he is coming or going.  He will not be able to make any plans to make ends meet.  He will not know whether his land is to be taken from him; whether he can plan the rotation of crops, or organise his farm for the future.  Farms do need organisation and planning.  Things do not just happen overnight on a farm.  The produce, whether livestock or crops, comes as a result of planning and patient waiting.  It is the result of a constant battle with weather conditions and many other circumstances such as depreciation in the market values of produce and other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Landowners must contend with all these factors but here the land, if it is inspected, will be rendered practically <Col N="528" /> useless for six months and the owner need not do any planning during that time.  In the 1930's we witnessed a situation which apparently the Minister is trying to secure again.  We saw land being confiscated from farmers just because Fianna Fáil at that time were waving the big stick.  We saw land being taken from farmers for less than £5 per acre.  Thousands and thousands of acres were taken by the Land Commission during those years.  The farmers had their land taken from under their feet in spite of their protests and in spite of their resistance.  The land was taken from them and divided, and many of those who got it proved that they did not deserve it because they set out to get the land vested and as soon as they became the vested owners, they were able to sell it, put the cash in their pockets and go into other occupations.  The activities which took place during the 1930's have demonstrated what could happen again if the Minister takes the power which he sets out to take in section 27.</P>
    <P>He must agree that fixity of tenure will be almost completely non-existent if this section is passed as it is.  It will mean that the farmer or landowner will only be a squatter on his own farm and in his own farmhouse.  Any private householder is entitled to dispose of his house in any way he wishes.  He may rent it, let it, or sell it, but it is for him to decide in what way he will use it or dispose of it.  Similarly a shopkeeper is entitled to rent or sell his shop, or sell the goodwill associated with that shop. The factory owner is entitled to sell, rent or let his factory, or sell the goodwill that exists and still continue to be the owner of the building.</P>
    <P>Here, however, an effort is being made to deprive the farmer of his rights as a private landowner, the right to sell or rent his land or use it in any way he wishes.  Even if he is a good, progressive farmer, the power will be there to take the land from him and divide it among persons who may be considered suitable to become tenants and vested tenants of that land.  The main point is that fixity of tenure is being done away with and farmers and landowners in future will not be in a position to regard themselves as sole <Col N="529" /> owners of that property.  It should be agreed that every citizen in the State should be entitled to ownership and the full control of his own property but that situation will be done away with under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Recently, we had a Fianna Fáil Deputy telling us that he decided land should be taken from a landowner in his constituency.  He went out on a dark night and turned his headlamps on this man's land for all interested to see that he had decided to make representations to have the land taken from him.  It was spread around the locality, particularly in the Deputy's Party, that he intended to make representations to the Land Commission to have this land taken.  That is exactly the kind of power this section proposes to give the Minister.  It will entitle him to take an interest in any farm he wishes and take steps to have it taken away from the owner.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we respect the principle of private ownership of property.  We consider that people have earned their right to own private property and are entitled to own it and that the attitude should not be that everybody's property is my property and my property is everybody's.  But that is the attitude that will develop if this Bill goes through.  The right of private ownership is recognised in the Constitution, and any Bill that would seek to take away that right would surely be against the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>This power would enable the Fianna Fáil Party, or any other Party for that matter, to secure support by promising political favours.  You can imagine the secretary of a Fianna Fáil cumann or of any other cumann going around the parish saying that, provided the people are loyal to the political Party concerned, they will consider the acquisition of a certain estate and its division amongst those who are foremost in their activities in support of the Party.  There is also the danger of political pressure being brought to bear in the Party rooms.  It is well known that matters of public importance and Party policy are carefully discussed in the rooms of responsible political Parties here.  A situation could <Col N="530" /> arise where the Minister would be faced in his Party room with the embarrassing situation of having pressure brought to bear on him for the purpose of forcing him to take steps which would result in the acquisition of a farm.  Similarly, even one Deputy, especially if the Government have only a narrow margin in the House, could bring undue pressure to bear on the Minister and his Party to insist on the acquisition of land in an area merely to secure political advantage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am afraid of.  That is why I am mentioning these matters.  I believe the Land Commission have all the machinery they require and that it is unnecessary for the Minister to take to himself a power vested in the Commissioners at present.  The Commissioners are doing a good job and are dealing with this problem very fairly.  They can be relied on to continue to deal with it on that basis.  It is obvious that the Minister is not satisfied with the powers the Land Commission have at present.  This section will give to the Minister and to the Secretary of the Department powers they never had previously.  They will be able to send out an inspector to inspect a holding and to freeze the position for six months.  The Minister does not need special powers.  The Commissioners have all the powers they require to ensure fair dealings with the owners of land and to ensure respect for private property, which we all feel should be respected.  Every person should have the right to own his own property, and to manage and dispose of it in his own way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it will be argued that land should be taken from a man who is not managing his land properly.  Nobody will dispute that.  We feel that the valuable asset of productive land should be available to the nation to be used to the best advantage.  However, we have no system here whereby a shop can be taken from a man if he is not managing it properly, if he is not giving good employment in that <Col N="531" /> shop or employing his staff under good conditions or paying good wages, and so on.  However, it may be argued that there is a big difference between a shop or business premises and productive land.  That probably gives some strength to the attitude that if land is not being properly managed, the State should acquire it on a fair basis from the owner and give it to somebody else who can make better use of it to the advantage of the nation in general.</P>
    <P>This is extremely dangerous not for what it seems to be but for what it may result in.  It will have very far-reaching effects.  Even if we are not afraid that the present Minister would take any mean advantage, it could be that a Minister in the future would.  At this stage, I do not intend to accuse the Minister of any undesirable interest: I am putting the argument fair and square to him that it seems to me that he is making a claim to something he does not need and that, if he gets it, the power could be very much abused in the future.  It is up to us at this stage to ask the Minister to eliminate this section, particularly because the Land Commissioners are doing a good job and have sufficient power under the existing land legislation.</P>

      <P>I am flattered by Deputy Burke's admission.  When it comes to the discussion on this section by the Deputy from North County Dublin, no doubt we shall hear the plea he always makes on behalf of one sector of the community up in Balbriggan.  Section 27 has perhaps given rise to more anxiety in the country than any other section of this Bill. Quite honestly, it was not understood at all in the beginning.  The section reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the removal of doubt, it is hereby declared that the determination <Col N="532" /> of the land to be inspected under subsection (6) of section 40 of the Land Act, 1923, as amended by this Act, is not an excepted matter for the purposes of section 12 of the Land Act, 1950; provided that the Minister shall not authorise (pursuant to subsection (2) of section 12 of the Land Act, 1950) an officer to make such determination unless the officer is an officer of the Land Commission and not below the rank of Senior Inspector. </P>
    <P>When the Bill was circulated and discussed by bodies such as the National Farmers' Association, I do not honestly think that many of them appreciated or understood its significance.  Without being able to go back to the Act of 1923 to see exactly what section 40 (6) involves, it is impossible to understand the implications of this section.</P>
    <P>It has been stated, correctly, by other Deputies that from time to time claims have been made with great regularity that X or Y or Z obtained a holding for his or their supporters. The general position in relation to the division of land throughout the country has been that those divisions have been made by the Land Commissioners. After the division has been announced, certain people have gone out and shouted valiantly that they were entirely responsible for getting an allotment for Paddy Murphy, Paddy Burke or Martin Corry, as the case might be.  We all know that they had nothing whatever to do with it and that they were merely trying to convince supporters down the country that they had wielded great influence for the applicant on the occasion in question. If, as a result of those activities, the Minister is now faced with the attack that, in the past, land division to some extent was considered on a political basis, the only people responsible for it are the Fianna Fáil cumainn who shouted they had got it, whereas in fact they had not.</P>
    <P>At the moment, I am not considering the nocturnal activities with which Deputy Corry regaled the House last week: we shall come to those in a minute.  I am talking about the allotment <Col N="533" /> of land by the Commissioners of the Land Commission up to this.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the Land Commissioners are persons appointed to what one might call a quasi-judicial term of office.  They are above the political head of the Department of Lands of the day.  By virtue of the terms of their appointment, they are entitled to sit back and to take an impartial view of whatever files and matters come before them, whether it be a file that comes before them for consideration in their office or whether it be one that comes before them when they sit as a quasi-judicial body in the court of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>It would also be appropriate for me to say that, because they sit as a quasi-judicial body to hear objections made to acquisition under the Land Acts, it is entirely wrong that the Secretary of the Land Commission should be a Commissioner.  I have the greatest respect for the present incumbent of the office of Secretary of the Department of Lands.  What I want to say in relation to his appointment as a Commissioner is not in relation to his personal appointment as such but in relation to the appointment of whoever may be Secretary of the Department for the time being to be a Commissioner.  It is relevant to consider that for the purpose of considering what one has got to do here.</P>
    <P>It is an utterly monstrous thing that one of the people who is there to sit in judgment on the objection of a farmer to the acquisition of his land is the administrative head, responsible for the inspectors who are giving evidence before him.  It destroys any possible air of impartiality in the Land Commission count and destroys any appearance of justice being done as well as, possibly, affecting justice being done. It stands to reason that nobody coming before the Land Commission court, knowing that the officer giving evidence is giving evidence before his boss, will feel that he will get a fair hearing from the court.  I want to make it clear that, in saying that, I am in no way accusing the present Secretary of the Department of being likely to influence, or attempting to influence, the evidence <Col N="534" /> given by his officers before him. Human nature being what it is, it stands to reason that there will be venal people who will try to curry favour by giving evidence at a hearing in a difficult case on the side that will win the favour of the political head of the Department and, therefore, that of the administrative head who in accordance with democratic way of running the Civil Service, must be in the closest possible touch all the time with the political head.</P>
    <P>That will have an effect also in relation to this section.  It will mean that we must face the position in the future that the political head of the Department will be entitled, if the section is passed in its present form, to say to one of those before whom the case may come for judgment: &ldquo;In your capacity as Secretary of the Department, direct that Mr. Lawlor's lands in Kildare&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I deliberately said &ldquo;in Kildare&rdquo; so that Deputy Lalor would not think I was referring to him&mdash;&ldquo;will be inspected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When they are inspected, the file may come back to the same man in his capacity as a Commissioner and he has to judge on that file whether acquisition proceedings should be initiated or not.  No man can serve two masters and the Minister in this Bill is deliberately creating the situation in which it would be utterly impossible for the Secretary of the Department of Lands faithfully and honestly to fulfil his duties under the Constitution as the administrative head of the Department, on one hand, and as a Land Commissioner, on the other.  It is utterly wrong that he should be asked to do as he is being asked in this section.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of the section supposed to be?  To expedite the work. We all know that when a place is put up for auction or sale, a great deal must be done by the private individual who wants to buy it.  Very often he must see if he can get money from his bank or from the Agricultural Credit Company to back him in the purchase. He must have interviews with the people concerned who will back him financially and he may possibly want someone to advise him in what I might <Col N="535" /> term the agricultural sense.  The private individual can do this in the time available; why cannot the Land Commission?  Is it not a fact that the Minister's case in relation to the necessity that he says exists for this section could be met, not by bringing in this section, but, by making sure that the Land Commission organisation is properly oriented and works reasonably efficiently?  He regaled us the other day with the tale of how the file had to travel from here to there and from there to somewhere else but what does it prove?  It is proof that the red tape methods of the Department are out of date and that he should reorganise his Department rather than bring in this section which involves a violent departure from principle, which strikes at the root of judicial interpretation and judicial decision as between one sector of the community and the other.</P>
    <P>From the very beginning of this State, and in any democratic State, it is an accepted cardinal principle that you cannot have a fair decision between the State and the individual unless the person making it has the independence of mind and outlook that a proper method of appointment of the judge involves.  The appointment of the Lay Commissioners to the Land Commission follows that pattern and their certainty of tenure enables them to make independent judgment, secure in the knowledge that they are entitled to be impartial and that by virtue of their post, they are bound so to be. This section destroys all that.</P>
    <P>The House and the country should be extremely grateful to Deputy Corry for having let the cat out of the bag. This section has been brought in by the Minister for the very purpose, in my view, of the nocturnal tactics described here by Deputy Corry.  We should be grateful to the Deputy for having exposed the Minister's hand and what he intends to do, having got this section through the House.</P>
    <P>Apparently, according to Deputy Corry&mdash;and I have no doubt the Deputy was told this at the usual Wednesday morning Fianna Fail meeting&mdash; when this section goes through, Deputy <Col N="536" /> Corry will only have to sidle up to the Minister for Lands and say: &ldquo;Go down to East Cork and have the lands of that fellow inspected.  He opposes me on polling day.  I shall teach him a lesson.&rdquo;  Whether that inspection is to take place by car headlights or by reason of section 27, that is what the section is intended for and it is well the country should know it.</P>
    <P>Now, the Minister will&mdash;I was about to say &ldquo;have great difficulties&rdquo; but I should rather say he will find it impossible&mdash;to re-bag that cat, once Deputy Corry spoke out of turn as he did.  Tomorrow is Wednesday morning again and I should fear that Deputy Corry might get a little lick of the tongue at tomorrow's Party meeting for having let the cat out of the bag.  I shall leave them to their internal difficulties.  We saw one of them already in the public eye in the case of Deputy Smith.  We will see what will happen to this cat in relation to the Minister for Lands and Deputy Corry in due course.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I did not think this section was really understood by farmers and organisations who were considering this Bill because of the fact that the section itself was related to another Act, that is, legislation by reference,.  Accordingly, without those other two Acts, the 1923 Act and the 1950 Act, people could not understand what this section meant.  It is very significant indeed that once the section became understood by people and by organisations, there was mounting opposition to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has three Fianna Fáil Deputies in Kildare and he can ask any one of them, particularly Deputy Crinion, about the clattering&mdash;that is the only word I can use&mdash;they got, and particularly Deputy Crinion got, at the public meeting called at Naas by the National Farmers Association in relation to this Land Bill.  Following that meeting, at which the Deputies concerned put their points of view&mdash;I put my point of view from the other side&mdash; we got a circular from the National Farmers Association I saw in that room in Kildare many supporters of mine, supporters of Fianna Fáil and supporters of the Labour Party.  I <Col N="537" /> knew them to be such.  It was a non-political meeting and nobody can have any doubt whatever about that.  It was called for the purpose of considering the matter in a non-political way.</P>
    <P>As I say, all four of us were given adequate chance and adequate opportunity to put our case before the meeting.  Since then or just about that time&mdash;I am not quite clear which it was&mdash;the National Farmers Association issued a second memorandum dated October, 1964 which they call &ldquo;Observations of the National Council on the Land Bill 1963&rdquo;.  In that memorandum they say that section 27 enables the Minister to delegate to senior inspectors of the Land Commission the power to decide on inspection of land with a view to possible acquisition.  No doubt that is what section 27 does.  It empowers the Minister to delegate to senior inspectors of the Land Commission the powers to decide on inspection of land.  Here is what the National Farmers Association say about it:</P>
    <P>We consider that these powers should be reserved to the Lay Commissioners as heretofore and that the number of Commissioners should be restored to six, if necessary. </P>
    <P>As Deputy Donegan said, we have heard no word from the Minister's side of the House as to why it is not possible to have an adequate number of Commissioners for the purpose of expediting that matter.  If that is what is required, far from having an adequate number of Commissioners, all that the Minister has done in that regard is to decide to get a Commissioner on the cheap by appointing the Secretary to the Department of Lands who, of course, is paid his salary as Secretary to the Department of Lands and gets a small allowance for acting also as a Lay Commissioner.  There is no other way of describing that.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we got another circular from the National Farmers Association dated 6th November in which they say:</P>
    <P>The document entitled &ldquo;Observations of the National Council on Land Bill, 1963&rdquo;... </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="538" /> This is the document to which I referred a second ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>... and dated October, 1964, which you now have in your possession, represents the considered opinion of this Association as expressed by our Council on behalf of our members, over 80 per cent of whom are owners of holdings under £35 PLV.  We would like to emphasise that our observations on the Bill have been drafted on the basis of policy decisions which were taken with the unanimous agreement of delegates from each and every one of our County Executives.  We hope that, in your deliberations on the Land Bill, you will find it helpful to have at hand the consenses of opinion of that section of the community which is directly concerned in the proposed legislation. </P>
    <P>As I say, not merely have I got that circular, not merely have I got those observations as a Deputy, but I also have the advantage of having heard at first hand the views of people from my constituency at this public meeting of members which was called and held at Naas, approximately a month ago and at which all four Deputies for the constituency were present.  This section was discussed that night.  I remember particularly one person got up and said he had no political views of any sort.  He was one of the people who was most vocal in saying that it was monstrous that the political head of a Department should be the person who would be entitled to decide whether land belonging to A should be inspected and not land belonging to B or land belonging to C.</P>
    <P>Some people may be misled by the fact that the section refers to the delegation to a senior inspector.  There are a certain number of senior inspectors around the country and the Minister has been trying to suggest that what this section means is that the senior inspectors will take their decision.  That is not what it says.  A senior inspector of the Land Commission is constitutionally bound to carry out the direction of the Minister.  If the Minister thought, for the purposes of expedition, <Col N="539" /> that it was necessary to have the decision taken down the country, as apart from Dublin, it would have been perfectly simple for him to devise a section by which his Department left that decision to be made in a manner in accord with the quasi-judicial powers of the Lay Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The position is quite simple.  The Land Commission have, virtually, a record of every piece of land in the country at present and it would be quite a simple matter in the areas concerned for the Lay Commissioners to go over those now and to have their decisions ready for action at the appropriate time.  That is not what the Minister has done.  He has deliberately framed this section in such a way as to give to himself, the Minister for Lands, the right and the power to say whose land is to be inspected and on whose land an inspector of the Land Commission is to enter.  That is what the section means; that is what the section says when you analyse it.</P>
    <P>If we are to believe Deputy Corry then, what he told us was that the purpose of this section was to ensure hereafter that he could tell the Minister for Lands to send an inspector down at once to inspect the land of so-and-so for the purpose of starting Land Commission proceedings and that he could see in this House that it was done. That may be in accord with what the Minister was trying to do behind the section permits him to do.  It is not in accord with the purpose for which he says he needed the section and it is not what he said the section would enable him to do, but it is what the section does enable him to do.</P>
    <P>Even leaving aside the political desirability of that, or the political undersirability of the Minister as the political head being able to do that, there is another aspect in relation to this section which I think will create unfortunate feelings.  All along an effort has been made, and correctly made, by the officials of the Land Commission to deal with their duties in rather the same way as a bank manager deals with his.  If you go into a bank to get <Col N="540" /> a loan, it is always the manager who gives it.  But when the day comes to call it in, it is always the directors of the bank who are the unpleasant people forcing the bank manager to ask you to pay it back.  By and large, the officials of the Land Commission have over the years been working on the same basis.  They have been trying to keep on reasonable terms with the people in the area of their operations. I do not blame them for it.  I think they are quite right and I think by keeping to that tradition, they were more likely to get accurate information.  They have been following the bank manager's advice and it is the Commissioners up in Dublin who have been taking the unpleasant decisions. This section destroys that.  The effect of this section will clearly be that the relationship between the officials of the Land Commission down the country and the people with whom they are dealing will be very much worsened in the future.  For that reason, quite honestly, I do not believe the officials in the Land Commission want this section.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect, too, in relation to this which we must consider, that is, the difficulties it will create in the general working of rural life.  We all know that the knowledge that there has been a formal inspection of land affects&mdash;has a great deterrent effect&mdash;a sale and reduces substantially the price the farmer can expect to get.  That does not matter if the Land Commission inspector goes in on a voluntary basis under the existing code and inspects the land.  Then, the auctioneer concerned and the clients know that he is going in for the purpose of endeavouring in a friendly manner to see whether he can put a satisfactory bid on the lands in accordance with their market value.</P>
    <P>That will not be the position under this section.  Once a forced acquisition inspection comes in under this section, the effect of it will be to reduce the value of that land in the open market by about 25 per cent.  I have already mentioned this.  I told the Minister on that occasion that it was the considered view of people who were <Col N="541" /> engaged, in their business, in dealing with this type of land sale from time to time that 25 per cent was perhaps an over-conservative estimate, and that in fact it might be very much more.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister want that to happen?  Does he want this to be another method of getting land on the cheap, another method of using the all-powerful forces of the State to overcome the individual farmer and to take his land from him at an uneconomic price, at a lower price than he would have been able to obtain in the open market?  Once a notice is served under this section, the open market is virtually gone at the market value.</P>
    <P>We will have in section 13, with which we have dealt already, the freezing, as Deputy Donegan said, for 12 months initially and now for six months, and the inevitable result of the two combined will be that the price of land will be forced down.  That is, I believe, one of the main reasons why the Minister is interested in getting this section through, together with the freezing powers in section 13.  That seems wrong.  As Deputy Rooney has said, many people had their land expropriated in the years 1932-1938. Many people up to the beginning of the emergency in 1939 had land taken from them for a twentieth of its value.</P>
    <P>This section, notwithstanding the provisions as regards market value that were included in the Land Act of 1950, will have the effect of depressing again for the benefit of the Land Commission the value of the land that will be acquired.  It may sound very nice for the Minister for Lands when it comes to considering the number of acquisitions which he can put through on the amount allowed to him on his Vote by the Department of Finance or allowed to him on the creation of land bonds.  It is bad principle and it unfairly weighs the powers of the State against the individual.  But, bad and all as that is and bad and all as I know the effect it will have is, it is far less obnoxious than the powers the Minister is being given politically to decide that one farmer's land is to be inspected, that one farmer's land is <Col N="542" /> to be dealt with and another is entitled to go free.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make just this remark.  I am proud, and my constituents are proud, of the action I took with the headlamps of my car which Deputy Sweetman and his noble leader were trying to camouflage, both last week and today.  I succeeded in pointing out to the Land Commission a way out where both the tenants and the Land Commission were agreed that the farm should be taken over for division.  It was bandied around for two years without a decision because the Land Commission, on the one hand, said they would have to buy it with bonds and the tenant, on the other hand, was not prepared to take bonds. The Commission were compelled to pay bonds because there was no migration on the holding.  I proved to the satisfaction of the Commission and myself that there would be migration and that enabled the Commission to come in and buy the holding at public auction.  I succeeded in making seven families happy by giving them each at least enough land to build up their uneconomic holdings into decent farms.</P>
      <P>Let us analyse Deputy Sweetman's objections to the provisions of this section.  One is that the Commission would be bound to carry out the decision of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The senior inspector would be bound to carry it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Either.  The Minister, in the first instance, must be elected by the people of the country to represent them in this House.  Secondly, he must be selected by this House as the person responsible for his Department.  Is he to come into this House after telling the senior inspector to do a certain thing and being told by the senior inspector that he will not do it, and answer questions put to him by either Deputy Oliver Flanagan or myself?  Is <Col N="543" /> he to whitewash the decision of that senior inspector who, according to Deputy Sweetman, has told him to go to hell?</P>
      <P>That is what Deputy Sweetman wants.  It is the situation in which this House, by foolish action, has placed a large number of Ministers from time to time.  When we come in here and ask questions about CIE of the Minister for Transport and Power, he sits down and says he has no function.  In the case of other Ministers, the reply is the same.  According to Deputy Sweetman, the elected representatives of the people, in this House, are to be deprived of all information in connection with affairs of State.  Deputy Sweetman speaks of political power. Might not the senior inspector be a member of the noble order of Freemasons or a noble Knight of Columbanus?  We do not know what order he might belong to and we have no means of finding out.</P>
      <P>If Deputies did their duty, there would be no need for one-tenth of the complaints we have had about aliens acquiring land throughout the country. I gave the example of a farm of 485 acres last week.  Many years ago the Land Commissioners were asked to step in.  I suppose poor Deputy Blowick had been told by the senior inspector that he would not examine the holding.  The result was that the farm was bought by an Englishman for £7,000.  It changed hands again.  A cattle dealer bought it and sold it to a German and it was up to £30,000 when the Land Commission took it over at market value.</P>
      <P>Now the unfortunate tenants will have to pay through the nose because of the neglect of a former Minister for Lands.  Any Deputy who wishes can trace the history of that farm through questions asked by the late Deputy Keane, God rest his soul, the former Deputy O'Gorman and myself.  The farm is at Finure, Whitegate&mdash;485 acres of the finest land in the country to which Deputy Blowick said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Are we to continue this practice of being told the Minister is responsible for his Department and then have the Minister tell us he has no function?  Deputy Sweetman has told us the chief inspector can tell the Minister to go to hell, that he will not inspect such and such a holding because he happens to be a comrade of someone in the noble order of Freemasons or in the noble order of the Knights of Columbanus.</P>
      <P>Let us get clear on this and see where we are, whether we want these things cleared up or not; whether we want absentees owning over 1,000 acres of land&mdash;absentee tenants, absentee landlords, absentee holders, holding land of that description in this country, unused, let in conacre year after year, with no-one to interfere with them, or whether we want the Minister to have power to step in and say he wants such a holding inspected.</P>
      <P>I claimed here to have a better knowledge of land law than any individual in this House, I do not care who he is.  I happen to be one of a family. My grandfather, the Lord rest his soul, was evicted out of a holding in Clare. He was turned out with 16 children on to the side of the road.  That land was purchased under the Ashbourne Act afterwards and he was reinstated.  My father purchased holdings under the 1903 Act, under the 1909 Act and under the 1923 Act&mdash;different holdings at different periods.  They were all purchased by public auction in the open market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I came into this House, I have had a flair for land law.  I remember having to go out in 1932 after this Government first came into office and gather up all the lame ducks, all the <Col N="546" /> fellows who were thrown on the side of the road, the fellows who had leases&mdash;long leases, short leases and medium leases.  I found one poor devil who was paying four rents and who could not be brought in under any of the Land Acts, not even the 1923 Act. He was paying rent to a landlord; he was paying a land annuity on the same holding; he was paying tithe rents on the same holding and he was paying Church temporalities on the same holding.  Sections had to be drafted to cover such cases.  I had to fight cases for tenants in the Lay Commissioners' court and in the Judicial Commissioners' court and I won quite a few of them.</P>

I quite understand the position of Deputies who do not want it, who are endeavouring to create a kind of scare. I am proud to be a member of a better organisation than any farmers' organisation in this country, the farmers' organisation that got for the farmers something that no other organisation was able to get, namely the pricing of their produce on costings.

      <P>There are very many dangerous proposals in the Land Bill which the Minister has introduced but, to my mind, by far the most dangerous provisions in this Bill are the proposals contained in section 27.  Deputy Corry had to leave again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>By far the most dangerous proposals are those contained in the section under discussion, section 27.  This section, to my mind, lays the foundations of a system which will invite political pressure and which will make it impossible for either Deputies of the Government Party, whatever Party that may be, or for the Minister in power to resist the political pressure which will be built up as a result of the Minister's decision to incorporate section 27 in his Land Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time, control is being taken into the hands of an active Party politician.  I am giving the Minister the credit of assuming that he is an active politician.  It is being taken into the hands of an active Party politician and that is being done deliberately.  It is being done&mdash;and I am not questioning the motives&mdash;the <Col N="549" /> Minister says in his explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill, for the purpose of speeding up land acquisition.  The Minister and the Deputies sitting behind him who support this provision may be very innocent indeed but enough has been said by interested organisations outside this House and by Deputies inside the House to convince the Minister and his Party that, in fact, what they are doing is stepping out on a very dangerous course, a course which is open to political abuse.  In many areas the powers which the Minister seeks to take in section 27 of this Bill could be used as a political weapon.  If this is allowed, it is only a small step from what the Minister proposes in section 27 to putting the politician in complete control in matters of land acquisition and ousting the land commissioners completely.</P>
    <P>The speech we have just heard from Deputy Corry seems to show that he at least would favour that course.  I do not know whether that is the general view of the Fianna Fáil Party but let me warn them that if it is their view, instead of cowing or intimidating the people by the political stick being held up, there is much more likely to be the type of backlash that Fianna Fáil will not enjoy, because the people do not want to see what they have regarded as their most sacred and most precious rights dependent on the will and the whim of any Party politician.</P>
    <P>There are many people in this country who in days gone by fought and sacrificed much in order to win from an alien Government the right to own their land.  What was won from an alien Government is now being filched from them by a Fianna Fáil Government because in future if the provisions contained in section 27 and already passed in sections 12 and 13 of this Bill are allowed to operate, the land-owners as we know them in this country will be a thing of the past.  In future they will hold their land merely on sufferance.  They will hold their land only so long as an active Party politician who for the time being holds the post of Minister for Lands decides that they should remain undisturbed in possession of their land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> I find it difficult to conceive that the Minister and the Deputies sitting beside and behind him do not appreciate the dangers of what they are doing, do not appreciate the door they are opening and the type of abuse likely to come in through that door.  I heard Deputy Dillon speaking from these benches last week paint a picture of what is likely to happen if section 27 of the Bill, coupled with section 13, is enacted as law by this House and by the Seanad. If that happens, Deputies supporting the Government Party can be challenged by any Fianna Fáil supporters in the country in regard to land division, land inspection, land acquisition, and can be told that it is their job to see to it that the Minister gets land inspected, and the Minister would have the power to get the land inspected.</P>
    <P>That type of political pressure could be put on, pressure which Fianna Fáil Deputies would find it extremely difficult to resist and pressure which a Fianna Fáil Minister, on the approaches of his Party, would find it equally difficult to resist.  There would be the situation where Fianna Fáil Deputies, if they wanted to do what they believed to be the right thing to do, would have to fight it out with their own supporters, and the Fianna Fáil Minister, if he wanted to do what he believed to be the right thing to do and leave it to the independent officials in the Land Commission to come to a decision, would then have to fight the battle in the Fianna Fáil Party rooms against the political pressures put on him in those rooms.</P>
    <P>Every Fianna Fáil Deputy, in fact, every Deputy in the House, sees the danger, the type of abuse which could arise if this Bill is allowed to operate containing in it section 13 coupled with section 27.  I cannot understand how, seeing that, the Minister can be so rigid in his attitude.  Remember, what we are saying is not personal to the present Minister or to the Deputies of his Party.  We are asked to legislate not merely for today or tomorrow but for the future, and the remarks we are making could apply to any Party or to any group of politicians who for the moment happen to be the Government. If the Minister insists on pushing this <Col N="551" /> through the House simply by weight of the numbers behind him, he will do an extremely bad day's work for the people.  The only redeeming feature is that sooner or later this thing will be tested out before the people and sooner or later some Government will replace the Minister's Government who will have the sense and the commonsense to repeal these proposals.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, and I do it quite sincerely and without seeking any political kudos out of it, even at this stage to reconsider the proposals in this Bill, particularly the proposal to take into his own hands as political Minister the power to decide what land is or is not to be inspected.  That is a power which no Minister, no politician, should have.  It is a power which, as I say, is open to the very gravest abuse and I would ask the Minister to reconsider that section and to give some indication to the House that between now and the next stage of the Bill, he will at least consult with the organisations outside this House who are vitally affected by this section, if he is not convinced by the arguments inside the House.  I believe if he does that, he will find that the backlash of which I spoke is there and that it may chasten him somewhat in his approach to this Bill.</P>

      <P>It is clear from Deputy O'Higgins's defeatist speech that he thinks Fianna Fáil will be here for all time.  Maybe he is right.  The problem with which we are faced is this: Do we intend to deal with this land question?  Is there any farmer in Ireland who has to fear any Minister or any Deputy if he is going to look after his farm and produce something worthwhile for himself and his family <Col N="552" /> and for the nation as a whole?  Not a single farmer need be afraid of anybody.</P>

      <P>I have been listening to the appeals here.  Is it the intention that we should leave the situation in which a man can go away and leave his land and the Minister should have no power to deal with that position?  We have heard a good deal from the Opposition about the people leaving the land.  Here, the Minister is trying, in a most reasonable way, to deal with this national problem.  Surely no Minister, irrespective of what Party he represents, will do anything gravely wrong or uncharitable. Every citizen is protected by the Constitution.  He has the law courts.  If he is aggrieved, he can go to the courts for redress.  He has the Lay Commissioners and he has his public representatives here.  I hope this democratic assembly will always be here to protect the rights of our citizens.</P>

Uneconomic holdings must be brought up to an economic size.  If there is anything unconstitutional involved here, the lawyers are there to challenge it.  That has been done before.</P>

      <P>Despite the speech we have just heard from Deputy Burke, I am still opposed to this section.  It appears to me that the section, when read in conjunction with earlier provisions, and particularly section 13, and this has been pointed out, gives the Minister a most undesirable power.  It is also clear that the Minister is anxious to prevent discussion on this section inside this House. He has intervened once or twice in an effort to prevent Deputies on his own side speaking.  It is perfectly clear the Minister would very much like to have this section steamrolled through. He appreciates, of course, that it does not bear that examination which it is our duty here to ensure it gets in the Dáil.  It is our concern to point out what is involved in this section.  We are doing so and we shall continue to do so, irrespective of how annoyed the Minister may be by having to sit here and listen to what we have to say.</P>
      <P>Land division in this country, associated as it has been in the past 100 years, or so, with the national movement, has achieved a certain appearance of fairness.  That was brought about by the creation of a division between the person politically responsible for the Land Commission and the Land Commission themselves.  Presumably that deliberate division has been resented by certain Ministers for Lands.  Clearly it is resented by the present Minister and he is now anxious to take from the Land Commission powers he was never intended to have, and we are discussing, on this section, part of that effort.  It will mean that a new power of political significance is given to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I spoke on this Bill, I gave this whole matter some further thought and I decided in regard to this proposed destruction of this glorious facade by a State Department that&mdash;and this is a surprising conclusion for me to arrive at&mdash;the Minister agrees with the Bill introduced by Deputy Seán Dunne but has been overpowered by his officials.  We have to judge everything by its form and that seems to have been the form of the Minister since he became Minister for Transport and Power; anything that his officials put up to him is accepted by him and brought into this House and pounded through this House.  I would exhort the Minister to make his own decisions. I do not believe that a man of the Minister's background would wilfully destroy this wonderful vista.  I should like to remind the Minister that if the ESB get their way and this destruction takes place, it will be remembered for him for ever, as the actor in the Abbey said.</P>
      <P>Last week I mentioned that more Deputies should have come in here, that it was not just a matter for a few Dublin Deputies.  I am rather proud of Deputy Seán Dunne and I want to compliment him on the manner in which he introduced the Bill and on the great research and hard work which he obviously put into it.  I am very parochial in my own way in this House and I am sure Deputies often accuse me of that.  I suppose I could only expect that from Deputy Seán Dunne because he comes from the same place as I do, from Waterford. I will say this much for the people there, that they would be more angry than the Dublin people about this coming destruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reminded the Minister last week also that he should not lightly brush aside the people who have come to <Col N="556" /> him and whom other Deputies could call pressure groups.  Mr. Desmond Guinness is the spearhead of the opposition outside the House to this proposed destruction and cognisance should be taken of what Mr. Guinness says.  I should like to remind the Minister that many beautiful things in Dublin have been presented to the nation by the Guinness family.  We are grateful to them for presenting us with the magnificent Iveagh House, one of the finest mansions in Dublin.  It may be of a later period than the facade of Fitzwilliam Street but it was a great house, and when the Guinnesses decided that there was no more need for a town house of that size, it would have been very easy for them to have sold it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are the servants of the people and if groups of people who are interested in certain things get together, Deputies and Ministers should take cognisance of what they say.

      <P>On a point of explanation, in view of the fact that officials of my Department have been commented on here, I want to make it clear to you, Sir, that the purpose of this debate is to decide whether my Ministry, together with the Oireachtas, should make a decision with regard to the preservation of certain buildings in Dublin.  Without recourse to pressure from any official or any advice from them, I have decided that the matter should be left in the hands of the Minister for Local Government and the Dublin Corporation.  The Deputy is quite entitled to say what he desires to say in this House but that is the issue on the occasion of this Bill, that is the issue before the House, quite simply, the transfer of certain powers and responsibilities to the Minister for Transport and Power of the day and to the Oireachtas and I have said that, in my view, that is not possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>From what I heard in the House this afternoon, the Minister for Local Government apparently &ldquo;jumped the gun&rdquo; on Dublin Corporation.  With respect to the Minister for Local Government, I do not think that he would be a judge of Georgian houses or that he would even give two hoots for them.  What he would do would be to pass this on to his officials. I am not making any attack on officials.  I am merely referring to a system I have been trying to fight in this House, especially in relation to the Minister who is present.  If what the Minister for Transport and Power says is true and this is passed on to the Minister for Local Government, people whose qualifications we do not know eventually come back to the Minister with a document and say: &ldquo;There it is&mdash;the sentence of death on the Georgian houses.&rdquo;  The Minister gives his imprimatur to it and it is passed on to the Minister for Trans port and Power, who says: &ldquo;They must go.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy S. Dunne and other Deputies say that these houses should not go and that this wonderful vista should not be destroyed.  We are anxious to go on record so that our children will know that we did not do this, that we appealed to the Minister for Transport and Power and did everything to prevent it.  I would be ashamed to have anything to do with an action of this kind.  We are told we should think of what is practical and modern.  We had the Taoiseach looking to the future and the atomic age, telling us he was not bothered about anything old but only looked forward to modern things. Before the week was out he looked back to things that were old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I like to look back on things that are old.  As far as the modern glass cages are concerned, I think they would be dreadful on that street.  A modern building can be splendid in the proper setting.  I am exhorting the Minister to get out of Fitzwilliam Street and do the really modern thing: build a block of offices in the green belt, where people can drive and park their <Col N="559" /> cars without let or hindrance and do their business.  The Minister is going to allow these offices to be built in Fitzwilliam Street.  That will add a further conglomeration of cars to those already there.  A main artery to Dublin will be blocked with traffic.  That should not be allowed, and members of Dublin Corporation should take note of it.  Today it is virtually impossible to find a parking space in the centre of the city.  Yet we are building blocks of offices there.  That will bring traffic to a standstill.  Now the Minister is going to add further to it.  The Sugar Company have built a block of offices at the corner of Leeson Street, but that was done before the Minister and his Department conceived this other plan.  In view of the fact that those offices have been built, the Corporation should have avoided giving even general consent to build the offices in Fitzwilliam Street.  From the information I have, the general consent given to the ESB and the Department of Transport and Power was given under the impression that the facade was to be preserved.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to members of the Fianna Fáil Party to bring pressure to bear on the Minister in regard to this. I am a member of a political Party.  If my Party were about to do this, I would disclaim it.  The members of the Government Party talk about democracy.  There is no democracy over there at all.  This Bill, and the Bill we were discussing since 4 o'clock, should send people in the Fianna Fáil Party to their feet to oppose their own Party. It is a matter of surprise to many supporters of the Minister, and to many who know the Minister, that he has stood for this.  Last Sunday I spoke to a man who knows the Minister well. He was of the opinion that everything was all right because he felt sure the Minister would not allow the facade to come down.  There is no harm to let the Minister know what the people are saying on the Rialto.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to have been convinced by the experts.  We have been given so many definitions of an expert.  The last one I heard was: a <Col N="560" /> man who comes from 60 miles away, who is not known to anyone and who knows nothing about what he is looking at.  Where there is such a difference of opinion among highly qualified men, men of great culture and taste, the Minister should look again.  Amongst those opposing him, the Minister will find the names of some of the most cultured people in this country and Great Britain.  I hope the Minister will change his mind and will not let it go on record for all time that he was the man who made the decision that the vista of Fitzwilliam Street should be destroyed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>In opposing this Bill, I submit that there is nothing of cultural or national importance in preserving every Georgian fade in Dublin.  I believe that any attempt to do so would be cultural and artistic sabotage.  If we were to decide to preserve the Georgian character of every old street in Dublin, we would surely stultify every effort of our planners, designers, architects and draughtsmen to build for us a city worthy of our native genius.</P>
      <P>We are now, or should be, endeavouring to provide for our citizens a city which will compare favourably with any capital in the world.  We will not do that by leaving a certain row of houses precisely as it is merely because the fronts have a certain architectural interest.  There are plenty of Georgian faades which we can preserve without losing sight of our main concern.  We need not, therefore, be unduly concerned at the loss of a few in Fitzwilliam Street.  If there is something special about the Georgian hall doors in Fitzwilliam street, I am sure the ESB will be glad to dismantle one or two and present them&mdash;free of charge&mdash;to any interested society which desires them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy S. Dunne refers to the &ldquo;swollen arrogance of semi-anony-mous rulers by decree,&rdquo; as reported at column 129 of the Official Report of Tuesday, 3rd November, 1964.  I presume he was referring to the management of the ESB.  If so, he was offering a gratuitous insult to men who are making the ESB perhaps our greatest <Col N="561" /> and most successful national undertaking&mdash;one in which Deputies on all sides of the House can take some pride.</P>
    <P>These are Irishmen as conscious of the physical and aesthetic needs of the capital and the country as are Deputy S. Dunne and his supporters.  They have shown initiative and progressive thinking throughout the whole range of the great industry which they control.  Can we not trust them to give us a building which will preserve the view of the mountains which so many presume to admire when it is pointed out to them&mdash;while, at the same time, giving us an example of Dublin's artistic progress?</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the ESB should move to the suburbs and that their present offices in Fitzwilliam Street be converted into flats to fulfil some of Dublin's housing needs is unrealistic. This would have the effect of giving us nothing more than temporary substandard dwellings.  The people of Dublin have had a surfeit of these. What they need now are blocks of new flats containing every amenity demanded by ever-rising standards.  Our architects and craftsmen can supply these if they are given the opportunity to do so and thereby help to re-create some of our own cultural and artistic heritage which was bludgeoned into unconsciousness many centuries ago.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that the preservation of a Georgian fade enhances the beauty of a street or district.  The block of flats built in Gardiner Street is much more beautiful and artistic than the Georgian fronts which were preserved in the reconditioning of Seán MacDermott Street, Gardiner Street and Summerhill.  I appreciate that this motion refers to one particular street but if the motion were successful who knows what other street we might be asked to preserve.  It would be well if supporters of the suggestion that Fitzwilliam Street be preserved would realise that Georgian Dublin is collapsing around us and our business is to rebuild on its ruins.</P>
    <P>Every branch of Irish culture went through a lean time in the years gone by.  Our writers, musicians, painters and architects were deprived of the opportunity to give expression to <Col N="562" /> national artistic genius.  We are charged with the responsibility of assisting our people to create for themselves a tradition in the realms of the arts which will not only be in keeping with a heritage which is almost lost but which will be representative of every worthy modern trend.  This artistic tradition will not be created in a year or two or ten years.  It will take a long time, but a start must be made and has, in fact, been made.  We should neglect no opportunity to press on with the work.</P>
    <P>If, in doing so, we erect some modern buildings which depress Deputy S. Dunne, I recommend to him the thought that, perhaps, the buildings which he, today, professes to admire were no less depressing to many eighteenth century Dubliners.  Deputy M.E. Dockrell is concerned, on aesthetic grounds, about the loss of the Georgian buildings.  Did the creation of beautiful things die with the Georgian era?  Can the twentieth century not create a beauty of its own?  It can, of course, but it never will, if obscurantist thinking is allowed to colour our approach to every progressive trend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Deputies in congratulating Deputy S. Dunne on bringing forward this matter for discussion.  Some people might think that, with various serious things happening in the country today, it takes the form of fiddling a bit to concern ourselves about the issue of whether or not a line of houses is removed but I do not think that anybody seriously holds that view.  All naturalised Dublin people and Dublin people who have lived here all our lives are so attached to Dublin that any change in it is a change in our environment and, being conservative as most people are, in matters of this kind, at any rate, we resent the change and are frightened of what the change might bring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems a little ungracious to say that I have not been completely convinced by the case made by people who want to retain these houses.  It is rather an unusual situation for me that I am still in two minds about what is the best thing to do.  Possibly Deputy S. Dunne may be able to help in replying to a few points which I <Col N="563" /> think neither he nor any of the speakers completely brought out to my satisfaction.  As to the ESB and their decisions, my general feeling about the ESB is that on the whole they have a good record in regard to standards in building.  I do not agree with Deputy T. Lynch about aesthetic values in the building of a power house or substation.  Maybe he has seen some ugly ones in Waterford but I have seen some in various parts of the country and I was surprised to find out that they were sub-stations.  They appear to be attractive and at the same time functional, serving the two important needs of any building nowadays.  It is quite likely that the ESB have these values very much in mind when they put forward proposals of this kind.</P>
    <P>I have not been impressed by Deputy Dunne's suggestion that these houses could be used for living accommodation.  In my view, they are most uncomfortable to live in and would not be manageable as residences any longer. Even assuming they could be made structurally sound&mdash;and that is suspect &mdash;I do not know if they could be made to provide flat type accommodation which would repay the outlay involved. I could agree with Deputy Cummins that the Gardiner Street attempted adaptation has turned out a complete fiasco.  If given a choice of living in the converted Gardiner Street houses or in the flats that have been built opposite, I should certainly opt for the flats. That is a simple and important test.  I have talked to people living in both types and there is no doubt that the Dublin people would prefer to live in the flats rather than the converted houses.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much validity in the suggestion that we could use these houses to provide the additional accommodation which is so badly needed in the city.  I think such accommodation could be provided otherwise much more quickly and probably much more economically.  A certain amount of criticism has been made of the ESB. They are a semi-State organisation and have acquired what we now know to be, at present market prices, an almost priceless piece of property.  On the <Col N="564" /> whole, we must give credit for this to the ESB.  They bought this property when it was not in tremendous demand and it is now a great capital asset as a building site from the strictly functional point of view.  There is great attraction in that idea.  If we tell organisations such as the ESB&mdash;and this is common policy of the Parties&mdash; that they should be strictly functional and run on the lines of strictly paying their way, I do not think we can fairly ask the ESB not to develop this capital asset to the maximum and get the most value out of it.  If that site were held, as has been said, by a commercial interest in the city, it would be developed to the full and, judging by precedents, without any serious regard to aesthetic results.</P>
    <P>The ESB happen to have this very valuable property and you must make up your mind whether you will ask them to act the part of a national trust &mdash;it should be the function of such a body&mdash;and ask the consumers of electricity to foot the bill for maintaining this monument to Georgian Dublin.  It seems to me that in this way you could retain this monument for the people generally.  I know, as most people agree, that you cannot live in this type of house nowadays; neither can you work in it.  Anybody who knows the vast rooms and high ceilings appreciates it is impossible to carry out, I should imagine, efficiently, the day-to-day work of the ESB in them. It might be possible for dress firms or embassies or people of that kind to work there but the buildings are not suitable as office accommodation. There is one exception, for what it is worth, that is, the blood transfusion service.  Those responsible made a rather fine adaptation of their houses and allied the functional to the aesthetic.  From what I can gather, I believe it would not be possible to do that with the Fitzwilliam Street houses.</P>
    <P>You cannot work in them or live in them and the only case for retaining them is to do so as a sort of national monument.  If you want to do that, clearly you must pay the price and somebody, presumably the State, must establish some sort of national trust to buy these buildings from the ESB at <Col N="565" /> market price, which is very considerable.  If people are serious about this proposition, they must face the situation that this must become a national charge and must be paid for in the form of taxation of some kind.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to abuse the ESB for not doing something which the community should already have taken steps to do if they were conscious of the loveliness of the Georgian period and its influence on Dublin and its development.  We should have ensured this dilemma would not arise.  It is wrong to exonerate, as appears to have been done, the people responsible for the fact that Dublin town is falling down due largely to neglect of landlords over the years to maintain these houses in structurally sound condition.  That is going back, all water under the bridge, and the realities are that the town and the houses are falling down and we are in the position in which if it is decided to keep these buildings, it is a matter for the Dáil and the Minister to decide.  If Deputy Dunne is successful in persuading people to maintain this fade from Holles Street to Leeson Street a quite different body should be asked to take on that responsibility and the ESB should be compensated for their foresight in purchasing this most valuable property.</P>
    <P>I speak now as somebody deeply devoted&mdash;if one can so express it&mdash;to the city of Dublin.  This attempt to retain the existing physical environment is a rather worrying thing in a generation at any particular point in time.  I worry about it because I feel that the forward-looking approach to it should be to say: &ldquo;We must make our contribution towards this city.  The city is a growing dynamic living thing and it is no good trying to fossilise or mummify it or keep it absolutely static at a point in time.&rdquo;  There is some similarity between this movement&mdash; they may see it themselves and I feel great sympathy with them&mdash;and the language enthusiasts, because they are in the same dilemma, attempting to retain something that is hardly a practical propostion in existing circumstances.  It is very sad and it is regretted by everybody.  At the same time, it is <Col N="566" /> a victim of the passage of time, the reality, and the possibility that we simply must move over and remove these buildings.</P>
    <P>Is Deputy Dunne justified in his fear?  I disagree with Deputy Cummins over a point he made.  Look at Dublin. Deputy Cummins spoke of the tremendous achievement we have made over the years.  Deputy Dunne is justified in being frightened of the next step.  I do not believe Ballyfermot, Crumlin, Drimnagh and all these other places would be considered a tribute to our aesthetic values and our understanding of beauty.  I consider it quite scandalous, while driving or walking through these places, that people live in the appalling anonymity of these houses.  They are like one dog kennel after another.  It must be terribly demoralising to live in them.  I do not believe in time to come we will want to take steps to preserve those places.</P>
    <P>If one looks around the city of Dublin at the present time and sees the buildings which are going up, I do not believe one will agree with Deputy Cummins that Dublin is a beautiful city.  I consider the Dublin we are creating is appalling.  I consider the new Liberty Hall and the other sheet plateglass buildings which are going up are horrible.  I know there is one new building along the canal, the new insurance building, which has some beauty.  Most of the buildings going up are without any personality and without any aesthetic value at all. Our churches are, pretty well without exception, vulgar and unimaginative. They are pedestrian at best in their general design and interior decoration, decor, furnishings and general equipment.  Our hotels are much the same. They are completely lacking in imagination.  There is appalling vulgarity in inside decoration.</P>
    <P>I do not know where one can look to see some sign of hope that we will be able to create something as beautiful as, or even more beautiful than, the thing we are taking away.  Deputy Dunne's fear is pretty well justified. I do not believe a country can lose, as we have lost, 1,000,000 people, and not <Col N="567" /> lose artistic, cultural and intellectual talent of every kind.  When we come to replace the Georgian fade with something as beautiful or more beautiful, we will find we simply have not got the talent to do so.  In fact, we have not got any particular quality of people in any of our professions, medicine, engineering, journalism or politics.  We have not got any particular architectural sense.  We have not got anybody to equal such personalities as Joyce, Becket, Shaw and, even more recently, people like John Kenny, who have left the country and have left us mostly like hens pecking our own eyesight out.  We are a dull, mediocre collection which has little or nothing to offer to the creation of a really beautiful Dublin to replace Georgian Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am, as I say, torn between the functional and the beautiful.  I do not see why one cannot marry the two, why it is impossible to have the two. The Taoiseach made a passing remark and said he was all for strictly functional.  I know he was speaking without any serious thought but I am slightly frightened by that approach because it is one I tend to myself.  I like things to be efficient and it occurred to me if one takes that view, one could take silver plaques and salvers and melt them down and make halfcrowns.  You would have something much more valuable, in simple terms, than the silver salvers.  Perhaps it is an expression of the faint-minded to say you can replace Georgian buildings with something as beautiful.  I do not see that we have anything with which we can replace those buildings or that we have anybody who is likely to replace those beautiful fades.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we have seen that it is possible to replace old buildings with new buildings which will blend with the old surrounding buildings. Deputy Dunne has to face that choice. Does he believe that the Georgian fade can be replaced by anything as beautiful or more beautiful?  We have seen what has been done in various places in this regard.  Trinity College is a very good example because it has tended to grow over the centuries. <Col N="568" /> Some of the buildings are of appalling vulgarity and others are of absolute impeccable beauty.  We have the engineering school on the one hand and then the horrible building which faces it. There is the likelihood that they will be able to produce a very beautiful library there.</P>
    <P>I suggest to Deputy Dunne that it is possible to merge the beauty of generations with new buildings and to create ultimately a wholly beautiful block of buildings.  The new Royal College of Physicians in London, I understand, merges with the old surrounding buildings.  Most people say it is a very beautiful modern building. While it fits in with the old beautiful buildings, it does not appear to be offensive.  It merges in with the surrounding buildings.  So it is possible, I presume, that we could try to get that type of merger of a modern building with the old.</P>
    <P>The only difficulty I face is that the Minister for Local Government cursorily said this afternoon that he had looked at plans which were to replace the site and he did not like them.  He did not like those presented by the ESB and sent them back, asking that changes be made and when the changes were made, he said.  &ldquo;They are all right now and fit in with the Georgian architecture generally and you can go ahead.&rdquo;  I think it was presumptuous to say that and I do not know what authority he had behind him to say that or justify the imprimatur he seems to think he could give on the design, as to what was acceptable, what fitted in and what did not.</P>
    <P>It boils down eventually to an act of faith in our own time.  I have no reason to believe we have any right to have any faith in the creative talents of our own time.  I know none of the products of our architects generally which would lead me to believe that we can trust them with this replacement.  Where we have had open competitions for the building of new buildings, such as University College Dublin new buildings and the Trinity College new buildings, none of our architects made any significant impact. It is presumptuous to say so but that <Col N="569" /> situation tends to support one's view that they are not competent to cope with a problem of this kind.</P>
    <P>Is it possible then, and would the Minister consider it desirable, because of the seriousness of the decision he has taken, and because of its importance, to lay down that it is most unlikely that we could create this ourselves?  It is regrettable but it is true. You cannot have an environment, education and background such as ours and not have a full appreciation of the beautiful by artists or architects who might fully understand these things operating in these terms.  In these circumstances, can the ESB be permitted to go ahead working on designs, the product of open competition on the same lines as competitions carried out elsewhere?  If it is felt that is not possible, that it cannot be done and that it should be restricted, and that we are not likely to get as good, or more beautiful, then presumably you would be justified in retaining the fade.</P>
    <P>With regard to asking the ESB either to take them over as a national trust or to build behind the fade, it does not strike me as a practicable proposition, and I would not be keen on it.  There should not be an attempt merely to preserve them for another generation, a generation who possibly might not take them as of our generation.  The general principle is that the beautiful is not really a negotiable commodity.  Because of that, they should be preserved, irrespective of the price.  They have the creative genius of a Frank Lloyd Wright or a Corbusier who could produce something so lovely that that generation would turn to them and say: &ldquo;These we created.&rdquo;  Instead, we are at the moment hiding behind an excellently fraudulent fade of derelict buildings. To me it is a measure of our own inadequacy and if we can do anything else, I shall be greatly surprised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first, to congratulate Deputy Seán Dunne on his opening statement in this debate.  He certainly put a tremendous amount of work into his case for <Col N="570" /> the Bill and came in fully conversant with his facts.  He did not convert me because I did not require to be converted.  I am of the opinion that every city has its own personal and distinctive personality and I do not think any Deputy or any Minister, will disagree with the fact that, embedded in the personality of Dublin, is this old Georgian architecture.</P>
      <P>Many arguments have been adduced in this debate, which has gone into its second week now, in relation to what should and should not be done.  Many arguments have been brought forward to the effect that Gardiner Street should have been preserved.  Some maintained that.  Others maintained that the reconstruction that took place there was more beneficial to the city as a whole than leaving it as it was. The conditions, of course, are not at all parallel.  In Gardiner Street the houses had become derelict and were on the point, as many other houses in Dublin were I regret to say, of collapse and were becoming a public menace and a danger.  They were cleared for the purpose of reconstruction.  What this Bill, as I take it, endeavours to do is to preserve and maintain the finest Georgian fade existent in Europe today.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, every city depends for its personality on a certain type of architecture.  If we permit this scheme, as is envisaged now, to be carried out and the removal of this long stretch, which I might say is world-famous and known by architects and artists all over the world, I consider that we as public representatives who live for and represent Ireland today are not doing our duty in the city of Dublin.  I speak with some reserve as I am a countryman and have no Dublin traditions or background, but I have had an opportunity of visiting many other cities and studying architectural conditions there and I always take away an impression of the architectural culture and background of the city concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies will argue that it is necessary to do this for utility purposes, that it is necessary to reconstruct these houses and remodel them. I should like to point out that in a <Col N="571" /> great number of European cities, and in other parts of the world as well, much forcible removal of houses has taken place by virtue of bombing, and so on, during the wars which we have been through.  I should also like to stress the point that old streets designed by architects 100, 200, or even more years ago, have been grossly interfered with and modern devices or architecture of the type to which Deputy Dr. Browne referred as the sheet glass type adopted which to me are an outrage to the vision.</P>
    <P>We have this street in the city of Dublin and the argument in favour of abolishing it as made by the Minister yesterday is simply that what happened was there was a Government decision. That decision was left to the Minister for Local Government and he decided whether this row of houses should be swept away or not.  The Minister for Local Government left it to those who are in an advisory capacity in that regard, the Dublin Corporation.  The officials of the Corporation or the elected representatives&mdash;I do not know which because I am not privy to their private affairs in any way&mdash;decided that the most economic and suitable thing to do was to remove this street and permit the ESB to construct a modern street there.</P>
    <P>I have the impression&mdash;I did not hear the Minister's speech but I read it &mdash;that the Minister agrees with the major portion of the motive behind this Bill but that the Government have already met on the matter, that a Government decision has already been taken and, of course, he is loyal to that decision.  I can put no other interpretation on the situation because the Minister, whenever he has defended himself, has stated it is a matter for the Corporation and the Minister for Local Government&mdash;that an appeal had been made by the Georgian Society against the decision of the Corporation and that the Corporation decision was final.</P>
    <P>That is the position at the moment. We are the people who legislate for this country, who must try to interpret the <Col N="572" /> opinions of the public and act on them. I should like to stress to the Minister-though I do not think it is necessary, that there is a very strong volume of opinion in the country to the effect that this is the perpetration of an outrage on the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The question was posed by Deputy Dr. Browne whether the ESB should be restricted in their endeavour to do the most economic thing.  This business goes far beyond the confines of the ordinary commercial undertakings of the ESB.  Of course, nobody can blame the ESB for trying to procure for themselves the most modern, up-to-date structure, the most economical proposition from their point of view, but there is the other aspect: why should it be left to the ESB to decide what the appearance of Dublin should be, in direct conflict with the opinion of so many others in the country?</P>
    <P>It has been very sensibly suggested by Deputy Seán Dunne that the ESB might move out.  He has asked why they should stay where they are.  In modern conditions, the ESB might be better off somewhere else.  If it were considered desirable to remunerate the ESB for any loss suffered in getting out of these premises, it could be done and this street preserved.  Thus, something would be done to maintain Dublin as the city people know and have known and admired not only in the present but during the last century as well.</P>
    <P>All cities have their own particular personalities.  Deputy Dr. Browne referred just now to the modern reconstruction of Dublin.  He searched for a word to describe what he felt and I thought of giving it to him but felt he might think I was interrupting.  The word is &ldquo;unimaginative&rdquo;.  It is what we are now confronted with in Dublin. I do not say that modern architecture cannot be beautiful or, indeed, striking. Anybody who has had an opportunity of visiting cities, completely razed during the last war and some of which have been rebuilt <i>en bloc</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have never <Col N="573" /> seen Coventry but I believe that following its destruction during the war, it is now one of the most architecturally attractive cities in the world, with no traffic problems.  I have seen Stuttgart which was completely razed. I did not know the old city but the new one has grown up as one of the beauties of the age.  Whoever was responsible for its reconstruction had imagination, unlike those responsible for Ballyfermot and other such places.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he refuse to permit this street to be destroyed.  If he feels it is not in keeping with the policy of construction and reorganisation of the ESB, he should suggest to them that they leave the premises.  What has happened to the original scheme whereby it was decided that the fade or frontage of this street could be maintained and the premises modernised at the rere?  I do not agree with Deputy Dr. Browne that these houses could not be reconstructed in accordance with modern trends, still keeping their Georgian aspect.  They could be developed as modern residential flats so long as there are four walls, secure and solid, within which to work.  It should not be beyond the ingenuity of man to reconstruct them, providing lower ceilings and smaller rooms within.</P>
      <P>The Minister must realise that there is a strong volume of opinion against this move.  The Georgian Society in Dublin issued a petition which has been signed by many people, including myself.  There is a strong nostalgic feeling among people not so vociferous in the city.  These people hold that such institutions and traditions should be allowed to survive.  They ask: why should we lose ourselves entirely in the modern age?  Any American who visits the country&mdash;the more who visit us the better&mdash;and any European who visits, first of all, looks for something old, something of a period.  According to the records, they should find here excellent examples of Georgian type buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this measure is not accepted, the Fianna Fáil Government, through the medium of the Minister&mdash;I am sorry for him because I do not think he agrees with the decision&mdash;will be responsible <Col N="574" /> for the destruction of such period examples, the destruction of a very old, very famous and very beautiful street in the heart of the city of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We meet in a Chamber today which proudly displays Malton's prints of some of the fine buildings of 18th century Dublin.  It would seem from the remarks of Deputies opposite and, unfortunately, of one or two beside me, that many Deputies do not use their odd minutes in the Lobbies to view these pictures with the respect they deserve.  They have been hanging for years and, reflecting on the beauty that once was Dublin, we find it being ruined by unscrupulous, bludgeoning bureaucrats, incompetent and amoral Ministers and indifferent local authorities who are bringing about a crisis in architectural effect and the manmade beauty of this country of ours.</P>
      <P>I suppose it would be possible for beauty to survive an unscrupulous bureacracy and also to survive an incompetent Minister if they both operated alone, but when they operate in unison, as they are now doing with the blessing of the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Transport and Power and the whole rank and file of the Fianna Fáil Party, it would seem that what is worthwhile not only in material values but in cultural and moral values will suffer.  No amount of passing the buck on the part of the Minister for Transport and Power will cure that sorry situation.</P>
      <P>For many years the crown sitting on the top of our national emblem, the harp, was regarded as a symbol of servitude.  We removed the crown.  We should replace it with the buck, the buck that is passed, the buck that people like to have to pass, which is imposing a new servitude upon the Irish people who want to free themselves of the dictation of incompetent, indifferent and unscrupulous bureaucrats and Ministers alike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak advisedly when I say that the bureaucrats of the public authority in this case, the ESB, are unscrupulous.  I speak because I am informed and it is not information <Col N="575" /> which arises only since 1955.  The Minister's file and map appear to go back to 1955 and the declarations the ESB have made on the matter, as far as I have been able to find out, appear to come only from the past ten, 12 or 15 years.  But what is not known generally is where this rot started.  It did not start when these houses were built. It did not start because these houses were not as well built as the houses in Merrion Square.  It started when the ESB, contrary to the advice of their own engineers and architects given to them in the 1930s and the 1940s, deliberately knocked down internal walls, deliberately put weights on floors that were never intended to carry them, deliberately abused the houses in Lower Fitzwilliam Street, although they were told by their engineers and architects&mdash;and if they have not burned the files they are still there &mdash;that by doing these things, they would bring about the early death of these buildings, but the ESB deliberately did them.</P>
    <P>This information comes to me from a man who served in the ESB.  I am not in a position to disclose his name because of the victimisation the unscrupulous bureaucrats and the Minster would bring to bear upon him and his colleagues if it were known but I state it here in full conviction of the accuracy of my statement because I have seen a copy of one of the minutes concerned.</P>
    <P>In our history book we are reminded of a Lord Lieutenant whose name escapes me now but whose statue stands in the City Hall, Dublin, a man who although he was a foreigner and the representative of a foreign king in this country, is respected by us because he coined the phrase that property has its duty as well as its rights. That is a pious notion that apparently we all should respect.  That is the kind of thing for which we will build statues to men who say it but, in the 20th century, we will not ask Ministers of State or semi-State bodies or any power that is big enough to defy what is decent, to respect that principle. That is the sorry plight to which we have come and which obliges us here, <Col N="576" /> because of the wisdom and courage of Deputy Seán Dunne, to debate at the eleventh hour the butchery and vandalism being carried out by a public authority in this State.</P>
    <P>I use the words &ldquo;public authority&rdquo; advisedly.  I am not really concerned whether it is one Minister or another, or one State company or another, or one Government Department, or one local authority or another.  All I know is that any person associated with public life in this country, either as a servant or as an elected representative, will be disgraced before posterity if we allow this vandalism to continue in Fitzwilliam Street in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I suppose we are carrying on a vain fight, when even at this stage, after the issue has been one of great public controversy for two years, a member could have stood up within the past half hour in this House and say: &ldquo;Sure what is in a few houses in Lower Fitzwilliam Street?&rdquo; Does not it show how shallow must be the minds and the reading of some people that they can think only of a few houses in Lower Fitzwilliam Street as a few houses of no consequence?  In themselves they are but a few houses, but in their position, in their planning, in their perspective they are the best of Georgian Dublin; they are the best example of the skill and ability of the professional men and the craftsmen and the artists of the 18th century in Dublin, when Dublin was one of the most beautiful capitals in Europe, and even today it could preserve some of what was then the best and what still in the years to come could be a shining example of the commencement of the idea of town planning in these islands.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power appealed to us who have protested over the past few years to be silent about what has already gone and what he wishes us to accept as completed and asks us instead to turn our energies to the future, because, he said, there will be opportunities under the 1963 Planning Act to ensure that what the ESB have left and what the other vandals and butchers have not been able to get at before the 1963 Act, can be capable of preservation.  Is that not a lovely thought?  Is that <Col N="577" /> not a generous approach to the problem from a member of a Government whose colleague, in the very week the Town Planning Act of 1963 was coming into operation, forestalled any attempt to preserve Fitzwilliam Street by making an order under the old legislation that the 1963 Act had repealed and had consigned to the wastepaper basket, allowing the demolition gangs to go ahead and to operate?  How on earth can any ordinary citizen have respect for public authority, for a Government, for a Department of Local Government, which deliberately prevent Dublin Corporation and deliberately prevent public opinion from preserving what they want to preserve, simply by using a defunct piece of legislation when it is on its last legs, wobbly legs, when it is about to pass out of our Statute Book and out of our memory for all time?</P>
    <P>That is a peculiar way in which to induce people to have regard to town planning.  That is a peculiar way in which to inspire the ordinary man in the street not to try to find loopholes in planning legislation.  It would seem to me that the action of the Minister for Local Government, condoned by the Government, amounts to an encouragement to every vandal to find some way or another to avoid his responsibilities to his country and to his fellow man.</P>
    <P>If it be that the ESB are to be allowed to go ahead, it seems to me grossly unfair to impose any obligation on the neighbours of the ESB to preserve 18th century architecture. Why should the ESB be allowed to do away with it if others are to be obliged to preserve it?  If others are not going to be obliged to preserve it, then, in heaven's name, why was it made a condition in the scheme that in the new development the new building would have to harmonise with the surrounding 18th century architecture? Are we to understand that the duties that relate to property are to be imposed upon everybody else, upon the next door neighbours of the ESB, upon everybody in the vicinity of the ESB, but not upon the ESB themselves?  That apparently is the notion <Col N="578" /> that we in Dáil Éireann are asked to accept.  That is the notion the Minister propagates in his rejection of Deputy Dunne's Bill.</P>

      <P>If the Minister finds pleasure in that kind of thing, I should like to deprive him of it by saying: let him abolish Dublin Corporation if they are responsible for this butchering of 18th century town planning and architecture in Dublin; they should be abolished&mdash;the Dublin Corporation, the Minister for Transport and Power or the Minister for Local Government, whoever is responsible.  The reality of the situation is as put by Deputy Dunne who foresaw the futile arguments the Minister was to advance. Deputy Dunne dealt at length with the behaviour of the Dublin Corporation in relation to the ESB proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was the first to raise in Dublin Corporation the proposed vandalism of the ESB and when I did, I was told Dublin Corporation knew nothing about it.  They only knew what had been seen in the newspapers, a report that the ESB proposed to demolish the buildings.  It was some considerable time after that that Dublin Corporation received from the ESB an application &mdash;to use the phrase the bureaucrats love and which the Minister also <Col N="579" /> admires&mdash;for general permission to develop the property.</P>
    <P>That was the position at that stage. The elected representatives of Dublin Corporation had no power or function, good, bad or indifferent, in regard to the giving or withholding of permission in relation to that application.  I want that clearly understood.  The Minister ought to understand it and if he does not, he just gives another example of his incompetence to which I referred at the outset.  The elected representatives, the 45 members of the Dublin Corporation, had no power or capacity to deal with that at all.  It was brought before the Streets Committee, or one of the many committees of the Dublin Corporation, by the manager as a matter of courtesy, as being one in which the members might be interested. I attended that meeting, to be told that no matter what views the elected representatives held, no matter what views the city architect held, no matter what views the City Manager might have in the matter, the Dublin Corporation would have to give the permission. They had no power to refuse the general permission to develop the property because they knew the buildings were dangerous.</P>
    <P>Again, let us go back to why these buildings were dangerous, not because they were not as well built as the houses in Merrion Square 100 or 200 years ago but because the ESB had deliberately misused the house, taking out supporting walls and putting weights on the floors that were never intended to carry them.  If you did that with a house that was built in 1963, if you removed internal supporting walls and put computers and heavy electrical equipment on the floors, the house would collapse overnight.  The fact that the houses in Fitzwilliam Street have not collapsed sooner than this is an indication of their strength and the sensible and sound way in which they were built.</P>
    <P>Let us get back to this committee meeting, the minutes of which are not available to the public because of the way in which a public authority works for the benefit of the citizens, invariably <Col N="580" /> behind closed doors.  The position is that the helpless Corporation are now being blamed by the Minister because they gave general permission for the development of the property, when in fact they had to do it, because if the property was to be rendered safe again, if it was to be rebuilt in the manner in which and with the materials with which it was built in the 18th century, that general permission would have had to be given.</P>
    <P>That is all the Corporation did. That can in no way be regarded as permission for the ESB to go ahead with their vandalism.  That is the Corporation's blame in the matter, the same blame as attaches to any parent who allows a child to go out of the home any hour of the day and the child commits an act of vandalism. The child must leave the house on lawful business and if the child commits an act of vandalism, it is not fair to blame the parent.  It is the same with the Corporation.  They had to pursue the lawful business of rendering this situation safe and that is all the Corporation did when they gave the permission.</P>
    <P>If I am wrong in that, then wrong advice, improper advice, was given to the Dublin Corporation by the officials of the Dublin Corporation.  If I am contradicted in this, then some heads will fall in Dublin Corporation for the wrong advice which was given by officials of the Corporation to elected representatives six or seven years ago.</P>
    <P>I attended the meeting in the Dublin Mansion House addressed by Sir Albert Richardson, and in the course of that meeting, members of the Dublin Corporation were attacked for permitting the ESB to go ahead with their plans.  Of the 45 members of the Dublin Corporation, as far as I know I was the only one present.  I made it clear again on that occasion that the advice was that we had no power to stop the ESB, that if we knew it to be otherwise, steps would be taken to stop the ESB.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for Transport and Power is really ashamed and upset, that he is extremely annoyed with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, because he has permitted <Col N="581" /> the ESB to demolish the 18th century architecture in Lower Fitzwilliam Street and put up some modern monstrosity in its place.  However, if the Minister does not agree with what is happening, he should do the same as his colleague, Deputy Paddy Smith, and I can assure him that although his colleague, Deputy Smith, had great difficulty in getting certain newspapers to carry the story of his resignation, if the Minister takes this step, we will give him all the credit and the publicity he deserves.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave expression to some other remarks in the course of his apologia and I should like to make some reference to them.</P>

      <P>I was saying, Sir, when progress was reported, that we had reached the situation in relation to land division in this country wherein it was regarded as essential that both the mode of acquisition and the division of land should appear to be fair.  As a result of the events in the early thirties, we had reached a stage, in particular, in which it was accepted that land division and land acquisition should appear to be above and removed from politics.  It was because of both these important aspects that the existence of an independent statutory authority, known as the Land Commission, became inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission, under the land legislation, operated and fulfilled a function between the Department of Lands and its political head, the Minister for Lands, and the people concerned with land division.  The role the Land Commission have played down through the years has been designed to safeguard people from the unbridled actions of an executive arm.  It is for that reason that nobody but the Land Commissioners may decide, under the present law, what land may be inspected with a view to acquisition just <Col N="582" /> as no authority, except the Land Commission, may decide what land may be acquired for division.</P>
    <P>The existence of these reserved powers in the Land Commission has been, of course, of irritation to politically-conscious Ministers for Lands and, in that regard, the present Minister is clearly an outstanding example.  The present Minister is concerned for the political kudos that may arise from the appearance of a speedup in land division.  He cannot appear to be dividing land unless he can achieve a situation in which inspectors are sent around the place inspecting people's holdings.  The Land Commission would not permit that and, under existing law, the Minister could not order inspectors to inspect.  But he is now asking Dáil Éireann to give him the power to order civil servants to go in on a farmer's land and inspect it, knowing that the result will be that that farmer, from the day the inspector sets foot on his land, may not let, sell, or deal with his land in any way for a period of 12 months, or longer.</P>
    <P>In my view, this is an outrageous proposal.  It is contrary to all the accepted principles of land division. It is an effort to obtain a form of control over land, and the occupation and use of land, which our people have never given to anyone.  I suspect it is being done for political purposes.  I know well that Deputies, like Deputy Corry, have come in here and talked about delays in land division, delays in getting this, that and the other done. What is Deputy Corry really saying? He is complaining of the fact that he has not the power to divide land in his constituency.  May the Lord preserve us from that situation.  If we ever reach the situation in which a Fianna Fáil Deputy, a Fine Gael Deputy, or any other Deputy, can, by arousing agitation amongst people, railroad the division of land, then this country will have taken a step backwards.</P>
    <P>If land division is to be sound and fruitful, if the people who work the land are to play their full part, as they do, in the economic life of the nation, it is essential there should be some legal machinery whereby the political caprice and whim of the moment can <Col N="583" /> be stayed so that a worthwhile and proper decision can be taken.  That is the function of the Land Commission. This section is designed to destroy the Land Commission.  It is designed to push them out of the way as a body found to be momentarily politically inconvenient.  No one will convince me that this is not being done for purely short-term political advantage for the people who propose it.</P>
    <P>It has been indicated by Deputies on this side of the House, that our function here is to point out what is being done wrong.  We shall do that irrespective of whom it offends or whom it suits.  We believe this provision is wrong.  If it is passed, it will be passed by the votes of Deputies who know in their hearts that it is wrong.  It will be passed by Deputies who will on another occasion go out to preach and defend the rights of private property and the desirability of having in this country a nation of independent, frugal, hardworking farmers.  This section is intended to destroy the independence of the Irish farmer.  It is intended to make him dependent on political patronage and the goodwill of the political head of the Department of Lands.  It is intended to make our farmers servile, to make them touch the forelock and doff the cap before local political pundits.</P>
    <P>I believe, as other Deputies believe, that if this section is passed, the reaction will be extreme indeed.  Once it has been established here that a Minister can, by a flick of his fingers, send a civil servant in on a man's land and, by that action, deprive him of the right to deal with, or let, or run his land as he wishes, then the Minister who does that will have started something that he will bitterly regret.  I do not believe our people will accept it and I am certain that, if this provision is passed here, it will not be very long before another Minister for Lands, in a different Government, will propose its repeal.</P>

      <P>If you invoke the names of Davitt, Parnell and O'Brien, if you invoke the history of land tenure over 80 years, you cannot do so lightly. Deputy Dillon says, and I quote him from column 398 of Volume 212 of last Thursday's debate:</P>
      <P>I want to give you the most solemn possible warning of this&mdash;you are going to invent the most pestilential instrument of political blackmail ever forged in the history of this country. </P>
      <P>They are fighting words.  They are either right or they are wrong.  Later on in the same speech Deputy Dillon invoked not merely the history of this country but also his father and grandfather before him and said:</P>
      <P>Love of the land is very deep in this country.  I solemnly warn you that if that transaction were repeated in many parts of Ireland, you would raise ghosts the nature of which you ought not to have forgotten. </P>
      <P>Later on, at column 402, he asked:</P>
      <P>Are we not reversing the whole course of history? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of this country are entitled to know whether the charges now being levelled against this Party, against the Government and against the Minister, are fairly laid or do not lie.  The people of East Galway, who will shortly be voting in a by-election, are entitled to know whether Deputy Kenny was right when he spoke in Headford after me and stated that <Col N="585" />&ldquo;this is a contemptuous thing&rdquo;.  Since he is a teacher, I take it that he was not confusing it with the word &ldquo;contemptible&rdquo;&mdash;the word he used was &ldquo;contemptuous&rdquo;.  He told the people of Headford and East Galway that we were doing something contemptuous, that this was designed to enable every Fianna Fáil Deputy, Senator and supporter to wield a political axe over his neighbour.  The basis of Deputy Dillon's argument and the basis of these very grave allegations which are being made is that we are attempting to destroy the fixity of tenure of the Irish farmer.</P>
    <P>I do not think that Deputy Dillon is right.  I do not think that Deputy T.F. O'Higgins is right.  I do not think that Deputy Kenny is right.  I do not think that Fine Gael are right.  If I thought they were I would not vote the way I will vote when this section comes to be decided.  Are we to allow the land of Ireland to lie fallow in the interests of an outworn catch-cry? Are we to allow people who have not a sufficient living to remain so to pay lip service to a principle that, in fact, is not?  This is what we have to decide and perhaps we could for a moment reflect on the meaning of the three F's, fair rent, fixity of tenure and free sale.  Fair rent does not apply any more in Ireland where people own their land.  The battle for fair rent was a battle by a tenantry against a landlord.  It was not the battle of a fee simple owner.  Fixity of tenure is established by reason of the fact that the farmer is not a tenant any longer. He is not paying rent any longer but owns his land.  As well as owning it and having all the rights and privileges that the ownership of land involves, he acquires as well the obligations that ownership entails.</P>
    <P>Could I remind Deputy Dillon and Fine Gael that property has its duties as well as its rights?  Could I remind Deputy Dillon of places very near to where he lives where dozens of farmers do not have a sufficient amount of land on which to live?  It seems to me&mdash;I said this last week&mdash;that, when land becomes available and the machinery of the Land Commission is so cumbersome that that land eventually <Col N="586" /> goes to somebody who can buy it, the whole purpose of trying to create economic holdings in the congested areas, particularly in the west of Ireland, will be frustrated.  It is almost axiomatic that if you have not got an economic holding you will not be in a position to buy land when it is for sale on the market, but somebody will be in a position to buy, the man who already has more land than he needs. Are we in this House, in the interests of playing politics, to suggest that there should not be some change in the Land Commission procedure which undoubtedly has proved ineffective over the years?</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan from Tipperary mentioned, after I had spoken last week on another section, that it seemed strange that I who had complained about delays on the part of the Land Commission in dividing land, delays that sometimes involved up to 20 or 30 years, should ask for more power for the Land Commission.  I should like to make myself clear on this and, perhaps, remind myself if nobody else, of one of the first speeches I made in this House in 1951 when I suggested that the Land Commission had failed in their task and should be abolished. I do not think I am being inconsistent, and even if I am, I do not mind, because times change and we change with them and sometimes people become wise and sometimes they become foolish with the passing years.</P>
    <P>What I then felt was that, unless the Land Commission got more power, they were so ineffective that they were a waste of public money.  I feel the same today.  I sincerely feel that those in Mayo, Galway and elsewhere, who have been watching the Land Commission let out land year after year without being able to divide or rearrange it, because they had not enough, are entitled to feel frustrated. If under this procedure the Land Commission are able to hold on long enough ultimately to acquire, then I believe this procedure is justified. Unless the Land Commission stir themselves and become an effective unit operating within the policy of the Government, then they should cease.  I would even go further.  In handing <Col N="587" /> them whatever powers they consider they need, I would warn them that they have a duty as well and that they must perform it within a certain time.</P>
    <P>I totally reject what Deputy Dillon and various other Deputies in Fine Gael have said about this.  I do not think it right or proper that it should have been said at all.  When you invoke the history of this country, particularly the history of the land of Ireland, you are doing something&mdash;in this I agree with Deputy Dillon&mdash;that goes to the heart of the people.  I resent his mentioning land grabbers and putting us in the same category as the moonlighters of 70 or 80 years ago.  I resent the attempt being made by Fine Gael to describe this Government and this Party&mdash;people like me&mdash;as the successors of the people who shoved guns in kitchen windows in the dark of night.  I bitterly resent it.  I consider that Deputy Dillon and his Party have let down the people of the country by adopting this attitude.  I would go further and say I believe that the people of East Galway will not accept from Fine Gael the proposition that Fianna Fáil have become a Party of land grabbers.  I do not believe the people of East Galway will accept the proposition that we have forged the most pestilential instrument for blackmail in the history of the country.  I do not believe they will accept that we are reviving the ghosts of other times.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned&mdash;I was born in the middle of the country and I am sufficiently long living in the west of Ireland to be able to say what I have seen in those years&mdash;if this Land Bill does not enable the Government to carry out their agricultural policy, then it will be a failure.  The Land Bill is only a part of a wider policy which the Government are obliged to implement if we are to be able to play our part in the Europe of 1970 in open competition.  I said before, and I repeat now, I do not want this Government, this Party, or this Dáil, either in the name of famous Irish people or in the name of any catch cry of yesteryear, to abandon the duty they have to give to each person on the land a <Col N="588" /> reasonable opportunity of making a living.  That is what this section is aimed at.  It is not aimed at what Fine Gael describe as political blackmail. I can only hope it will achieve the result for which it was designed.  If it does, then the people who are now living on tiny holdings of land while their rich neighbours are becoming daily richer will have some hope for the future&mdash;a hope that would be denied to them if the Opposition had their way.</P>

      <P>Are we going to hear something from the Minister? Surely the Minister, having heard the speeches made by the Opposition and the few speeches made by his own Party, will not sit in silence without offering some comment on the merits of the views expressed?  He has been asked to give reasons for the introduction of this section other than the reason he did give, which we do not believe and which we know is not the real reason, that it is merely to expedite land division.  I challenge the Minister to give us the real reason that he and the Government had for introducing this section.  We want him to come out openly and not sit in silence.  No responsible Minister would sit silently by when asked for an explanation for resorting to unusable and unwarranted legislation.</P>
      <P>The last Deputy who spoke made reference to Deputy Dillon's speech on this section last Thursday.  If this section is passed and if the Minister can direct a senior inspector of the Land Commission to carry out an inspection at the whim of the Minister and of every Fianna Fáil club, it will bring about a state of affairs that will render the work of the Land Commission useless.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to go on that line.  If the Minister has this power, he will make it impossible <Col N="589" /> for the independent judicial Commissioners to act.  Eventually, we will find the Commissioners looking on their duties as a waste of time and they will resign.  Then we will have the spectacle of the Minister and the Government appointing their own nominees, so that they will have the whole set-up in their own bag.  That will be the outcome of this.  This is downright political blackmail, nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to endorse what has been said earlier.  We can describe Fianna Fáil, without any shadow of doubt, as land grabbers &mdash;and they are land grabbers if this section is passed.  Not alone are they land grabbers and <Col N="590" /> moonlighters but every single farm, big or small, in East Galway will be subject to Fianna Fáil inspection and intimidation.  I hope that that will be made clear by every Deputy who speaks in the approaching by-election. It is only right that the issues should plainly be put before the electorate that whether they own five acres or 50 acres in East Galway the Fianna Fáil land grabbers will have them listed and the cold dark hand of the moonlighter will hang over them in an effort to dispossess them of the little holdings their fathers and grandfathers so dearly won.  In its true form, this is a section which we can describe as Fianna Fáil blackmail.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister assure the House that this is an improvement in the present system of notification of an intended inspection? Perhaps, he would go into some detail to enlighten the House and also for the record for future purposes show the difference between the present system and the improved system which this section will give us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The section deals with the inspection notice under section 40 of the 1923 Act.  Under this section the inspection notice must be under the formal seal of the Land Commission which makes it a more formal document than heretofore.  It also ensures that inspection notices would not be issued lightly as has been suggested by Deputies.  When the formal seal is attached to them, it increases the formality and importance of the documents.  That is the reason for this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister very properly says the purpose is to attach some formality and significance to this procedure.  I think he is right.  There is a special value in connection with important procedures relative to property in attending its transfer or acquisition by certain formalities in order to record the care and circumspection with which authority regards private property.  I ask the Minister this question in no controversial sense.  Did he compare this provision with the rather odd provision in another Bill which one of his colleagues is presenting to the House, the Succession Bill, not in regard to the highly controversial parts of that Bill but in regard to the position where the old procedure of witnessing wills is being streamlined and simplified, as I understand it, on a principle diametrically opposed to the principle which the Minister would appear to be following here?  I think the Minister for Lands is correct in his view, and particularly in regard to rural Ireland, that this kind of operation should be surrounded with solemn forms because they are readily understood by the people and the very solemnity conveys that something of substance has been done.</P>
      <P>May I suggest that inasmuch as the Minister has adopted this principle in the Land Bill he might direct the attention of the Minister for Justice to the fact that when he is dealing with property this extra formality is brought in and that there is good reason for doing so.  If this be true, for reasons envisaged in connection with section 28 of this Bill, there is even stronger ground for avoiding the abolition of such formality in connection with the making of wills, which a solicitor of the Minister's experience will recognise, has a certain relationship to the transactions in land which we have in contemplation in connection with the Land Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the Succession Bill, in contradistinction to this Bill, is one in respect of which many Deputies on all sides have different views.  The Minister in charge of that Bill has already indicated that <Col N="593" /> he is not tied to any particular provisions of the Bill.  No doubt in the matter to which the Deputy refers, making the execution of wills more formal than formerly, his view may be shared by other Deputies.  In this case, however, I feel that, contrary to the former practice, it is better in a notice of this kind that the formal seal of the Land Commission should be affixed to the document.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 13, before section 30, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>Section 46 of the Land Act, 1923, is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (5) of the following subsections:</P>
      <P>(5A)  For the purposes of such registrations, the Registrar of Titles may order any person having possession of the land certificate (in this section hereafter referred to as the old certificate) in respect of the original holding to deliver the old certificate to the Registrar of Titles or, where he is satisfied that the old certificate has been lost or destroyed, may dispense with the production of the old certificate.</P>
      <P>(5B)  Any claim of lien or other claims on the old certificate shall, as from the date of the registrations, be transferred to the land certificate in respect of the new holding and the priority of such claim or claims shall not be affected.</P>
      <P>(5C)  The land certificate in respect of the new holding shall be issued by the Registrar of Titles to the person who had possession of the old certificate immediately prior to its delivery to the Registrar of Titles or its loss or destruction. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My only purpose here is to settle some uncertainties which have arisen about the procedures to be followed in the Land Registry in recording exchanges of holdings carried out by the Land Commission.  I put forward my proposals as an amendment to section 46 of the Land Act, 1923, <Col N="594" /> because it is the key section governing exchanges of registered land.</P>
    <P>First, we have the case in which, following an exchange of holdings, the allottee cannot produce the land certificate in respect of his old holding because it is lost or destroyed.  It is proposed that the Registrar of Titles should, in an appropriate case, be free to accept the fact that the certificate is lost and should issue the certificate for the new holding in the same way as if the old one had been physically surrendered.</P>
    <P>Next, we have the case in which a third party holds the certificate on foot of a claim and does not wish to release it without a settlement.  It is proposed that any such claim should transfer from the certificate for the old holding to the certificate for the new so that the rights of the third party shall survive the exchange.  The Registrar can compel the third party to hand in the certificate but under the new proposals he will be able, at the same time, to assure him that his position will not thereby be prejudiced.</P>
    <P>Lastly, it is provided that the Registrar shall give the new certificate to the person who last held the old one. This is to prevent the Registrar from being caught up in disputes between parties as to who should have the certificate.  He will simply deal with the one party on the basis of the <i>status quo ante</i> and will not enter into the merits or demerits of that party's possession of the document.</P>
    <P>This is a simplifying and enabling procedure that we find will be very necessary to enable the Registrar of Titles to more expeditiously deal with the type of case to which I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are obliged to the Minister for his exhaustive exposé of the amendment but he will realise it is very complicated.  Could it be simplified to a simple procedure which would provide for a person who has lost his certificate getting a new one, provided the Land Commission are satisfied that the application has been notified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct in a limited number of cases.  It also provides <Col N="595" /> for the case of a new holding. Somebody may have left the lien on the land certificate and it is necessary to produce it for the dealing so that the new land certificate would be subject to the same rights of lien as the old.  It is an enabling procedure that we feel from experience is necessary.  It will expedite the work before the Registrar and will be an aid to those people to whom I have referred here.  There may not be a large number of cases but they are cases that can give rise to trouble in the Land Registry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will understand we are a little embarrassed on this side of the House that this is an amendment so that we are not fortified by the explanation provided in the White Paper with the Bill as it originally stood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate the purpose here is to settle, in exchange holdings, some uncertainties which have arisen in procedure, such as might happen in the case of a man who has migrated from a small holding in Mayo to a holding in Kildare.  The procedure formerly was that the new one would be subject to the same equities as the old. He may not have his land certificate. This provision is for dealing with that certificate.  There may be people having claims against the old land certificate or having a lien on it in respect of the old one.  This provision is so that the same provision will attach to the new certificate, which would have to be issued in lieu of the old.  It also provides that the Registrar of Titles will not be drawn into the procedure between the contending parties for the custody of that certificate.  That would be a matter for the courts or somebody else to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little surprised. I should be interested to hear if it is the Minister's considered opinion that this is sound procedure.  Take the case of a small congest in Mayo who has deposited his land certificate as a security for a loan and a lien attaches to it or, possibly, there is a <Col N="596" /> lien attaching to an old holding in respect of support or some second party has a claim against it.  You transfer that congest to an economic holding in Kildare, Meath or elsewhere.  Is it a good plan that such a transferred person should start off on his holding in Kildare or Meath with the same burdens attaching to his new holding as he accumulated on the old place in Mayo?  Perhaps it is.</P>
      <P>The Minister will recognise that this amendment is largely by reference to previous Acts.  What are you to do with the lien on the old holding? What is to become of those who have claims against the old holding?  When the congest moves to his new holding, you are going to give him a new start, a new house and a loan for stock. He is set up in a new surrounding and with a new status.  In fact, he has ceased to be a congest.  He has now become an economic holder with a new life opening out before him. Is it good to start him off with a kind of chain attached to his leg of liabilities and contingent debts which have largely arisen as a result of the congested state with which he and his family have been struggling for centuries?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister grasp my apprehension in this matter?  Does the Minister think it is a good thing to carry on some of the congest's earlier liens and attach them to the new life which we propose for him in economic holdings, into which after all we are going to pour a great deal of money in order to get the migrated family off to a good start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Deputy Dillon suggest that it might be a good idea that whatever liabilities were on the congested holding the man should not have to bring them with him, that if he is not a thrifty man and has gone into a considerable amount of debt, then the State should clear that debt for him?  There would not appear to be any alternative to it.  It has to be cleared.  The only way debts can be cleared is if somebody redeems them. The suggestion Deputy Dillon has made, if we follow it to its logical conclusion, is that if somebody outside <Col N="597" /> the district gets an addition to his holding, he should not get the same treatment.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  I should like the Minister to clarify this position for me.  I am puzzled as to which is the better way.  Personally, I think it is reasonable that the debt must be carried to the new farm.  Otherwise, a situation would arise which would be embarrassing for someone before the whole thing was cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I know this is a complicated matter for people who have never been engaged in this business.  I remember a good many years ago a man with a small holding from Mayo was transferred to either Meath or Kildare and he was migrated, subject to the equities arising out of the grant provisions of his own holding in Mayo. When he went to his bank ten years afterwards and tried to discharge equities against a batch of land in Mayo which had been divided ten years previously, he found it virtually impossible to get evidence to discharge equities.  The reason for this is there is no other way for dealing with the situation.  A man down in, say, Mayo, Donegal or Sligo who is migrated in many instances has certain burdens on the small holding he has there.  The transfer of these burdens was a traditional system going back to the 1903 Act.  In this situation if he has not his land certificate, he may be in trouble straight away in connection with the new holding.  Deputies will be aware that holdings are under the Registration of Title Acts now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are rights of support for maintenance or other such burdens, there is only one practicable way of dealing with them, that is, the new holding must be subject to the same rights as the old.  In order to deal with some of these matters, including the position when the land certificate is lodged as the subject of a lien, as Deputy Dillon said, in respect of the old holding, that burden must go to the new holding and that is what this subsection is providing for.  It is enabling the Registrar to deal expeditiously with a situation which could hold up the man in his new <Col N="598" /> holding as a result of any of these mishaps I have recited in respect of the loss of the land certificate, and so on.</P>
    <P>There is no method I can conceive whereby you could more effectively deal with the situation.  In the first place, some of these burdens that may attach to the old holding might not be capable of being discharged by the man in question at the particular time. He may need some time in the new holding to make the necessary money or take the necessary steps to meet these burdens or obligations and discharge them.  Deputies will appreciate that, generally speaking, in every case, before the Land Commission can migrate a man, they must see that his title is in order.  It may be there are rights or burdens, such as, for instance, the right of the man's mother to reside in the dwellinghouse and be supported there while she lives in the small holding from which he is being migrated.  Unless that right were transferred to the new holding, the Land Commission would have to maintain the old lady in the small holding for the rest of her life.</P>
    <P>This is the only practical way that I can see of dealing with this matter. In fact, this is the way it has been traditionally dealt with, except that the provisions in the amendment are enabling provisions, to allow the Registrar of Titles to deal with some practical difficulties that have arisen from time to time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the Minister unduly.  I think he will agree with me most of us are interested in those affairs and have always regarded it as a tragic mistake that in the original Registration of Title Act provision was ever made for registration subject to equities.  It has operated to create titles more complex than were ever known under the old law.  I am interested in the reactions of Deputy Tully and myself.  I come from the relatively impoverished lands of Mayo, while Deputy Tully comes from the rich lands of Meath.  My instinct at once is to buck away from anything that maintains or makes permanent this whole system of registration of <Col N="599" /> title subject to equities, owing to the forest of confusion that ensues from it.  I fully understand the Minister's practical difficulty which he admirably illustrates with the case of the mother, or grandmother, let us say, who is entitled to residence.  What are you to do?</P>
      <P>Under this Land Bill which we are now considering, one of the best provisions in it is that the Land Commission have power to say to an elderly proprietor: &ldquo;If you would like to surrender your small holding to the Land Commission, we will give you a life pension.  You can go and live on your own and surrender your holding to the Land Commission for distribution for the relief of congestion.&rdquo;  I think that is an admirable principle.  It is one capable of doing great good in the congested areas.  Taking that one area the Minister has mentioned, perhaps he would consider whether equities of that kind might not be at least dischargeable on lines analogous to the new section he proposes.</P>
      <P>In regard to other unascertainable equities, the case arises where you have a man with ten children scattered over Australia, the United States and perhaps Great Britain, and some of them who have not been heard from for years.  One son 45 or 50 years of age is married and with children in the place when his father and mother die and he carries on and he gets his title registered, subject to equity.  I think I am correct in saying that&mdash;I am not a practising lawyer.  This son takes from his father only what his father had to leave and he finds that any title he has is one subject to equities, and these equities may relate to uncles and aunts.  I think there is some procedure ultimately for going to the courts to get all these equities swept away,</P>

      <P>Any of us who have <Col N="600" /> experience here knows it is astonishing the number of cases where it is not cleared up, where the title gets more complex and involved.  I should be glad if the Minister would have another look at this business to see if we could not devise some measure whereby, on the transfer of congested tenants to any holdings of reasonable dimensions, this whole question of equities could be cleared up.</P>
      <P>In respect of the equity I mentioned, a device in some other section might be employed.  In regard to other equities, we have in the Land Commission an insurance fund which is no longer attracting funds because there is a sufficient sum of money in it to deal with the landlords' titles where we took land over from landlords and maybe mis-distributed bonds. There is a fund to indemnify the Land Commission if somebody can demonstrate they have a claim overlooked in the distribution of the land bonds originally allotted.  I do not know whether it is possible to establish an insurance fund of an analogous nature or whether we could graft on to the existing fund a modest annual contribution so that any outstanding equities on a congest's holding would be extinguished, except in so far as they are clearly ascertainable and susceptible to liquidation.</P>
      <P>I would agree that if you have clear and certain equities which are capable of liquidation, it would be much preferable to have them liquidated by the Land Commission and a suitable addition made to the land annuities of the incoming tenants, provided the incoming tenants would have a certificate that would discharge all equities for which they were responsible and that any outstanding or unascertainable equities were extinguished, subject to the right of the beneficiary of such equities having a right of hearing against the Land Commission insurance fund if he were in a position to prove it hereafter, as a landlord's heir has such a right at the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to press the Minister unduly but I suggest to him that inasmuch as he shares with me the general regret at the qualification of the Land Registry procedure which permits of the registration of land <Col N="601" /> subject to unascertainable equities, this might be a good way to start and there would be a great psychological advantage in being able to say to a congest that he has lived his life under the shadow of these equities and that he is now moving into a new holding, into a new outlook, to a new start in which he can forget the equities on a farm of a reasonable size capable of meeting the annual charge of annuities and providing him with a reasonable standard of living.</P>
    <P>I do not ask the Minister to say immediately that he accepts that view or that he should give immediate legislative effect to it but I do suggest most sincerely that it is worthy of consideration by him between now and Report Stage, during which interval he might be able to give it fuller and better consideration to see if this Bill could not be availed of to effect what would be, to my mind, a desirable improvement, if it is practicable.</P>

      <P>I have a brief comment to make on what Deputy Dillon has said.  I agree entirely with the last part of his remarks, which seem to constitute an ideal solution.  However, I do not agree with the first part of the solution he suggests or, in fact, that it would be possible, because if some old person has the right of maintenance on a farm and if the son or daughter has to leave the district, I do not think the answer is to give the old person compensation.</P>

      <P>I made the comment before, and I repeat it, that I have never known of an old person with land who has no friends or blood relatives when the farm comes up for assignment.  No matter what compensation, by way of annuity or otherwise, is offered, I do not think it is the solution, whether or not the old person concerned asked for it.  I am afraid the Land Commission would find themselves paying annuities to old people who would be back again in the bosom of their families.  It might be possible to add to the annuity the ascertainable equities, and that might be the ideal situation.</P>

      <P>I should like to clarify one point for the benefit of Deputy Tully.  At any rate, he has a different meaning for the word &ldquo;friends&rdquo; from that either the Minister or I would attach to it.  In our part of the country the word &ldquo;friends&rdquo; means second cousins and further out.  It does not mean friendship but relationship. Surely Deputy Tully is not serious in believing that the idea is to promote permanence for elderly parents on the holding of a young family?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the great difficulties in getting young people to marry in rural Ireland is the reluctance of the young wife to go into a house where there would be two mistresses. It is a source of continual difficulty and trouble.  That is why I so cordially approve of the Minister's proposal which gives the parents the right to surrender the holding and retire into the neighbouring market town with a sufficient pension to live in comfort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully says they would move back again into the bosom of their family.  I do not agree.  It can cause great hardship if you are moving a vigorous man of 30 or 35 years of age up to Meath or Kildare to say to an old person of 76 or 77 years that he must tear up his roots from a place like Carna or Oughterard or Louisburgh and move up to Meath or Kildare <Col N="603" /> where he does not know a creature, and where the likelihood of his making new friends is remote in the extreme but, if you say to these old people: &ldquo;You are perfectly free to go; you have a statutory right and you take it with you if that is what you elect to do, but, if you would sooner stay at home in Louisburgh, Oughterard or Carna, the Land Commission will discharge this equity by giving you a life pension on terms similar to that provided in the event of your having given up your holding, being yourself childless.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If Deputy Tully will reflect for a moment I think he will come to agree with me that where it is very often a good and stimulating thing to say to a young farmer with a young and vigorous wife and with a young family that it would be a complete revolution in their whole approach to life and would be a good life for them, it may be a different thing to say it to their father or mother and it would be a good thing not to compel them to surrender their equity but to say: &ldquo;If you stand on your equity, you have a right to go and the new family must respect the undertaking they gave you but if you would like to stay where you were born and reared and where you reared your own family there is machinery under this Bill whereunder the Land Commission will enable you to stay in your own home and let the young people go off to a new life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would agree and I think the Minister would agree with Deputy Tully that one must move in these matters circumspectly.  I do not want any mandatory provision here that the Minister for Lands or anybody else would have a right to go in to old people and say: &ldquo;Your equity is extinguished and your whole family arrangement is broken up because we think it is good to do it&rdquo; but I would be glad to see the Minister with machinery available to him where the old people approached him and said: &ldquo;We are glad to see the young ones going off to a holding.  We are glad to see our status as congests put an end to, but we do not want to go from <Col N="604" /> Louisburgh to Navan and if you could let us out we would sooner stay here and leave us a pension that will carry us on to the end of our days and bury us decently.  Let the young people go and maybe they will come back and visit us and maybe we will get up to visit them but, in the meantime, we will be at home and our neighbours will be calling on us and we will be calling on them.  We would not know a creature in Navan&rdquo;.  I do not press this but I submit it to the Minister as being worthy of consideration.</P>

      <P>I do not want unduly to hold up the Bill, on this section of it at any rate, but I still cannot see where the necessary amount of money would be available, to be reasonable about it.  It is a small holding in a congested area, and the person is being moved because of the fact that it is a small farm.  He is being moved in order to get a viable farm.  I cannot see where the amount of money would become available in such circumstance which would enable them to continue to live.  That is the point I should like to have clarified because I believe it just could not happen as things stand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two questions that I should like to ask the Minister.  This may be the appropriate occasion to ask the Minister whether the Land Commission in considering this amendment have received any statistics from the Land Registry, from the Registrar of Titles, as to the extent of defective or complicated or involved titles to holdings.  Does the Minister feel that there is a very large number of landowners who have in their possession defective titles?  Perhaps it may have been possible for the Minister to obtain from the Land Registry in respect of each county, giving each <Col N="605" /> folio, the details as to whether the title was a good title or whether it was a defective title and, if he has received such statistics, perhaps he would tell the House to what extent this is a problem.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I should like to know whether, under this amendment moved by the Minister, whereby the Registrar of Titles, where he is satisfied that the old certificate has been lost or destroyed, may dispense with the production of the old certificate and a new certificate may be issued, the application for the new certificate must be accompanied by a Land Registry stamp and, if so, what would be the cost of such stamp or whether the new certificate would be issued to the applicant free of charge.</P>
      <P>I presume that these matters may be governed by regulations to be made by the Land Registry but if there is to be any charge on the tenant seeking the new certificate the Minister might avail of this opportunity to enlighten the House as to what the cost of the Land Registry stamp would be in such case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There would appear to be some misapprehension about this matter.  Deputies may not appreciate technically that on a rearrangement scheme the man is surrendering his old holding for, theoretically, a completely new one although the new one may consist of 97 per cent of his old one plus a bit of swopping here and there. It is still a new and different holding. If he is still without his land certificate he is in trouble because the Registrar cannot deal with the matter once a certificate has been issued without its being produced and all kinds of evidence gone into as to what became of it.  That applies to these thousands of cases of rearrangement as well as the migrants' holdings to which I have referred and the same matters and principle apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall look into the point made by Deputy Dillon to see if there is a different way of dealing with this matter.  Let me say in passing that I could not agree more as to how useful a proposition it would be to do away with this question of the discharge of <Col N="606" /> equities altogether if it could be done and I think that at least some progress has been made in that connection under the Registration of Title Act, 1964, with which I am not as familiar as, perhaps, I should be but I do know that instead of the cumbersome procedure which we had whereby the man in occupation had to go to the circuit court judge under what we call a section 52 application, under the old Registration of Title Act, the matter can now be dealt with in chambers by the Registrar on production of evidence of 12 years' occupancy in certain instances, which goes at least some distance towards removing the difficulty in the chasing of relatives gone for umpteen years to the far ends of the earth and possibly serving notice on them, as was the law before the passing of that Act.</P>
    <P>I fear that the many matters&mdash;I have touched on only a few here&mdash;which would be covered by what I call technically the discharge of equities would really need to be dealt with in a separate Registration of Title Bill.  This particular amendment is providing enabling powers for the Registrar of Titles to expedite matters in certain circumstances that arise.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Flanagan, who made the point, that these difficulties have arisen in practice in very many cases.  One could say that perhaps there is not such a great number of migrants but there are literally thousands of cases of rearrangement schemes, of rearranging tenants to which the same law and principle apply and it is very necessary that this simplified enabling procedure for the Registrar of Titles should be provided to deal with these cases.  I do not know what the position would be or what conditions the Registrar of Titles may lay down or what the provisions are that he has laid down to deal with this question of lost land certificates.  The requisition of a new land certificate after issue for the first time, as well as I recollect, bears a stamp of £1.  I do not know what will be the position of a person applying for a certificate in substitution for a lost one but the person who lost the <Col N="607" /> certificate is the person at fault and if he is penalised for his carelessness, it does not appear to me to be unreasonable.  I do not say that he is and I do not know what land registry fees would be prescribed for some application that would arise under this section.</P>
    <P>I shall look into the points raised to see if there is any easier way to deal with this problem than that proposed in this amendment.  I should like the House to appreciate, however, that this is an endeavour to deal in as simple a way as we can devise with the hundreds of cases that arise from day to day and it is merely an enabling procedure to speed up the removal of the difficulties of title clearance with tenants, because the Land Commission cannot deal with them, as I have said, until their titles are reasonably in order.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this is to deal with the small purchase money limits and to facilitate and expedite the distribution of funds.  It is proposed <Col N="608" /> to raise the monetary limits below which modified title requirements may operate.</P>
      <P>Under the existing law, that is, section 35 of the Land Act, 1931, as extended by section 52 of the Land Act, 1933, title requirements are relaxed in three categories: in cases not exceeding £30, in cases not exceeding £100, and in cases not exceeding £300. Dealing with the devaluation of money in these small cases, the purpose of this section is to substitute £100 for the £30, to substitute £300 for the £100 and to substitute £2,000 for the £300. In the £30 instance which is now being increased to £100, the examiner can give that money to the occupier, whoever he finds in the place, that is, where the title is non-existent, if you like.  In such a small case, he has the discretion to do that.</P>
      <P>In the case where £300 is substituted for £100, the examiner can pay it to the occupier as a trustee.  Although there may be different owner interests, whoever he finds on the land when it is taken over he can pay that money to him but the occupier will be getting it as trustee for whoever may be found to be the legal owner.  It is a quick way of dispensing with the matter.</P>
      <P>In the case where £2,000 is substituted for £300, he can dispense with what is laid down as the root of title, that is, going back 30 years or so.  He can accept a title for, say, 12 years or possibly less if he is satisfied.  These are the distinctions, and the only difference between this and section 36, which follows on the same lines, is that section 36 provides for dealing with shares in small purchase money cases. The same thing will apply.  It will increase the jurisdiction of the examiner dealing with these small cases where a question of different shares in a commonage, for instance, is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The first and second cases are clear enough.  In the first case the examiner can pay out £100, and in the second case he may pay out up to £300 and an equitable owner would be entitled to proceed against the tenant up to the limit of £300 because he received it as trustee.  In regard to the <Col N="609" /> £2,000, are we to understand that in that case the recipient has a clear title to the £2,000 or is he subject to the obligations of a trustee?  Is it clear title?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In the third case, he has a title but he may have difficulty in proving the statutory title laid down by the Land Commission in the general run of cases.  He may not be able to go back 30 years.  He may not be able to adduce title back to that root of title.  However, he is in occupation of the land and he is, presumably, the owner.  It is the kind of case that would be accepted in normal practice by a solicitor who knew the history of the family, and so on; every &ldquo;t&rdquo; was not crossed and every &ldquo;i&rdquo; was not dotted; perhaps there were no recitals in any available documents that were more than 20 years old and he would, perhaps, have to accept a statutory declaration of 12 years' beneficial occupation.  In this case the examiner would have the discretion to depart from the general rule and accept a lesser proof of title than he would in the larger case.  That is the purpose of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If there should turn up a person who had some claim in category (c), has he any right against the insurance funds in the Land Commission or is his right exclusively against the recipient of the £2,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is that I have not adverted to it.  If a person in the third category appears to have a title, in normal circumstances, it would be generally accepted.  The man in category (c), having proved his title and having been accepted by the examiner, must <i>ipso facto</i> get his purchase money.  There is a provision in the Land Acts whereby compensation by way of money voted by the Dáil can be paid in such a case, but the short answer is that, once his title is accepted &mdash;this is the general law, I might say, dealing with the Land Commission&mdash; that is that.</P>

In smaller cases, examiners, as is only natural, since they are legal officers of public Departments, are much more wary in dealing with title than the ordinary practitioner outside would be.  In order to get the machine moving faster in the smaller cases, we felt this enlarging power should be taken so that the smaller type of case could be dealt with more expeditiously.  A sum of £2,000, considering the way the price of land is soaring, is not a big sum.  It is a comparatively <Col N="611" /> small case now in which there is not more than £2,000 involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most important section.  I do not know whether the Minister intends to elaborate on it, but I want to sound a very serious note of warning here.  This section deals with the power of the Land Commission to create rights of way.  At first glance, people might well regard that as a necessary and sensible provision, but this is an amendment of section 39 of the Land Act, 1931, and it is described in the explanatory memorandum as a section&mdash;</P>
      <P>designed to remedy legal flaws in the principal provision (section 39, Land Act, 1931), relating to the creation of rights of way by the Land Commission.  This is being effected by redrafting in clear terms subsection (2) of section 39, Land Act, 1931.  In this way, it is intended to overcome the effects of adverse legal decisions in relation to the existing powers of the Land Commission in the creation of rights of way.  In particular, the new subsection confirms that a right of way order by the Land Commission will be valid whether any terminal point of the right of way is or is not situate on lands sold or agreed to be sold under the Land Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opportunity is being taken, having regard to monetary changes, <Col N="612" /> to increase the compensation limit of £50 contained in section 39 (4), Land Act, 1931, to £200. </P>
    <P>It is worthy of comment that in this informative explanatory memorandum circulated by the Minister, the Minister elects to describe as adverse the decisions of the court.  I have no doubt that the people in whose favour the decisions were reached would not so describe them.  They were adverse to the Land Commission.  In case the Minister, and I speak of him now in his corporate capacity, should ever allow himself to be persuaded that any decision of the courts which does not correspond with his interpretation of the law is an adverse decision, it is very necessary to keep present to his mind that the decision is a judicial decision on what the law passed by this House is.  That does not necessarily always mean that the law is what the Minister believes it or wishes it to be.  The function of the court is to discern what the law is and a decision, I suggest to the Minister, of the courts is not appropriately described by a Department of State or a member of the Executive as adverse.  It may be adverse in his contention but it is not adverse to the person in whose favour it was given.  On the contrary, it is a decision of the court as to what the law was up to today when the proposal changes.</P>
    <P>Now, the extent of the amendment which the Minister proposes is not readily discernible.  The subsection reads:</P>
    <P>The powers of the Land Commission ..include power to confer on the Land Commission and their licensees and to define and extend or improve ways and rights of way over any land whatsoever for the purpose of facilitating passage to and from any land sold or agreed to be sold under the Land Purchase Acts, whether such rights of way are or are not so conferred as to be appurtenant to any land, and whether any terminal point of such ways and rights of way is or is not situate on lands sold or agreed to be sold under the Land Purchase Acts. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> What does that mean?  It means that in regard to what is freehold land which has never been the subject of land procedure before by the Land Commission, which the Land Commission have never acquired or sought to acquire, the Land Commission can come along today and say: &ldquo;We have acquired land adjacent to your holding on two separate sides and for the better husbandry of this holding we now propose to drive a right-of-way through your land for the accommodation of the owner of the two pieces which we have acquired adjoining your land.&rdquo;  In a very large number of cases I am sure an equitable arrangement can be arrived at which will not seriously interfere with the enjoyment by the owner of the land across the right-of-way, but there could arise cases in which the creation of such a right-of-way would constitute not only a very grave hardship but a diminution of value of the holding out of all proportion to the convenience for which the right-of-way is created.  I instance particularly a stud farm.  If you drive a right-of-way across the corners of a field it is perfectly understandable that in many cases you erect no fences at all, or it may be desirable in certain circumstances, if it is an exclusive right-of-way, to fence the right-of-way, but if you want to fence a right-of-way on a stud farm it must be fenced with timber all the way, or else you destroy the whole area of the stud farm because you cannot let horses, foals and mares into fields surrounded by barbed wire.  Whether the Land Commission are going to take the view that because the particular holding over which they want to drive a right-of-way is a stud farm they have an obligation to fence it as a stud farmer would fence is something which I beg leave to doubt.</P>
    <P>I should like to have from the Minister some reassurance that he is satisfied that the compensation maximum of £200 in respect of a right-of-way is in itself sufficient to ensure that no substantial injustice is done to a man whose property has to be trespassed in order to provide a right-of-way.  I can envisage a situation arising, particularly in relation to a stud farm, where <Col N="614" /> if you are going to create a right-of-way you will have to cut off a whole corner or a piece and simply fence on one side of it, or tell the person to fence it, but he should be entitled to say: &ldquo;If I have to fence this and surrender for stud purposes that part of the land which is on the other side of the right-of-way, you will have to give me compensation which (1) will enable me to erect wooden stud farm fences and (2) enable me to sell the bit of land on the other side of the right-of-way to a non-willing purchaser from an all too willing vendor, and the limit of £200 is manifestly inadequate for that purpose.&rdquo;  It is necessary to say this: let us in our zeal to rearrange the land bear in mind that the real test of the genuine democracy is its solicitude for the rights of minorities.  God knows most of us in this House lived long enough under the tyranny of landlords without, when we shook ourselves free from them, seeking to exercise over landlords or their kind, the sort of tyranny they used rejoice in exercising over us.</P>
    <P>I want to be able to say to the stud farm owner, or the large land owner: &ldquo;Under the law you are treated on the basis of equality with the smallest farmer in Ireland.  Everyone in this country is equal before the law. If you suffer a loss as a result of what the community requires to be done your rights will be respected as would the rights of anybody else.&rdquo;  The temptation is to say: &ldquo;That fellow has plenty, why should we bother our heads about him?&rdquo; The exquisite quality of the system to which we are privileged to belong is that all of us are equal before the law.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that in our desire to change this provision we are, perhaps, forgetting the rights of a small minority.  I can see, in the lowering eyes of some of my colleagues sitting opposite, the kind of implied suggestion: &ldquo;Why the hell should we not?&rdquo; The answer is because we should be too proud to do to them what those before them did to us; we have the power to do injustice, it is beneath us to sink to doing it.  I think the Minister will sympathise with that view and I suggest particularly in <Col N="615" /> regard to stud farms that he should reconsider the question whether this much wider power creating rights of way has attached to it compensatory provisions calculated to do substantial injustice to an admittedly small minority who are nonetheless citizens of this State, equal with the rest of us before the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister in the use of the word &ldquo;adverse&rdquo; because it is not unknown that Bills have been enacted in this House and subsequently the court has put interpretations on them which were not intended when they were discussed here.  For that reason I feel there is a certain need to describe some of those Acts in a way in which the courts would not like us to describe them.  While Deputy Dillon's point about stud farms is a good one, we must all realise that throughout the country farms were divided which, to use a rural phrase, were just a hen's race from a main road but had no access to that main road.  Access could be obtained only by giving a large portion of land to somebody not otherwise entitled to it in order to get a right-of-way.  If this Bill does something to remedy that position, it will be doing a good job.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Dillon, I am rather perturbed about how far this section can go.  The stud farm may be an example, but what about the small farmer whose holding may be carved up by such rights-of-way?  Is the maximum compensation of £200 sufficient in that case?  Surely it should depend on the actual length of the right-of-way acquired?  I suggest that a small farmer who would lose perhaps a small piece of land for a right-of-way might suffer a far greater loss in proportion than the big farmer who has a large amount taken away.  I am sure the Minister will try to tie up those matters before the Bill is finally passed, which will be some time yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should deal with the question of the type of right-of-way. Those of us who represent rural constituencies have met the irate farmer who is always complaining he cannot his machinery through a gateway <Col N="616" /> because somebody else owns the gateway and will not allow him to go through it.  Modern machinery is much larger than that used some years ago.  We now have all sorts of quarrels arising between neighbours over rights-of-way.  I think on one occasion the Minister pointed out that rights-of-way were probably the cause of more litigation in this country than any other subject.  If anything can be done in this Bill to ease that situation, every attempt should be made to do it.</P>
    <P>On another section last week, there was a reference to rights-of-way being laid down by the Land Commission as badly done.  No provision is made to ensure that they can be subsequently taken over and developed into public roads.  The ultimate end of all these roads is that they should be taken in charge by the local authority.  Meath County Council have taken over practically all of them.  However, needless expense has been put both on the ratepayers and taxpayers because the roads were badly designed and made by the Land Commission, in the first instance. Even if the proper type of material was put into them, they were either too narrow or there were sharp angles in them for no apparent reason&mdash;except, perhaps, that somebody decided there was a gap in the hedge and, rather than make the road straight, they swung around and went in through the gap.</P>
    <P>When the Land Commission were laying out houses on an estate, they put them in such a way that it was expensive for themselves and, subsequently, for the local authority to make roads into those houses.  Could we ask the Minister to persuade the Land Commission to have the matter fully discussed with the local authority before going ahead?  If that is done, a lot of money will be saved.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have some arrangement with the Land Commission whereby we can have an easement of the present position with regard to awkward rights-of-way. Maybe it is a big job and he will tell us the Land Commission have far too much other work on hands, but it is of such importance for rural Ireland that somebody should do something <Col N="617" /> about it.  If this opportunity is passed by, I cannot see another Land Bill coming before us for a long time, in view of the time it has taken to deal with this one.  Possibly, none of us will see even this one pass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important section on which we ought to elicit all the information we can from the Minister.  Perhaps he might give us some idea of the kind of adverse legal decision to which he has referred?  Rights-of-way have been the cause of much friction and unpleasantness between neighbours and even members of families for many years. If the Land Commission are to be given the right to make whatever rights-of-way they wish, then we should have some guarantees from the Minister.  I can assure him that, when holdings are being valued or put on the market, one of the first questions a purchaser addresses to the vendor relates to the rights-of-way on the holding.  The more rights-of-way there are on the holding, the greater is the fall in the value of the property.  The Land Commission will have to be cautious and realise that in creating rights-of-way, they are immediately reducing considerably the value of the property.  If property is being reduced in value, ample and generous compensation should be paid.</P>
      <P>Owners of property do not view rights-of-way with any great delight. If this section is passed, new rights-of-way will be created so as to give entry and exit in accordance with the new arrangement of holdings.  What provision will there be for an appeal to the Land Commission in regard to those rights-of-way?  Will the special circumstances of a stud farm, to which Deputy Dillon referred, be taken into consideration?  If the Land Commission create a right-of-way through a stud farm or a dairy farm on which there is a valuable herd, the owner of such holding will have to be amply and generously compensated, because the right-of-way will reduce the property in value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that for the Land Commission to create a right-of-way through such a holding, the owner of the holding <Col N="618" /> would have to be amply and generously compensated.  The right-of-way through his property would consequently reduce it considerably in value.  The Land Commission should take steps to see that such a right-of-way would be fenced off completely.  In addition, the right-of-way ought to be constructed in the most convenient location of the property, after consultation with the owner.</P>
    <P>My experience of the officials of the Land Commission is that they are men with a very high degree of commonsense and a very great degree of intelligence.  I feel they are anxious, in so far as it is possible, to co-operate with the land owners, particularly in regard to fencing and rights-of-way. The law should so be enacted as to ensure that the least possible inconvenience will be created to the landowner in regard to the making of a right-of-way.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has conferred with the head of this section in the Land Commission in the course of the preparation of this Bill.  He might tell us how much compensation, in the last ten years, say, has been paid out to persons over whose lands the Land Commission have created rights-of-way &mdash;whether it is a very substantial sum or what the position is.  I am sure he has this information.  Perhaps he may be able to avail of this opportunity to indicate to the House the steps the Land Commission have taken in the past to create rights-of-way.  I know of a number of rights-of-way created by the Land Commission.  I have been wondering what compensation has been paid&mdash;not individually.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us, say in bulk, the amount of money the Land Commission had to pay in regard to those rights-of-way.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the great value of the activities of a stud farm, the Land Commission would be well advised if at all possible to avoid the making of a right-of-way there.  In the event of its being absolutely essential that a right of way should be created through a stud farm, the Land Commission should undertake the responsibility of having it properly fenced with the very <Col N="619" /> suitable type of fence which will be required for the purpose of the stud farm.  The same steps should be taken in the event of a right-of-way being created through a dairy farm.  The owners of dairy farms who have very valuable herds would certainly be anxious that the law is so framed as to guarantee them the highest possible rate of compensation for any inconvenience that may be caused to them by the making of such a right-of-way. It is very necessary that the Land Commission will use their wise and sound judgment to avoid making rights-of-way in cases of stud and dairy farms.</P>
    <P>The whole question of rights-of-way should not be taken too lightly.  I would make a special appeal to the Minister, when this section is passed, to give us an assurance that this power will be used only where it is absolutely necessary and that in so far as it is possible the Land Commission will have the consent and the approval of the owner of the land over which the new right-of-way will be made.  In the event of the owner submitting proposals to the Land Commission for the creation of the right-of-way along the most convenient part of his farm for him, I trust that the Land Commission will give the case he presents every possible consideration.</P>
    <P>I do not like to see the Land Commission getting wide and what may be described as unreasonable powers.  It may be the case that the Land Commission may be slow to avail of this section when it is passed.  I would ask the Minister to give this House an assurance that the power he now seeks in this section will be used only where it is absolutely and completely essential for the rearrangement of lands in any particular area.  I really feel that that assurance should be given, for the records of the House, by the Minister on this section.</P>
    <P>Landowners very much dislike and disagree with the making of new rights-of-way.  If the Land Commission avail of this section to make rights-of-way <i>ad lib</i> through any farm, if they so desire, I think it would be undesirable <Col N="620" /> and uncalled for.  I should like an assurance from the Minister so as to reinforce our landowners in the knowledge that the Land Commission will not use these powers except in cases of absolute necessity.  The owner of land would expect an assurance in that regard from the Minister in relation to this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The general difficulty, in my experience &mdash; long before I became occupier of my present office&mdash; with the Land Commission was to get them to exercise some powers contained in the sections which are being referred to in this section.  I should like Deputies to get their minds clear as to what we do here.  Section 43 of the Land Act of 1923 and section 39 of the Land Act of 1931 contain powers for conferring and defining rights-of-way for the use of lands sold or agreed to be sold under the Land Purchase Acts.  Doubt was expressed on the adequacy of those provisions in what is known as the Healy case in County Kildare which purported the creation of a right-of-way into the Healy Estate and which was partly over property owned by the Grand Canal Company. These proceedings were contested by the Grand Canal Company at that time.  The proceedings were by way of a case brought by the Lay Commissioners for decision of the Judicial Commissioner on a point of law.</P>
      <P>The effect of that decision was that the term &ldquo;any land&rdquo; in section 39 (2) of the Land Act of 1931 does not include lands excluded from vesting in the Land Commission by virtue of section 24 (2) (f) of the Land Act of 1923, that is, in the main, lands held by central or local authorities or by public service undertakings.  That was appealed in turn to the Supreme Court in the Healy case and it was held by the Supreme Court, in dismissing the appeal, that the Order contemplated in the Notice of Intention to confer and define a right-of-way was not authorised by the powers conferred by section 39 (2) which the Land Commission thought they had the right to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision of the Supreme Court in dismissing the appeal was based on <Col N="621" /> a different issue, as often happens there, and apart from the power to confer and define a right-of-way over public undertakings' property, a matter capable of arising in the ordinary course of land settlement operations. The Supreme Court decision implied that for a right-of-way order under section 39 to be valid, it must embrace the entire length of passage between the farthest terminal point and the terminal point on the dominant land.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment seeks to improve the position of the Land Commission by covering &ldquo;any land whatsoever&rdquo; in line 32 and asserting that it is immaterial whether the terminal points are, or are not, situated on Land Purchase Acts land.  I shall deal with the other subsection relating to the compensation in a moment but I should like Deputies to get this picture clear.</P>
    <P>The right of the Land Commission, under the present law as interpreted in the Healy case in the Supreme Court to which I have referred, would prevent them, for instance, from crossing land that was held under title not subject to Land Purchase Acts.  For instance, if you had a case, as you sometimes do, where a portion of land adjoined Land Purchase Act land, either under Fee Farm Grant or pure realty, the Land Commission could not get a right-of-way over that particular land.  And if the passageway ended on such land, they could not enforce such a right-of-way nor could they enlarge it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Have we not abolished realty under the Registration of Titles Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Not pure realty.  In certain instances, no.  There are many cases not registered under the Registration of Titles Act.  We abolished realty for the purposes of descent.  That is land that comes under the Registration of Titles Act but you have some lands such as I have described that have not yet come under these Acts and in such a case, or in any case in which the land was not purchased under the Land Purchase Acts&mdash;however that may <Col N="622" /> have arisen&mdash;they could not use this right-of-way power.  Outside Fee Farm Grants there are other odd cases of pure realty, cases of holdings with expired leases that were not renewed under the Conversions Act and odd bits and pieces.  I have even come across some places in rural Ireland where nobody knows how they originated and it would be impossible to prove they were at any time subject to Land Purchase Acts.  In such an instance, as the law now stands, the Land Commission would be stultified and in such a case this amendment is necessary and I think reasonable to enable the Land Commission, where a right-of-way is necessary, or the enlargement of a right-of-way is required, as now happens in modern conditions and with modern vehicles, to provide such a right-of-way.  Rights-of-way suitable for our grandfathers would not serve the modern purposes of the modern agricultural user.  In these cases, irrespective of the different titles to the land over which a right-of-way runs, the Land Commission should be entitled to enlarge or extend it provided, of course, compensation is paid.  That is a different issue with which I shall deal in a moment.</P>
      <P>Up to the decision in the Healy case, it was understood by the Land Commission and, I am sure, by those responsible for the drafting of the 1923 Act and section 39 of the 1931 Act, that the Land Commission would have power in dealing with rights-of-way, to run them where they should run, irrespective of whether the land was purchased under the Land Purchase Acts or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>However, that is the way the law was interpreted.  I think Deputies will appreciate that there is no good reason why, if it did happen that such local or public authority had a small piece of land intervening, that should stop the Land Commission from running a suitable right-of-way for the convenience of a number of tenants on a large estate which was being acquired or divided.  Deputies can well realise how a right-of-way <Col N="623" /> could very well be necessary for the economic planning and development or division of an estate.</P>
      <P>Coming to the question of compensation, this is rather similar to the section I was dealing with a moment ago in connection with small cases.  The particular section with which we are concerned here is section 39 subsection (4) of the 1934 Act.  It is very short and I shall quote it because it will make clear what I have in mind.  It says:</P>
      <P>Where the compensation payable for a right-of-way or right of access conferred by the Land Commission under this section or any other provision of the Land Purchase Acts does not exceed fifty pounds, such compensation may be paid to the person who satisfied the Land Commission that for not less than six years immediately preceding the payment of such compensation he and his predecessors in title (if any) have been in actual occupation of the land over which such right-of-way or of access is so conferred or in receipt of the rents and profits of such land. </P>
      <P>This was enabling, simplifying procedure which allowed the Land Commission to run a right-of-way over this land when they wanted to do so in, perhaps, cases of very small holdings in respect of which the titles might be very faulty or non-existent.  They could give to the occupier there this compensation up to this amount to get his consent to go on with their right-of-way.  What I am doing here is amending that by allowing them to deal with these small cases up to a maximum of £200.  Again, that is taking into account changed circumstances and again it is enabling the Land Commission to deal more expeditiously with this type of case where it now arises because in many small cases you would find that as against the £30 the Land Commission might pay, if a small man had to put his title in order, it would cost him as much.  That is the purpose here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall look at the case posed to me about the stud farm mentioned by <Col N="624" /> Deputy Dillon.  I must confess it is something that did not occur to me.  I believe the answer to that to be that the Land Commission would be acquiring that land in the ordinary course under their powers and they would have to pay him compensation by way of market value under existing law.  Of that I am not sure.  I shall look into the point between now and the Report Stage, but offhand I should say that is the answer, that the Land Commission would have to deal with it on the same basis as if they were acquiring a portion of his lands in respect of which he would have the right of appeal on the question of value if he was not satisfied with the offer of the Land Commission.  That may not be the real answer, and if I find it is necessary to write into this section an additional power to deal with the particular case to which the Deputy refers, I shall consider the matter between now and the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I am getting on to deal with the phrases about proximity.  We have the expression in different Land Acts, for instance, &ldquo;the same locality, neighbourhood, same district in which some such lands are situated.&rdquo;  If in amendment No. 40c we adopt the three mile radius as settling the immediate neighbourhood, then we logically accept all these localities and districts and substitute the same immediate neighbourhood.  Congestion, unemployment and residence could all be judged in the same way.</P>
      <P>I realise one can say this is oversimplification.  Strict uniformity is not always as logical as it seems at first glance.  It is best to do away with these variations in phraseology which we have had in these different Land Acts on this issue, if it is only to remove the temptation of making hairsplitting differentiations in their interpretation.  I am accordingly recommending these amendments as a means of rationalising the wording of the original provisions.  These amendments are all designed to substitute &ldquo;immediate neighbourhood&rdquo;, to stick to &ldquo;immediate neighbourhood&rdquo; for the purposes of this section and to get away from the different expressions about localisation or localities used in different other sections dealing with this matter.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will sympathise with us in saying that his exposition of this series of amendments has not about it the crystal clarity which attended the exposition of the previous two sections with which we dealt.  My anxiety with regard to these amendments does not relate to any dissent from the Minister's general proposition that we should seek uniformity of expression throughout the land code, where that is possible. But there are implications, different implications, arising in the different <Col N="627" /> circumstances of the different categories of persons who are affected by the substitution of the words &ldquo;immediate neighbourhood&rdquo;, and no subsequent definition as representing the three-mile limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the Minister's general intention of uniformity but I should like to extend the limit beyond the three miles the Minister seeks to apply.  Three miles is an extremely short distance in this day of motor vehicles.  In this day of the internal combustion engine with men charging from place to place, it is an anachronism to have a limit of three miles simply because that is regarded as the most arduous journey a person should undertake.  What is the practical position in rural Ireland at the present time and what is likely to develop in the years immediately ahead?  More and more motor power will be used.  It is no hardship at all now for a man to work on a farm which is more than three or four miles away from his main holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> I am concerned with the kind of situation which could easily arise where, say, an uncle leaves a farm to a nephew who may live three and a half miles away.  Under the Minister's definition, the nephew is likely to have that farm taken from him unless he goes to reside on it.  If he goes to reside on it he may have to leave his old home where his father and grandfather lived before him.  It is unreal in the twentieth century to impose the limitation of three miles only on any person when it is so easy to get from place to place.</P>
    <P>I can see arguments to the effect that one can drive persons in a car but one cannot drive stock except one has a large car or a car provided out of the public purse, or one might be compelled to walk animals along the road. It does not get away from the principle I ask this House to recognise.  Is it not possible to work more than one area of land within a radius of five miles?  I should like the Minister to reflect on this and to move with the age in which he lives and the age in which our children will be living and allow a greater extension than was previously proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am perhaps the person most disinterested in this Bill.  No party in my constituency has regard for the land. The constituency is unique in that way and has no problem whatever for the Land Commission.  I am saying this to emphasise that I have no personal interest in this.  But it seems to me an extraordinary business that the Land Commission and the Minister are incapable of moving with the times and realising the practical family problems and situations which exist in the country.</P>
    <P>My purpose in raising this matter was to meet a particular situation of which I became aware.  It is in a part of the country where a Fine Gael family consisting of three brothers and two sisters reside.  They have two farms and both are five miles from the main holding.  They were told by members of the Fianna Fáil cumann that their days were ended, that as soon as the Land Bill came into operation, these farms would be taken from them.  It is denied by members of the <Col N="629" /> Fianna Fáil Party in Roscommon and is now being denied in East Galway.  This is a relevant affair of one family which I know.  One family came to my notice out of the length and breadth of the country.  This indicates what a frightful Bill this is.</P>
    <P>The Minister is being generous to the extent of meeting my point three-fifths of the way.  I would ask him to go further.  I can see his point in asking: &ldquo;If five miles, why not ten?&rdquo; The reason why five was proposed in my amendment was that we thought ten would be too much, so we halved it. I should say that I am not displeased to see the Minister going so far to meet me.  However, I do not think it is far enough.  It may be all right in 1964 but what about 1974 and 1984?  The fact that his Government accept that rural Ireland will become thinly populated suggests that there will be many more out-farms being operated.</P>

      <P>I have just one constructive suggestion with which I think Deputy Ryan will agree.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;one finds a lot of sound commonsense in some of the things he says.  It is true that people who some years ago might find it a hardship to travel a mile in a horsedrawn vehicle now find it easy to travel five or six miles in a tractor or lorry. There I part company with Deputy Ryan.  I am not at all interested in saving the out-farm for the person who has a farm which he is not serious about working, just holding on to it for the purpose of disposing of it at a good price.  The Land Commission have not facilitated the people who have an acre here and an acre there and who try seriously to make a living out of these bits and pieces.</P>
      <P>A man may have an acre and a house in one place and five or six acres of land elsewhere.  He may have a job as well and may be able to work the five or six acres very well.  It would be a hardship on such a man if the Land Commission were to create a situation in which that man would be deprived of his five or six acres.  If there is no other reason for such action except simply that the land is further than three miles away, I do not think it is a good idea.  My Party would not be prepared to agree to such a proposal.  I am asking the Minister to enlarge on this proposal.  I am prepared to go along with the idea that in this section we must have a designated neighbourhood but I am not prepared to agree with the idea that because a piece of land is further than three miles from where the person lives the Land Commission should be entitled to take away the outlying portions of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, are we discussing amendment No. 40c or Deputy Ryan's amendment?  The point made by Deputy Ryan is largely met by the amendment I have tabled, providing a three mile radius.  He suggested five miles.  That would mean, to my mind, that if an owner had been resident in New York during the past 50 years <Col N="631" /> and had a brother living at home within five miles of the farm owned by the gentleman in New York, the gentleman in New York was safe from the Land Commission.  The Deputy may not have that intention but that is my interpretation of what his amendment suggests.  I submit that the three mile limit is reasonable.  Again, let me emphasise that this general provision is to deal with absentees, people not living on their farms, not living in the immediate vicinity of them, companies owning land down the country, perhaps resident in London, or, indeed, in this city.</P>
      <P>They are the people to whom this section is directed.  The case has always been made here during discussions on this Bill that certain provisions are directed at the widow or the small working farmer or the excellent farmer who may have an out-farm.  We have had provisions in Land Acts since 1923 which give powers to the Land Commission for the acquisition of land for the relief of congestion.  We do not use these powers for the purpose of getting after people who are working their land.  They are used for the acquisition of land for people who are not making proper use of their lands, who have had them let for a great number of years, for getting after people who have neglected the duties of land ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers here are not being sought for the purpose of interfering in any way with the ordinary working farmer of this country.  They are being sought to deal more effectively with people who have land but are putting it to bad use, to deal with absenteeism&mdash;in fact, to acquire lands, not being <Col N="632" /> properly used, for the relief of congestion.  I suggest that in the amendments I have tabled I have met adequately the point made by Deputy Ryan.  In any event, his proposition would be unworkable.  I, therefore, ask the House to accept the official amendments I have tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has pointed out that this section, with the amendments, is directed against companies.  He claims it is unthinkable the provisions here should ever be invoked against individual farmers who are working their lands.  On the other hand, as Deputy Ryan points out, what is said in the House is one thing and what is said down the country is another.  We must be circumspect to ensure there are not powers incorporated in the Land Acts which can be used for the purpose of threatening people with whom, according to all opinions in the House, nobody has the slightest right to interfere.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a word at this stage in regard to companies.  The hour is late but I should like to pursue it when the debate is resumed on this subject, because here again there are certain provisions which would impose very great hardship on people who have lived their lives in this country for generations and who would clearly be harassed if this section is passed in its present form. I have great sympathy with the case made by Deputy Ryan.</P>
