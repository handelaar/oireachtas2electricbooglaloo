      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to that, the Minister for Justice made it known in a series of public speeches that he intends radically to alter the draft of the original Bill.  That being so, would the Taoiseach consider the desirability of redrafting the whole Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to know. According to the statements made by the Minister for Justice at various gatherings, it is proposed substantially to remove Part IX of the Bill and other provisions.  It is extremely difficult to deal with a technical Bill of this kind subject to vast amendments.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would consider the desirability of redrafting the whole Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill should take considerable time and should get considerable time from the Dáil in Committee but the sooner we get to the Committee Stage, the sooner we will be able to get on with these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Taoiseach, <Col N="1154" /> on reflection, will agree that it seems to be a daft kind of procedure to discuss on Second Stage principles of a Bill which the Government have announced they intend to alter fundamentally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It makes the Second Stage discussion virtually meaningless because we cannot discuss what is actually in the Bill because what is on the face of the Bill is no longer in the Bill.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would consider whether it might be desirable to redraft the Bill with the amendments proposed by the Government and let us discuss it on the Second Stage or Committee Stage as the Government mean to sponsor it?  I am satisfied that it would result in very much more expeditious passage of the Bill if that course were adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought permission to make this statement because last evening in the House Deputy Noel Lemass made a statement about me, and my family, might I add, which was untrue and unjustified.  I read the transcript of the Deputy's speech and I am really at a loss to know what he refers to.  He refers to an estate near Loughrea.  It cannot possibly, to my mind, refer to our holding in Kilrickle because that property is not and never has been subject to Land Commission acquisition. I think perhaps he means Ballydoogan estate near Loughrea which is subject to Land Commission proceedings at the moment.</P>
      <P>The position is that a couple of years ago the Land Commission proceeded to acquire this estate.  In the meantime the owner died.  His widow, at the end of September, sought from the Land Commission, and got, permission to let half of this estate.  On 1st October there was a public auction at which my family acquired part of this estate.  As far as I am aware, there is no right of way and never was any right of way through the portion which we now hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1155" /> Prior to the letting of this estate, the owner laid off some of her employees.  On the Sunday following the auction, one of these employees came to me in my home and told me that for 16 years he had worked on this estate, that he had had the freedom of a cow and calf and that with his notice to quit, he was also given notice to take his cow and calf out of the estate.  This unfortunate man explained to me his position, that he would have to sell his cow and his calf, that he would have to buy milk and his circumstances would be considerably worse than before.  I told him to leave his cow and his calf on the division and further instructed my herd not to interfere with his cow and his calf in any way.  So, far from locking the gate to keep anybody out, I allowed the man to stay in and he was extremely grateful.  That is the true position and those are the facts.</P>

    <P>This new section, unavoidably a rather complex one, is designed to deal with the problem of the purchase of farm land by non-nationals.  I have repeatedly made it clear in statements to this House over the past few years <Col N="1163" /> that the Government were keeping a close watch on the extent of such purchases and were at all times alive to the possibility that some formula might be discovered to enable non-nationals to escape the special stamp duty.  On several occasions I appealed to Deputies to report any instances in which they knew or suspected that evasion had taken place.  I got no specific report on this point.  Coupled with the knowledge I have gathered from other sources, this fact convinces me that there has not been any widespread evasion of the existing heavy stamp duty and that no large areas of land have been sold to non-nationals without the knowledge or assent of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>There is, however, some reason to think that a few Irishmen have found ways to facilitate the purchase of farms by non-nationals using legal subterfuges which enabled the purchasers to evade the special duty.  The Government have decided that any such gaps must be closed before any general harm is done.  We have always asserted our readiness to deal with this type of activity whenever it appeared necessary and this new section is our proposed remedy.  In view of the length of the section I shall explain it by first stating its effects in broad terms and then going through it step by step in greater detail.</P>
    <P>The general proposal is to initiate a system of direct control by the Land Commission over the purchase of rural land by non-nationals.  There are exemptions in favour of industrial and residential units; a special concession is given to non-nationals long resident in this country; care is taken to avoid upsetting the ordinary business of the transfer of agricultural properties between citizens and there are special features aimed at ensuring that the new proposals do not have an adverse effect on the common sources of agricultural credit for the native farmer. But, with very few exceptions, the non-national who wishes to purchase or control farm land, either as an individual or by operating through a company, will not under this section be able to <Col N="1164" /> do so lawfully without the prior consent of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Turning to the details of the new section, Deputies will find that subsection (1) deals with a number of definitions. To begin with, the section covers all land except urban land.  Our primary purpose is, of course, to protect farm land or &ldquo;agricultural land&rdquo; but it is an extremely difficult matter to draft a definition of agricultural land which would embrace all ordinary farm land and exclude &ldquo;white elephant&rdquo; properties and other units of rural land which, by and large, might be allowed pass to non-nationals without loss to the rural community and without causing any upset in the land structure reform programme.  In fact, there are so many localities in which different types and qualities of land are intermixed with one another that it would be almost impossible to frame a section which distinguished clearly between the wheat and the chaff.  It was accordingly decided that if the section was to be effective it must first capture all rural land and then provide simple forms of exemption for such properties as could suitably be regarded as outside policy.  This sounds rather drastic but it will be seen as I go on that the list of exemptions is as generous as it can safely be.</P>
    <P>Next we have a definition of &ldquo;interest&rdquo; in relation to land which is designed to cover a substantial number of the evasion devices which could theoretically be applied against present stamp duty laws.  Thus, while sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) cover the straightforward cases in which a man owns or leases land, sub-paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) relate to a number of different ways in which he might achieve effective control without completing a direct instrument of transfer to himself.  For example, (c) is aimed at the non-national who might arrange for an Irish agent to buy a farm, lend him the money for this purpose and take a mortgage from him; the non-national could then enter into effective control while the citizen remained in residence to keep up appearances. Alternatively he could instruct the citizen to default in the mortgage, <Col N="1165" /> and he himself would enter into possession as mortgage without having to complete an instrument of direct transfer which, as we shall see later, would be ineffective without the consent of the Land Commission.  The last line in this definition is intended to bring in any residue of cases in which the non-national would arrange to have the legal interest vested in a citizen while, in the non-legal sense, he himself became the real owner.</P>
    <P>Next we come to a definition of &ldquo;qualified person&rdquo;, that is, a person who will be qualified to buy rural land, without having to seek the consent of the Land Commission.  The Irish citizen naturally must be qualified; also there is a concession to the non-national who has resided among us for such a substantial period that we are prepared to accept him as one of ourselves even though in fact he has not changed his citizenship.  Sub-paragraph (iii) contains an exemption for industrial purchases and (iv) for local authorities.  The next three clauses cover semi-State companies and other bodies corporate which for one reason or another are unlikely to be used as cover for evasion.  These are State companies set up under Acts of this House.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that in this context I have assumed that the ostensibly Irish company is the Trojan Horse which is most likely to be used to breach the defences.  Consequently I have adopted the attitude that all companies dealing with or purchasing farmland must submit to some form of scrutiny unless by their nature they are entirely above suspicion.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation, which has many dealings with native farmers by way of mortgage, is one such body corporate and it can be safely exempted.  Similarly, sub-paragraph (viii) exempts all the principal banks operating in this country because it is clear that they cannot be used in an objectionable manner.  More important still, however, is the fact that the Government does not wish to introduce unnecessary obstacles to the ordinary machinery of charges on land which enable the banks to make <Col N="1166" /> working capital available to the Irish farmer.</P>
    <P>Sub-paragraph (ix) is very similar to a provision in the Finance Acts and it will allow a non-national to purchase a country residence with a few acres of amenity land provided he has passed the scrutiny of the Land Commission, to make sure that the purchase is not part of an evasion device.</P>
    <P>Sub-paragraph (x) will allow the Minister for Lands to create additional categories of exempted persons if, in the working of this section, he finds it desirable and safe to do so.  I have in mind that there are some public companies so long established in this country and of such good repute that they would never be suspected of being used to cloak undesirable purchases. If the new section proves irksome to such companies we may be able to find a formula by which they could be given a general release while at the same time we do not open any doors for bogus Irish companies. Deputies will appreciate that I have to proceed cautiously in this matter of exemptions.</P>
    <P>Next we have a definition of &ldquo;State authority&rdquo; because it is intended to exempt every such body.</P>
    <P>In subsection (2) we come to the kernel of the whole section.  If a person is not a qualified person within one of the categories I have already described he will not be able to obtain an interest in rural land save by consent of the Land Commission.  A consent may be general so that it covers a whole class of people or a series of transactions and it may or may not be subject to conditions.  For example, the Land Commission might give consent to the sale of a mansion and grounds to a non-national provided the owner first sold them a sufficient area to satisfy local congestion.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) provides a complete exemption for a State authority and for the legal personal representative of a deceased person to whom, while acting in that capacity, any interest in land may temporarily pass.  This is simply to avoid unnecessary trouble about the ordinary wills of native property owners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1167" /> In sub-paragraph (3) we have a much more substantial point about wills.  The effect of this provision is that an interest may pass under a will to an heir or to a member of the deceased's family who is a non-national. In the first place, I think it reasonable that those non-nationals who are already established amongst us should be able to leave their own property to their near relatives, even though they are unqualified non-nationals, without the fear that the Land Commission may stop them. Furthermore, I do not think we should prevent an Irish citizen from leaving his property, or part of it, to a son or daughter who has gone abroad and has acquired the citizenship of another State or, to take another instance, to a non-national who has married the testator's son or daughter and is the parent of his grandchildren.</P>
    <P>Lastly, by confining this concession to heirs, where appropriate, and members of the deceased's family, we make it highly unlikely that anyone will find a method of evasion based on will-making; if we do not so confine the concession, it is just possible that a non-national might be able to obtain control of a property, without consent, by having it bought in the name of a dying citizen who would will it back to the non-national.</P>
    <P>Sub-paragraph (c) limits the meaning of &ldquo;family&rdquo; to close relatives.  If a citizen wants to bequeath rural land to a far out relative or friend who is a non-national, he will have to seek consent and show reason for doing so.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) deals with the mechanics which conveyancers will have to use to conform to the section after enactment.  An instrument which purports to vest land will not be effective unless it contains a certificate of Land Commission consent, or a certificate that the person becoming entitled to the interest is a qualified person, or a certificate that the instrument is consequent upon a contract entered into before the passing of this Act, or a certificate covering the case of family succession under a will, which I have already described.</P>
    <P>The last clause in this paragraph is <Col N="1168" /> in ease of future conveyancing.  It is essential to the future security of the purchasers of rural property in general that one of these certificates embodied in an instrument of transfer should be acceptable on its face value and that the solicitor for a future purchaser should not have to go behind the certificate to seek evidence of the facts it recites.</P>
    <P>The wording of paragraph (b) of subsection (3) is a bit involved.  The only effect of it is, however, to confirm that instruments passing property rights to State authorities or legal personal representatives will not have to include any of the four certificates I have described.</P>
    <P>In subsection (4) we come to very important provisions dealing with persons who may seek to evade this new law.  Deputies will appreciate that the system of discouraging non-nationals from the purchase of agricultural land, through the operation of the 25 per cent stamp duty, was a rather indirect one.  We have not been completely satisfied with it and we are now changing over to a direct system of control.  Any such system of control, if it is to be effective, must include a direct system of confronting, challenging and examining every individual and every company against whom or which it can be honestly alleged that they appear to have flouted the control. Accordingly, this subsection provides that if the Land Commission suspect anyone of evading their control and successfully occupying farmland they shall have power to call upon him to give an account of his dealings with the property.</P>
    <P>There is at present a substantial number of companies, big and small, which owns farms in Ireland and it would be possible for a non-national to enter into effective ownership of such land by buying up the shares in the company.  Apart from this, there is always the possibility that an ostensibly Irish company might be created especially for the purpose of transferring effective control of land to non-national hands by the manipulation of shares rather than by transfer instrument.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> Accordingly, in subsection (5) there is provision that, if a land-holding company under Irish control passes into the control of a non-qualified person, this fact must be reported to the Land Commission and if the Land Commission choose to institute proceedings for the acquisition of the land the ordinary defences against acquisition are no longer available in relation to that land.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) provides heavy penalties for any person who knowingly makes a false or misleading statement for the purpose of this section, or fails to comply with a requisition, or fails to make a report to the Land Commission which he is required to make.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) makes the officers of bodies corporate subject to similar penalties as those which apply to individuals.</P>
    <P>Where the Land Commission's consent is requisite, written application to the Department will be necessary ordinarily, in advance of a proposed transaction.  To cover exceptional eventualities, there are provisions in subsection (8) that consent may be given retrospectively.  This subsection also contains facilities for legal proofs by sealed certificates of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Subsection (9) provides that where an unqualified person will be selling land after the passing of this Bill, he cannot exclude requisitions on his title in relation to the Land Commission's consent.  This provision is intended to increase the risks in evasion devices.</P>
    <P>Finally, subsection (10) extends the time for summary proceedings to three years from the date of the offence. Under the Summary Jurisdiction Act, it would, I think, be only six months as the law stands.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to guarantee in advance that legislation of this type will prove watertight when put to the test but we have very carefully gone into any suggestions or suspicions that have come to our notice of methods of evasion of the law as it stands. I have felt for some time that, while the penal stamp duty of 25 per cent is very discouraging from the point <Col N="1170" /> of view of preventing non-nationals buying land, the Revenue Commissioners are really not the proper people to deal with this matter.  The Land Commission have their officials spread out over the length and breadth of the country and would consequently be in a much better position to know whether a suspicious transaction had taken place, whereas, if people swore false affidavits or made false statements in their deeds, it could happen that these people would get away with it.</P>
    <P>I do not say what they have done in the past is illegal but, on consideration, it appears to me that the more effective way of dealing with this matter, in so far as it is a problem for us, would be through the Land Commission.  We have very carefully considered not alone suspicions but also theoretically any devices which have occurred to us and which could possibly be used to get around or circumvent the law as it stands.  This section is as comprehensive as I, at all events, can devise at the moment, and without suggestions from any Deputies, to deal with what might arise for the purpose of evasion of the existing law.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of what some Deputies will, no doubt, say about Irish companies, I am quite satisfied that, unless we take global control by means of this section, it will be virtually impossible to devise ways and means of stopping evasion.  Let me emphasise again that I am taking power to make further exceptions or exemptions, as we become experienced in the working of this section, and it may well be that we can, where the necessity arises, exempt or except the operations of a number of well-known, old-established Irish companies.  But, unless the House is prepared to agree to a global control of this kind to deal with alleged Irish companies, I am quite satisfied there will be no way of stopping evasion. I have no doubt that people would use company devices for the purpose of evading the law.  As I say, I have made this section as comprehensive as possible to deal with every situation we can think of and accordingly I recommend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this amendment gives an interesting instance of Fianna Fáil closing the door after a large part of the horse has gone.  We realised the nature of this problem as far back as 1961 and accordingly introduced a Private Bill into the House in the names of myself, Deputies Patrick Giles, Tadgh Manley, Denis Jones, Patrick Lindsay and Oliver J. Flanagan, called the Land (Regulation of Acquisition) Bill, 1961. On that occasion we proposed there should be established a non-nationals land register.  We provided that every acquisition of land, the beneficial ownership of which would ultimately accrue to non-nationals, should be registered in the Land Commission. The Bill provided that if any device or skulduggery were employed in order to avoid that obligation, then the sale of the land would be declared null and void.  There is no more effective sanction you could employ than to say to some person who wishes to break the land law: &ldquo;Whatever device you employ, if the end result is that a non-national acquires a beneficial interest in the land without registering it in the Land Commission, the transaction will be null and void and you will have paid your money for nothing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very effective method of controlling this problem.  We were told on the occasion when we introduced the Bill that it was wholly unnecessary, that the Minister was taking all the precautions necessary to control this growing evil and that any precautions of the kind we proposed under the Land (Regulation of Acquisition) Bill, 1961, were superfluous and would do nothing to resolve the problem which we then pointed out to the Government was one of growing importance to the country.  Three years have elapsed since we introduced the Bill and now the Government have come in with a Bill designed to achieve exactly the same result.  It is a good thing to realise that Parliamentary discussion and agitation in the country still have the salutary effect of waking up a somnolent Government to their <Col N="1172" /> clear duty.  If the uncontrolled acquisition of agricultural land by non-nationals continued indefinitely, very serious social problems would have been created in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the Bill introduced by us, precautions were taken to make it quite clear that our primary purpose was to prevent the acquisition of agricultural land by non-nationals and in the form of the relatively simple Bill we produced, it made it quite possible for a non-national to buy what the Minister described today as a &ldquo;white elephant&rdquo; property, and made it quite possible if he were purchasing lands for industrial development to continue his purchase. In fact, it put upon the non-national one obligation, and one obligation only, and that was to keep the Land Commission fully informed of his intention to purchase agricultural land.  At the same time it fixed the non-national with notice that if contrary to the general land policy, the non-national acquired agricultural land, the Land Commission had full powers compulsorily to acquire it if it was considered in the public interest to do so, for the relief of congestion in the locality, or for any other purpose for which the Land Commission are entitled compulsorily to acquire land.  We are glad that the Government have awakened to the necessity for what we pointed out to them was necessary three years ago when we first introduced this Private Bill, the Land (Regulation of Acquisition) Bill of 1961.</P>
    <P>Now, I approve of the Minister, in dealing with a complex question of this kind, reading his brief to us because it is useful to have a clear and positive statement of what his intention is.  I envy him the availability of his brief.  I suppose all Oppositions always envy Ministers the great advantage they have in having their briefs prepared for them, covering every detail of the measure which they are sponsoring before the House. This is a very comprehensive, long and involved section which the Minister tells us he is advised by his advisers is necessary effectively to control the problem which I believe could have <Col N="1173" /> been just as effectively controlled by the proposals in the Land (Regulation of Acquisition) Bill, 1961.  The important thing in this connection is to notify all non-nationals that it is contrary to the policy of the Land Commission for substantial areas of agricultural land to pass into non-Irish hands and that if this happens, the Land Commission will use their general power to acquire it compulsorily for the relief of congestion in the area in which it is situated and for re-allocation to Irish nationals in accordance with the general Land Commission policy.  However, the Land Commission have sought to stop every gap and cover every contingency which, as the Minister says, is an extremely difficult thing to do.</P>
    <P>There are one or two matters of detail in regard to this long amendment, which extends to four pages, to which I direct the Minister's attention. In the first section, he deals with qualified persons and there are ten sub-paragraphs.  Sub-paragraph (x), at the top of page 2 of his amendment, provides that a qualified person can belong to &ldquo;any category declared by the Minister by regulation to be an additional category for the purpose of this definition&rdquo;.  The Minister tells us that he puts that in deliberately to leave himself some room for manoeuvring in case some unforeseen type of case arises.</P>
    <P>That is all right and it is desirable that there is to be some flexibility here owing to the experimental character of this amendment, but I should be glad to know if he does not agree with me that where he makes a regulation of this character should it not be laid on the Table of the House?  It is desirable, if you extend a category of persons to be deemed to be qualified persons, to put it on the records formally.  I do not think in that case that it is necessary to ask the Minister to provide the customary provision with regard to the 21 days, because if anybody wants to raise this matter, he can raise it by way of Parliamentary Question, or if necessary by motion, but I do think that it should be put on the records by tabling it so that it may <Col N="1174" /> then go into the permanent records of the House which are available in the Library.</P>
    <P>There is one other small detail which I should like to draw to the Minister's attention.  There is a definition which involves the employment of the word &ldquo; town &rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In subsection (1) ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think so.  The problem is : is there any definition to be found here or in some other statute of the word &ldquo;town&rdquo;?  I think there are different definitions in different statutes. It might be useful to the Minister if he would look at the statutory meaning of the word &ldquo;town&rdquo; and possibly adopt a definition either by reference to the Town Improvement (Ireland) Act, 1854, or the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963. Otherwise, I think very considerable problems for conveyancers might arise. Possibly the Minister would look into that to determine with which definition of &ldquo;town&rdquo; he wishes to bring the amendment into line.</P>
      <P>I do not want to rub it into the Minister unduly but I think it right and proper to direct the attention of the House to the fundamental difference between planning intelligently and programming from day to day.  An essential feature of intelligent planning is to foresee the problems that are likely to arise and to take precautions in time to prevent their developing into serious social problems which have to be dealt with radically.  An admirable example of that is our Land (Regulation of Acquisition) Bill, 1961, whereunder we sought to take precautions before the growth of this evil would reach serious dimensions, to bring it under control, and to fix all and sundry with notice that we did not intend to allow it to develop, that we intended to provide simple machinery which would act not only as an effective deterrent but as an explicit warning to non-nationals that this was the settled policy of the State, and that it was not intended to allow any skulduggery or legal manipulation to circumvent that fundamental policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> Programming according to Fianna Fáil waits for the evil to develop and then you bring in an amendment running to four pages, which the Minister himself admits is of such complexity, and so difficult, that to explain it takes four or five pages of his own brief. I believe that had we adopted the provisions of the Land (Regulation of Acquisition) Bill, 1961, we would not be confronted with the situation which the Minister now seeks to remedy in section 44 of this Bill.  However, it is better to be late than never to act at all.</P>
    <P>It is an interesting thing that it took the Roscommon bye-election to awaken the Fianna Fáil Government to the existence of the Shannon floods. It has taken the East-Galway bye-election to awaken the Government to the existence of the problem which they denied was there at all up to about a week or a fortnight ago. Interestingly enough&mdash;and I think this is deserving of comment&mdash;the introduction of this amendment to the Land Bill was announced, not in Dáil Éireann by the Minister for Lands, but at a Fianna Fáil convention in Loughrea by Deputy Haughey who was then, I think, suspended like Mahomet's coffin between the Department of Justice and the Department of Agriculture. I do not really think that kind of procedure is seemly or becoming.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands is the Minister for Lands and is responsible for matters relating to the contents of this Bill.  It shows a profound lack of respect for the Oireachtas, and for the decencies and proprieties of public life, that a radical amendment to a Land Bill which is at the time under discussion in Dáil Éireann should be announced at a Fianna Fáil convention in East Galway, because contact with the people has at last forced on the Government a realisation of what we were trying to teach them three years ago.  If the Government can learn in each bye-election as much as they appear to have learned in Roscommon and East Galway.  I cannot imagine what kind of volcanic eruption will take place when the general election <Col N="1176" /> comes.  Surely revelations and discoveries will be made by Fianna Fáil of a kind never before witnessed in this country.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister for Lands that a Fianna Fáil convention addressed by the Pooh-Bah of the Fianna Fáil Government is not the proper place for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil Government to assume the penitential mantle for the purpose of doing public penance for their past lack of diligence and foresight.  Such confessions of failure should more properly be made to the Oireachtas, as has been done by the Minister for Lands this morning.  Here they can be discussed and examined, because the likelihood of those things being intelligently done at a Fianna Fáil convention is extremely remote.  Intelligent discussion of legislative proposals for the purpose of improving them is an essential part of our legislative procedure.</P>

      <P>Before the Dáil went into Recess there was a meeting of the Whips at which it was announced that one of the important items of legislation which had to be concluded before the Recess was the Land Bill.  It was impressed on us that no matter what happened, the Land Bill had to go through.  It was felt by the Labour Party, and apparently by the Fine Gael Party also, that that task was impossible.  The Minister and members of the Fianna Fáil Party have now castigated everyone responsible for that decision up and down the country. If we had concluded the Land Bill before the Recess, section 43 (d) would never have appeared.</P>

      <P>We would be in the position that, the Land Bill having been completed, we could not expect another Land Bill to be introduced soon and we would have a continuation of what the Minister now admits must be a serious problem, the wholesale purchase of land by non-nationals. Is there any reason why this should not have been included in the Land Bill ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> I do not want to embarrass the Minister by producing a copy of the Dáil debate in respect of the occasion when a Labour amendment was discussed in which we sought that the purchase of land by non-nationals be restricted to land required for industrial purposes or park-land, where a house is bought, not to exceed 10 acres. I do not think I can be accused of misrepresenting the proposed section if I say that it bears a remarkable resemblance to the amendment which was introduced in this House by the Labour Party&mdash;and you should hear the things the Minister said about that amendment.  You should hear the comments he made about how utterly ridiculous it was to suggest that anything like that could be included in a Land Bill and how utterly useless it was to introduce proposals to end a problem which, he said, did not exist. I do not want to embarrass the Minister by producing the evidence but I suggest that he or some of his advisers might have a look at the record and avoid a similar mistake again.</P>
    <P>It was said here, and I want to repeat it now, that in certain areas of this country there is wholesale purchase of land by non-nationals and that the usual procedure is that one man comes in and buys a farm and then throws his eyes around and sees one which will suit some of his friends, his brothers or his sisters or somebody else, and, bit by bit, areas such as those in County Meath, where the best land of the country is and which unfortunately is still in large farms, have, over the past three or four years, been bought up by those people.  Around the area where I live the position has become a laughing stock.  Nobody may bid for farms because there is always a non-national to top the highest bid whether it is public or private.  I compliment the Minister on having the decency, when he knew it was a problem that should be dealt with, to introduce this section.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the suggestion that the buying of land by non-nationals can be stopped by a fine of £100 or £200.  Imprisonment is also added but we know quite well that when the courts hear these cases they <Col N="1178" /> do not like to put those fellows in jail. They have a lot of money and they will fight it to the last court in the land. Would the Minister suggest that a fine of £100 is any worry to a man who is prepared to pay £80,000 for a farm which, to an Irishman, may be worth not more than £40,000 or £50,000 ? Does the Minister suggest that, when the 25 per cent stamp duty was not sufficient to stop them, they can be stopped by token fines such as are suggested here?  I have not seen it in the Bill but I agree with Deputy Dillon that the one way to stop it is to make all such purchases null and void. Somebody remarked that a fine of £1,000 is provided.  Again, I pose the question: what difference does a fine of £1,000 make to somebody who can find £80,000?  Does £1,000 here or there matter very much to such a person?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have another look at this.  I believe that the only way it can be stopped is by cancelling out completely any purchase of land by those people except with the express written consent of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>It is suggested here that land could be transferred in certain cases to members of a family in a will.  Again, I would suggest to the Minister to have a second look at this.  It does not matter whether the grandson or the step-brother of a present owner is a non-national, he or she can be in the very same position as somebody who has just come into the country for the first time.  They are either national or non-national and there should be no halfway mark.</P>
    <P>A very interesting question posed by Deputy Dillon is the question of &ldquo;town&rdquo;.  I understand that in the interpretation of Acts the Irish version takes precedence.  If that is so, then &ldquo;baile&rdquo; I assume will be the term used.  Every little townland in the country is Bally this, that or the other. Would the Minister take a look at that and so prevent an awful lot of ambiguity when the Act eventually comes to be interpreted?</P>
    <P>I am glad to see this section introduced. I believe the Minister can <Col N="1179" /> improve it a lot.  From the length of the section, it is clear that it must have been an awful job to stop all the holes that had to be stopped in order to ensure that it would work at all. No matter what way we take it, we must remember that the object is to prevent a further peaceful infiltration of this country by the people I have referred to because already it has gone much too far.</P>
    <P>My only regret is that one portion of our amendment was not included by the Minister: retrospection is not included here.  I should like to see not alone those who have come in in the past 12 months but people who will break their necks to buy land in this country before this Bill is finally an Act caught in the net and the land taken from them and given to the people of this country for whom it was originally intended and who are the only people entitled to it.</P>

      <P>The seriousness of this problem has for a long time been stressed by this side of the House. The purchase of land in rural Ireland by aliens has caused very great concern to the Fine Gael Party and I cannot but be glad at the great conversion of Fianna Fáil, completely and entirely, to Fine Gael's view in relation to this matter.  At every election, we see Fianna Fáil dressing up very sprucely and nicely in Fine Gael clothing.  This is a typical example. Fianna Fáil has awakened to the seriousness of this matter and now realises the commonsense and intelligent approach of the Fine Gael Party to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of land purchased by aliens in this country is astonishing. I am quite satisfied that the Land Commission or even the Revenue Commissioners have not to this day a true and accurate picture of the amount of our land that has fallen into the hands of aliens over the past few years.  The problem has become so great that not alone have the NFA and other organisations made their own protests but the problem has now reached the stage at which the Government <Col N="1180" /> admit and realise that it is serious.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was first introduced in this House, many Deputies in the Fine Gael and Labour Parties demonstrated the seriousness of the purchase of land by aliens.  At that time the Minister and, indeed, most members of his Party publicly stated that it was not a serious problem, that it was being kept under review by the Land Commission and that it did not call for any serious action.  I put it to the House that if the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill had been accepted and approved by the Government in 1961, the serious problem that has arisen since then would not now have reached the colossal dimensions which it has reached.  If the Galway bye-election has done nothing else for us to date except extract this pronouncement from the Minister for Agriculture that it was the Government's intention now to deal with the problem of the purchase of land by aliens and to tighten up the regulations by the new section, which the Minister for Lands has now brought in, at least it has done some good.</P>
    <P>I should like to inquire from the Minister, although I know he certainly will evade the reply, why he did not make some comment on this?  He did not make any comment at all.  He left it to the Minister for Agriculture to go down to Loughrea and announce the Government's intention in relation to this matter.  I feel that the Minister for Lands could not have addressed himself to this matter seriously when he did not have regard to his own failure and the failure of his Department to recognise long ago that this was a serious matter.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael told the Minister so in 1961 because we had our experience in the late 1950's and in 1960 of the colossal amount of land that was being purchased in this country by foreigners. At that time we asked them to go to it and to do then what they are doing today but they failed to do so. I venture to say if they had taken the action in 1961, which they are taking today, there are many large tracts of good land in this country in the <Col N="1181" /> occupation and ownership of aliens that would be in the hands of the many local deserving applicants for land in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister was known to say time and time again, when the Fine Gael Party asked for a register to be kept in the Land Commission of the purchase of Irish lands by non-nationals, that such a register could not produce good results and that the Land Commission already knew of these purchases. The details furnished by the Minister for Lands were in accordance with the survey published by the NFA, who set up a special committee to deal with the seriousness of this problem.  I really feel, even more strongly than Deputy Dillon, on this.  He said the Government are now deciding to close the stable door when part of the horse has gone.  I really feel the Government are now closing the stable door when the horse has galloped a long way because the land is not there now.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister for Lands recalls that the late German ambassador, when addressing his own people, advised Germans in their own interest, not to embark on the purchase of agricultural land in this country.  He displayed great public interest in doing so. He realised his duty and he realised the seriousness of the land problem in this country.  I have referred on more than one occasion to the very worthy and creditable advice which the former German ambassador gave to his own people.  I feel this advice was very commendable.  This man had been here in this country.  He realised that there was not enough land here to meet the demand of the many native applicants and he most certainly took the first available opportunity of advising his own countrymen in Germany not to embark on the purchase of agricultural land in this country because he realised that it was creating a great social problem.  I feel that his statement is one that certainly deserves the greatest praise and commendation by everybody.</P>
    <P>The question of the purchase of land by aliens has given rise in many parts of this country to very serious forms of land agitation.  I feel that the section, which the Minister is now including in <Col N="1182" /> this Bill, will certainly curb future land sales to aliens.  What is going to happen about the land which has already been purchased ?  I feel the time has come when the Land Commission ought now at this very late stage examine the details submitted to them by the Revenue Commissioners or their own inspectorate and see what can be done about the large amount of land which is at present in the ownership of aliens in this country.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the Minister has not, at any time, given this House a true and accurate account of the seriousness of this matter because he has not, at any time, had correct statistics before him.  We of the Fine Gael Party always welcome converts to our view and I feel that the greatest possible welcome that we can give should be extended to the Minister for Lands for embarking on a part of Fine Gael policy.  This is something for which we certainly can take some credit and pride because it was achieved as a result of the Fine Gael Party focussing public opinion on the seriousness of this matter.  It is of great national importance that we have succeeded in this and that the Minister and the Government have wakened up and have now decided to do something about this, even though I feel it is too late.  They have at least realised that the question of the purchase of lands by aliens is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred if the Government a long time ago had taken steps to prevent entirely and completely the purchase of land by aliens but I hope that when this new section becomes part of our new legislation we will have heard the end for all time of the purchase of land in this country by foreigners.  I am quite satisfied that our smallholders throughout this country have a very genuine grievance.  Many of our farmers' sons and many of our smallholders, who had to emigrate to seek employment in Britain and elsewhere, certainly have a very genuine grievance in so far as the purchase of land by aliens is concerned.  Many of them had to leave their holdings because of the very small dimensions of their property.  It is most regrettable that they had to go and be denied a <Col N="1183" /> standard of living in their own land and, at the same time, see wealthy farmers coming here and buying up the cream of Ireland's land.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government have at last realised the seriousness of this matter, to see their conversion at this late stage to the ideas of Fine Gael. This is very welcome, and I hope and trust the Minister will have the courage at last to stand up and say: &ldquo;I said Fine Gael were wrong in 1961 and that there was no problem.  I now see the folly of my statement.  The problem is there and we now appreciate the advice and assistance we have received from the Fine Gael Party in focussing public attention on this matter.  I am now taking the advice offered by Fine Gael, and I am sorry I did not do it in the interests of Ireland's landowners in 1961.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the kind of speech of repentance this House is owed by the Minister for Lands.  Not alone is this House owed such public repentance but the country is, and more particularly are those who are far from the shores of this country and who have made efforts to obtain portions of large tracts of land now in the ownership of aliens.  The fact that so many acres of land have fallen into the hands of foreigners is entirely due to the inactivity of the Minister for Lands and the Fianna Fáil Party and their failure to realise that this matter is one of great national importance and urgency.</P>
    <P>However, it is better late than never, although I am very much afraid that any land which was on the public market for purchase by aliens has already been purchased.  The big purchases of land by aliens have in recent months been considerably slowed up simply because the amount of land on the public market for such people has now been exhausted.  I should like the Minister to indicate to the House what steps he proposes to take in relation to the lands in the hands of aliens for the past three or four years. It is only in the past three or four years, and particularly since 1960, that we have seen great tracts of land falling into what I would describe as undesirable <Col N="1184" /> hands.  Many of those people are buying land for the purpose of spending their money.  They are not coming here for love of this country or for the purpose of producing fodder for man and beast here.  They are land speculators, coming to see what they can make out of it.</P>
    <P>As well as that, when they become aware of uncertainty and insecurity on the Continent, they come and buy up large tracts of land in this country. I recall the words of James Fintan Lalor when he said: &ldquo;The soil of Ireland for the people of Ireland to have and to hold from God alone who gave it.&rdquo;  It has taken Fianna Fáil a long time to realise the wisdom of the writings of James Fintan Lalor, and the action which the Minister now takes under this new section is one in which he will have our support and co-operation.</P>
    <P>We have been advocating this line of action for a long time and it is only in recent weeks that a group supporting the Minister for Agriculture has been responsible for bringing about this great change.  Whether it was the Lemass group, the Smith group or the Haughey group, we appreciate their efforts and we hope, as a result of their efforts, there will be a change of heart on the part of the Land Commission and the Minister for Lands in relation to the purchase of land by aliens.  This is something which has our complete and entire approval.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the last three speakers, it occurs to me that Deputies on all sides of the House seem to be of one mind regarding the non-national or alien buying Irish land.  If I thought for one moment that the introduction of this Bill would not remedy this disaster, and I call it a disaster, I would be against it.  I am quite satisfied this Bill is a step in the right direction in that regard.  I feel also, and have no political bias in saying this, that this Bill was much maligned up and down the country heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I look around me in County Westmeath, with Deputy Dillon. Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Tully, I <Col N="1185" /> see large farms of land taken over not alone yearly but monthly and weekly, by people who are not Irish, or by people whose names are not Irish, people with names such as Prodinsky, Palm and Macklenberg.  It is time the Government woke up and introduced a Bill to stop this practice.  I was born and reared on the land on a small farm down in North Longford where the average valuation is £5.  I came to live in Westmeath later to farm on a larger scale, through my own endeavours, and to live in a part of Leinster where the holdings are larger.  But time and time again for the past three years, since I came to Dáil Éireann, I have gone to the various offices of the Land Commission, down the country and here in Dublin, and I have approached the Minister, about cases of what I would call real congestion.  I should like to inform the Minister, and I am sure he knows it as well as I do, that there is congestion in both Longford and Westmeath just as in the west of Ireland.  It is a sad reflection that while the congestion I mentioned exists, at the same time those people are coming into the country and, like the planters of old, they are not going into the bogs, the moors or the mountains but buy the best tracts of land available on the market.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to make.  Some of those in public life who derided the action of Irish auctioneers and agents and others and people who spoke from the housetops about this disaster, as I already called it, were some of the first to yield to the pressure of the people who came into this country with what I would call blood money.  As I said, I am entirely for the Bill if it stops that practice.  I have heard it debated by county councils, county committees of agriculture, in the Dáil and at other levels. We have provisions in the Bill which no good, sound farmer has any reason to fear.  Any farmer who works on his land, whether it be behind or before his house, has nothing to fear from this measure.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Tully and I know that the big tracts of valuable land in this country are in Westmeath, Meath and other such counties.  Deputy Flanagan <Col N="1186" /> last night asked the Minister about stud farms and I agree that by all means we should preserve them.  The bloodstock industry is one of our main sources of money from outside.  However, you have the position where Lord so-and-so comes in from Britain, France or Germany and buys a big tract of land.  He immediately puts up &ldquo;The Ballymacnanty Stud&rdquo; on the gate and he becomes an untouchable. How is the Minister to decide what is to be done about that?</P>
    <P>It does not matter very much to me whether the Minister for Lands is a member of Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, but I am glad to see all sides of the House agreeing on one aspect of this business, that nobody wants to see the land of Ireland going to foreigners for what I have described as blood money. Our land is too valuable and costs too much to be given away in that manner. This Bill will enable the Land Commission to take over large estates and divide them into 45-acre or 50-acre holdings on which to settle Irishmen, whether their names be Joyce, McManus or Sheridan.  If we succeed in doing that, we shall have done a good day's work for the country.  We shall be putting men and their families in a Christian way of life, on a sound footing, in a position where they will be of good to the community and, above all, where they will no longer be mendicants, deprived of all State services because they happen to have a few miserable acres of land.</P>
    <P>That is about all I have to say on the Bill.  As I stated at the beginning, if it stops the disaster we have been experiencing during the years I am all for it.  If I thought for one moment that it would penalise even one good, sound, practical farmer in any way, I would be entirely against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Dillon and Flanagan seemed to be very concerned about the Fianna Fáil convention in East Galway and the statement made at it by the present Minister for Agriculture. It was an important occasion because there were more than 600 men and women there from every part of that constituency, assembled to select Tom Hussey.  An occasion such as that, <Col N="1187" /> a democratic process held in the open to select a man in the ordinary way by public acclaim of his Party, constitutes a most fitting occasion for an announcement of that kind.  You could not make it in a back room in Dublin when the sole remaining member of Clann na Talmhan was selling out his late colleague's seat to the Fine Gael Party.  That would not have been a proper occasion for the making of such an announcement.  The Government have collective responsibility under the Constitution and this was a matter for the Government.  Each and every Minister is responsible for decisions in that Government.  It is the way this Government works.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon complains about my reception of the Bill he introduced in 1961 and tries to suggest that had that Bill been accepted, it would in some way have been effective to deal with the question of non-nationals acquiring land in this country.  The Bill was a very short one, very badly drafted, but my main comments on it were that it was a completely innocuous measure, that it would not make one acre of land available for the relief of congestion, that it would not materially strengthen the Land Commission procedure for the acquisition of land.</P>
      <P>That Bill called for a type of register to be established to keep track of dealings in land by non-nationals, without any enabling provisions, and completely overlooking the fact that we had established in that year under the Finance Act a statutory register to be kept by the Land Commission to record sales to non-nationals.  Let me repeat, because Deputy Flanagan keeps repeating untruths in the hope that if he keeps repeating them long enough, they will be believed outside, that there is a statutory register established under the Finance Act, of 1961, kept in the Land Commission and that in that register any dealings in land on which the 25 per cent stamp duty has been paid&mdash;purchases of land by aliens for industrial or non-industrial purposes&mdash;are kept under a law of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that register the amount of the transactions for non-industrial purposes <Col N="1188" /> has been running at between 6,000 and 7,000 acres a year.  There was a dramatic addition in the last year by virtue of the fact that a mountain down in North Mayo was purchased by a non-national.  It consisted of between 5,000 acres and 6,000 acres but the valuation of the land was twopence an acre.  That gives an indication of the wrong picture being painted as to the extent of the purchase of land by non-nationals.</P>
    <P>At all events, the figure has been running at approximately the same acreage, according to the Land Commission records, from 6,000 to 7,000 acres a year.  In some of these cases, there have been dealings in land acquired by one non-national and sold to another.  We shall have repetition of that at all times.  When we take into account the fact that we are supposed to have 12 million acres of arable land, the figure I have given will be a rough indication of the amount of these transactions.  Let me emphasise that while, outside the register, there are some suspicious cases, I am satisfied there could be no widespread evasion.  I suspect a few devices that may have been used.  I have appealed time and again to Deputies that if there was any particular case in which they had their suspicions to let me know, but except in one case I have had no reports from Deputies&mdash;even from Deputy Flanagan, who is so vocal on this matter and professes to know so much about it.</P>
    <P>I have said on numerous occasions that, if at any stage the Government felt further steps should be taken to deal with this matter, they would take such steps.  I would not follow the lines of the innocuous Bill introduced by Deputy Dillon in 1961.  From an administrative point of view, the Land Commission would be in a better position to keep full control of this issue than the Revenue Commissioners. Because of the machinery they have, they can make the control more effective. Deputy Flanagan said the horse had left the stable when the control was coming.  As I said, I have no evidence of any widespread evasion of the existing law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> Deputy Flanagan quoted Fintan Lalor at me.  I suggest he quote it at some members of the Fine Gael Executive, like Senator L'Estrange or ex-Senator John L. O'Sullivan of Cork, and some of these high officers of his own Party who were not averse to making a deal with non-nationals when they had land to sell.  That is the hypocrisy Deputy Flanagan is preaching.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made a point about the definition of a town.  As this section stands I think that needs looking into to see if the definition meets the purposes of this Bill.  Conceivably someone might claim certain lands were in a town for the purpose of avoiding this section when, in fact, they were not.  I wish the House to understand that I am moving this section on the basis of the known understanding of what a town is.  If I find, going through the law between now and Report Stage, that the section as it stands would not be effective, I will bring in a suitable amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully apparently misunderstands some of the provisions here. <i>In terrorem</i> penalties are being provided of up to £1,000 and up to three years' imprisonment for breaches of any portion of this section.  The Deputy asked what was this to somebody with a lot of money.  I think the prospect of three years in jail is poor comfort for any of these people.  The Deputy apparently does not understand that, in addition to these penalties, the purchase is rendered null and void by virtue of the fact that the Land <Col N="1190" /> Commission's consent was not sought before it went through.</P>

      <P>The way the section is put is that any of these people, who are not excepted people under the section, must have the prior consent of the Land Commission to their purchase.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <P>Subsection 2 (a) states:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding any other enactment or any rule of law, but subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection and to subsection (3) of this section, no interest in land to which this section applies shall become vested in a person who is not a qualified person except with the written consent (whether general or particular) of the Land Commission and subject to any conditions attached to the consent having been complied with. </P>
      <P>If he is not a qualified person, if he does not get the consent of the Land Commission, no interest in land to which the section applies vests in him. That means that without the consent of the Land Commission, land, or any interest in it, does not legally vest in the individual.  He is deprived of his title to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is satisfied that covers the point, that is all <Col N="1191" /> right with me, but it appears to me that it leaves the position so that the penalty imposed for non-compliance is a fine or imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may rest assured that in addition to the penalties provided, such an individual will find himself completely divested of his title to the land in question.  That is the legal position.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully said that I was rather scathing in dealing with his amendment. I have since re-read what I have said and I suggest he should re-read it also.  I think that if he does, he will be prepared to withdraw his remarks. He proposed that :</P>
      <P>No person or trust shall be permitted to purchase more than one hundred and fifty statute acres of arable land after the passing of this Act.  Non-nationals shall not be permitted to purchase more than ten statute acres of arable land except for industrial purposes. </P>
      <P>There were two legs to the Deputy's amendment and I devoted most of my opposition to the proposal limiting the ownership of land by one individual or trust to 150 acres.  I pointed out that any man with 150 acres should be able to live and rear a family on it but that you would have some cases where the wife or the son had other land.  I said that it was wrong to deal with the matter by attempting to ration land by putting in this overall limit on ownership.</P>
      <P>The instance I have just quoted is a typical example of how the Deputy's amendment would be unworkable. Here you have 5,000 or 7,000 acres, the valuation of which is 2d. an acre. That demonstrates that it would be impossible in practice to work out a system whereby there is an overall control on individual ownership of 150 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to reiterate that there is no evidence, as far as we know, of widespread evasion of the law except what we suspect in a few instances.  The changing of the form of control was decided on as being most desirable from the administrative point of view <Col N="1192" /> and more effective than the law as it stands which is being operated by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat on this section what I have said here on a number of occasions: if people are prepared to take the risk and deliberately sign false documents for the purpose of evading stamp duty, they may get away with it for a while.  Even under this section, if completely false statements are sworn, if people are prepared to go so far to evade the law, they may get away with it for a while but if they are caught, it will be a very serious and expensive business for them, both under this law and under the existing law.  I feel, however, that the acceptance of this section will stop the many wild allegations that are being made inside and outside the House about alleged foreign invasion.  When we ask those who make the allegations to give instances, we can get no evidence of this foreign invasion.  Here, under the Land Commission, we shall have an additional form of control and through our country inspectorate, we shall be in a better position to keep track of suspicious cases than the Department of Finance, under which the Revenue Commissioners operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister implies that he now realises that this is a matter which at all times should have been under the control of the Department of Lands rather than the Revenue Commissioners. He says the true dimensions of the problem should come to light through the instrumentality of the Land Commission and their field inspectors.  I could not agree more. That is exactly the view we expressed on the introduction of the 1961 Bill. On that occasion in volume 188, at column 1734, the Minister for Lands is on record as saying, while I was speaking on the Bill:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I interrupt ?  When explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill, I said that it is proposed the Revenue Commissioners will keep the Land Commission informed of purchases by non-national interests. In that way the Land Commission will be in a position to assemble the essential information.  Surely that <Col N="1193" /> will meet the purpose the Deputy has in mind quite effectively. </P>
    <P>I said it would not three years ago; the Minister for Lands says three years later that he has discovered it would not, and that it is much wiser to lay this duty squarely on the shoulders of the Land Commission.  That is the advantage of planning your progress. If you plan intelligently, you do not wait three years to learn these facts. You act in anticipation and then the problems you have to deal with very often do not arise.</P>
    <P>I think it important on occasions like this to call to mind that we are not the only country trying to deal with the problem of aliens buying agricultural land.  The purchase of agricultural land has been for many years prohibited in the Channel Islands; Switzerland has now prohibited the purchase of agricultural or building land by anybody; the great United States in many of its States require the sale of lands registered in foreign ownerships to American nationals. Quite apart from the actual legislative requirements, the feeling has grown so strong in many parts of the US against foreign ownership of land, that some very great corporations with vast tracts of land in these states have been constrained to sell them.  The same problem has given rise to a great deal of social unrest in many parts of South America and, indeed, I believe, in France.  We are concerned to avoid the development of a similar social problem in this country which we saw was coming, of which we warned the Government and at this eleventh hour, they now have proceeded to act upon our warning in the amendment produced for consideration by the Dáil today.</P>
    <P>I think it is interesting and requires to be further emphasised what Deputy Tully has said here today that after all the hullaballoo about the protracted debate that has taken place on the Land Bill, this fact stands out that if this Bill had not been subjected in Committee to the long and careful scrutiny to which it has been subjected, section 44 would never have seen the light of day.</P>
    <P>Section 44 was produced at the <Col N="1194" /> Fianna Fáil convention in East Galway and I think the Minister should acknowledge the debt he owes us for scrutinising this Bill as closely as we have.  We have succeeded in converting him to the point of persuading him to introduce this new section 44 and I do not yet despair that between now and the Final Stages of the Bill, we will persuade him to eradicate the detestable provision whereunder he seeks the power to inspect for acquisition the land of any man in the country on his own initiative without reference to the Land Commission and certain other features of the Bill to which we have made reference.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I want to say this: I understand the Minister's guilty reaction to the fact that of this radical alteration of his own Bill the first announcement was made at a convention in East Galway by somebody who was not the Minister for Lands but a Minister of another Department of State. That, naturally, produces an irascible reaction from the Minister for Lands but there is, I suggest, an important principle here at stake.  The practice of members of the Fianna Fáil Government presenting policy statements to dinners, dances, suppers and conventions and in a variety of venues outside the Oireachtas is a bad practice, and it is a bad practice for this reason: our whole system of Government is based upon free and open debate in this House, under great privilege which, I am sorry to say, is sometimes abused, but all the machinery of this House is designed to keep our people informed not only of the Government's view but of any legitimate comment upon that view.  If we are to continue the practice which Fianna Fáil have adopted of making announcements of radical changes in Fianna Fáil Government policy at dinners, dances, dog fights and social occasions of one kind or another or at Fianna Fáil conventions, these statements of policy are not subjected to the proper criticism, review and investigation to which they should be subjected for the information of the people, who are entitled to know the facts.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister for Lands that, while I understand his indignant <Col N="1195" /> attempt to justify the announcement of this amendment to his own Bill by another Minister at a Fianna Fáil convention, he would be well advised to urge on his colleagues that that practice should be dropped and that where the Government wish to submit new policy proposals for legislation, they ought to submit them first to Dáil Éireann and then, at their pleasure, in any other arena where they consider it proper to do so.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister proposes to look into the suggestion I have made to him for the technical correction of this amendment in regard to the word &ldquo;town&rdquo; and in regard to regulations, and I suggest to him that he should reflect on the fact that he is on record as saying here in the Official Reports of 1961 that he thought the Revenue Commissioners procedure was fully adequate to do all that was necessary. He has discovered three years too late that he was mistaken in that view.  I think&mdash;and I would like to put this on record&mdash;that if you deal with a problem of this kind in time, you can often use relatively mild legislative procedures because they act not only as a statutory control but as a clear warning to everybody of what the declared policy of the Oireachtas is.  If you allow these situations to develop until they constitute a real and serious social evil, you are often driven to the extreme of drafting extremely difficult complex legislative devices to control a situation which should never have been allowed to arise.  If in 1961 we had said: &ldquo;We are going to set up a register in the Land Commission.  If any alien buys land, however he does it, and fails to register all the facts with the Land Commission for review and consideration by them, no good title in the land will pass&rdquo;, I believe a great many transactions that have taken place and that have created considerable social upset in rural Ireland would never have taken place.  However, there is no use crying over split milk and it is better to act late than not to act at all.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government have come round to our point of view.  I <Col N="1196" /> am glad we are now in a position to place it on record for all who run to read that it is contrary to national policy that arable land should pass into the ownership of aliens and I think it is important to emphasise that in publicly recording that decision and giving everybody full notice of it, we are not acting exceptionally, that we are simply doing what a great many other countries have done when they found themselves confronted with the problem that now confronts us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish merely to make a couple of brief comments.  First of all, with reference to the place where the statement was made and by whom it was made, I want to place on record that I do not care, nor do my Party, if it was the secretary of one of the three-man cumainn, of the Minister's Party, a number of which operate in my constituency, providing the Minister is prepared to stand over it in this House.  If he is taking responsibility for it, it does not matter who made the statement.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the Minister was rather naive in his comment about the whole question of the purchase of land because he has spent most of his time here today talking about the evasion of stamp duty.  While I and other people speaking about this Bill over the past months did refer to what we consider to be an abuse and stated that we understood there were purchases of land on which the 25 per cent stamp duty was not paid, I want to make it clear that if there were 100 per cent stamp duty paid by everyone of the non-nationals who have come in to purchase land&mdash;and I am sure the Government would not object to that; it might be of extreme assistance to them at the present time in view of the figures for the balance of payments we have been hearing about over the past few days &mdash; we still believe it would be wrong to allow this racket to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, the Minister referred to the amendment which the Labour Party put in and which was debated in this House.  Again, he was rather naive because he referred only to one section of it and replied to one section of it <Col N="1197" /> here.  He, I understand, sincerely believed at that time and still believes that that portion of the amendment was wrong, that is, that a person should not be allowed to purchase an extra amount of land which would allow that person to have more than 150 acres.  We put that in because, if the Minister thinks of a 40 to 45 acre farm as a viable farm, it was a reasonable thing to expect that those who had got 150 acres should not be allowed to get more.  But he did not explain here why it was that at that period the Government did not decide, as they could have, to adopt the other two parts of the amendment, the first one limiting the amount of arable land which could be bought by aliens to ten acres in the event of its being purchased for the purpose of residence; and the second one providing that only land being acquired for industrial purposes could be bought by non-nationals.  Surely it could have been done then as it has been done now.</P>
    <P>Again, I think everybody who is interested in this problem will thank Dáil Éireann for the way in which they succeeded in holding this Bill and not allowing the various sections to go through until the Minister and his Government realised that some steps had to be taken.  They have taken them now and I hope they will be effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Deputy Dillon's proposal here in 1961, there was provision only for registering transactions in the Land Commission and, indeed, the way the Bill was framed the whole of Ireland could be bought by non-nationals so long as they reported to the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a drastic change of policy by the Government.  The Government decided long ago that there should be control in connection with these transactions and they provided that control under the Finance Act of 1961 under which these very severe penalties were provided for non-nationals purchasing agricultural land.  That decided the issue of control.  It provided also for the keeping of this statutory register <Col N="1198" /> by the Land Commission so that we would have an official account of each and every transaction of land purchased by non-nationals.  It was the first time that was done under the law of this House.  There were a number of checks made from time to time away back to the time Deputy Dillon was in Government but these checks were rough and ready affairs and they were ineffective.</P>
    <P>There was one check made, I remember, where the Guards were asked to report on cases where more than 100 acres of land were bought in different counties by non-nationals.  But there was no legal, official method of control until the Government decided under the Finance Act of 1961 to establish these controls and to establish for the first time this statutory register to be kept by the Land Commission in which is recorded from week to week or from month to month the various purchases of land by aliens, whether for industrial or other purposes.  Under that section certain aliens, can be exempted by a certificate from two of the Lay Commissioners of the Land Commission to the Minister for Finance allowing these people to pay the ordinary stamp duty in cases in which the Land Commission are not interested or in the case of what I describe as &ldquo;white elephant&rdquo; purchases.</P>
    <P>That is the law that is there.  This is simply extending that control or dealing with control by a different method.  The only real necessity for this is the allegations that have been made, although by people, as I say, who will not produce evidence, about the ways that have been found for avoiding the existing law.  It is difficult under a Finance Act to cover every conceivable type of evasion that could arise.  If Deputies will go to the trouble of re-reading all these many sections of the Finance Act of 1961 dealing with this question, they will see how wide the net was spread to cover all transactions.  However, I have been told from some source that some few people are avoiding the existing law.  Again, I am not in a position to say but I personally doubt whether the device they have been <Col N="1199" /> using is not a fraud and that they are not and may not be liable to be prosecuted under the existing law.  At all events, this section is more comprehensive in the sense&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes.

In that sense it is just an extension of the existing controls and it is more comprehensive and must accordingly be more effective than the provisions of the 1961 Finance Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 44:</P>
      <P>In page 19, before section 44, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>Section 17 of the Land Act, 1953, is hereby amended by the insertion, after &ldquo;registered owners&rdquo; in subsection (2), of &ldquo;or have become entitled to be registered as owners&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained in connection with section 20, I have sought to improve the provisions of the Land Acts relating to the exchange of holdings and especially those complex groups of exchanges <Col N="1200" /> which we call re-arrangements.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the present amendment is to ensure that the Land Commission will be able to re-allot and revest lands given up in exchange without waiting until they have themselves become registered as owners of such lands.  Deputies will appreciate that re-arrangement work would be intolerably slow if every step had to wait upon the noting by Land Registry of the changes brought about by the previous step.  It is usually important and often vital that the whole process of rearrangement in a townland should be carried through in one operation without waiting upon the less urgent, though admittedly important, work of adjusting the records to reflect the changes on the ground.  In practice, where a migrant is brought up, he is immediately vested in his new holding and he transfers the old one to the Land Commission who divide it among the allottees in the place he has left. It is necessary that this work should go ahead and the Land Commission could have been held up until the vesting took place.  That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>

    <P>The first seven items for repeal are associated with section 12 of the Bill. They represent the old system of subdivision control and they are explained in the memorandum circulated to Deputies.  In section 12 of the Bill, we have a new overall provision for the control of subdivision and subletting. There is a provision in the repeal Schedule for the demolition of the existing legal machinery and the first seven items in the Schedule represent the main body of the existing law.  A member of my own profession put it to me that I should take this opportunity to repeal a clause in the Irish <Col N="1201" /> Land (Provision for Sailors and Soldiers) Act, 1919, which deals with control of sales and subdivisions.  I am informed this provision did not apply to more than 360 holdings so that this is of no significance to the vast majority of landowners.  Nevertheless, it is an out-dated piece of legislation and it could cause annoyance and difficulties for solicitors who are dealing with these few odd cases. I propose accordingly that it be added to the list of items for repeal.</P>

      <P>(a)  The proprietor shall not without the consent of the Land Commission acquire by purchase any other holding for the purchase of which an advance has been made under the Land Purchase Acts if the amount of that advance then outstanding, when added to the amount of the advance or advances made in respect of the holding or holdings then held by the proprietor would exceed the sum of seven thousand pounds, and, if any proprietor acquires any holding in violation of this condition, the Land Commission may cause that holding to be sold.  </P>

      <P>In the first place, this was never workable; neither could I ever conceive it to be workable. Deputies can imagine the Land Commission trying to sell out some man under this section and going through the process of evicting him out of the farm.  It could be represented superficially as the demolition of an existing ban on the conglomeration of holdings, but that is not the case in practice.  No administration ever tried to keep track of all the transactions which might have led to technical breaches of this particular section.  There must have been no thought for the endless possibilities of evasion.  The penalty of selling them up was clearly unthinkable. The position would be that, if the Land Commission went down and followed up the two, three or four different holdings for the time being in the ownership of one landholder, they would find possibly that the land was bought with the intention of benefiting one or two sons; that was illegal under this particular section and the penalty provided was that the Land Commission had power to take one, or more, of these farms and eject the holder.  As I have said, I could not conceive of any administration trying to work this section; it is unworkable and unrealistic in this day and age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to increase to £30 million the aggregate amount of money available to An Foras Tionscal for grant purposes from the present limit of £20 million imposed by the Industrial Grants (Amendment) Act, 1963.  The increase in the aggregate sought is necessitated by the fact that as at 30th September, 1964, grant commitments of the order of £19,552,645 had been entered into out of the available total of £20 million; made up of £15,477,007 for new undertakings and £4,075,638 for the adaptation and/or enlargement of existing undertakings.</P>
      <P>The grants, totalling £15,477,007, which have been approved are in respect of 223 new undertakings, and, of these, 170 have commenced production. The building of factories has commenced in 14 instances, arrangements to commence building are being made in a further 17 cases and the remaining 22 are not yet in a position to proceed.  These 223 undertakings involve an estimated capital investment of £53,955,000 and additional employment of 30,630 workers.  The total amount of grants paid to 30th September, 1964 under the Industrial Grants and Undeveloped Areas Acts was £10,193,667.</P>
      <P>The House will be pleased to learn that the response to the Government's exhortations to firms to adopt measures to make themselves competitive and prepare for conditions of freer trading has been encouraging.  Applications from 362 firms for these special grants had been received up to 30th September, 1964 and, as already stated, grants amounting to £4,075,638 had been approved in 174 cases.  Payments actually made up to 30th September, 1964, represent a total of £885,741, which includes £39,855 paid to firms situated in undeveloped areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent events have highlighted the vital importance of measures by our industries to raise their efficiency and productivity and I propose to introduce <Col N="1206" /> for the consideration of the House an amendment of the Bill to extend by one year to 31st March, 1966, the statutory time limit for eligibility for adaptation grants.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that any industrialist who has so far failed to take advantage of the facility will have time to reconsider his outlook and to take the requisite steps to gear his industry to face any difficulties which have arisen or may arise in the future.  I also propose to introduce an amendment to authorise the making by An Foras Tionscal of special adaptation grants designed to help industries to meet the cost of any exceptional measures which they may find necessary in order to cope with the problems arising out of the application of the British import levy.</P>
    <P>Might I elaborate on that?  The purpose of this amendment will be to help industries which may now require to alter their machinery in order to provide for the manufacture of goods, the specifications for which, in markets alternative to the British market, are different from British specifications. An obvious example is electrical goods where a firm has been manufacturing solely or mainly for the British market and now require to seek markets in European countries, for example, and may require to adapt their plant.  I felt originally that the legislation as it stands would have covered such grants but I am advised that that is not so and hence I propose to introduce the amendment on Committee Stage to provide for it.</P>
    <P>I think that the House will agree that the general policy of providing industrial grants has fully justified itself.  Its success is reflected in the rapid increase in industrial exports and the steady rise in industrial employment in recent years.  Industrial exports rose from an annual value of £32.8 million in 1958 to £62.2 million in 1963.  The numbers at work in industry rose from 243,000 in 1958 to 274,000 in 1963. Portion of the growth rate envisaged in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is expected to be achieved by the establishment of new industries <Col N="1207" /> and it is necessary to have the means to provide financial encouragement towards this end.  This Bill, therefore, marks a further step in the implementation of the Government's industrial expansion programme.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House and look forward to its early passage through all Stages so that An Foras Tionscal can continue its valuable work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House will agree with the Minister's statement that the general policy of providing industrial grants has fully justified itself.  It is well to emphasise that statement because in the past when one of the Minister's predecessors, the late Deputy Norton, as Minister for Industry and Commerce originally introduced the first Industrial Grants Act in 1956, there was a good deal of criticism of the proposal by the present Taoiseach, then Deputy Lemass.  In fact, as the then Minister indicated, the Bill which was introduced fell short of the sum necessary to meet the demand placed on the funds available, and since then amending Bills have been introduced to provide sufficient capital both by way of grant and loan to assist industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that since the initiation of the industrial grants policy enshrined in the measure introduced by the late Deputy Norton as Minister for Industry and Commerce, there has been a <Col N="1208" /> general realisation that the policy behind that measure, and the subsequent measures which have been introduced, not merely justified the initial decision but, in fact, the demand for financial facilities has indeed exceeded probably the most optimistic anticipations which were held at the time.  I believe the assistance which has been provided for the establishment of new industries, as well as for the extension of existing industries, has undoubtedly contributed to the very substantial growth in industrial employment.</P>
    <P>There is no disagreement between members of the House on the contribution which industrial employment must make in providing new jobs for those seeking work, and for those who are obliged to leave employment in the rural areas, as well as for those reaching manhood or womanhood.  The growth in the past few years in the numbers in employment, as quoted by the Minister, indicates that the financial assistance which has been provided has justified itself.  It has certainly assisted in promoting an increase in exports, as well as an increase in employment, but in considering this measure, we must dwell on other aspects of the matter besides the actual development which has taken place.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> considerable stress was laid on the contribution which is expected from industry, and the figure published of the anticipated rise in industrial employment between now and 1970 is based on the assumption that industrial expansion will continue, and that those who are obliged for one reason or another to leave employment in the rural areas will be absorbed in industry.  In the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> it is estimated in paragraph 58 that: &ldquo;A net increase of 86,000 in the numbers employed in industry will require the creation of a much larger number of new jobs: new jobs will be needed for the workers now engaged in industry who will have to transfer to different employment as conditions become more competitive...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> That, I believe, is an easy way of saying that employment will have to be provided for those who find that because of developments either here or elsewhere they become disemployed, and that steps will have to be taken to train them, and make some provision for those who become redundant.  It is on that aspect of the matter that I want to get some further information from the Minister.</P>
    <P>It appears from the data published in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> that CIO, the Committee on Industrial Organisation, found that in many industries, buildings were unsuitable, procedures and equipment obsolete, direction and management unenterprising, operative training inadequate and the range of variety in production too wide.  Those are some of the defects which the CIO investigation found in considering the problem.  Since that report was published, we have had the recent imposition of the levy of 15 per cent by the British Government on imports from this country, as well as from other countries, of course.</P>
    <P>I believe it is not sufficiently realised by those involved in this problem or that it is certainly realised to an inadequate extent by industrialists or possibly by trade unionists that much more needs to be done, if re-adaptation and retraining are to be provided for at anything like the extent necessary for those who are disemployed or disemployed for a temporary period or who find that because of changes in demand and changes in production techniques, changes not merely in this country but changes effected elsewhere which will have an impact on our whole industrial structure the nature of their employment is affected to a greater or a lesser degree.  A far greater and more intensive effort must be made in order to retrain and re-equip, thereby ensuring that those already employed in industry will be retained in industrial employment even if they are obliged, because of these changes, to get employment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>One of the aspects of this matter that I believe requires consideration is the extent to which changes in location may be involved.  We can all understand <Col N="1210" /> that if a worker can get a job adjacent or in close proximity to his existing place of employment no great difficulty may arise, but if workers have to be retrained and re-employed elsewhere, while in the locality in which they are at present employed, then a whole variety of other problems will arise such as re-housing, schools and other consequential difficulties.  It is for these reasons that I believe this problem has got to be tackled in a much more energetic and indeed on a much more realistic basis by all concerned. To that extent, the fact that a levy has recently been imposed may operate to bring home to all concerned the need for urgency in this matter and the need for improved efficiency and techniques.</P>
    <P>The CIO reports went on to indicate that there was a far greater need and, indeed, great scope for improved efficiency.  It expressed the view that plant and machinery must be modernised, the organisation of work improved, modern techniques of management introduced and the level of technical skill raised.  It adverted to the fact that restrictive practices both by management and by labour should be removed as well as greater specialisation introduced.</P>
    <P>I notice from the Minister's speech that applications from 362 firms for special grants had been received.  From Questions in the House as well as comments elsewhere it would appear that certain advances have been made by some industries.  It is always a difficult question to decide whether to name special industries because of the reactions which comment may have on their success or otherwise but undoubtedly one of the outstanding achievements of adaptation efforts in the past few years has been that in the case of the boot and shoe industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to think, as I believe all Deputies would like to think, that the same initiative and the same drive and foresight which was associated with the moves made by the boot and shoe industry applied over a much wider field.  In fact, in an answer given here recently by the Minister to, I think, a query by Deputy Corish, it was obvious that in another industry <Col N="1211" /> where we might have expected a more enlightened approach the sense of urgency did not seem to be present to anything like the same extent.  I should be interested to hear from the Minister to what extent the Department and the various bodies connected with it has, by consultation and by discussions with the trade interests concerned, brought it home to the various representatives that time in this matter is not on their side.  To what extent have they been made to realise that it is imperative that immediate steps should be taken to widen the number of applications for adaptation grants?  It is imperative to instil a sense of urgency, a desire for a greater level of efficiency and a greater attention to the problems which will be created by the developments in Europe as well as by the immediate effects of the 15 per cent levy imposed by the British Government.</P>
    <P>It may be that one of the reasons for the lack of a sense of urgency in this matter is the fact that it now seems that there is no definite date likely so far as membership of the EEC is concerned.  When a matter of that sort loses momentum, it is difficult to keep up the belief that, although the target laid down is membership by 1970, because of what has happened it might be possible though it does not seem as likely as at one time it did. I was, therefore, interested to hear from the Taoiseach last week that the question is still the subject of consideration and that some alternative arrangement may be proposed.  I do not want to enlarge on that at the moment.  It is important that the sense of urgency which existed&mdash;to the extent that it appeared that membership was likely by a certain date&mdash;should still exist.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I believe it was wise not to proceed further with the proposed reduction in tariffs.  When membership was likely, it was a reasonable exercise to bring this country's tariff rate in line with that of member countries but the situation has changed.  Unless we can be certain of some <i>quid pro quo,</i> it has always seemed to me that we ought not to proceed further in that direction.  I am glad that the Government have decided <Col N="1212" /> not to proceed with the proposed further reductions on 1st January next. The estimated capital development in respect of the 223 undertakings mentioned by the Minister is very considerable and the additional employment provided of 30,000 workers is a welcome contribution to increased employment.  One of the facts which emerge from the statistics is that although there is a figure of a projected increase of 86,000 by 1970 the anticipated reduction in the numbers employed in agriculture must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>So far as I can see from a table in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> there is an anticipated drop, according to Table 2, between now and 1970, of those employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing of 66,000. Although there is an anticipated increase of 86,000 in those employed the other figure must be taken into account.  While those figures are based on a variety of assumptions it is well to recall that, despite the rise in industrial employment in the last few years, there are still over 70,000 fewer employed in the country than were employed in 1956, when Deputy Norton introduced the first Industrial Grants Bill.  It seems to me, although industrial expansion has increased substantially, it has not yet come to the stage when it is having an effect to the extent that it increases the total number in employment.</P>
    <P>I believe all economists agree that with the changes in agricultural technique, the utilisation of machinery and other modern methods, as well as the general trend, which is not confined to this country, the continued flight from rural employment shows no sign of abatement.  In fact, industrial expansion and industrial employment must increase substantially if those who have hitherto been employed in rural occupations are to get jobs elsewhere in the country without taking account of those who, in the years ahead, will reach adult age.</P>
    <P>The need to plan for industrial exports is equally important.  One of the matters which has been the subject of consideration by the various <Col N="1213" /> committees is again emphasised in the report, published today, of the National Industrial Economic Council, where emphasis is laid on the need to develop exports.  Whilst it is important to encourage in every way possible the Buy Irish campaign that only deals with one aspect of the problem.  If we are to maintain our trading position and increase the prospects of improved trading conditions, as well as offset our balance of payments problem, we must plan for increased industrial exports.  That is the key not merely to economic prosperity and economic improvement but it is also the key to increased employment in industry.</P>
    <P>I believe, for these reasons, that the measures which are proposed in respect of tax relief will assist in that direction.  Reference has often been made here to the opinion expressed by Professor Carter of Queen's University, Belfast, who said the tax relief in exports was the biggest technical factor in the expansion which has occurred in exports.  Today, it is proposed to extend that relief and to encourage still further the development of exports and assist those concerned in them.  I believe that the extension of the maximum permitted under the proposed Bill will assist further in the development of industrial expansion but I believe it is important, from the national point of view, that industrialists, management and trade unions should combine and co-operate with the Government.  The various agencies and those dealing with this problem should ensure that this is approached on the basis that the interests of all depend on national co-operation and on the realisation that the welfare not only of those directly concerned in industry, whether it is management or workers, but the welfare of the nation demands that that co-operation be extended over as wide a sphere as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which makes available, so to speak, a maximum of £30 million for the purpose of industrial grants.  It appears to me to be a formidable amount.  While I have no objection at all to giving the <Col N="1214" /> Minister the Bill and approving of the idea of making industrial grants, what we should be concerned about is the manner in which these grants are applied and the use which is made of them for the greater benefit of the economy.  It is very important to ensure that Irishmen and Irishwomen will obtain employment in their own country.</P>
      <P>This is a short Bill in its format, which merely extends the limit of the amount of the grants to £30 million. There is no alteration in the administration of the grants.  Two years ago we did have some changes made, that is, in the Act of 1962.  In that particular Act, there was a further extension of the grants to areas outside of what were scheduled as the undeveloped areas.  There was an extension of the £250,000 to one-third of the cost of the fixed assets to be given in the undeveloped areas.  The same grants could be applied in other areas under the same conditions with two very important provisos: (1) that there were sound economic reasons why the industry could not be established within the undeveloped areas and (2) that there were other exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose many areas could plead exceptional circumstances in an application for the type of grant I have described.  I assume that exceptional circumstances would be circumstances of unemployment or of emigration. There always has been a case for the development, as such, of industry in the undeveloped areas and in the rural areas generally but a case can also be made for certain of the areas outside the undeveloped areas.  While we welcomed an extension of the grant to parts of the country other than undeveloped areas two years ago, I do not believe it serves the purpose which the Minister intended and which the House hoped it might serve. The Minister will appreciate it is very difficult for an area that has the possibility of an industry being established therein to say to a foreign industrialist, for example: &ldquo;You will get this grant.&rdquo;  In the undeveloped area, they can say positively that this <Col N="1215" /> grant is available, but the application of grant outside the undeveloped areas is conditional and must be submitted to An Foras Tionscal before there is a final decision.  From my experience, industrialists who come to this country want quick decisions and many of them are not prepared to do business with any town, village or city outside the undeveloped areas when they are told that they may get the grant or they may not get the grant. In the undeveloped areas, the people who are interested in the establishment of an industry say: &ldquo;Yes, you will get A, B, C or D.&rdquo;  That is a good thing.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms I have of this system of industrial grants is what I consider a wrong description.  I do not think &ldquo;undeveloped areas&rdquo; is the proper title for those which are, say, west of the Shannon, or even for any part of the country.  I think the Minister should decide to change the title of that particular Act and change that term to &ldquo;development areas&rdquo;.  It must be recognised that there are areas which need to be developed.  They could not strictly be called developed areas but they are areas that are capable of development.  I suppose one can say that all the area west of the Shannon needs to be developed to a greater extent than in recent years. But in the other areas in the east and south and midlands, whilst they have benefited overall, it is also true to say that there are many towns which have not had the advantage of this industrial development.</P>
    <P>I do not want to weary the House with examples, but the example I give is the one I know best, that is, the County Wexford area, in the matter of industrial development.  It is recognised in statistics published from time to time as a county which suffered greatly from emigration during and after the War.  It has a special problem in the matter of the flight from the land.  County Wexford has by far the greatest proportion of agricultural workers and, again, it has been recognised that employment in the agricultural industry for agricultural workers has decreased very <Col N="1216" /> rapidly over the years.  In that particular matter, they have a very special problem.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect I should like to mention.  Whilst unemployment figures for a place like County Wexford are not shown by the employment exchange, they are shown under emigration because when a man on any part of the east coast, or in Dublin or the midlands, becomes unemployed, it is a relatively simple matter for him to emigrate.  Therefore, one should not take the unemployment figures as such because when a man or woman becomes unemployed in certain areas of the country, the facilities are fortunately, or unfortunately, easy for them in the matter of emigration.</P>
    <P>I am trying to impress upon the Minister and the House my original suggestion that we should approach the industrialisation of this country from the point of view of the ability to develop industry in certain areas.  The main towns of County Wexford&mdash; Enniscorthy, Gorey, Wexford and New Ross&mdash;have not participated in this industrial drive.  I do not think the people there are any different from those in any of the other counties in the Provinces.  I think it is true to say that in four of these towns the local people have made efforts towards industrialisation but these efforts have not been successful in that, apart from New Ross, the three towns, Wexford, Enniscorthy and Gorey, have not had new industries established over the past five or ten years.  In one particular area in Enniscorthy, several attempts were made and it seemed that some industries would be lined up, but whatever happened&mdash;and I certainly do not know&mdash;the industries were not established.</P>
    <P>I think a place like Wexford town, because it is capable of development, ought to be given special attention.  It is certainly not an undeveloped area in that it has many thriving industries, but it has lost its population.  It is capable of development in that it has all the facilities and amenities and, above all, it has the skilled labour.  A town such as that should be compensated in some way for the loss of its harbour, whether <Col N="1217" /> that was the fault of this Government, the last Government or Governments during the past 15 or 20 years.  The fact is the harbour is gone and, to maintain the population there, the Minister, if he decides to develop areas like this all over the country, should give special attention to them by reason of what they have to offer.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak on the broader aspects of this Bill.  The Minister has referred to adaptation grants.  These adaptation grants were introduced some time ago as an encouragement to industry in this country to prepare itself for membership of the EEC, or for some sort of free trade throughout Europe or throughout the whole world.  The Minister, in his Bill of 1962, offered 25 per cent of the cost for schemes of enlargement or for the adaptation of industrial undertakings, for plant, equipment and buildings.  In his speech today, he does not seem to be too worried about the fact, which he mentions, that for these adaptation grants, he had applications from only 362 firms.</P>
    <P>I referred to this last week in the discussion on the 15 per cent surcharge and I said I thought it was a great reflection on Irish industry to say that only 362 firms, out of a total of 4,000, had shown any keen desire to make the necessary changes in order to gear up their industries for free trade, which the Taoiseach tells us is coming in 1970, or perhaps before that.  I do not think the Minister gave the House enough information.  I believe, therefore, in his reply, without mentioning any specific names, it is his duty to tell the House and the country what type of industries are included in these 362 firms that have applied for adaptation grants and, above all, how many workers are involved.  Perhaps these 362 firms are the biggest of the 4,000 odd industries we have in the country; perhaps they are the smallest.  But what we are concerned with is what Irish industrialists who are offered these grants are doing to keep their industries alive and above all to keep their workers employed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has confirmed the figure I guessed at last week when he said approximately 4,000 firms could <Col N="1218" /> have availed themselves of these adaptation grants, which were to be available up to the end of this year.  Now, the position we find ourselves in is that only 362 firms out of the 4,000 have decided to avail themselves of what we consider to be this very generous offer.  The Minister must indeed be very disappointed, certainly not encouraged, by this inaction of Irish industrialists.  He has decided, 15 per cent British surcharge or not, that these grants will be extended to 31st March, 1966.</P>
    <P>We all, I think, share Deputy Cosgrave's sentiments when he inferred that this surcharge may be&mdash;in my opinion, it definitely should be&mdash;a warning to Irish industry that if it does not pull up its socks, if it does not decide to get up to date, to re-equip, to change its methods, it, and indeed the Irish economy as a whole, will be left very far behind.</P>
    <P>This is a formidable bill, one of £30 million to be paid over many years, and I do not think that the review one would expect of Irish industry, when the Minister comes to the House for an extra £10 million, should be only the contents of two pages of foolscap.  I asked the Minister certain questions last week with regard to the report of An Foras Tionscal in an endeavour to get information from him as to how many adaptation councils had been established.  He could not give it to me.  He said it was not the function of An Foras Tionscal to give this information.</P>
    <P>I submit there is an obligation on the Minister to tell the Irish taxpayer, and in particular the members of this House, on an occasion such as this, everything there is to be known about industry, including the number of men at work and their prospects in future years.  The Minister has not said a word about what progress there has been in rationalisation.  Last week, when questioned about the motor assembly industry, he confessed to the House that out of 15 firms, only one had applied for an adaptation grant.</P>
    <P>We are concerned about the workers.  One of the reports of the Committee on Industrial Organisation <Col N="1219" /> stated that in the event of free trade, practically all these workers would be rendered unemployed.  No matter what progress Irish industry may be making, thousands of those workers, if that situation occurs, will be rendered unemployed and there will not be any alternative employment for them.</P>
    <P>There is a Buy Irish campaign to which we all subscribe.  I do not think Irish industry should again fall into the trap, so to speak, of assuming that a Buy Irish campaign and consequent greater sales on the home market will be an answer to their problems or to those of the nation.  They must still make efforts to ensure that the foreign markets are preserved, because, again as Deputy Cosgrave emphasised, the home market alone will not solve the economic and industrial problems we have at the present time.</P>
    <P>I should prefer to see industry in this country in the main established by Irish people with Irish money.  The people of any city, town or village where there are prospects of industries being established by Germans, Turks, Britons, Greeks or Americans, would welcome the idea, but more emphasis should be placed on the establishment of industries by Irish people with Irish money.  The information we have been given in the recent report of An Foras Tionscal shows that the emphasis is not on the establishment of industry by Irish people with Irish capital but that there is a preponderance of foreigners.  The Minister should make some comment on that.</P>
    <P>All we in the House have got is the information contained in this report. I feel sure the Minister has much more information and figures than those given in the report.  Since the Industrial Grants Act was introduced and brought into operation, the report discloses that the total grants paid up to 31st March of this year amounted to £8½ million.  Of that, German industrialists got 25 per cent for 30 industries, British industrialists got 17½ per cent for 25 industries, United States industrialists got 8 per cent for 13 industries, Potez and Verolme got <Col N="1220" /> 17½ per cent of the £8½ million and Irish industrialists, in respect of 75 industries, got 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not feel happy about that type of balance.  There were 75 Irish firms involved and they must be relatively small if they could command only 25 per cent of the grants while 30 German firms got a similar proportion.  I believe the State, through the Government, must make greater efforts to see that more industries are started here with Irish capital.</P>
    <P>It seems obvious that with the generous grants and the equally generous loan facilities available, far too few Irish industrialists, or those living in Ireland who have money, are prepared to invest here in industry. Perhaps it is not possible for them to establish the type of industry that would last and give valuable employment, but I believe it is the function of the Government to establish industries. They have done it successfully during recent years and I mention the Irish Sugar Company as an example, particularly the recent extension into food processing.</P>
    <P>I suggest we could engage much more in this branch of industry.  The British 15 per cent surcharge does not include foodstuffs.  Therefore, in present circumstances, if we wish to build up a market in Britain not subject to the surcharge, there is no better way to do it than in extending our efforts in the canning of food and its export. I would therefore urge on the Government to use our natural resources, our agricultural produce to ensure an expansion of our exports and in an endeavour to get a permanent market in Britain for processed foods.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister was fair to the House in that he did not give full information, which must be available to him, in the matter of employment. Over the last number of years, the Minister for industry and Commerce in particular has had the task or the honour, whichever you like to call it, of opening new factories.  We are frequently told that this is an industry in which so many thousand pounds have been invested, that it will employ 30 people at the beginning and <Col N="1221" /> after ten years will have reached the maximum employment figure of 500 men.  We have never had a review of such forecasts.  How have such forecasts worked out?  The Minister has a responsibility to the House to justify the expenditure of this £30 million by placing it against the number employed in the industries.  He should be able to say whether these forecasts of projected employment have been realised or not, whether there is a likelihood that after a few years in operation, the maximum employment figure will be realised.</P>
    <P>The report for the year ended 31st March, 1963, estimated that the total investment, that is, the investment by the Government, by foreigners and by our own people, was £43.7 million. It was also estimated that when these industries were in full employment, they would employ 26,310.  The report for the year ended 31st March, 1964, states that a total of £48.1 million will have been invested by the Government, by foreigners and by Irish nationals and that employment will be provided for 28,040.  The difference in investment, therefore, is £4.4 millions for an increase in employment of 1,730.  That seems to be a formidable expenditure for the employment of a mere 1,730 people.  That is one of the reasons why I say the Minister in looking for this extra money should leave no doubt in the minds of the people that it is being well spent and applied in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> forecasts that we will get something like 7,800 new jobs by the year 1970.  That figure will not be nearly enough to meet the needs for employment here at that time.  Deputy Cosgrave and others have referred to the fact that against that figure must be placed the rural depopulation which is taking place.  Whether we like it or not&mdash;and we do not like it&mdash;the flight from the land continues.  It varies from year to year but, in any event, it seems clear there still will be people who will become unemployed on the land and who can only look to the establishment of Irish industry for their employment.</P>
    <P>There is also another factor that has <Col N="1222" /> not been mentioned, that is, the numbers who are at present employed in the building industry and who may not be employed in it in 1970.  I would hope that everybody employed in that industry now would be employed in it in 1970.  But we are hoping&mdash;maybe it is a false hope&mdash;that the housing programme will be completed long before 1970.  At least, we are hoping that the bulk of the houses now required will be completed by 1970. Therefore, we will have a problem on our hands.  Builders' labourers and even skilled craftsmen will not be able to find employment in Dublin or elsewhere. The figure mentioned in the Second Programme for the number of new jobs by 1970 is not realistic and certainly will not provide the need that undoubtedly will be there in 1970.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to giving the Minister this Bill but I think he does himself a disservice&mdash;certainly he does the country a disservice&mdash;if he does not give a more detailed review of Irish industry and tell us what steps the Government intend to take if Irish industry, now offered assistance to adapt itself to free trade, does not avail of that assistance.  He should also tell us what it is proposed to do for the workers, in the matter of retraining and severance pay, who find themselves rendered unemployed by the negligence of some of our Irish industrialists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to granting this sum to An Foras Tionscal but I should like to have some assurance that this money, which comes out of the taxpayers' pockets, will be spent wisely and providently and will not be poured down the drain. That is something that can easily happen to public money.  It has been said here that Irish industrialists have not been getting a fair share of the cake.  I do not know how true or otherwise that is.  I do not mind who sets up the factories so long as they are set up and our people are given employment.  Even if these factories were not paying, in the last analysis, it would still be better to give employment to our people even at some loss, and put them on their feet rather than <Col N="1223" /> have them drawing the dole or other State subvention.  It would also be better to have them employed in this country, even by foreigners, than to have them seek employment outside, where again they would be employed by foreigners.</P>
      <P>Irish industrialists are not the best in the world to speculate; if they were, their industries could be far more remunerative and could give greatly increased employment.  One need only look at the distilleries; if they changed their traditional methods they could probably capture the whiskey markets of the world and not only employ many more people but give much extra money to our farmers.  They will not do that.  It is unfortunate that up to recently we had not got technical knowhow.  Only comparatively recently have we gone ahead towards the position in which we can begin to compete with other countries. We were not particularly mechanically-minded within our own country although when we went abroad we proved more than a match for others. Only comparatively recently have we begun to catch up with the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Any efforts the Government make to ensure that we shall go forward in industrialisation are efforts worth making. Governments have been accused of selling our goods more or less in one basket to England.  There is some truth in that but if the present Government were not in office there would be no goods to sell: we would still be exporting a crowd of people and a few cattle. The present Government have been making honest efforts to improve our position.  They have not been going forward as rapidly as I should like but I must say in honesty they are the only Government that made an effort towards industrialisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noticed recently&mdash;I hope I am not right in this&mdash;that the emphasis that was on industrialisation of the west some years ago has now practically disappeared.  For every factory set up in the west today there must be ten set up in other places.  Perhaps people <Col N="1224" /> sincerely believe Shannon Airport is in the west; they should have second thoughts.  If something is not done to provide employment in the west we shall be in a very unhappy position in the not too distant future.  The whole emphasis now appears to be on bringing people into the cities and big towns but when we reach the point when the people will be in the cities and towns we shall have lost our identity as a nation.  It would be far better that an industry should employ even 25 people in Belmullet, with another in Crossmolina and Swinford and Charlestown than to have one industry here or in Cork employing 500.  We are being unrealistic and making idiots of ourselves.  We are subsidising the Irish language which should be subsidised; we are pretending that we want to retain Irish culture and at the same time we are going miles out of the way to sabotage the efforts to retain our language and culture.</P>
    <P>I hope some of the £30 million which will be voted by the House will be used to retain our native culture along the west coast but there is only one way to do that and it is to provide employment for the people there.  Unfortunately, that employment is not being given as it should and could be given. I am certain, that no matter what Minister comes in and asks for extra money to improve the position of the people in the west he will get it.  Last week the Taoiseach himself came here to deal with the question of the 15 per cent levy on Irish exports and there was no trouble in meeting his requirements. But the people who will get that money from the Irish taxpayer are, generally speaking, not people from the west but some big shots in Dublin, Cork or Limerick.</P>
    <P>It is long overdue that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and other Ministers should take stock of what is happening and instead of allowing our people to go from the western coastal areas, they should do something to keep them there.  I have no doubt that some fake companies are getting Government grants.  That is something that must be guarded against.  If somebody wants to bring in Japanese toys and paint them green instead of red that <Col N="1225" /> should not be tolerated but some firms operating today under Government grants are doing little more than something of that type.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful that in 1964 we should still be importing lanterns from Hong Kong and toys from Tokyo or somewhere near it.  Before any more millions are spent&mdash;perhaps I should say misspent&mdash;an effort should be made to stop this nonsense.  The Japanese do not take any of our people and employ them and it is time we learned that. Italians or Germans will not take our people unless they want slave labour; we know the offers they made to them. It is time to deal properly with this matter and I cannot see how anybody can adopt the attitude that just because an article is made outside the country it is superior to one made at home.  I never bought an article made outside that could be made in this country and I have always asked people to buy Irish goods.  I see no reason why we should buy foreign goods when we can get a much superior article made by our own people.</P>
    <P>There may be some excuse for buying British or even American goods because Britain and America employ our own people but when you go outside those countries there is no excuse and it is time the Government took drastic action to change the attitude of some of our industrialists and other people who have no respect for our Irish consumers and decide to bring in any type of trash and foist it on us very often at high prices.</P>
    <P>There is another big factor affecting the whole framework of Irish industry, that is, the fact that we have neglected to use our own native products as the basis of our industries.  We are mainly an agricultural country.  I honestly believe that Meath alone, if properly tilled, would easily feed the whole of Ireland but, unfortunately, as we all know, Meath is not properly tilled and, evidently, the people in Meath have no intention of tilling that county properly as long as they can get away the soft way.  There is no reason in the world why agricultural production in this country could not be increased by 1,000 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about agriculture.  I am talking about industrialisation but I say that agriculture should be the basis of our industrial expansion.  One of our big mistakes is, and always has been, that we have failed most lamentably to use agriculture as the basis of our industrial development.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that this £30 million should be used for what I call the feather-bedding of industrialists.  Some industrialists try to get us to believe that they are heading for the county home.  Annual reports from their firms do not seem to indicate that at all but seem to indicate the very opposite, that year in year out they are making colossal and increasing profits.  An eye should be kept on these profits and before any money by way of grant or loan should be allocated to any industry of any description there should be some way of checking the profits of that industry.</P>
      <P>We all know how accounts can be juggled.  It appears rather remarkable that it is only in the case of State-sponsored companies that we see losses.  I do not know exactly what the reason is but I have my own suspicions. It appears to me to be rather unusual that ordinary private companies and firms always show increasing profits but State-sponsored companies nearly always show losses or send their representatives in before us looking for more money by way of either grant or loan.  There appears to be something peculiar about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are rumours in the air at the moment, for instance, that the Irish Sugar Company is practically bankrupt. Whether that is true or not, I do not know, but the people of Carlow happen to be in a rather unhappy position at the moment and whether their guess is as good as mine or whether mine is as good as theirs, I cannot say.  I should like the Minister to clear that up before he finishes with this matter because if a company like the Irish Sugar Company happens to be in financial trouble, it will be a very <Col N="1227" /> serious matter.  Certainly, I would prefer to see the Irish Sugar Company getting soft money from us than to see people like Verolme of Cork or any foreign firm getting it.</P>
    <P>It is a peculiar situation, rather extraordinary, that ordinary privately-owned firms can make colossal profits and at the same time the State-sponsored companies appear to be in trouble.  There is no valid reason at all for that.  Where a State-sponsored company is established every effort should be made to obtain the best type of executives, technicians and other important personnel for that type of company and just because some fellow was out in 1920 or in 1916 or was in the Boer War should be no excuse for employing him.</P>
    <P>A Buy Irish campaign is started. Why should it start?  Why should we buy anything other than Irish?  What kind of people are we?  Where the Government provide the main incentive for industry they should take steps to insist, compulsorily if necessary, that the people bought Irish.  There should be no question about it.  It should not be necessary today to ask us to buy Irish.  If we do not buy Irish voluntarily, we should be compelled to buy Irish and it would be the first proper type of compulsion introduced in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to know whether the document produced by the Government is produced out of insolence for the House or whether it is the product of a very stupid man who does not really know the measure of his personal responsibility.  We are asked in it to spend a total of £30 million and this money is to be a further hand-out to Irish industry as it is at present organised.  At a time like this, when we are at the greatest and most significant phase of industrial development since the first industrial revolution, with the likelihood of increased mechanisation and its social and economic impacts on every society, it is regrettable that the Minister should come in with this completely inadequate document and make no case whatever, make no attempt to <Col N="1228" /> provide a case, for the continuation of our present attitude to industry as organised here.</P>
      <P>In page 2 of his speech the Minister uses the phrase, &ldquo;I think the House will agree that the general policy of providing industrial grants has fully justified itself.&rdquo;  I thing the direct contrary is true.  I do not think the general policy of providing industrial grants has fully justified itself.  Possibly we are at cross purposes.  Possibly the present position of our society is such that the Minister thinks that its reliance on private enterprise capitalism since the State was formed, pretty well exclusively for this type of industry and investment in industry, has been justified, even though there are the monumental failures to be seen on all sides, in the social and economic consequences, in the standard of education, in the standard of health services, in the standard of the care for old people, in the general level of production, the general level of employment and of emigration.  All of this stems from the failure of the industrial policy initiated in the twenties and given its added dynamism by the Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, in the thirties.  Nobody objects to people making mistakes.  Everybody does; it is human, but it is completely unforgivable for the Government, at this time in our history, with the developments in Europe, with the prospect of European free trade and all the other prospects before us, to continue to refuse to learn from the grave errors in judgment that have been made in the past.</P>
      <P>As recently as yesterday we find the Taoiseach coming around to an idea which time after time he rejected. When I questioned him here about the possibility of going into the European Economic Community as an associate member rather than as a full member, his answer was: &ldquo;No, we are interested only in full membership.&rdquo;  Now we can see there is a fundamental change in outlook and the suggestion made many years ago, when the idea was first mooted, that Irish industry was not ready for full membership is completely justified by events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> I do not know of any count on which Irish industry has justified itself over the past 30 years, in particular, in which it has been given its head, every possible encouragement, by the man who fervently believed in it, the Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In regard to any aspect of our society, social services, employment, emigration, it is the responsibility of the industrial arm in a community to create the wealth whereby society can provide for these. We have seen year after year the failure of Irish industry to perform its first function, that is, to provide well-paid employment.</P>
    <P>Most of us know that quite a large number of the factories established are fiddling industries or subsidiaries of British, German, Japanese and other companies and that they employ to a very considerable extent child labour, young boy labour.  My facts are based on the Economic Research Institute reports on wages, salaries, prices and industry generally, all authenticated by competent economists.  They say that our wage rates here are anything between 20 and 30 per cent of the European averages.</P>
    <P>How has Irish industry justified itself?  It has failed to provide full employment. There is a constant figure of between 8 and 10 per cent unemployed since the State was founded, in addition to the fact that an annual average of 16,000 emigrants has gone up to something like 40,000 or 50,000.  This recent so-called economic resurgence under the Taoiseach is one of the greatest confidence tricks of our time. The Taoiseach has been there as Minister for Industry and Commerce since 1932.  He is not a neophyte in this business.  He has been in charge of industry for 30 years.  Who stopped him bringing about this great resurgence, if it is a genuine one, in Irish industry, if it is not a completely fraudulent one as I believe it to be, based to a considerable extent on funk money of one kind or another coming from Britain and many other countries where they cannot get labour?</P>
    <P>While the constant figure for unemployment has been between eight <Col N="1230" /> and ten per cent, since the so-called resurgence under the Taoiseach as Minister for Industry and Commerce there has been a mere increase of some thing in the region of 6,000 a year in the jobs created in industry.  That is certainly an improvement on the earlier record mentioned in the Commission on Emigration report in which the new jobs creation is about 800.  The figure is 6,000 but with the natural increase in population of approximately 20,000, what happens to the 14,000?</P>
    <P>We debated last night what the unemployed get, a couple of pounds if they are married with a family.  Obviously the intention is to starve them out to Great Britain.  Many of them went there hungry and Britain fed them.  That is the policy which the Minister for Industry and Commerce says is fully justified, the best part of 250,000 people filing up the gangways of our ships, British ships in fact, to go to Britain to be fed because Irish industry will not provide them with jobs.</P>
    <P>Surely that is a failure of industry organised under these circumstances which even the Minister and the Taoiseach cannot afford to continue to ignore.  Under this new document, the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> the position is virtually the same.  The emphasis is exactly the same.  The whole emphasis is materialistic with emphasis on stock, goods, exports or anything you like.  It has nothing to do with humanity, with the provision of employment.</P>
    <P>We shall continue to have a minimum increase of 20,000 persons coming on to the labour market between now and 1970.  All we are concerned about is increasing the gross national product by about 4 per cent.  There is no question of increasing the job opportunities by a number sufficient to provide jobs for that 20,000.  We accept with complete complacency the fact that the job increase will be something like three-quarters of one per cent between now and 1970, that is, about 8,000 jobs, which will leave at least 12,000 people unemployed between now and 1970, that is, 80,000 or 90,000 people for whom nobody will provide work, in addition to between 40,000 and 50,000 people who are currently unemployed. <Col N="1231" /> There will be 120,000 unemployed persons and it is proposed to do nothing at all about them except to continue to support industry which has failed in the past and in respect of which we now have, on the assurance of the Government, a guarantee that it will continue to fail in the future.</P>
    <P>It is particularly cavalier of the Minister to come here today and ignore the realities implicit in his own introductory speech contained in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> We find that even the people who are employed are employed in industries in which they are ill-paid. Figures are available to show that the wage rates paid are considerably lower than the wage rates paid in Europe. Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take <Col N="1242" /> Questions Nos. 22 and 23 together. Under the Double Income Tax Agreement between Ireland and Great Britain, a person resident in Ireland but not resident in Great Britain for a particular year may claim repayment of British income tax deducted at the source from British dividends.  The available information seems to show that this Agreement will not be affected before April, 1966.  The British proposals will not be known in detail until after the British Budget of 1965; and so it is not possible at this stage to say precisely how Irish shareholders in British companies may be affected by the proposed changes, nor can there be any question at this stage of entering into negotiations for a new double taxation agreement.  An approach on the subject, however, has already been made to the British authorities.</P>

As the Deputy is aware, valuable State facilities and incentives are available to encourage the establishment and development of industries in all areas.  It is for private enterprise to take advantage of these inducements and local interests have done and can do much to encourage private enterprise to set up industries in their own districts.  Needless to say, any sound proposal formulated by local or other interests for the setting up of industry in any area is afforded all the assistance within my power.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 33, 34 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the particular circumstances which influenced the Corporation in giving permission for this development were&mdash;</P>
      <P> 1.  That the site was in an area zoned in the draft planning scheme for industry.</P>
      <P>2.  That the former use of the site was industrial, the premises being used as a rope making works.</P>
      <P>3.  That the detailed description of the wet-process proposed to be carried out and the provisions to be incorporated in the plant for suppression of dust indicated that dust nuisance need not be anticipated.</P>
      <P>4.  That the development was in no way inconsistent with the provisions of the draft planning scheme.  </P>
      <P>In connection with the application, the Chief Medical Officer advised that he &ldquo;did not think that the site was suitable for a process which was liable to interfere with the amenities of the houses facing Gordon Street.&rdquo;  Apart from a suggestion that the development would diminish the light to the rear of these houses, his report did not indicate any specific objection on the grounds of danger to health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In correspondence with the City Planning Officer subsequent to the grant of the permission, the Chief Medical Officer stated that in a similar situation there had been some nuisance from noise and greater nuisance from dust and, although the latter had been diminished by use of the wet process, it had not been eliminated.  On the <Col N="1248" /> 17th November, 1964, he expressed the opinion that unless the works were extraordinarily effective, nuisance from dust would arise but as there were no plants in the city or suburbs which were similar to that proposed at South Lotts Road, he was unable to judge to what extent possible nuisance from noise or dust might arise.</P>
    <P>I think that I should add that Road-stone Limited, in a memorandum submitted to the Corporation on the 17th November, 1964, stated as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We guarantee that there will be no escape of cement dust.  On the subject of noise... the noise level will be much lower than the normal noise of traffic in the area.  The factory will be in operation during the ordinary hours worked in the building trade.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>After work had commenced on the site, the Corporation received complaints from local residents in connection with the proposed development and I am informed that these complaints have been considered by the Planning and Development Committee of the Corporation.  I have not been informed as to what action, if any, the Corporation may take as a result of these complaints but I understand that the Committee decided at their meeting on the 17th November to request representatives of the firm concerned to attend at a meeting of the Committee on the 20th November.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it then that there is no such plant near any residential area at present?  Or is there any such plant as this in Ireland from which it would be possible to find out if there is a health hazard associated with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I have is the statement by the Chief Medical Officer that as there was none in the city or suburbs, he had no measure to determine the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be fair to say, then, in view of what the Chief Medical Officer says, that there is a possible health hazard, and in those circumstances surely it is grossly improper for the Corporation to have <Col N="1249" /> sanctioned the positioning of this machinery in the middle of a residential area, so close to where people are living and working?  Is there anything the Minister can do?</P>

The powers now available under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, enable proceedings to be taken for the removal or alteration of any unauthorised structures such as those referred to by the Deputy.  It is a matter for Dublin Corporation in the first instance to consider what action should be taken in regard to these structures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Following my recent announcement of Government policy in regard to itinerants, I have requested local authorities to give their early attention to the provision of serviced camping sites for itinerants and to furnish a report to my Department on the action which they have taken or propose to take in the matter.  In addition, discussions have been held with the local authorities principally <Col N="1250" /> concerned.  I am awaiting the reports from the local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no direct powers or controls in regard to the site in question, but we have had pretty continuous contact with the local authorities concerned.  I have expressed my view in regard to allowing the site to be used for some further time.  The local authorities are endeavouring to find a suitable alternative site to accommodate those who are on the Cherry Orchard site at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we know where we are.  Before any provisions were made that particular local authority had been inquiring from the Department&mdash;and I am sure if we went back over the records we would find they had been inquiring through the Deputy &mdash;about certain facilities.  Now that the minimum facilities are being made available through the Department, the same local authority, according to <Col N="1251" /> Deputy Clinton, are not prepared to go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get this quite clear.  This thing must be started somewhere.  The situation is that if we were in a position to provide good facilities in one particular place not only would we have to look after those already there, but there would be an influx from other parts of the country. I am alive to that problem.  The problem is pressing in some places but we must make a start somewhere, and that does not mean we are in any way ignoring the legitimate fears these people have that they may be making more trouble for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if it is the intention of the Government to make use of the evidence they have that some people have expressed the preference to live in certain areas?  Is it the intention to ask the various local authorities to provide sites for the families already in the areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain people have expressed preferences to remain where they are, but in so far as preferences are concerned, those are matters about which we are trying to gather information at the moment from the local authorities: information as to their habits, if you like; where they go; in what numbers; and where they would wish to make a stand, and so on.  All that must be taken into consideration together with preferences expressed by people who want to go to a particular county.  The councils will have something to say about that as well.  If the local authorities approach the matter on the basis that we are going to do something about it we could very likely do a lot quite quickly, but if some of them continue to think that <Col N="1252" /> by doing nothing they will be allowed to continue to do nothing the whole problem will be made much more difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that it is recognised as a national problem, would the Minister consider a 100 per cent grant rather than a two-thirds subsidy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>To throw the Deputy's argument back at him, why should people who are not affected be asked to contribute to those who are most affected?  That is putting the Deputy's argument in reverse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether the on-the-spot parking fines were increased from 10/- to £1 by order when the Dáil was in recess; and if he will now revoke that order until adequate parking space is provided for motor vehicle owners to cater for the increased number of vehicles registered in Dublin city and county as well as for outside <Col N="1253" /> traffic causing congestion in Dublin city area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to rebut the implication in the Deputy's question that these regulations were made because the Dáil was in recess.  They were made on 27th July, 1964, with effect from 1st August because traffic conditions required that they be made as quickly as possible and experience had shown that the existing regulations did not operate as a sufficient deterrent.  A person served with a notice under the new regulations may still exercise the option of allowing the case to go to court.  The new regulations have, in fact, reduced the incidence of parking offences and I do not propose to revoke them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that the parking facilities in Dublin are in any way adequate?  People are fined for parking offences because they have no place to park their cars.  They leave their cars in certain places for extended periods because they have no place else to park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suggest that there are sufficient car parks in Dublin, but it is a fact that the streets in this city, or any other city, are primarily intended as lines of communication and not parking lots, and the sooner the public realise that the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the fact that he is now throwing the onus back on the public generally, whereas it should be his responsibility and that of his officials to provide car parking facilities for the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We made very fair offers to the local authorities in regard to multi car parking facilities.  We have already provided about 1,200 or 1,300 car spaces in or around the centre of Dublin, and a further 1,500 parking spaces are in course of being provided as surface parking lots, again in and around the centre of the city. The public must keep in mind that whatever about parking their cars, the one place where we cannot afford to <Col N="1254" /> have cars parked is on the streets, many of which are already inadequate as lines of communication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the authority under which he is withholding from a widow of a deceased soldier and her four children (details supplied) the sum of £308 1s. 3d. which is payable to them under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme; and if, having regard to the fact that the lady in question has applied for a Dublin Corporation house and has been refused one because of the Corporation's inability to give her accommodation in view <Col N="1259" /> of the serious housing shortage in Dublin, he will now pay the gratuity in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The authority for withholding payment of the gratuity to the widow referred to by the Deputy is Article 39A of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme, 1937 (S.R. and O. 1937 No. 249) as inserted by Article 33 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Scheme, 1947 (S.R. and O. 1947 No. 81).</P>
      <P>The widow in question is overholding married quarters and the gratuity payable to her is being withheld to cover the daily charges for such overholding and the cost of electricity consumed as well as any amount which may be due for loss, damage or deficiencies in the quarters or furniture.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a payment of £25 from the gratuity was made to the widow, last week, as an exceptional measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that he must be unique in this country as being the only landlord who requires a widow with four young children to put down a deposit of £308 security for rent and possible damage to quarters?  Having regard to the fact that this lady has applied to Dublin Corporation for housing accommodation and has been refused it because there are some 10,000 seeking and unable to get accommodation from the Dublin Corporation, would the Minister not, in this instance, see to it that this woman's hardship and grief are alleviated to some extent by paying over at least £250 of this money to her forthwith?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is asking me to change a general rule of fairly long standing.  I have told him that a large number of army personnel, married men, are looking for accommodation. We cannot give it to them because of this overholding.  In view of the exceptional circumstances which were brought to my notice by the Deputy, and by other Deputies privately, we made a payment of £25 but it is not proposed to alter the <Col N="1260" /> general rule as otherwise, we should have no grip on these married quarters. There is very serious discontent amongst married army personnel because they cannot get houses.  I am sure a good many of these are constituents of the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The solution to the problem is to build more married accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister seriously suggest that he can help to alleviate the problem to which he has made reference by punishing an unfortunate widow and her four young children who have nowhere to go? The only way in which she can now get this money is to go out on the street and to bring her infant children with her.  Surely the Minister is not justified in that kind of attitude in this instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows as well as I do that large numbers of these overholders, or the majority of them, were in fact in recent years offered houses by the Corporation, and offered them in the districts for which they had applied, but when the offer was made, they refused to take them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this case not different from that which the Minister has mentioned? This lady has applied for accommodation anywhere and has been refused.  Is the Minister not aware that this unfortunate lady's husband died in August this year and that she immediately applied for accommodation and that her application is still open as far as she knows?  The Minister is making it difficult for this lady.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should have satisfied the Deputy that this is no hardhearted attitude in this matter but we must retain this general rule; otherwise we would have to do what the Deputy suggests, namely to keep on building houses against ever-increasing overholding, and that is a suggestion which the Department of Defence could not entertain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The House must be disappointed by the fact that the Minister has not taken this opportunity of considering the full implication of his continuation of the present policy in regard to Irish industry.  Everybody knows I am a socialist and that I believe in public ownership, the development of nationalised industries and so on.  I believe, at a time like this, even the Minister, with his conservative outlook on matters of this kind, without coming anywhere near to my approach to the reorganisation of society or economy in industry here, could have shown a much more enlightened attitude within the whole concept of a capitalist economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears, in regard to the provision of this money, that he is quite unwilling to accept that it is possible that the whole of Europe, or most of it, would show that there is a form of capitalism within which it is at least possible to <Col N="1266" /> provide for full employment.  I do not see that the Minister is making any provision at all for the reorganisation of our industries or for his suggestion to industries that they should so reorganise themselves as to ensure full employment.  The past is there for all of us to see.  The best part of one million were not provided with jobs.  It is very much more intolerable that the future does not hold out any great hopes and that there will be a continued relatively high unemployment figure and a consequential relatively high emigration figure.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, as well as the 8,000 for which he is going to produce jobs, there are about 12,000 who will not find jobs under the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> We shall export something over 100,000 people between now and 1970, in the middle of this Programme, which is being produced with so much extravagant praise, hopes and extravagant promises.  One of the pities of our society is that we happen to be a highly romantic race, with a magnificent gift for fabrication, particularly in a literary sense.  One of the things which we seem to be able to do better than anything else is to create a completely dream world, peopled by endless Walter Mitty-type characters, who believe they are operating in a highly efficient, well organised society, the tough, arrogant, self-sufficient go-ahead businessmen who are afraid of nobody, who want to stand on their own feet, and not depend on anybody but take on the toughest in Europe and meet and defeat them.  That is the mentality that is built up by the interaction of the radio, television and newspapers.  The widespread narcissism we find among our people is, of course, blown completely skyhigh by the relatively slight intervention of Mr. Wilson in imposing his 15 per cent levy.  England sneezes and Ireland gets pneumonia is a reasonably fair comment on what happened.</P>
    <P>These are the same people, this is the same Taoiseach, this is the same Government and Minister who promised us that we were ready and able to take on, not only the toughest <Col N="1267" /> in Great Britain but in the whole of Europe, that our industry was well founded, well organised and well run. They were fervent, devoted believers in private enterprise, and what do we find on the first attempt by us to stand on our feet or stand up against a little more competition?  We find these people squealing all over the place asking for pity and turning to the Government for hand outs&mdash;the things they despised so much.  They say we do not like this welfare society; we do not like people getting doles, free grants, allowances, and so on.  Our so-called private enterprise is based practically entirely on public money, public grants, public loans.  We take all the risk, they take all the profit and, in the process, they effectively rape the public through their organisation of restricted trade practices of one kind or another.  So that, not only are there tariffs to protect them from outside competition, but we have restrictive trade practices within Ireland to protect them from internal competition. Therefore, the unfortunate consumer is pillaged by these people in order to create the enormous profit which they have collected in the past few years.</P>
    <P>The profit figures I got recently from the Minister are&mdash;1957, £9.9 million, 1959, £13 million and 1961, £23 million.  That is two and a half times increase in profits in two or three years and all because they grossly exploited the unfortunate Irish worker, whether this be a child labourer, a girl, a boy or the ordinary man in employment.  This compared with Europe, is gross underpayment, together with gross over-pricing of Irish goods.  I do not know why the survey carried out by the Economic Research Institute has not been referred to.  There has been a discussion in the newspapers recently, and so far as one can make any comparison, the discrepancy between Irish and English prices is ten per cent, two per cent of which goes on distribution costs here.  They are lower here than in Great Britain but it works out at a ten per cent discrepancy in Britain's favour, against our industry and <Col N="1268" /> against those people who are at the front gate at the moment waiting for another £10 million to come their way &mdash;not out of their profits, because they cannot afford it.  It was £23 million in 1961 and I do not know what last year's figures are.</P>
    <P>They cannot afford to pay anything. These are the self-sufficient, arrogant, we-stand-on-our-feet private enterprise merchants who are terrified out of their lives at the prospect of free competition, and the Minister knows that well.  Why is it the Minister and the Government refuse to face that fact? I find it positively terrifying that the Minister should read a statement about adaptation grants where only 362 applications were made out of approximately 4,000&mdash;one in ten&mdash;and we are on the edge of this insane decision to look for full membership of the Common Market.  I am glad to see there is a prospect of that being changed to associate membership.  We should fall in with Greece and all those other underdeveloped countries. These are the hard facts of life which we have ignored for so long in this tiny narcissan society where we are blowing ourselves up.</P>
    <P>We will not listen to the other point of view.  When we do, we are called cranks or communists or atheists, or God knows what, so long as we can be destroyed and so long as one can then ignore reality.  There are even the poor unfortunate people, the athletes, who were sent to Japan recently and the unbounded mention they got before they went, and the decimation when they arrived there completely outclassed. This painful contrast in the truth from outside always causes us a surprise because nobody is prepared to look at things in realistic terms here.  That is the tragedy.  When this 15 per cent came on recently and the Irish industrialists threw up their hands and all their financial advisers and economists screamed their heads off at Wilson, they knew quite well that it was precisely the same type of conservative economists&mdash;the Maudlings, the Homes and their advisers&mdash;who created that situation in Britain and that we are rapidly creating a comparable situation here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> Unfortunately, there is no strong Labour Government here in Ireland at present to do what Wilson has done in regard to industry over there. They screamed their heads off largely because they know quite well when the Socialist advances in Great Britain, the same thing will happen here.  It is as inevitable as the tide.  The serious thing in this debate is the unfortunate casually in the debate.  The casualty is the unfortunate worker and his children.  It is he who has got hurt and it is he who will get hurt.  I consider the offer of these unfortunate workers down the country more than pathetic.  They have been grossly exploited in their rights to offer free labour to those people who have taken so much from them and given them so little in return.  It is the mark of the workers' generosity and the employers' rapacity.</P>
    <P>One in ten people who were so categorically anathematised in the Minister's CIO report as being inefficient, incompetent, unmechanised, badly organised and defective in seeking export markets, decided that this is a serious matter.  They hear from the Taoiseach that Irish industry is strong, vibrant, dynamic and go-ahead and is as rosy as they tell one another it is. Rubbish! The 15 per cent found the Government out in that rubbishy statement, that rubbishy fairytale which, to their discredit and continued disgrace, the public media of communications are continuing to circulate as if it were, in fact, a reality in the community. Irish industry has failed to provide jobs for one million and there is another one hundred thousand it will not provide jobs for.  It has exploited labour here and has provided goods at grossly unnecessarily exorbitant prices, all the time operating completely inefficient machinery, inefficient equipment, outdated, outmoded managerial and technological methods.</P>
    <P>That is bad enough, but it is making no serious attempt to improve the position.  Time and time again, and particularly from the Minister for Transport and Power, we get stupid homilies&mdash;nobody can be more stupid than that man in his speeches&mdash;to the <Col N="1270" /> workers about increasing production. If the Minister would give the slightest thought to increasing production, he would appreciate that the unfortunate worker has no say whatever, virtually, in the question of increasing production.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention a word in his opening speech&mdash;and it is like talking about Hamlet and leaving out the ghost&mdash;about the whole question of automation.  We are left as we are, in the Model T Ford era of industrial development.  Does the Minister not know, if you have two men and give one man a shovel and the other a bulldozer and ask them to remove a hill, which of the two will remove it the quicker?  If the poor devil with the shovel shovels hard enough, according to the Minister for Transport and Power, he will get rid of the hill before the bulldozer.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the Irish worker is not provided with the tools to maximise production to keep in line with European production.  Yet those slow, lazy, indolent, selfish people who control industry are completely indifferent to that reality.  Why?  For the simple reason that they know that when the time comes, the parent industry or the major industry outside will come in, start some cheap factory in some back street, work it on child labour, make an official impression with a golden handshake and the employer is all right.</P>
    <P>But the worker is on the street if he has not gone to Liverpool for a job in Wilson's socialist England, we hope, properly cared for, clothed, fed and washed.  The Minister should be damn glad to see Wilson in Government in Britain.  He will have plenty of jobs and to spare.  The Minister knows this quite well, and I wish he would tell the Minister for Transport and Power that he should give up this idiotic habit of asking the worker to increase production.  A machine capable of turning out 1,000 candles, or 1,000 light bulbs, or 1,000 boxes of matches, cannot turn out 1,001 no matter how hard it is worked.</P>
    <P>Unless you improve the machinery you cannot improve production and <Col N="1271" /> that is borne out in this matter of applying for adaptation grants.  Those people have no intention of giving the Irish worker the machinery to improve production.  If one looks at our export market, one realises that 75 per cent of our export goes to Great Britain.  This is made more difficult at present; yet in spite of that no serious attempt is being made to diversify exports to other countries.  Our industrialists have depended on the fact that the parent British factory would take the output of the Irish factory and anything else makes no difference to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister must face the necessity for giving some direction to Irish industry to bring it into line with the needs of our society.  There are very few, even conservative traditional economists, who would accept the <i>laissez faire</i> economic ideas of the present Government.  No one of them directly has any kind of suggestion that there should be profit sharing, or encouragement to profit share, with workers.  I do not agree with the idea at all, but at least there should be some greater measure of participation by the workers in industry than there is.</P>
    <P>The Minister should draw the attention of Irish industrialists to the fact&mdash; I do not suppose they would take the slightest notice, but he should do it any way&mdash;that they have a responsibility to society.  Their job is not to exploit the consumers here, the workers, in order to buy bigger Jaguars, build greater houses or go for more and more expensive continental tours. That should not be the objective of a properly orientated, civilised community, yet that is the way it largely operates here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not be allowed to get away with this complacent acquiescence in the failure of Irish industrialists to show they are aware of what is coming to them in the early 1970's.  He must now have very little confidence in their ability.  Anybody who read the hysteria in the evening papers and the morning papers recently, the Federated Union of <Col N="1272" /> Employers, all these great independent industrialists, screaming for money from the public purse, must understand that these people are grossly incompetent, that they are completely unprepared for the challenge of serious outside competition.</P>
    <P>The Common Market recently reduced their tariffs by 50 per cent. What would we do in that situation? What will the Minister do to see that this position is not recreated if Mr. Wilson decides he has, due to Tory mistakes and the idiocy of the policies over the years, to continue the 15 per cent surcharge or even to increase it? What are we to do?  Are we to continue to subsidise these industrialists? What steps do they propose to take to see that serious action follows the granting of additional money towards the creation of significant export markets elsewhere than Great Britain?</P>
    <P>The whole of the Middle East and Africa are hungry for supplies, particularly the products of Érin Foods. What incentive is the Minister giving in that direction?  He intervened&mdash; and it was a welcome intervention, his first for as long as I can remember&mdash; to stop this pack of gangsters from taking something like £400,000, the produce of a penny on the gallon of petrol, from the unfortunate public, the private motorist, the public consumer. What is to happen to those people for having tried on that piece of highway robbery, which I have no doubt they would have got away with were it not for the fact that the Government's plate is so full of headaches at the moment they could not allow that particular outrage?</P>
    <P>How many times have they increased their prices unnecessarily?  How many times did the Minister not intervene? If he had intervened would he have succeeded in getting a reduction in price which has been greatly in excess of the price paid for petrol in Great Britain over a number of years?  What does the Minister propose to do about the independent action of these people whenever they feel like taking another increase in profits by increasing prices to the consumer?  What protection will be given the consumer?  We are the consumer.  We are speaking on behalf of the consumer.  This sum the <Col N="1273" /> Minister is seeking will come from the consumer.  What guarantee will the Minister give him that he will be protected from this crowd of men who have over the years behaved so completely irresponsibly in their capacity as leaders of Irish industry?  What does the Minister propose to do about it?  What redress have we when they continue to increase prices?  Lecture the trade union movement, I suppose. Lecture the worker to increase production, to tighten his belt, to live on less. Thank heavens, we are coming to an end of the time when the worker would take that from anybody.</P>
    <P>The reality of the situation is, as I see it, that the conflict must go on. The employer believes that wages are profits gone astray.  The worker believes that profits are wages gone astray.  In that is the conflict, which can only be resolved, I believe, when the worker gets the total profit of his labour in the form of wages and social services of one kind or another.  That, of course, is the socialist system.</P>
    <P>We have also had to bear, as a result of the inadequacy of these people, the remarkable shift in the impact of taxation over recent years away from the wealthy.  Nobody likes taxation.  In the ordinary taxation code the wealthy man paid as much as he was able and then there was a sliding scale down.  Because of the Government's concern for the wealthy, taxation is changed completely.  Now we find the burden of indirect taxation has changed very much in favour of the wealthy businessman and against the consumer, the ordinary worker.</P>
    <P>Again, that is where most of this money will come from eventually&mdash; from the consumer, who is under-paid, who pays too much for whatever he does pay for, who, if he is out of work, gets relatively little or no social services of any kind.  He cannot have health services because he cannot afford them.  He cannot get his children educated because he cannot afford the educational services&mdash;all because of the incompetency of Irish industry.  Indirect taxation is higher proportionately in Ireland than in practically any other country in Europe.  The social welfare contributions paid by the employers are <Col N="1274" /> about six per cent here.  In Europe they run at between 20 per cent and 30 per cent.  No matter what way you look at it Irish industry is featherbedded, and the feather-bedding has created the useless, inefficient, decadent, selfish incompetence, which, to a considerable extent now dominates the activities of the Irish industrialists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to hasten after Deputy Dr. Browne in welcoming the advent of any particular form of Government: I do not think there is any need to rejoice at the departure of one Party or another in any foreign Government.  I do not think it affects our problems to any great extent.  We know, in the instance to which Deputy Dr. Browne makes reference, that the remedies now being applied in Britain are those which would have been applied had the Government not changed at all.  It ought to have been obvious from the experience in all European nations over the past 15 years that something of that kind would develop in Britain. It did not need the Minister to be told in confidence by Mr. Maudling some months ago that this was going to happen.  It was apparent to anybody who took even a passing interest in international economic affairs.</P>
      <P>We have been concerned in these benches about the Government's lack of real interest for the past seven years. The fact that they have been so disinterested has been proved by the shock and alarm they displayed and engendered when Britain took what was inevitable action to protect her trading and financial position.  Every country in Europe without exception, every member of the economic organisations there, has had to take protective action of one kind or another in relation to its balance of payments.  It was as inevitable as day follows night that Britain would have to take similar action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lamentable thing is that the past seven years in this country have been seven wasted years.  Instead of promoting increased efficiency at from three to five per cent per annum, we have been concerned only with the value of our exports and have not measured in real terms whether our industry was <Col N="1275" /> becoming more efficient as the years went on.  The sad thing is that, with one or two exceptions, our industry has not become more efficient.  Deputy Dr. Browne is right in criticising all those who are to blame for that sorry state of affairs.  If we had had a three per cent increase in efficiency in each of the past seven years we would now have an increase of efficiency of 21 per cent, which would be more than sufficient to meet the 15 per cent levy Britain has chosen to impose on something less than one-fifth of our total exports.</P>
    <P>We are told that, because Britain has done this, it is a national disaster and a body blow.  We have had the most unpatriotic display of alarm on the part of the Government, who went to London, who met the British Ministers and who came out wiser than they went in, but only as wise as the rest of the country.  When they came away from Mr. Wilson they knew that the British Government meant what they said.  Apparently, they did not believe it until they heard it from Mr. Wilson.  Blessed are those who do not see and believe.  Blessed are those who anticipate these things.  Cursed is the country in which Ministers do not anticipate these things and do not accept them when they come.</P>
    <P>Having realised no way out of their dilemma, the Taoiseach, the Minister and their colleagues came into the House and chastised us in the Opposition Benches.  They accused us of doing the very thing they had done the previous week.  They bewailed the position and spoke about national disaster.  The only note of confidence struck in the country at the time the levies were imposed was sounded by Deputy Dillon, our leader.  We are not without faith in the Irish people. We do not think they want to be feather-bedded all the time.  We believe if they were encouraged in the right way through being given a proper lead they would respond.  They have not been able to get that from the present Government.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons which justify the allegations that we have wasted <Col N="1276" /> several years is the way in which, during periods of industrial peace, the Government have failed entirely to take any effective measures to secure a better system of employer-employee relationship.  Indeed, the Government's activities in industrial relations in recent years have been quite the reverse: when there were negotiations and conferences between employers and employees, the Government sought temporary political advantage by interfering and caused those negotiations to break down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He can deny true ones also and it is no bother to him but he is going to hear these things being said.  What has alarmed many people in recent years is the wide gulf existing between the ordinary rank and file of the trade unions and the trade union hierarchy.  That is a sad situation and the people who suffer most under such a system are the workers themselves. Here, again, the Government have shown a considerable want of courage to take steps to end that sorry situation. What is worse still is that in a period of serious industrial strife, when <Col N="1277" /> the working people are up in arms against the Government, they are antagonistic to the employers because, in the situation which the Government have created, it is very wrong of the Government then to threaten to take action to solve the situation which ought to have been capable of reasonably easy solution during the period of industrial peace.  Now the big stick is being waved.  This is all in keeping with the clamour raised when the 15 per cent levy in Britain was imposed.</P>
      <P>The Government know well, or ought to know&mdash;certainly their advisers should be telling them and I can only assume they are doing so&mdash; that the country is drifting into its own serious financial difficulties.  Those difficulties were going to arise irrespective of the 15 per cent levy imposed in Britain.  The only justification or explanation for the Government's conduct in crying about body blows and national disaster when the levy was imposed was that they wanted to blame Britain for the financial problems they themselves created.  When anybody dares to criticise them he is accused of siding with the ancient enemy.  If anybody doubts that let him watch the remarks of Fianna Fáil in coming months. This situation is of their own making: were it not of their own making there would be no need to be so upset at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It strikes me that one of the reasons why we have not made better use of the last seven wasted years is that the machinery we have to expand industry is too cumbersome: the bodies we have considering applications for grants and the methods we have of making payment of grants are too cumbersome.  These bodies have a bureaucratic outlook.  They are incapable of responding in the dynamic, dramatic way in which people who are successful in industry and in business must act.  There is a clear need to use the pool of active, successful businessmen and industrialists we have whose aid is not being sought.  One of the real difficulties is that of all the industrialists and businessmen, the <Col N="1278" /> number who sit on Government or semi-State bodies is few and one can always select them because of their political allegiance.  Certainly, the political views of the majority of them are well known and if any vacancy occurs in any of these bodies we can always forecast for certain who is going to be appointed not because of his particular commercial, industrial or business acumen but because of his politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

In Cork, in particular, the Minister knows well who it is I have in mind as an example of what I am saying.</P>

      <P>If the Minister and his colleagues are more particular in future about such appointments there will not be such justification for saying what I am saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These bodies are mainly concerned with the development of luxury and <Col N="1279" /> prestige products.  Fashion shows are all very well.  The tweed trade and the homespun trade have every reason to expand.  They provide very valuable employment and are a source of great revenue but we should always be aware that we can possibly make more profit out of the sale of millions of cheap items to a chain stores in Eastern America than we can by having expensive shows of luxury products in about 50 different parts of America.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a costing done of some of the export promotion projects of some of the Government or semi-State bodies.  I have a feeling that in some cases it will take years to recoup the initial outlay on some of the so-called luxury trade promotion efforts.  For instance, I think you would spend more on a cocktail party in London in endeavouring to promote a particular line and have less success than you would have in cheap Press and television advertising in the midlands or on the west coast and some of the western cities of Britain which are contiguous to us.  We must be prepared to go down into the market place and not try to sell goods all the time in luxury stores.  The vast majority of people in the world are under-clothed and under-fed and not concerned with luxury items and if world standards continue to improve the great prospect for this country and others is in the provision of clothes and food for the under-nourished and under-fed.  We should endeavour to develop that market on a generous scale.</P>
    <P>Most members of the House, if they are ever approached by people thinking of industrial expansion, have been concerned about the long delays that arise where the particular industry or business has a market available to it but is unable to develop the market because of lack of capital to build up stocks and in many cases stocks must be built up in order to ensure delivery dates and delivery quantities.</P>
    <P>Again, we come up against the difficulty that many of these bodies require an element of prestige and status in exports before they will come <Col N="1280" /> forward with the necessary assistance but long-established Irish family businesses have more to lose than have many of the passing foreigners who are able to get money because, apparently, they have the status or are accepted as having status because they are foreign and I have known of more than one case in which a long-established Irish firm has been unable to get assistance but has been advised that assistance might be forthcoming if it could link up with some foreign concern which was in a similar line of business.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong in this but I have advanced the excuse to people who consulted me that this was probably because the authorities felt that there would be better prospects in an export market if they had a foreign company behind them here because that company would have markets already available to it abroad which would not be immediately available to an Irish company starting off.  I may be wrong in that.  Perhaps that is not the excuse for their conduct but it is the only plausible one.  We ought to be a little more courageous and give our own people more support and encouragement without requiring them at all times to be associated with some foreign interest.</P>
    <P>I have already said that I think it is a mistake to direct attention to luxury items all the time and that we should be concerned with the cheap article&mdash;I will not use the word &ldquo;shoddy&rdquo;&mdash;but there are many people in this world who would be glad of a shoddy article if it were as much as they could afford to pay for and we certainly should try to meet the requirements of the extensive and vast poorer markets in this world.  There is a serious obligation on the Government and on the State-sponsored bodies to ensure that anything produced by these concerns is not something that we ourselves would not tolerate in this country.  We should also ensure that it is not something which is contrary to the law of this country.</P>
    <P>I am aware since it was brought to my attention yesterday of some pornographic literature of the worst possible <Col N="1281" /> pornography which has been produced here by a firm which has received money from the Government and which is going to receive more money from the Government.  I am aware, of course, Sir, that the firm in question received the money on condition that all its products were exported but I do not think that this House or the Government should attempt to justify the manufacture in this country of pornographic literature simply because it is for export abroad. If we, in our wisdom or otherwise, have decided here that we should have a censorship board in order to prevent the minds of our people from being destroyed by pornography it is entirely wrong that public money should be made available by the same Parliament as made this law for the manufacture of pornography here and the export of it to Britain and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of how this particular book has come back to this country. I will bring it to the attention of the Minister and to other members of the Government because I think it is highly deplorable and immediate action should be taken to prevent any further pornography being manufactured with the assistance of money provided under the Industrial Grants Acts or in any other manner by the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the foggiest notion of what the Deputy is talking about, but, if there are particulars, if the Deputy will give me the particulars, I will look into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This book only arrived in my hand yesterday and I had the embarrassment of opening it here in this Chamber but I was absolutely appalled that the type of this book is being set up here.  I am sure the Minister must be aware of the concern in question because, as far as I know, it is the only printing concern which has received money from the Irish Government.  Suffice it to say that it is a concern associated with an international multi-millionaire.  It is amazing to many of us here that substantial moneys should ever be paid out of the Irish Exchequer to the assistance of a multi-millionaire but we were told <Col N="1282" /> that he would not come here unless Government aid was provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is going a bit far now.  In fact, I think I can almost tell him that the allegation he is making is wrong or, at least, the direction in which he is making it. Give me the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might readily say that I was wrong but I will show him the book which contains on the reverse side of the title page the name of the firm in Dublin credited with setting up the type for the printing of the book in question.  The contents of the book speak for themselves and it does not say that the pornographic pages were set up elsewhere.  I will give the particulars to the Minister.</P>
      <P>It does not seem to me that there is at present in the industrial grants legislation any power to control the type of products which may be furnished by a firm.  All that one can do at the moment is to get the intentions, to get the plans, to consider the expectations of these firms and their prospects, but, once they start operatting, I do not know what power, if any, the Minister or the State bodies have to control the operations of them thereafter.  It does seem highly desirable that public moneys would not be spent on the production of anything of that particular nature and there are other goods which might be produced which for other reasons, national and moral, might be considered undesirable.  Some powers should be taken, if necessary in this legislation, to prevent that kind of thing being done.  I will, therefore, pass on to the Minister with the least possible delay the product in question as soon as I get permission from the person who sent it to me and also after it has been considered by the Censorship of Publications Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We should all welcome and be willing to support a Bill which is being introduced to ensure that adequate money is available for the provision, through An Foras Tionscal, of grants to attract new industries, grants to extend existing industries, adaptation grants to enable <Col N="1283" /> our industries to meet the more competitive conditions into which we are moving and, lastly but not least, grants to assist industrialists who are adversely affected by the imposition of the British levy.</P>
      <P>I am personally concerned about the alarming number of people in my own constituency who have already lost their employment as a result of decisions taken by management allegedly to offset the effects of the British import levy.  In one industry alone, I am aware, over forty men have been already let go and more men will be let go next week and the week after.  That is due to a decision on the part of the particular industry to cut down on the maintenance and repair staff, who, in addition to maintenance and repair work were also, I suppose, making additions to buildings. I refer to men who were regarded as permanent maintenance personnel.</P>
      <P>It is my belief that any worthwhile export industry would make a decision to live on its own fat during the present difficult period in order to hold the export markets which it has and in order to keep the valuable staff it has built up and has employed over a period.  These are side effects and whether the fact of the levy is being used as a means of quietly getting rid of men of that description for a time, or not, I do not know.  I doubt if it is because in the case I have in mind these people have been employed over quite a long period.  What makes the matter more serious is the fact that at the same time there is a strike of builders' providers and there is no place to which these men can move and get employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If anything can be done to ensure, through the various grants being made available, that the normal development of industry is maintained at its previous levels, the Minister should use his influence in that regard; otherwise, I greatly fear that a large number of men will lose their employment and will lose it coming up to Christmas when people like to have that little bit extra and certainly do not like to <Col N="1284" /> be registering at the employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>There is a particular need at the present time to expedite the establishment of new industries and the enlargement of existing industries so that more employment opportunities may become available.  I have said in this House before that I personally do not believe that the machinery we have in the State at the present time is adequate to do that.  Deputy Corish referred to the delays of which he was aware and to which people coming in here proposing to establish industries objected very seriously, and they were not inclined, in many cases, to wait.</P>
    <P>I have myself had the experience of assisting a few firms to go about getting grants and establishing industries.  I could not speak too highly of the people I met in the Industrial Development Authority and An Foras Tionscal but it is my view that there are not sufficient people employed in An Foras Tionscal or in the Industrial Development Authority where these proposals are being processed.  It is taking much too long to have them processed because there are a large number of proposals at the same time before the Industrial Development Authority. They are all at various stages and the whole process is a very protracted business.  Many people coming here from outside the country just cannot understand all these delays and are inclined to become impatient.  Not only could these negotiations be speeded up but there are many other ways in which these people could be facilitated.</P>
    <P>The one central body should deal with all the problems that confront firms coming here from outside to establish industries.  We here are familiar with all the processes and with all the legal requirements, town planning and the various other difficulties that arise even when a decision has been reached.  The process of actually establishing an industry here is a difficult one for foreigners and the brochure which the Industrial Development Authority circulate in various parts of the world gives them the impression that here are grants available and ready to be handed out. <Col N="1285" /> They are not aware of the very great difficulties that exist and that have to be overcome before they get to the stage where an industry is actually established.</P>
    <P>Another problem of which I became aware in the course of my experience is this: proposers coming in here find it hard to convince the people who are responsible for making decisions that they are a solid and a worthwhile firm and that they are prepared to set up an industry that will have an export content of so much, an employment content of so much, and that will measure up to certain specified targets.  If we could get it established that grants would be made available at a future date, subject to firms of that sort measuring up to pre-determined targets, it would be a very important thing.  Many proposals are held up and many, perhaps, are turned down because the people responsible for sanctioning these grants are not certain, and went as far as possible to be certain, that these industries will succeed.</P>
    <P>If it could be made clear to proposers that, provided what they are saying is true, they will get this money, that they will have to wait for it up to this point where they have proved themselves over a period&mdash;it need not be a very protracted period; two or three years, perhaps&mdash;there are many outside firms in a position to establish industry here in that way.  All they would need is the assurance that when they reach the stage, a certain amount of support will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that one of the things that has to be proved is that it would not be possible to establish an industry unless this money was obtained. It must be shown that there is insufficient money.  That is wrong.  It is wrong to be trying to induce industries here where it must be shown there is insufficient money available to see the project through, but that is one of the conditions for grants through An Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <P>There should be greater discrimination in favour of industries with raw materials produced in Ireland. Industries of that sort have a much <Col N="1286" /> greater attraction for us here.  I am not sure that they are favoured in the way they should be when consideration is being given to the size of the grant available for particular projects. One of the things I have in mind and which I feel we have very much neglected over the years is the potential of our fishing industry.  We have not made the grants nearly attractive enough to bring big people into the fishing industry here in order to realise the potential of the seas around the country.  That is the type of industry to which we should hold out more attractions, even more than we normally give to industries based on raw materials which have to be imported from outside or for industries which are merely assembly industries.</P>
    <P>In relation to our insistence that grants will be given to industries only if they go to certain parts of the country, we can very easily overdo it. The important thing is to get industry into any part of the country and to overcome all the obstacles, first of all, to speed up the machinery for the giving of grants and then to get the fullest possible co-operation from the local authorities and all other people concerned in the establishment of industries.</P>
    <P>Everybody in the country, without exception, should be extremely anxious to co-operate in this very important work.  In a country where we have so many people still unemployed&mdash;we have over 43,000 unemployed at the moment and it is a problem which is on the increase, due to the increasing number every year leaving agriculture &mdash;the co-operation that is needed would be forthcoming from all sections in society who can contribute but there should be an attempt at the top to co-ordinate that effort and to repose in one body the responsibility for going out to meet industrialists and saying to them: &ldquo;If you have a proposal, we shall solve any problem you put up to us.  You will not have to go here, there and elsewhere in the country to get your problems solved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When we succeed in establishing an industry, we lose interest from there on.  There should be a body to follow <Col N="1287" /> up the various industries that have been established to see if they have continuing problems and if they have, to see how they can be assisted.  It is only in that way we can ensure that the maximum progress will be made in industry and the greatest possible number of people will be employed.</P>

      <P>I shall not detain the House very long but there are one or two matters on which I want to make observations and to put questions to the Minister.  It seems to me that in introducing these industrial grants the Minister had an opportunity of giving us some sort of review of the industrial position, but that he failed to do entirely.  In effect, what he said was that we were increasing these grants by £10 millions for the purpose of expanding industry, and he said little more than that.  In the light of our present trade balance, which appears to be reaching almost alarming proportions, is the Minister satisfied that a policy of <i>laissez faire</i> is a satisfactory one for the country?  I should like to refer him to the Government's plan for economic expansion. As I recollect it, the Government recognise that agriculture, although it may be expanded, cannot do a great deal more to advance our economy; neither can it be expected to deal to any great extent with employment.  Of course that position obtains everywhere.  It is not peculiar to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied the existing industrial set-up is producing results? Is he satisfied it is likely to offset the extremely unpleasant balance of trade that we appear to be facing and, if he is not, surely the House is entitled to a more extensive dissertation on the situation relative to industry as a whole.  Further, is the Minister satisfied that the policy adumbrated is a satisfactory policy?  In the brochure circulated, we are offering any amount of benefits&mdash;free grants, the building of factories for foreigners, and so on&mdash; and that offer does not seem to have given us the return we might expect. I venture to suggest it has not given <Col N="1288" /> us that return for two reasons.  First of all, we have laid ourselves open to this difficulty: a foreign firm gets an order for £500,000, perhaps and, as the Minister knows, there is in practically every country today, outside of the developing countries, of course, full employment with a concomitant shortage of manpower.  There is a tendency for these firms to come here to avail of all the benefits we offer, produce the materials as quickly and as expeditiously as possible, and sell in the market available.  If that market does not continue, they just close the door, turn the key and shut down the factory.  I do not want to drag the East Galway by-election into the debate but it happens that I was down recently in Portumna fishing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Portumna is on the edge of the constituency.  I was told there was a firm there operated by foreigners and on the very day I was there the factory was closing down and 15 or 20 people found themselves out of employment.  Does the Minister not consider a change in the policy desirable?  There is quite a considerable amount of capital available and people are looking for good investments.  If we were to reverse our policy and had Irish industries run on Irish capital, concentrating on securing business executives from outside, with ability and knowledge of how to run factories we could, I think, achieve a better result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to cite to the Minister an industry in my constituency in the town of Gorey.  It is a leather industry, run and controlled and managed by expert outside foreign executives. First-class material is produced.  Practically everything produced is exported. So far as I know, these people are not looking for any money from the State. They are financed entirely by private enterprise capital and they can compete successfully with other countries. I think that is the type of industry at which we should aim.  The policy should be to encourage Irish industrialists worthy of the name to establish industries here and the grants and <Col N="1289" /> aids and subventions given should be given for the purpose of securing the best advice and management that can be got.  Executives in the upper echelon of industry earn something in the neighbourhood of £7,000 a year. If grants were given to enable these people to be paid that salary here, we would be able to procure the best to run our factories competently and properly.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, at the other end of my constituency, there is a firm which is not being properly managed. The Minister knows it.  The employment content has fallen to zero.  All prospects of employment in the area are destroyed.  Deputy Clinton mentioned the difficulties foreigners have who come in here.  I do not think there are any difficulties at all.  It is very difficult to get them to come here to set up industries because all these big combines, such as the Federation of Industries in the Federal Republic of Germany and the Agence France, and so on, rely in the first instance on a strong domestic market.  Here we have a dwindling population and I have had great difficulty in trying to encourage foreign industrialists to come in here.  They are more inclined to go to countries like the smaller Republics of South America, which are developing and in which the economy is improving.  There is the added attraction that the populations are continually rising.  Our disadvantage is that our population is continually falling.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I had to refer to East Galway and I hope it will not have any effect one way or the other on the election.  The Minister may think I was speaking specifically for that purpose in Dáil Éireann.  Of course, I was not.  I suggest to him, however, that if he hopes to get the expansion necessary here if we are to rectify our balance of payments, there will have to be a completely new reorientation of industry.  Coming in here year after year looking for more grants to carry on the existing policy will not produce the results.  The facts and figures are there.  We have a growing imbalance of trade with practically every country. One of two things must be wrong: <Col N="1290" /> either our system is wrong or else our production is not up to the required standard.</P>
    <P>A third question enters into it and that is the question of being able to sell on a market.  Old-established firms have a greater advantage here than we have and I think that was in the minds of those who directed our industrial policy originally; by getting these foreign firms to come in and set up here there would be no difficulty about markets because they would have good and tried markets available and a sales organisation.  If the Minister is inclined to adopt my suggestion now to encourage Irish capital, with safeguards in order to secure the industrial personnel required to make industry a success, he will find he will get a better result and possibly a better balance of trade in the next 12 months when he comes in here again, if he is still Minister for Industry and Commerce looking for the necessary moneys to carry on his policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate today followed the usual pattern of debates on industrial grants legislation.  There was, of course, the complaint that I did not give sufficient information in my opening statement, the suggestion being that I should run through the whole gamut of industrial and economic activities for the purpose of introducing this Bill.  Generally there are very few subjects on which there are not more frequent debates in Dáil Éireann than on industrialisation generally. I would remind the House that the time for the general debate on all aspects of industrial and commercial activity is on the occasion of the annual debate on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, complaints were made today that certain information was lacking and these were obviously made in ignorance of what the facts are.  Deputy Corish even went as far as to allege that I was not oncoming about reports of adaptation councils. I do not know from Adam what he means by that, because adaptation councils work within industry.  They are groups of people or firms, catering for a particular industry, who come <Col N="1291" /> together, their purpose being to rationalise where rationalisation is in their best interests, and engage in bulk buying or bulk selling where these activities will tend to improve the competitiveness of these industries.  I should like to say there has been no secrecy whatever about the publication of publishable matter dealing with our industrial re-adaptation policies.</P>
    <P>For example, everybody knows that there have been 26 survey reports by the Committee on Industrial Organisation. These are reports on hundreds and hundreds of firms in these 26 industries.  They have been most thorough reports which have highlighted the advantages these firms or industries have, and have pointed out their defects and made recommendations as to how they can overcome these defects.  They have said how many people work in the industry and how employment might drop in free trade conditions if certain improvements they recommend should not be carried out and, in many cases, how employment might well rise if the recommendations by the Committee on Industrial Organisation are carried out.</P>
    <P>I cannot for the life of me understand why allegations should be made that the House and the country are not getting sufficient information as to what requires to be done or is being done to improve our competitiveness. As I said, there have been 26 reports, 18 of which have been published and the remaining eight of which will be published over the next few months. These reports have been on industries in which many firms are engaged in the same type of operation.  Side by side with that, there are many firms carrying on industrial activity in which there are few, if any, other firms engaged in the country.  The surveys in these cases are done on an individual basis and by and large the reports on the surveys are not made available for publication simply because of the identification of the particular firm. One of the recommendations of the Committee on Industrial Organisation was, of course, that as a result of the <Col N="1292" /> recommendations, adaptation councils might be set up.  Today, some 20 adaptation councils have been set up. Many are working very effectively; some have been slow to get off the ground, I will readily admit.  I think it was Deputy Cosgrave who mentioned one, the footwear industry, which has been working hard and which has adopted certain measures which will be conducive to the maintenance, and I hope, the increase of employment in these industries.</P>
    <P>There are other industries for which adaptation councils would not be suitable. Two of these industries are the radio industry and the chocolate and sugar confectionery industry, and the industrial reorganisation branch of my Department&mdash;whose function it is to follow up the firms on whose activities reports are made by the Committee on Industrial Organisation to ensure that the recommendations will be carried out to the fullest possible extent&mdash;are satisfied that in the case of these few industries an adaptation council would not be suitable.  Nevertheless, in one case, the motor assembly industry, which was specifically mentioned by Deputy Corish, while an adaptation council was not considered appropriate for it, has set up a joint committee amongst the motor assembly firms themselves.  As I said in the House a couple of weeks ago, in reply to Parliamentary Questions, there appears to be now a degree of confidence among motor assemblers which is completely different from the tone set by the report of the Committee on Industrial Organisation in connection with motor assembling.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned, among other things, the problem that will arise as a result of automation and greater technical advances in industry, the problems of retraining and resettlement, and I take it that resettlement will cover the particular problem he had in mind of a man having to move from one part of the country to another to follow a particular trade, or to take up a job to which his particular aptitudes are suited.  The House will remember that when our application for membership of the European Economic Community was <Col N="1293" /> first made, or shortly after it, at any rate, there was set up an interdepartmental committee to examine the working of the European Social Fund, that is, the Fund the Common Market countries set up to facilitate retraining and resettlement.  The original purpose in setting up that committee was to examine how that Fund could be applied to Ireland on our accession to the Common Market and what obligations it would impose on us as a people and on the Exchequer.  When it became obvious that our application was not being proceeded with, we nevertheless directed that committee to continue the examination of the problem generally in anticipation of the coming to this country of a greater degree of automation and the problems arising from automation and technical advances.</P>
    <P>This committee has of course reported and its report has been published.  Deputies will remember that it recommended amongst other things accelerated vocational training, training in the job and advance training, but since then, other groups set up under State auspices have examined different aspects of this very same problem.  For example, the Committee on Industrial Organisation has a report entitled &ldquo;Certain Aspects of Redundancy&rdquo;.  As well as that, the Irish National Productivity Committee has published a report entitled &ldquo;Adoption Of An Active Manpower Policy&rdquo;, and the National Industrial Economic Council has published what I think they call an interim report on &ldquo;Manpower Policy&rdquo;.  The House will readily agree that there is every relationship between manpower policy and retraining and resettlement.</P>
    <P>Another group has been set up to examine and co-ordinate these reports. In the meantime the Government have taken certain preliminary decisions.  I think those decisions were announced recently by the Taoiseach.  The first is that a detailed scheme for the provision of training and retraining for industries will be worked out in consultation with employer and worker interests, and any necessary legislation will be provided as soon as possible. Without making any promises in that <Col N="1294" /> respect, it may be practicable to introduce that legislation in the Dáil during the coming session.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it was decided that a small inter-departmental committee of senior officers should examine and report quickly on the development of agencies to meet the foreseeable needs in the national manpower policy.  The specific function of this group will be to examine the different spheres of industry and try to determine in advance whether more of a particular skill would be required, and whether less of another skill would be required. An advance assessment of the position will be made so as to ensure that where we might now have an excess of a special skill, the necessary retraining will be carried out, and that skill diverted into channels which are more necessary; and in reverse, where we have not enough of a particular skill, channelled in the other direction.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it was announced that the same inter-departmental committee would also examine and make recommendations on the most effective method of making financial provision for redundant workers.  It is, possibly, too easy to look to the Government to provide any moneys that will be required in the case of inevitable redundancy&mdash;redundancy of people who have not the skill to be retrained as a result of automation or other technological changes, or even where they have the skill and we have not the capacity within ourselves to take up those skills.  There must be tripartite sharing of this burden between the State, the trade unions and the employer organisations.  That is one of the three matters that are at present under examination as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether it is proposed to operate the redundancy scheme in advance of becoming a member of the European Economic Community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not got the final report yet, but I should imagine that if in the type of activity we are trying to anticipate, redundancy or the necessity for retraining as a <Col N="1295" /> result of technological changes comes about for us more quickly than membership of the European Economic Community, it would be reasonable to assume we would apply those measures in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>I promised Deputy Dr. Browne that I would reply in detail to supplementary questions he asked me on this subject during Question Time this afternoon.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to the slowing down in the momentum that seemed to have developed in Irish industry in the years while our application for membership of the EEC was pending.  I think it is true that there was a certain slowing down.  Notwithstanding the fact that our application was held in abeyance, we, nevertheless, continued to urge firms generally to carry out readaptation and reorganisation where that would seem to be necessary, in order to prepare for what we regard as the inevitable freer, or completely free, trade within the seventies.</P>
      <P>I had occasion earlier to complain that the number of applications for adaptation grants was very small, but there was a marked increase in the number of applications in recent months although not as much as I should like.  The fact that we have some 350 applications is an indication, I think, that Irish Industry is alive to the necessity for gaining for itself greater efficiency to meet greater competition. Deputy Corish and Deputy Dr. Browne talked about a figure of about 4,000 firms.  That includes all kinds of firms such as small joinery works, and other small firms which may employ as little as five or ten people.  In many cases they are craft or traditional industries, and no amount of adaptation would help them.  I am reasonably satisfied that a good cross-section of Irish industry is taking advantage of the adaptation grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised at Deputy Corish's assertion that no indication is being given to him, or to the House, as to what type of industry is seeking such assistance, because if he looks at the latest report of Foras Tionscal for the year ending 31st March, 1964, he will <Col N="1296" /> find at Appendix 5 a long list of the type of industries, and the number of firms, which have made application for adaptation grants.  The figure in this published report is 282, covering some 30 or 35 types of industrial activity. It shows also the number approved, and the number rejected so, again, I cannot understand Deputy Corish's complaint about lack of information when most of the information he wants is available in published documents.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised questions about the preponderance of foreign investment, and at least one Deputy suggested that if you had a different coloured skin or a different accent from an Irish skin or accent, you would be more welcome in the portals of Foras Tionscal.  I am sick and tired of saying in this House, and outside it, that that is completely untrue and false.  However, we cannot have it both ways.  It is accepted on all sides of the House, I think, that it is desirable to attract foreign investors, not so much for the sake of the investment, but to get the technical knowhow and marketing contacts those outside people have.  Surely if we have an organisation like the Industrial Development Authority, whose function it is to seek suitable types of industry and investors for this country, we must give them a chance to work. If we do not want that, we should tell them to stop.  I do not think any Deputy will complain about the activities of the Industrial Development Authority.  At most they will complain about their lack of success, but I do not admit that there is a lack of success.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne gave us his usual homily on socialism.  At least he appeared to have the merit of sincerity, but he had the demerit of making extravagant and almost hysterical charges against individuals.  I will not waste the time of the House in defending industrialists against charges like that.  I hope that when Deputy Dr. Browne calms down he will realise that every industrialist is not dishonest and an exploiter of labour; that every working man is not being exploited, and that there is room for improvement in certain aspects of labour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> Deputy Dr. Browne suggested that no man can improve his output unless the machine on which he works is properly serviced and brought up to date by the employer.  We all know that there are faults on both sides. There is no use in heaping all the sins on one side or the other.</P>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Dr. Browne, however, who, apart from a few hysterical outbursts, had the merit of being sincere, the obvious insincerity of Deputy Ryan is something I might expect from him.  He referred to the past seven years as seven wasted years in the economic advance of the country &mdash;the wasted years in which we more than doubled our exports, in which we increased our GNP from one per cent to 4½ per cent per annum, in which we reduced emigration figures by about four times, in which, for the first time we succeeded in providing more industrial jobs per annum than the number of people leaving the land and, again, for the first time for generations, we succeeded in reversing the trend of emigration.</P>
    <P>I shall not waste the time of the House in going over the three years that preceded those seven allegedly wasted years.  Deputies opposite will know well the great change in the conditions that marked the introduction of the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and that has continued through the first year or so of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>I do not know what Deputy Ryan is referring to in relation to a pornographic publication.  It is a pity he should make allegations like those here without giving somebody a chance to check up on them.  I always resent people who for the sake of making headlines, say extravagant things without at least giving the person who can do something about it an opportunity of looking at the case.  This is the first I heard of it today.  I hope Deputy Ryan will follow up the allegation he has made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan also made allegations against the people who give their time and service on the boards of bodies dealing with industrial grants.  He <Col N="1298" /> called them inefficient, bureaucratic and owing their membership only to Fianna Fáil.  He made his charges lightly and recklessly, without any regard for the truth of the situation. The existing members of the IDA have been there for several years now.  Most of them were appointed, as far as I remember, by the former Deputy Morrissey when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Members of Foras Tionscal were appointed before that.  Two of these men were civil servants and the Chairman, Dr. Beddy. Subsequently, two members were added because of extra work being done in Foras Tionscal&mdash;one a former civil servant, well known in Irish insurance life and the other an existing civil servant in the Department of Agriculture &mdash;in order to bring certain agricultural knowledge to the board of Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <P>How, in the circumstances, can Deputy Ryan make such reckless charges against these men who are doing this work, one might almost say voluntarily in many cases because the amount of remuneration that these part-time appointments carry is very limited and is certainly not commensurate with the ability of these men and the amount of time they give to the task?  These allegations are made for whatever political kudos Deputy Ryan hopes to get out of them.  I am sorry for wasting the time of the House in dealing with the charges but, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I have to defend these men from reckless charges of this nature.</P>
    <P>Again, to show his lack of knowledge of this whole subject, Deputy Ryan said we should abandon the idea of trying to sell quality goods, or luxury items, as he called them, abroad and instead go in for mass-produced cheap goods.  A most elementary look at the pattern of trade throughout the world will indicate even to Deputy Ryan that it is not possible for this country to compete with the low-cost countries of the Middle East in those cheap mass-produced goods.  We should be completely swamped in any markets we tried to compete in for these cheap long-run types of merchandise. It has been the policy of Córas <Col N="1299" /> Tráchtála to push what we think we can do best, that is, luxury goods, quality goods, into markets where we know they will be appreciated and where the value of the contribution by Irish labour will be fully appreciated and properly compensated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton, I am glad to say, gave due credit both to the IDA and Foras Tionscal.  He has personal experience of them.  He is associated with at least one industrial promotion that these bodies handled in the recent past.  He returns, however, to an old complaint about there being more than one body&mdash;that instead of having the IDA and Foras Tionscal the promotional body and the grant examination body respectively there should be just one.  We had experience of that when the IDA, early on, handled, as well as their promotional activities, the grants made available by the Industrial Grants Act, 1956.  At that time, Foras Tionscal had already been established to handle the grants made available under the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
    <P>As a result of their experience at the time, the IDA recommended to me that the promotional aspect only of the task should be left to the IDA and that the grant application side should be given to Foras Tionscal, as under the Undeveloped Areas Act.  Apart from that experience, common sense would indicate to anybody that an organisation which is a promotional body, which goes out of the country or encourages those within it, should not be the one to knock an application if a proposal were found not to merit the giving of a grant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde made the complaint that industry was not offsetting the deficit in our balance of payments and, if not, why not.  The simple <Col N="1300" /> answer is that industry is only one part of our economic activity.  Agricultural and other exports&mdash;invisible, in other words&mdash;all these together are designed to help our balance of payments problem.  We have a big balance of payments problem which we hope will not get serious by reason of the imposition of the 15 per cent surcharge on our industrial goods in Britain.  I believe we can overcome the difficulties we are now facing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne suggested that we were the only country that kicked up a row about the imposition of these duties.  He said our industrialists threw up their hands in horror and that it indicated our weakness in our dependence on the British market.  Every European country and every combination of countries in Europe made bigger noises than we did.  Naturally, any country whose trade might be affected by the unilateral act of another country, especially in breach of an existing agreement, will make complaints and representations about the effect of such acts.</P>
