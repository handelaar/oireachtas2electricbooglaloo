    <P>1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will take steps to increase the present inadequate levels of the infectious diseases maintenance allowances; and if he will liberalise the means test at present applied for these allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I presume the Deputy is aware, an infectious diseases maintenance allowance may not be paid unless the person concerned would experience financial hardship in endeavouring to maintain himself and his dependants, if any, during his course of treatment. The health authority must, therefore, have regard to the means of an applicant from other sources in determining what payment should be made.  At the same time, where a health authority consider that undue hardship would be caused by adhering strictly to the fixed scale, they have discretion to disregard, in whole or in part, income arising in this way.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should remind the Dáil that the rates of allowance payable have been increased in each of the past three years, the most recent increase taking effect from 1st August, 1964.  In addition to the personal allowances, substantial rent and domestic help allowances may be paid in appropriate cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the local authority have power to increase <Col N="150" /> allowances but could the Minister say for how long the present means test has obtained and whether the means test is determined by the local authority or by the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no means test, other than that which has been in force all the time.  If a person would experience financial hardship in endeavouring to maintain himself and his dependants, he would be entitled to secure an allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>But did the Minister not refer to a means test?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not.  I said the health authority must have regard to the means of an applicant from other sources in determining what payment should be made.  The applicant must show he is not able to bear the expenses himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not an absolute means test like that applied in the matter of social welfare benefits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no prescribed means test, any more than there is in the case of medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be correct then to say that the health authority have absolute discretion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose one could say they had but they must exercise that discretion in a reasonable way. The Deputy must remember that they have to account ultimately to the ratepayers and to the Local Government auditor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>They can administer this allowance in accordance with their own standards and at their own discretion? They are not handicapped by any means test prescribed by the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not prescribe an absolute figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that, because some local authorities have protested that a means test has been laid down by the Minister and the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we talking about the same thing?  It may happen <Col N="151" /> in relation to a disabled person's maintenance allowance, which is rather different, that it may be indicated the local authority are to take into consideration any increased income that would be derived from other social services sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state if, where a local authority have reduced the allowances of these people, there is any appeal other than to the local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible for me to discuss such a wide, general question.  If the Deputy would be good enough to put down in the form of a question any specific cases he has in mind, I shall be glad to answer him in the House or communicate with him in person.  He must put a specific case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want a straight reply to a straight question: can the Minister state whether those people who have been turned down by a local authority can appeal to the Minister for Health?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would want to have notice of that question.  I do not think they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state whether in the future some Minister for Health other than he would give the right of appeal to those people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>

      <P>The recruitment of their staff is, under section 8 of the Electricity Supply Act, 1927, the sole responsibility of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Board that the essential minimum educational qualification for the post of laboratory assistant in their service is the Department of Education Leaving Certificate (Pass) but with honours in one of four specified subjects, namely, mathematics, chemistry, physics, and general science.  An employee with these educational qualifications can progress to a maximum salary of £996 per annum. An employee who has or acquires certain additional educational qualifications can progress to a maximum salary of £1,259 per annum.  These additional qualifications are a Pass in mathematics, chemistry and physics in the GCE at &ldquo;O&rdquo; level or its equivalent. A Pass in the corresponding subjects in the Leaving Certificate examination, which is at a higher level, would also, of course, qualify the employee for the higher maximum.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that this latter point is not brought out more clearly in the Board's advertisement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <P>The people who are really concerned are the people who are attending the secondary schools. They feel that although they have a <Col N="154" /> good Leaving Certificate result their qualifications are slighted and that those with qualifications coming from the secondary schools will not receive as good remuneration, even though they have Leaving Certificate honours. Perhaps the Minister will look into the matter.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take the replies to Questions Nos. 4, 5 and 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as any hotel may be a potentially dangerous building as defined in the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, it is subject to the control of the fire brigade authority under that Act.  The authority may require the proprietor to refrain from using the building unless specified fire precautions are taken. These may include the provision of appliances or fittings for enabling the occupants to escape from the building on the occurrence of a fire.  I have been concerned at the possible risk of loss of life from fire, and on 20th May, 1964, I asked all fire brigade authorities to carry out up-to-date surveys of all potentially dangerous buildings in their areas, particularly those providing substantial dormitory accommodation. I pointed out that appropriate action should be taken in relation to such buildings and that, where necessary, owners should be compelled to refrain from using them altogether or until <Col N="155" /> effective fire precautions had been put into force to render the buildings reasonably safe.</P>
    <P>I am not empowered to direct Bord Fáilte to take any action to ensure that all hotels approved by them have adequate fire escape facilities.  My views, however, as to the necessity for the provision of such facilities have been brought to the notice of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>In the case of new or reconstructed hotels I understand that grants are not paid by Bord Fáilte until the Fire Brigade Authority have certified that their requirements as to fire precautions have been met and that in the case of existing hotels, the payment of a grant towards the provision of fire escape facilities, required by the Fire Brigade Authority, will be considered.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for regret that the advertisement concerned was open to misunderstanding.

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to consolidate in a single measure, as far as this is practicable, the existing body of law relating to the safety, health and welfare of mine and quarry workers. At the same time, the opportunity is being taken to bring the law up to date and to provide for some desirable innovations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operations of mining and quarrying have much in common and are attended by similar risks.  At present there are two separate codes of law relating to them, although these codes are similar in general character and are closely connected.  Both are cumbrous and involved, being contained in well over a dozen enactments stretching back to 1872; they are also out of date in many respects.  I think <Col N="166" /> it would be convenient for all concerned if the entire body of the law were dealt with comprehensively in a single enactment.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been framed on the principles that the rights enjoyed by mine and quarry workers under existing legislation will not be diminished; that mine and quarry workers will, in general, be given the same kind of protection as has been afforded to factory workers by factory legislation; and that working conditions will comply with this country's obligations under International Labour Organisation Conventions.  Accordingly, it follows the general lines of existing legislation but revises many of its provisions in the light of modern conditions and practices.  At the same time a number of elaborate provisions will be replaced by power to make regulations. This change, by setting out general requirements in the statute and leaving the details to be prescribed by regulations, should provide a degree of flexibility which should obviate for many years to come the need for amending legislation.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill makes the usual preliminary and general provisions relating to interpretation, expenses repeals, etc.  I would like to draw attention, however, to section 6, which brings State mines and quarries within the scope of this type of legislation for the first time.  This development is in line with current views on the position of State enterprises&mdash; the Factories Act, 1955 and the Office Premises Act, 1958, have already set a headline in this respect.  Section 9 provides for prior consultation with the Minister for Health on health regulations.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with the management and control of mines and quarries.  It sets out the duties of owners and provides for the appointment, general duties, rights and powers of managers. The most important innovations in this Part are the requirement that a manager must be appointed to supervise the working of every quarry, and the power to prohibit, by regulations, the carrying out of certain operations unless the quarry manager has prescribed qualifications.  The requirement <Col N="167" /> that every quarry must have a manager arises from the need to have a readily identifiable person who will be responsible for seeing that the detailed requirements of the Bill and of Regulations and Orders made under it are complied with.  Owners of small quarries need not feel that this requirement will place an undue burden on them, however, as it will be open to any owner to appoint himself manager of his own quarry.  On the second point, developments in recent years in the scope of the activities being carried out at some of the larger quarries have indicated that, in order to supervise some of the more complex operations, a manager would need to have technical qualifications.</P>
    <P>Part II also contains some new provisions about the rights and duties of mine and quarry owners and managers which are designed to set out clearly their respective areas of responsibility. For example, orders by mine and quarry owners to subordinates of managers must normally be given through the managers, and managers may in certain circumstances require written confirmation of owners' orders. Also, a quarry owner may exclude any matter from the manager's control and reserve responsibility for it to himself, as long as this would not be prejudicial to the safety or health of his employees.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with safety, health and welfare of mine workers. It covers such matters as securing shafts and entrances, construction, maintenance and safe use of roads, operation of winding and haulage apparatus, provision of support underground, ventilation and lighting of mines, use of electricity and blasting materials, precautions against fire and flooding, safety provisions relating to machinery and buildings, and general welfare.  These provisions are based on existing legislation to a large extent, with some necessary modifications required by modern conditions.  There are a number of new provisions, none of which could be regarded as revolutionary.</P>
    <P>Part IV provides for the safety, health and welfare of quarry workers. As might be expected, it has a good <Col N="168" /> deal in common with Part III, and it incorporates certain provisions of that Part, which are relevant to both mines and quarries.  Again, existing legislation is followed closely.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with the notification and investigation of accidents and diseases.  This Part also follows the lines of existing legislation, which has been adapted to modern requirements. The procedures laid down for holding inquests and formal investigations are similar to corresponding provisions in the Factories Act, 1955.</P>
    <P>Part VI, which consists of only one section, maintains the right of workmen employed at a mine or quarry to appoint &ldquo;workmen's inspectors&rdquo; to inspect the mine or quarry at intervals. I am advised that this right has seldom, if ever, been availed of in this country but I do not propose to extinguish it.</P>
    <P>Part VII also consists of only one section, which continues in force the existing requirement that owners must fence abandoned and disused mines.  I might mention here that the fencing of dangerous quarries, whether abandoned or not, comes within the scope of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1964, and accordingly, there is no need to provide for it in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Part VIII deals with conditions of employment.  At this stage I might point out that settling conditions of employment is not a primary objective of this Bill, and in fact quarry workers are already covered by the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936.  However, under existing legislation mine workers have certain rights in this matter which will be continued in force, and I have taken the opportunity of making some necessary new provisions.  The existing prohibition on the employment of boys under 14 years below ground is being replaced by a power to make regulations restricting the employment of boys under a prescribed age.  This change will enable the minimum age for work below ground in mines to be reviewed in the light of any alteration in the general school-leaving age or any future commitments which this country may assume under any international agreement on the matter. <Col N="169" /> Restrictions on the employment of women and young persons at night are being brought into line with the latest ILO Convention on the subject and other conditions of employment of such persons employed above ground may be settled by regulations.  The prohibition on the employment of women and children below ground will, of course, be continued.</P>
    <P>Regulations may also provide for the compulsory medical examination of all persons employed or seeking employment at mines.  Compulsory medical examination of young persons has long been a feature of factory legislation, but the high incidence of respiratory disease in the mining industry requires that such examination can be extended to adults.  I envisage that these regulations will require (a) compulsory medical examination of all persons seeking employment at mines and (b) compulsory medical examination of serving miners at regular intervals.  Consultation with mine-owners and trade unions on the making of these and other regulations relating to conditions of employment is required by section 119.</P>
    <P>Part IX continues in force, without any fundamental changes, existing requirements about keeping records and furnishing returns and information.</P>
    <P>Part X, which consists of a single section, makes provision for the making of ministerial regulations, the procedure being set out in the Second Schedule.  Here again, the lines of existing legislation have been followed.</P>
    <P>Part XI maintains the right of coal miners who are paid by the weight of coal produced, to check the weighing of it.  I understand that this right has hardly ever been formally invoked in this country, but its existence probably is of some value in the completion and implementation of wage agreements where wages are based on output.</P>
    <P>Part XII deals with the appointment of inspectors and sets out their general powers.  These provisions are on the lines of existing legislation.</P>
    <P>Part XIII makes the usual type of provision for offences, penalties and legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>Finally, Part XIV covers a number <Col N="170" /> of miscellaneous matters which are not proper to any other Part.  The most interesting of these is a new provision for the setting up of an advisory council representative of employers and employees.  This provision has been prompted by the success which has attended the operation of the Factory and Office Advisory Councils set up under the Factories and Office Premises Acts.  It will be the function of the council to advise me on any matter arising out of the execution of the Act which I may refer to them. They will also be entitled, on their own initiative, to advise me on the administration of the Act, and any orders or regulations under it, and on certain other matters affecting the safety, welfare and education of employees and employers.  The council must include representatives of trade unions and of employers' organisations. I am confident that the advisory council will be of considerable assistance in the smooth operation of the Act when it becomes law.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is not controversial in its general principles.  It is, in fact, a codification of the existing laws relating to mines and quarries which, I understand, are spread over about 20 statutes.  The Bill, in fact, lays down the specifications which might well be laid down by an engineer or an architect to secure the safety of persons working in mines and quarries and, to that extent, it is more in line with these specifications than an ordinary piece of legislation.  This is not a criticism of the Bill but a commentary on its contents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, certain matters that may fall to be considered between now and Committee Stage.  One question which arises on the Bill is whether there is any machinery in the Department of Industry and Commerce which inquires from time to time whether mine owners are fully <i>au fait</i> with the procedures to be adopted in the event of miners being trapped.  For instance, are any practice rescue operations carried out from time to time and can the Department make available at <Col N="171" /> short notice expert advice on rescue operations in the event of such advice or information being required and is there adequate machinery available for use in rescue operations?</P>
    <P>I raise these matters because it seems to me that the time to take the necessary steps to have them attended to is before they are required rather than after the need has arisen.</P>
    <P>There are certain points in connection with individual sections which I should like to mention at this stage so that they can be considered between now and Committee Stage.  Under subsection (3) of section 3, there is a possibility that a machine shop placed at a mine would be covered by the Factories Acts rather than by the Mines and Quarries Bill and it is suggested that there should be some exclusion from the definition to make it clear that such manufacturing as is required for a mine or quarry production process is excepted, when carried out in a mine or quarry, from the provisions of the Factories Acts.</P>
    <P>Also, there appears to be some difficulty in regard to the function of a deputy as defined in paragraph (b) of section 17.  I understand that the function of a deputy as so defined is that which is normally considered to be the duty of a shift boss or other first-line supervisor.  Under section 20 a deputy is not permitted to work for a contractor so that it would not seem to be possible for a shaft contractor to employ supervisors but that such supervisors would have to be employed by the company.  I understand that a shaft contractor must employ supervisors if he is to operate efficiently.  It may be, therefore, that some amendment is required in these sections.</P>
    <P>Section 32 appears to be concerned only with coal or other stratified minerals.  If this is a correct interpretation, then it suggests to me that the term &ldquo;stratified&rdquo; should be defined because many mineral deposits could be classified by geologists as stratified. If this is so, the restrictive conditions of section 32 would apply to lead, zinc, barytes and other similar metal mines, whereas the section is intended to apply only to coal mines.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> Sections 36 to 41 contain restrictions on mechanical haulage.  It might be that this would be more appropriately dealt with by regulation than by a section in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 43 deals with the qualification of a person in charge of haulage apparatus.  A person qualified to operate such an apparatus should be required to undergo an annual medical examination.  This is a responsible and onerous position and the fact that a person carrying it out would be required to undergo an annual medical examination might ensure that he was at all times physically and otherwise fit to undertake the duties.</P>
    <P>Section 104 deals with the question of workmen's inspections and was referred to by the Minister in his introductory speech.  There is no conflict of interest between labour and management so far as mine safety is concerned and the need to provide good working conditions.  In fact, no modern mining operation would be successful unless safe and efficient working conditions were provided.  Representatives of management and the trade unions concerned almost invariably co-operate on the safety precautions and on the steps necessary to ensure that these are carried into effect, and it has been suggested to me that joint company and union safety committees are the most satisfactory methods of dealing with this.  To that extent I believe the proposal which follows the somewhat similar provisions in the Factories Act for an advisory council may deal with this matter.  If not, it would seem to be a matter which might appropriately joint representation.  Although it may be necessary to prescribe for it in the Bill or by regulation, in a matter of this sort voluntary co-operation appears to be the appropriate procedure.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter about which I want to inquire.  The enactments set out in the First Schedule are repealed.  Is it correct to assume that, with the repeal of those enactments, there will also be automatic repeal of regulations such as Statutory Instrument 273?  As I understand it, much <Col N="173" /> of that which is covered by Part III of this Bill deals with the subjects covered in Statutory Instrument 273. Some of them may be in conflict with that statutory instrument and I should like to inquire if it is proposed to issue further regulations when the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>Subject to those remarks and any amendments which may be proposed on Committee Stage, this Bill appears to bring mines and quarries into line with the similar changes which were made in the Factories and Workshops Act as applied to factories and workshops.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, on behalf of the Labour Party and the trade union movement, to welcome this Bill.  It may not be generally known that the conditions of coal-miners and quarry workers in this country are governed by an Act of 1911 and were it not for the activity of the trade unions down through the years in getting conditions agreed upon between employers and unions, there would be many more accidents in mines.</P>
      <P>This Bill follows more or less the British Act of 1954, and most of the provisions in the Bill, as I said, are already provided for by union agreement with management.  Nevertheless we wholeheartedly welcome the Bill, and if there is any criticism to be made of it, it is only that a period of ten years has lapsed since the British Act was passed in 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important Bill and we shall have the opportunity on Committee Stage of dealing with it section by section.  Each section needs to be considered because this Bill is something like the Road Traffic Act and the Factories Act in which we are dealing with the lives and livelihoods of workers and others concerned in mining and quarrying operations.  It is very seldom that a Bill comes into the House that deals with life and limb. That is why we should consider this Bill in detail on Committee Stage.  It must be remembered, and this is important, that mine workers and many quarry workers are not insured with insurance companies.  The mining companies <Col N="174" /> and the quarries have to carry their own insurance.  If there is an accident and a worker is awarded £2,000 or £10,000, he may find himself in the position that he cannot get one penny because the mine goes into liquidation.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into too much detail at this stage but it will help considerably on Committee Stage if the Minister can tell us more about this advisory council.  This is the body which will really administer the Bill when it becomes law.  It will make the regulations and advise the Minister. The proposed council will consist of eight members and a chairman.  Since this is a Mines and Quarries Bill, I take it there will be four from the mines and four from the quarries or, in other words, two employers' representatives and two trade union representatives. I would ask the Minister to consider extending the membership of the council.  In the British Act there is provision for area councils.  If there are only two workers' representatives from the mines, the council will not be very representative really because problems differ in the different mining areas.  There are different problems in the Leinster coalfields from those in the Connacht coalfields and, if the Minister cannot increase the membership of the council, then he should consider setting up area councils.  I would suggest one for the Munster coalfields, one for the Leinster coalfields and one for the Connacht coal fields.  In that way we would have a good cross-section of the mining problems in the country.  The problems, as I say, differ.  A problem in a Connacht coalfield might not be a problem in a Leinster coalfield and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I trust we will get more information on Committee Stage and I hope the Bill will receive the consideration it deserves on that stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, like any codification measure, is to be welcomed, but one shudders at the prospect for the future.  Instead of an Act of the Oireachtas generally available, well known and easily accessible, we will be offered a mass of regulations, unexplored <Col N="175" /> and unexamined.  In the explanatory memorandum issued with the Bill, and again in the Minister's speech today, we were told that, in order to achieve flexibility in the management and operation of mines and the safety measures adopted in them, we were to remove many of the obligations which now exist in statutes and substitute for them regulations, which will obviate, the Minister says, the need for amending legislation.</P>
      <P>The most unbending thing we can experience in this world is a statutory regulation.  The most unbending individual one can meet this side of Jordan is the bureaucrat applying a regulation. One of the most difficult things to amend is a regulation, not that it calls for any great effort on anybody's part to amend it but because the impulse and the urge that one must create, or induce, before a regulation is amended is so great as to be beyond the endurance and capacity of most people.  That is why I do not welcome the section in this Bill which proposes to create a mass of regulations.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the Planning Act.  Under that Act, passed earlier this year, we have had a greater mass of regulations in a short time than we have ever had under any other measure I know of in recent times.  The result is that from day to day people who are consulted&mdash;lawyers, architects, engineers and others&mdash;in relation to planning and development are unable to answer with confidence what the law is at any particular moment.  I am aware that these regulations, when made, will be placed on the Table of the House.  I am also aware that they may be rescinded within 21 days.  The distractions and duties which hedge in public representatives today are so multitudinous, so multifarious and so onerous that it is true to say that some regulations that have been passed should never have been passed in the form in which they were drafted.</P>
      <P>It seems to me, therefore, that we urgently need to establish a group like the Committee of Public Accounts to sit permanently for the purpose of considering regulations as they are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> The spasmodic fashion in which we are supposed to review regulations is not suited to the demands of this modern age.  The duties of Deputies are increasing inside and outside of the House.  I hope that before long we will create machinery for the careful examination of all regulations made or about to be made.  I hope that the committee I suggest will have power to send for papers and for officials to explain what is proposed, together with the power to urge on Ministers the desirability of amending regulations.</P>
    <P>It has been the lot of many members here to meet individual cases of injustice and hardship.  We are told that hard cases cannot be accepted as justification for amending regulations because hard cases make bad law.  If we had a reviewing committee sitting permanently, entrusted with the duty of examining regulations, that would prevent injustice and hardship and the unendurable situation that can exist when justice is not being done because the regulation does not permit it to be done; this House has given the Minister power to do something and we are unable to take effective action to rectify an intolerable situation.  The Minister's answer will be that amending legislation may be introduced to qualify the Minister's powers or require certain things to be done but it is unlikely, in my opinion, that an individual member of this House will undertake the onerous and difficult task of trying to ensure amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister is providing for safety regulations to be made in regard to mines and quarries.  The powers we are conferring on the Minister in this regard are, in the main, permissive.  I am concerned with the fact that the Factories Acts and other legislation passed in this House have allowed regulations to be made for the safety of workers and operatives in various industries and I am aware that in a large number of cases the necessary regulations have not been made.  I think the Department has been unduly dilatory in making safety regulations, particularly in relation to weights to be carried and other matters of that kind.  It has occurred on many <Col N="177" /> occasions, when workers have sought legal redress for injuries received in the course of their occupations, that when their legal advisers sought advice from the Department of Industry and Commerce, or sought amongst our Statutory Instruments, some guidance as to what was a safe mode of working or what was safe equipment, they found no guide or regulations as far as conditions here were concerned.  In many cases also people have been obliged to look to Britain, to examine British Statutory Instruments or to write to the British Stationery Office to get information.  In most cases where such information has been sought, certainly in my experience, there was some kind of record or guidance available in Britain.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate that the Minister may not have the staff at his disposal to make all the necessary or desirable regulations but if the adoption of regulations available elsewhere would cut out a certain amount of work, it might be desirable to do it.  Certainly we should not be assuming that we are discharging our duty in this House by simply permitting Ministers to make regulations when we know of cases where we have already given the permission and the necessary regulations have not been made.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear from the Minister, if I understood him rightly, that workers who have the right to inspect mines and quarries have not been exercising that right.  One would hope that the trade unions would encourage workers regularly to inspect mines and quarries.  We know that the injuries and pain that can be suffered where there is an accident in a mine or quarry can be very considerable. In many cases death can be caused and in others very serious injuries, and it would appear most desirable that those mostly affected by defects in quarries and mines, or in equipment, should take the necessary steps to inspect them and having done so, ask the advisory councils which the Minister suggests for the necessary protective measures to be taken before accidents occur.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that he is removing the specific statutory rule which prohibits engaging people under <Col N="178" /> 14 years of age below ground.  I would be happy about that if I were certain that the regulations which the Minister proposes to substitute instead of the specific section now in operation, were to be made in time but again I am afraid our experience with Government Departments has been that regulations trail along until the social conscience of the people requires something new.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that the regulation will be made more quickly than amending legislation but I do not think that always follows.  I do not think it is desirable in an important matter like the age of employees that we should shed our responsibility.  That is something that lies peculiarly and specially on the shoulders of legislators as legislators and it is not a moral responsibility which should be passed on casually to the administrator or the Executive.</P>
    <P>Subject to these remarks, we on this side welcome the Bill.  We appreciate that it is primarily a Committee Stage Bill because it is only by the examination of each clause and phrase that we can understand its implications. We will certainly give to the Minister in the consideration of this Bill the co-operation and assistance which we feel it deserves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that most of the enactments governing mines and quarries in this country are based on British Acts dating as far back as 1892 indicates clearly that after a lapse of some 92 years, legislation of this kind by an Irish Government is long overdue.  It is true to say that we have come a long way in mining from the days of Keir Hardy when child labour was exploited at a very tender age and children as young as ten or 11 years were employed in British mines.  They were obliged to work excessively long hours&mdash;from 12 to 14 hours per day was not unusual in those days.  They were exploited in every sense of the word by unscrupulous coal barons.  There was no regard whatever for the health, safety or welfare of these workers.  They were confined to the bowels of the earth, hewing out coal or in charge of pit ponies, working in darkness and excessive <Col N="179" /> damp which had a ravaging effect upon their health and many of them died young.</P>
      <P>We have not the same history of coal mining or mineral research as they have in Britain; nevertheless in those mines that we have, we have an obligation to ensure that the people employed therein are employed in decent conditions, with adequate wages and adequate safeguards for their health.  In my opinion, and I speak as a Deputy who is familiar with mines as there are mines in my constituency, I regard mining, especially of coal, as the most arduous, the most dangerous and the most exacting on health, of any employment.  Sad to say also it is insecure.  The legislation laid down in this Bill is welcomed by us in the hope that after the completion of the Committee Stage, we will have evolved a miner's and a quarry worker's charter which will guarantee them the most modern conditions of employment to which they are justly entitled, with decent rates of pay, the elimination of any semblance of exploitation, and adequate health, safety and sanitary facilities.</P>
      <P>There is much in the Bill which we welcome but there is much left out which we would like to have seen included. Pending the more conclusive observations of the unions involved in mining and quarrying, we will have a most important contribution to make on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to note at section 57 that waste must be ventilated and that the appropriate steps must be taken to minimise dangerous emissions from waste of inflammable or noxious gas. We all know the very high incidence of accidents in mining.  We have seen most tragic and heartrending scenes in films in recent years, and we have read of such accidents in the papers, caused by inflammable gas, an inrush of water, or the collapse of shafts which were not properly shored up. We know of miners who sustained injuries or lost their lives as a result of explosions in mines.  We know also, as Deputy Pattison pointed out, that such accidents are the results of inadequate <Col N="180" /> precautions, and that there is inadequate compensation.</P>
    <P>This measure could be perfected if the Minister had regard to the modern times in which we live, and the necessity for the inclusion in a measure such as this of the very desirable fringe benefits for which the trade union movement is agitating today; proper sickness benefit for miners or quarry workers who may be obliged to lay off from this very exacting work and the urgent necessity for an adequate superannuation or pension scheme for such workers and, above all, the necessity that they should have a feeling of security.  Our mines and quarries should be made secure and the workers given the feeling that they have secure employment and are not at the mercy of an employer who can indiscriminately lay them off if he is experiencing any difficulty, irrespective of the contribution they, and their fathers before them, made to the wealth of the company concerned.  Those people should at least get the contributory old age pension at the age of 65 years.</P>
    <P>We welcome the measures in the Bill which lay down that there shall be adequate sanitary arrangements in the mines and facilities for washing and so on.  Those of us who have seen miners at work, and coming from work, have been appalled at their condition, and many of them are very young.  They are covered all over with dust and sometimes they are dripping with water, having worked for seven or eight hours in the bowels of the earth. Many of them must go home, perhaps to a council cottage, and there undress and wash themselves.  I respectfully submit that one cannot adequately wash oneself in a basin in a council cottage, having regard to the kind of work that is involved in mining.  It is essential that adequate washing facilities be provided, and the services provided should be availed of by the miners.</P>
    <P>I wonder why it is still necessary to retain section 106, and similar sections relating to the employment of women and children.  I take it that it is a carry over from the English Act.  I am aware that in the bad old days it was common to employ young boys and, <Col N="181" /> indeed, young girls, underground in mines in Wales, England and Scotland. I am not aware that ever happened here.  We did not have that mining tradition here; otherwise, perhaps the same exploitation would have taken place here also.  It is quite unnecessary to have regulations to replace the existing prohibition on employment below ground of boys under 14 years, or of women and children.  If the Minister examines the situation in Irish mines and quarries, I think he will find that boys under 14 years are not employed, and girls are not employed except in offices as secretaries, or clerks, or typists, and the offices are usually somewhat removed from the mine proper.  I do not see any reason why that stipulation should be laid down in these modern times.  There is no necessity for it.</P>
    <P>I have been looking up the regulations governing the duties of quarry managers, and the deputies which the Minister's Department will probably appoint to supervise the quarries and mines and see that they conform to the regulations.  I understand that an owner is entitled to designate himself as manager of a mine.  I question the wisdom of that.  In the regulations the Minister is insisting on certain technical and engineering qualifications.  It may well be that a manager is operating a mine from a long distance. He may not be domiciled, in, or a native of, this country at all.  I think we should ensure that a manager is not merely readily identifiable, as the measure says, but also readily available when an emergency arises and his services are required.  He should also have the technical qualifications to cope with his responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In regard to the qualifications laid down in this Bill for managers, I suggest to the Minister that we have some managers of quarries or mines who may not have any degree, or any technical qualification, but have been doing the job satisfactorily over a long period of time.  I have been asked to request the Minister to ensure that such people will not be interfered with in their employment.  If they do their work to the satisfaction of their <Col N="182" /> employers, they should not be interfered with by reason of the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to see section 70 and other sections which require that the productions of inflammable or injurious dust below ground be minimised, and set out the measures which the mine manager must take to deal with any such dust produced below ground or in a building on the surface. It is true to say that a great deal of ill health and disease amongst miners is the result of dust.  There is the miners' disease, known as pneumoconiosis, which would seem to be prevalent in certain mines in this country. We welcome any step the Minister may take to minimise that scourge.  We welcome everything in this Bill which will ensure that these mines will be properly ventilated and that the noxious gases, and so on, are eliminated to as great an extent as possible.</P>
    <P>I must point out to the Minister that there seems to be a conflict between the Department of Social Welfare and the insurance companies governing workmen's compensation in relation to claims by miners who are suffering from pneumoconiosis.  The Minister ought to remedy this anomaly which I shall strive to outline.</P>
    <P>It has come to my notice that when a miner has an ailment of the lungs and applies for disability benefit to the Department of Social Welfare he is told that he is not entitled to such benefit and should seek workmen's compensation.  The claim having gone to those dealing with workmen's compensation, the applicant is informed that the matter is not the responsibility of the workmen's compensation section but rather is that of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>There is a dispute as to responsibility in this matter.  Seemingly, the Department of Social Welfare insist that this ailment is caused as a result of the employment pursued by the applicant and that consequently any claim for benefit arises under workmen's compensation.  On the other hand, the insurance company say, in effect: &ldquo;No.  This is merely a chest ailment, an ordinary ailment, and <Col N="183" /> consequently we are not responsible.&rdquo; I have dealt with some cases of this kind.</P>
    <P>While the battle was being waged between the Department of Social Welfare and the insurance company governing workmen's compensation, the miner who in certain instances was married and had a large family was obliged to seek home assistance and to live for a number of weeks on home assistance until the whole problem was resolved.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at this problem and to see if he can pin responsibility on either the Department of Social Welfare or the insurance company governing workmen's compensation, thus ensuring that payment is made promptly when a miner is obliged to lay off work on grounds of any respiratory trouble, pneumoconiosis or chest ailment of any kind.</P>
    <P>It was hoped that the Factories Act, 1955, would do great things for industrial workers.  I understand it is also applicable to mines and quarries, which are listed here.  The then Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce, the late Mr. William Norton, piloted that Bill through this House.  That excellent measure which could do so much good for industrial workers, in particular, has not been availed of to the extent to which the trade union movement would desire.</P>
    <P>The Factories Act, 1955 gives power to the workers and their trade unions to appoint a factory committee to look into questions of safety, general health, ventilation, sanitation, adequate lighting and heating facilities, and so on. Although workers in factories, shops, mines, quarries and so on, have the power under that Act to set up such a committee they have not availed of it to the extent we would desire.  I do not know whether or not it is attributable to the lack of factory inspectors or to the approach of these factory inspectors in that when they visit a premises or a factory they are more inclined to treat at all times with the employer and show a scant respect for the operatives.  There is an obligation on these gentlemen, who are charged with the implementation of <Col N="184" /> the Factories Act, which is also contained in this new measure, to see to it that the workers are also consulted.</P>
    <P>The measure is not being implemented for the sole benefit of the employer.  Rather is it being implemented for the benefit of the worker. The aim is to ensure that the intolerable conditions under which so many people worked for so many years will end and that there will be satisfactory sanitation, heating, lighting and safety conditions, and so on, with a view to safeguarding life and limb.</P>
    <P>Where there are factory committees, these inspectors should consult with them on every visit.  Even where there are not such committees, there should be a greater enticement to appoint committees by a direct approach&mdash;if necessary on the floor of the job&mdash;by these inspectors.  It is not good enough that they go to a plant, factory or office and are escorted in and out by a member of the staff, without bidding the time of day to the workers on the job.  At the same time, the trade union movement is not without blame in that, as well, it has not been able to inculcate in its members the responsibility which is theirs to set up committees under the Factories Act, 1955. May I express the hope that the workers in the mines, for whom we are now legislating, will avail fully of these provisions?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give us some time before the Committee Stage in order to consult with our respective unions and workers' organisations so that we may convey to him our views on how this Bill might be improved. We have given some views already.  It is our desire that this Bill will prove to be a miners' charter, a quarry workers' charter.  We hope that it will mean a greater sense of security for workers, a greater feeling that a man is benefiting from the wealth he creates and is sharing adequately in the wealth which he produces.  We trust that he shall be safeguarded on the job not merely in respect of safety, sanitation and health generally but that he shall be given a wage which will enable him to maintain his family in at least frugal comfort.  Moreover, we trust that cognisance will be taken of <Col N="185" /> the fringe benefits to which I have adverted&mdash;the desirability that in sickness, infirmity and old age a worker is properly provided for.  These are the fringe benefits on which the trade union movement today lays greater emphasis than on an actual increase in wages.</P>
    <P>Above all else, on this question of security, the Minister should have appreciated that most of the mines in this country are not State controlled. They are still in the hands of private enterprise and whatever difficulties are experienced, when any economic illwind blows which ruffles the profits of these mines, we have the problem of redundancy rearing its ugly head. Miners and quarry workers have no semblance of security.  The Minister should appreciate that and see whether or not we can include in this measure a provision which will allow for the payment of redundancy compensation in respect of the lay-off of men at any given time.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Pattison from the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny who was concerned some time ago about the possibility of redundancy in a mine in his area.  As a result of the inrush of water to this mine there was a likelihood, were it not for generous State aid coming to the rescue, of a sizeable redundancy problem being created there and a large number of men laid off.  It was through no fault of the employer they became redundant, but they would, perhaps, never find work in that mine again.  They were laid off under circumstances where there was no provision for adequate compensation, or redundancy pay, of any kind.  In other words, they were sent out on the unemployment scrap heap.  The small allowance which is provided nowadays for unemployment is totally inadequate to maintain a family.</P>
    <P>We would wish to see this measure evolve into that kind of miners' charter which would give these men a new impetus, new hope, new courage and new enthusiasm to work not merely for the betterment of themselves and the betterment of their employer but for the benefit of our <Col N="186" /> community.  It is sad to think that the mineral resources of our country are not being exploited as we would desire. We hope this measure will revive interest in the mineral deposits of this country&mdash;zinc, copper, lead and coal&mdash; and that the State will take a more active part in exploration of this mineral wealth.  It is tragic that there should be such untapped natural wealth abounding, and lying dormant and unexploited at a time when we have a vast labour pool denied the means of a livelihood.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to those who are responsible for drawing up the Mines and Quarries Bill of 1964.  It seems to me they are men who know their job and are familiar with the sufferings, the hardships and the dangers involved in mining and are anxious to do a good job of work in respect of this measure.  In all that it contains for the improvement of the livelihood of these people, we welcome this measure and we shall, please God, on Committee Stage have some further observations to make which we believe will improve this measure and make it the kind of miners' and quarry workers' charter we desire.  It is evident we shall not get another opportunity for improving this particular Bill for a long time to come and we wish, therefore, to avail of the opportunity on the Committee Stage to peruse it in greater detail and give the Minister and his Department the views of the workers and the trade unions concerned.</P>
    <P>Let me express the hope that, when this Bill has been enacted those engaged in mining and quarrying in this country will feel that it was worthwhile and that they will have a greater sense of security in their work than heretofore.  In respect of the State quarries to which the Minister refers, I should like to ask whether they include the many quarries being operated in this country by local authorities.  If the Minister is expressing a view in respect of State quarries and State mines, would he indicate clearly whether these are deemed to be quarries which we know are owned, controlled and operated by the local authorities?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="187" /> By and large, we welcome this measure and hope to improve upon it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is an urgently required piece of legislation, more particularly in view of the fact that it is now obvious that we have great mineral wealth untapped in this country.  Recent discoveries in Galway and parts of Mayo have proved that and, in preparation for obvious future development, this Bill is timely.  However, it is not so much the legislation enacted in the Bill which counts as the regulations which will be formulated as a result of this legislation. I should like the Minister to bear in mind, in the formulation of any such regulations that he should be sane and sensible and ensure that these are not like some of the lunatic ones formulated under the recently passed Planning Act.  There is no use introducing regulations purely for the sake of raising handy money, or regulations which obviously victimise certain sections of our community.</P>
      <P>Any regulations introduced under an Act should be sensible and sane and should not in any way involve the placing of undue hardships on any of the parties involved.  We have reached a position where regulation supersedes legislation.  At this stage of our development it is hard to know whether it is for better or worse that such a position should arise.  I believe that where the Minister himself will have common sense is in seeing through any flaws in regulations put before him by officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible in the near future, if some of the present developing areas prove worthwhile, we will have more foreigners coming into this country. They may be coming in for our good to some extent, but my own candid opinion is that, generally speaking, they will not come in unless they know quite well it is for their own good.  If it were only to protect our people against those who come in with the idea of exploiting us, this Bill is most important. I am glad to say that the employment of juvenile labour in mines and quarries is, as far as I know, at an end but some of those get-rich-quick people <Col N="188" /> from outside may still think we are backward enough to tolerate that kind of thing.  This measure makes it possible for us to take steps to prevent it.</P>
    <P>I trust that the position under this legislation will not be that the owner of a mine will be regarded as the manager of that mine.  If that were to be the situation, we could have a rich Egyptian coming in here as the owner of a mine.  He might not know the English language, let alone have a knowledge of mining, yet he could be appointed as manager, as a competent person to manage a mine.  It is very important that nobody will be accepted as manager of a mine unless he is competent.  Nobody should get away with murder even if he is a moneyed foreigner.  I am sure the Minister agrees with me.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in this Bill because it is likely that mining may become important in the western part of the country in the near future. It is obvious to all that there must be great mineral wealth unexploited in the West.  By the time it comes to be exploited I should like to see the regulations provided for in this Bill fully working, fully tested.</P>
    <P>Our main objective here is the protection of workers in mines and quarries and while we may be inclined to busy ourselves overmuch with mines, we should not forget quarries. In the matter of quarries, local authorities are the greatest offenders in the State.  For years they have been setting up crushers at every crossroads in the country but they have made no effort to protect their workers from rain, wind, hail but particularly from dust. They have never introduced any type of sprinkling system to prevent the dust rising.  It is true of practically all local authorities who operate quarries.</P>
    <P>It is a shocking state of affairs that because they are public bodies they can get away with downright murder. They are nothing better than potential murderers when they allow this dust to get into people's lungs.  I hope the Minister will look into this matter most closely so that local authorities will in this respect be subject to the same stringent regulations as private <Col N="189" /> operators of quarries&mdash;that steps will be taken not only to prevent accidents but to protect quarry workers from this dust menace.</P>
    <P>If the regulations under this measure are to be of any value, inspectors must be employed to enforce them.  Those inspectors must be men of integrity and ability, men who will go out and not be afraid to take action, no matter how drastic, against people contravening this Bill when it becomes law.  It is no use sending out as inspectors fellows who have better eyelids than eyes, fellows who would close their eyes to offences.  The whole value of the Bill will be defeated if competent inspectors are not appointed.  Despite the fact that most of the important quarries in the country are situated beside trunk roads, I have never heard of a prosecution in my county.  I hope that when these regulations are introduced, the Minister will not hesitate to have them enforced.  I am glad the Bill is before the House and hope it will get through in the best possible form, as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have established in the House a special procedure for the codification of many branches of our laws.  I put it to the Minister that what is required here is to get all mining and quarry law into the one Act.  I fear we are falling into the same mistake we made in regard to the Official Secrets Act.  We are trying to amend the law and codify it by the same Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister before that when we are seeking to codify law, the sensible thing to do is to take all the statutes requiring amendment, to amend them, then codify them by bringing in one Bill and putting it through the codification machinery the House has provided.  In that way you effectively get in one Bill all the laws relating to mines and quarries.  The Minister has tried to do that here, but if you look at the Table on page 41 and the First Schedule on page 65, you find that the Table on page 41 sets out that certain sections apply to quarries only.  When you come to the First Schedule on page 65, you find that in many cases we are repealing <Col N="190" /> the whole Act but we are retaining apparently part of the Payment of Wages in Public Houses (Prohibition) Act, 1883, 46 and 47 Vict. c. 31.  Manifestly, our whole purpose here is to ensure that somebody advising mine owners will not have to refer back to the Payment of Wages in Public Houses (Prohibition) Act, 1883.</P>
    <P>It is established what the form will be in relation to quarries and mines in Ireland.  If we made what amendments were necessary to that old Act, we could then have repealed it <i>in toto</i> and reassured the people concerned with mines and quarries that it was no longer necessary.  If we look further down at the list of repeals, we will find that in another Act there is total repeal but in the Notice of Accidents Act, 1906, 6 Edw. 7, c. 53, the extent of repeal is sections 1, 2, 3 and 5. Whether the balance of that Act has any reference to mining and quarrying in this country is a question that will have to be investigated by anybody seeking to advise those concerned with mines and quarries.  If you look further down, you will find that we have repealed section 10 of the Police (Factories) Act and further down we have repealed section 19 of the Mining Act of 1920, c.50.  Out of the Factories Act of 1955, we have deleted sections 21 to 28.</P>
    <P>I think that procedure invites confusion. If we had introduced a Bill dealing with all these amendments and then produced a Mining and Quarries Bill, 1964, we would be in a position to say authoritatively to everybody concerned that there would no longer be any need to consult any other statute in regard to the law regulating mines and quarries because there would be no other statute operative except the Mines and Quarries Act, 1964.</P>
    <P>This is a non-controversial measure to provide for regulations regarding mines and quarries, some of which require to be brought up to date but there are two matters to which I would like to refer.  Deputy Treacy referred to the disease known as pneumoconiosis which affects miners.  There <Col N="191" /> is an absolute statutory obligation on mine owners to make whatever provision is necessary to prevent the incidence of pneumoconiosis and its appearance is conclusive evidence of neglect on the part of the mine owner and the question of damages lies against him. There is an absolute obligation on the mine owner to take such precautions as may be necessary to prevent a dust situation in his mine when he starts mining operations.  That is as it should be.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has seen in the old days an elderly miner dying of pneumoconiosis will agree that such a man is entitled to whatever damages he can obtain against the mine owner for allowing such conditions to obtain.  I appreciate that the Minister may say that there is separate legislation dealing with industrial diseases but I would put it to him that there are forms of respiratory diseases in mines which do not seem to come within the general statutory description of pneumoconiosis. It would be well if the whole position was re-examined and that absolute liability was placed on the mine owner to ensure that such conditions would not obtain in his mine which would give rise to this industrial disease.</P>
    <P>The last matter to which I wish to refer is this.  In regard to the Shipping Acts there are statutory obligations placed on shipping companies to ensure that where they carry passengers certain safety drills will be carried out at regular intervals.  This is done for the simple reason that there is no use having safety equipment if nobody knows how to use it.  There is nothing more ghastly than to have a mining catastrophe in which men are entombed in the ground and I would be glad to hear if there is any power which requires the mine owner to have provision made for dealing with such a contingency if it should arise.  It may be that our mining operations are on so limited a scale that we ought to consider having some central rescue service to which all mine owners would contribute and which would be available to them in case of accidents.  The progress made in recent years in the <Col N="192" /> invention of equipment for that purpose has been remarkable and we have all noted with admiration the equipment operated in Germany for the rescue of men entombed in a mine without which equipment they would have been lost.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will say to me that this kind of equipment is of so unique a character that its availability must be based on an international agreement but I doubt if that is so. The Minister will be able to tell us, when he is replying, if it is so.  I would suggest that any comprehensive measure dealing with mines and quarries should have regard to that contingency and we ought, if practicable, to place on mine owners the obligation of providing such equipment or of making arrangements for the use of such equipment in the shortest possible time where the necessity may arise.  I can conceive a situation in which we might make an arrangement with the Mine Owners Association of Great Britain, if the installation of such equipment is beyond our own resources but, one way or the other, that is a matter to which we all have to have regard.  When we are legislating in a definitive manner with regard to mines and quarries this is a provision which should be made.</P>
    <P>This is a long and detailed Bill.  It is not easy to examine it with the care it deserves for Committee Stage consideration in this House.  I am glad, and I desire to acknowledge this, that when the Bill first came out it was not accompanied by a White Paper but when we directed the Minister's attention to this he was courteous enough and obliging enough to arrange for a White Paper to be provided.  Even with the White Paper it is not an easy Bill to master without careful examination. I would have preferred to deal with an amending Bill first and to then have a codification Bill and I would suggest that in any future codification operation the Minister should adopt that procedure and avail of the codification machinery which we have provided for the better convenience of those who have to deal with such technical matters.</P>
    <Col N="193" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of what Deputy Dillon has said about amending and codification legislation. It is difficult to deal with both in the one measure but, as the Deputy is aware, there has been a lot of amending and bringing-up-to-date of legislation in my Department in the last couple of years and there is naturally a desire to get things done as quickly as possible to keep pace.  I will accept the Deputy's advice in the case of future codification legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon and other Deputies referred to the prevalence of pneumoconiosis amongst miners.  Unfortunately, it occurs even in mines where all the necessary precautions are taken and respiratory and preventive equipment is available.  It is not easy to oblige a particular mine owner to carry the full burden of personal disability through pneumoconiosis.  A mine owner may employ a workman who has already contracted the disease.  I think that is one of the problems Deputy Treacy was referring to when he mentioned that insurance companies who carry mining risks often are in conflict with the Department of Social Welfare.  Insurance companies allege that the pneumoconiosis from which the insured person might suffer was not contracted in the course of the employment they had insured but may have arisen in previous employment.  I understand that is often the case and is one of the difficulties involved.  Nevertheless, I am under the impression&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that the Department of Social Welfare are not that intransigent about paying disability benefit. They usually do pay if a man is unable to work because of the condition of his health.  If it is established at a subsequent date that that condition arose out of an accident or conditions arising from his employment, the Department of Social Welfare usually seek recompense from the insurance company or the employer who is primarily responsible for the employment of the man in which he incurred that disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may not have been quite correct in his reference to insurance cover.  I know the mine owners have <Col N="194" /> considerable difficulty in getting insurance cover because of the size of the premiums insurance companies request from mine owners for the cover of men who work for them.  Again, that is largely brought about by the inherent physical danger involved in mining and, secondly, because of the difficulty of establishing when pneumoconiosis first took effect in a man's lungs.  The mining owners came to me some time ago to see if I could do something to help.  I have been trying to do all I can, but it is a difficult problem to resolve.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned a number of details which will be dealt with more adequately on Committee Stage.  I agree with him and other Deputies that nobody in this House wants to gain political kudos from this Bill.  Our whole purpose is to ensure that this legislation is enacted in the best way suited for what we want, that is to ensure that conditions of employment, safety methods and all other matters pertaining to mining are properly covered.  I hope to give the House an adequate opportunity of helping me ensure we will have a good, workable piece of legislation when it ultimately emerges.</P>
    <P>With regard to safety generally and to anticipate, if we can, mining difficulties, there is provided in this Bill a section which will enable regulations to be drawn up to have certain training carried out.  It is a good idea that such training should not only be carried out at some stage but, as Deputy Dillon suggests, that there should be periodic exercises in that type of training. We have not at the moment any special equipment on hands to deal with specific mining difficulties, such as cave-ins, because the type of equipment used on such occasions is exactly the same type as mining operators use for drilling, boring and other operations. However, there is a very active Mines and Quarries Association in the country, composed of people who own mines or are managers of mines, and there are many technical people associated with them.  I know of my own knowledge that they have come together to pool their resources on mining <Col N="195" /> operations.  I feel sure, apart altogether from the activities of the advisory council, that this is an aspect of mining to which this association will have full regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy is not quite right in suggesting that this is a Bill in which we could provide for certain fringe and other benefits for miners.  This is a Bill primarily designed to ensure, as far as we can, that the utmost safety precautions are applied to mining and to ensure that mine owners and managers will have the kind of safe equipment and type of operation to ensure the safety and health of their workers. Conditions of employment, such as wages, fringe benefits and redundancy pay, are matters outside the scope of the Bill, and I am sure Deputy Treacy will realise that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison asked about the advisory council.  The council will consist, as the section provides, of a chairman and eight members.  I do not think the qualifications of the eight members have been set out.  If any difficulty arises about the adequate representation of miners as against mine owners, we can take this matter up on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by Deputy Treacy was that it should not be necessary to prohibit the employment of women and children in underground mines&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Leneghan referred to the possibility of an owner not having sufficient qualifications to appoint himself a manager.  The qualifications required for a manager will be set out in the regulations to be prescribed under the Bill.  It will not be sufficient for an owner to say willy-nilly that he appoints himself a manager and therefore satisfies the legislation. Not only will the manager have to be qualified but, whether he is the owner or not, he will have to be in attendance at the mine daily for consultation or, if not, a qualified man must be in attendance as his deputy. These obligations are clearly set out in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister have regard to the plea I made that managers of quarries who are carrying out their duties satisfactorily now will not have their employment imperilled by this new legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a section which, I think, will enable that to be done.  We can come to that on Committee Stage.  I do not think there is any difficulty arising in the case mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked whether certain regulations now in force by reason of the enactment of previous legislation would continue in force. Section 11 provides that this will be the case.  So, on that score, Deputy Cosgrave need have no particular worries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the regulations to be made, Deputy Richie Ryan made certain references to the undesirability of legislation by way of regulation.  No matter what objections he and other members of his Party might have to <Col N="197" /> this type of regulation under the aegis of legislation, in a case like this it is necessary.  We may provide to the widest possible extent in a Bill like this that certain things may not be done in mines, that certain substances may not be brought near mines but it is quite possible that substances or equipment not now regarded as dangerous might be discovered at a later stage to be dangerous.  It is better that there should be a quick method of dealing with eventualities or situations like that.  I suggest that the regulations made under a Bill of this nature are the best means of covering matters like that.</P>
    <P>In addition, of course, the advisory committee will have power, not only at the request of the Minister but of their own initiative, to take certain action which could include advising the Minister about the necessity for regulations or a difficulty about complying with regulations or the inadequacy of regulations.  Therefore, in regard to the regulations that will be made under this Bill, apart altogether from the obligation of their being placed on the Table of the House, there will be adequate means of supervision and amendment as occasion requires.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Treacy that it is unfortunate that workers have not set up safety committees under the Factories Acts.  That, of course, is their own fault.  Arising out of that point, I want to assure Deputy Treacy that inspectors under the Factories Acts do not ignore workers in factories.  I have heard that complaint.  I have also had the complaint that inspectors pillory factory owners.  It is only natural, if an inspector visits a factory, that he will go to the manager or personnel manager or somebody in charge, inform him of his presence and then proceed to visit the various parts of the factory.  The fact that the inspector is accompanied by the factory manager or the personnel manager does not necessarily imply that he is in any way under the influence of the factory management generally.  On the contrary I have received complaints that some of these inspectors start looking for too much, make too many complaints and often bring prosecutions over matters that might easily have <Col N="198" /> been remedied on the spot had the factory management got adequate notice.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the factory inspectorate in the Department of Industry and Commerce are carrying out their duties in a most satisfactory manner.  There are very few factories, if any, that they do not visit at least once a year and there are many factories, no matter how small, that they visit at least a couple of times a year.  The mining inspectorate in the Department is competent and will be able to carry out its duties in an impartial manner without in any way favouring a mine owner to the detriment of the mine or quarry worker.  To answer a final question put by Deputy Treacy, those county council quarries do, in fact, come under the definition of State-owned property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister one question.  I mentioned to him that some ambiguity existed in regard to the definition of pneumoconiosis. I understand there is a statutory duty on mine owners to prevent the incidence of pneumoconiosis and if it arises in his mine that is in itself evidence of neglect on his part but pneumoconiosis has been declared by the courts to be a particular kind of lung inflammation associated with the inhalation of silica.  The question has arisen whether the inhalation of coal dust comes within the statutory definition of pneumoconiosis.  I would suggest to the Minister that the inhalation of any kind of dust in a mining or quarrying operation ought to come within the category of pneumoconiosis if it, in fact creates that condition. Perhaps the Minister will examine that question to see if any clarification is required in the safety regulation?</P>

Sometimes we are all approached with a remonstrance that such a thing has not been raised in Dáil Éireann but nobody mentions it until the Committee Stage of the Bill has passed.  I do not think there is any urgency in this.  If the Minister will set it down for the first sitting day after Christmas, it will let all take notice, and if they have any representations to make to trade unions, employers' federations or anybody else, they will have abundant time to do so and it is their own funeral if they do not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement last April announced that the Government had decided that additional rate relief on agricultural land to the extent of £1.4 million should be granted.  The purpose of the present Bill is to give legislative effect to the Government's proposals.  The Bill will apply to the three financial <Col N="200" /> years ending on the 31st March, 1967, and will increase the primary allowance from 70 per cent to 30 per cent of the general rate in the £ on land valuations up to £20 and on the first £20 of higher valuations.  It will also increase the supplementary allowance on land valuations over £20 from 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the general rate.</P>
    <P>The effect of these increases will be that the agricultural grant will total approximately £11 million in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The grant was originally given under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, as a fixed annual subvention providing a flat rate of relief on all agricultural land in county health districts. The basis of distribution and the total amount of the grant were varied under a number of enactments, but between 1898 and 1946 the amount of the grant was always a fixed amount, stipulated by each successive Act.</P>
    <P>The Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1946, changed this basis. It related the amount of the grant to the rates actually levied on land by county councils.  The Act provided that the grant would represent the sum needed to give relief of rates by way of a primary allowance amounting to three-fifths of the general rate in the £ on the land valuation up to £20, a supplementary allowance of one-fifth of the general rate in the £ on the land valuation over £20 and an employment allowance calculated at the rate of 10/- in the £ on the land valuation over £20, subject to the limitation that this allowance should not exceed £6 10. 0 for each adult workman employed on the holding during the whole of the preceding calendar year.  The agricultural grant was continued on this basis until the passing in 1953 of an amending Act which, as subsequently extended, applied to the nine financial years which ended on the 31st March, 1962.  That Act left the primary allowance unchanged, abolished the supplementary allowance and provided for an employment allowance of £17 in respect of each qualified workman, subject to the limitation that the total of the employment allowances would not exceed the rates on <Col N="201" /> the land valuation over £20.  The Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1962, stepped up the primary allowance from 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the rates on land valuations up to £20.  It revived the supplementary allowance and fixed it at 25 per cent of the general rate on land valuations over £20 and it left the employment allowance unchanged.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the grant increased from £2.91 million in 1946/47 to £5.84 million in 1961/62, £8.53 million in 1962/63 and £8.95 million in 1963/64.  The increase in the primary allowance to 80 per cent of the general rate, provided for in section 3 of the Bill, will cost an additional £994,000 and the increase in the supplementary allowance to 30 per cent under section 4 of the Bill will cost £375,000 extra bringing the total grant for the current financial year to an estimated £11.14 million.  The increased grant will have the effect of reducing the net rates leviable on agricultural land in the current year to less than the 1956/57 level.</P>
    <P>Of the total amount provided for the relief of rates on agricultural land in the current year the primary allowance will absorb an estimated £7.95 million. More than 77 per cent of all rated holdings of agricultural land in the State have valuations of £20 or less and under the proposals in the Bill, 80 per cent of the rates on these holdings will be borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer will, this year, bear more than 63 per cent of the total rates on land in county health districts as against 57 per cent in 1963/64 and 45 per cent in 1956/57.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has some interesting facets in it and we are in favour of it.  However, while the Bill now proposes to derate holdings of under £20 to the extent of 80 per cent, I suggest we ought to derate these holdings altogether, simply eliminate them.  This would greatly simplify the collection of the rate.  When more than 77 per cent of all rated holdings of agricultural land in the State have valuations of £20 or less and when we are already meeting 80 per cent of the rates on these holdings, it seems to me <Col N="202" /> to be spoiling the ship for a ha'p'orth of tar.  The simplification of rate collection which would result from eliminating the remaining 20 per cent would, I think, commend itself to most Parties in the House.  It will certainly come, and the difference involved in postponing it for one or two years should suggest to us all that we might as well not make any more bites of this cherry but derate all holdings of under £20 in valuation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it should be made available by the Exchequer.  Since 77 per cent of the agricultural holdings are under £20 valuation and there is only 20 per cent of those left, it is hardly worth collecting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason I asked the question is that I thought the Deputy might mean it might be borne by the other ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The sensible thing to do would be to derate the holdings under £20 and place the burden on the Exchequer.  That burden is not insubstantial. I want to draw the attention of the House to the facts revealed by the Minister's speech.  The total amount of the agricultural grant has increased from £2.91 million in 1946/47 to £11.14 million now.  That includes, of course, a growing degree of relief for agricultural land but it also reveals the staggering rate at which the rate burden is rising in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all inclined in this House, certainly I am, to think of rural Ireland as consisting exclusively of farmers, large and small, but I am a shopkeeper in rural Ireland as well as being a farmer and I live amongst small shopkeepers and householders in a country town.  I represent a constituency in which there are four or five medium-sized towns and a very large number of smaller towns, in all of which there are people struggling to keep little family businesses together or trying to maintain a home.  For all <Col N="203" /> of these people, the burden of rates is piling up steadily and when we from time to time pass legislation here taking over under the central Exchequer, parts of the burden on the land, we are only too prone to forget that that does nothing to relieve the residents in rural Ireland who live in towns and villages.</P>
    <P>When we advance on the road of completely derating small holdings and substantially relieving the rates of larger holdings, we are forgetting a quarter of the population of rural Ireland, that is, people who have a home or a small family business who I suggest to the House are now suffering a virtually intolerable burden to which sooner or later we shall have to turn our minds.  I think this is the appropriate time because as we provide legislation to relieve agricultural land of rates, we reach the stage where the Minister for Local Government concludes his speech by saying:</P>
    <P>The Exchequer will, this year, bear more than 63 per cent of the total rates on land in county health districts as against 57 per cent in 1963/64 and 45 per cent in 1956/57. </P>
    <P>Above that, he says:</P>
    <P>More than 77 per cent of all rated holdings of agricultural land in the State have valuations of £20 or less and under the proposals in the Bill, 80 per cent of the rates on these holdings will be borne by the Exchequer. </P>
    <P>That creates the impression in the minds of a great many Deputies that the rate burden is now being substantially taken over by the central Exchequer.</P>
    <P>While that may be true in respect of agricultural land, with special reference to the small holdings, it certainly is not true of the residents of small towns and villages and we are allowing the rate situation to get out of all control. There are some counties in Ireland today levying rates of £3 in the £.  When we think of a person operating a small shop in rural Ireland, who has a wife and children, doing his best to make a living with a valuation of maybe £10 <Col N="204" /> on his house and property, and realise that the increase in the rates from 20/- in the £ to £3 in the £ has imposed upon that man a charge of 10/- a week, then we appreciate that is a very formidable burden, and I think if anybody brought into the House a proposal that we should levy a tax of 10/- a week on them all there would be a revolution.  These are decent people.  They are hard working people. They have families to raise and make provision for and I want to avail of the occasion of this Bill to say a word on their behalf.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that these people are being squeezed out of existence and the impact of the growing rate burden upon them is becoming out of all proportion to the burden borne by anybody else.  We sometimes are inclined to say: &ldquo;Look at the people in the city of Dublin or the city of Cork.  Look at the rates they have to pay and look at the relatively large valuations upon which they are paying them&rdquo;.  What we forget is that the person who is paying rates on a valuable property in the city of Dublin has an advantage because every year he pays the rates the capital value of the premises on which he pays them is sky-rocketing. But take the person with the small shop in Clones, Monaghan, Castle-blayney, Carrickmacross or Ballybay, on whom the rates continue to rise and who has no corresponding capital appreciation in the value of the premises on which he is paying rates. If he tries to sell he very often finds it extremely difficult to get a buyer because the small country towns are not showing any tendency to expand. On the contrary.  With improved transport facilities the custom and trade tends to move more readily into the larger centres.</P>
    <P>I make two suggestions to the Minister. When we reach the stage of derating up to 80 per cent the holdings under £20 valuation, and when we realise these holdings represent 77 per cent of all the holdings, does he not think the time has come to finish the job?  The second suggestion I make is that, while it is a good thing to face the fact that small agricultural holdings <Col N="205" /> can no longer bear the burden of rates, as rates are today and threaten to continue, that proposition is equally true for the small householder and the small business man in the towns and villages up and down the country. Sooner or later that fact will have to be faced, but, in the meantime, if we again turn our backs upon the problem, there are small people in the towns and villages of rural Ireland who will be crushed out of existence.</P>
    <P>I have always been obsessed since I came into this House by the tendency which grows upon us all to think of problems globally and forget the impact on obscure individuals who are our neighbours.  There is no use telling a person who is driven out of his business, who ceases to be independent and has to go out and look for a job in middle age because the little business will no longer bear the burden of growing costs, that you cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs.  That is a very nice theory, provided you are not the egg.  We should be constantly vigilant in this House that we do not approach this problem with that philosophy.  This is a small enough country and we are close enough to one another to be solicitous for the individual as well as for the majority.</P>
    <P>I invite Deputies on both sides of the House to join with me in putting a case to the Minister for the householder and the small business family in rural Ireland, the small shop run by a widow woman or by a small family working together.  These people are being crushed out of existence by the burden of rates.  We acknowledge that it is necessary to lift 80 per cent of the rate for the small farmer.  When are we going to do something of the same kind for the small shopkeeper who is entitled to get his living in rural Ireland as well?  If the Minister is not in a position to say that he has any proposals to make about that now, it would be a help if he were in a position to say that the Government are sympathetic to that view because I feel bound to say that if and when we have authority in matters of this kind, we will feel it an obligation upon us to do justice to that section of the rural community as we seek to <Col N="206" /> have it done to those who actually live and get their living on the land.</P>
    <P>The other point is with regard to these abatements of rates provided for the relief of agricultural land.  I am right in saying, I think, that they do not apply to the rateable valuation of the house or buildings on the land. Now we ought to bear in mind that if the rate burden continues to grow and it is left to operate on the houses and farm buildings on a small holding, we are rapidly moving into a position in which we will be multiplying schemes to induce farmers to improve their houses and put up new farm buildings and equipment, while, at the same time, as the rate burden on these buildings grows, we are discouraging them from undertaking the very kind of expansion we seek to subsidise. That is a silly and contradictory procedure. It shows a complete absence of any planning on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not want unreasonably to expand the scope of the debate but we should bear in mind that in relieving agricultural land of its rates, there are other rate problems which, if they are not discussed now, may go unobserved. They cannot be discussed on the Minister's Estimate because they would involve legislation.  I will submit my point and I will readily understand if you, Sir, think it goes beyond the ambit of this particular legislation.  I do not think it does.  When we relieve the rates on the small holding up to 80 per cent by these grants, if that small holder carries out a scheme of reconstruction under the Minister's reconstruction grant scheme, substitutes a slated roof for a thatched roof, increases the size of the windows, improves the doors, puts in water and so forth, then that house, so far as I know, is liable to a revision of valuation. If he builds stables or out-offices under the Department's Farm Building Scheme, all these become liable.</P>
    <P>With rates standing anywhere between £2 in the £ and £3 in the £, it can very easily happen that the abatement we give here is more than swallowed up in the revision of valuation which may result from the improvements which the farmer seeks to carry out.  I <Col N="207" /> would suggest to the Minister that while we have made some concession in regard to farm buildings which are immune from rating for a period after construction, we ought to try to ensure that where a house is improved without increasing its cubic capacity, or where a shop is improved internally or externally without increasing the cubic capacity of the building, the Commissioners of Valuation should be inhibited from increasing the valuation.</P>
    <P>Subject to those observations, we are in favour of this Bill but we believe that in respect of the 77 per cent of the holdings whose rates are now relieved to the tune of 80 per cent, it would be much more sensible to finish the job in relation to the tune of 100 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from the county which has the lowest rate but the highest valuation on agricultural land, I feel this measure, while it is intended to help, does not exactly fit in with the requirements down there.  I quite agree with Deputy Dillon that having gone 80 per cent of the way, there does not seem to be any logical reason why we should not be able to complete the job and go the whole 100 per cent.  If it did nothing else, it would do away with certain administrative costs and there would be a substantial saving.  I am sure the Minister has looked into this and has an idea of how it should be dealt with, but I should like to remark that this question of the £17 employment grant does not offer any inducement to an employer to keep a man for 52 weeks of the year.  With present wage rates of something over £7 a week, or an average rate of somewhere nearer to £9, for the whole year, it represents less than two weeks pay. I have yet to see the employer who has kept on a workman because he was getting £17 rebate.  It does not serve any useful purpose and possibly it could be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing which has amazed me since I came into public life is the way in which the big farm with the small house pays a relatively small amount of rates while the small farm with a relatively large house, particularly if it has good stabling, pays quite <Col N="208" /> a substantial amount of rates.  That should not happen and I agree with Deputy Dillon that the system which has grown up of increasing the amount of rates, increasing the valuation of buildings, when they are improved, should be changed.  One thing which is a disgrace is that somebody who gets a county council labourer's cottage with one acre or less, very often finds that he is asked to pay anything up to 3/6d. a week rates on top of the rent. If a house is built under a grant, there would be no rates for the first year and it would only come under full rates after ten years, but if a man goes into a cottage, he has to pay full rates. Such people are often able to point out that they are paying per week for the cottage and the acre as much as their neighbour who has 200 acres is paying per year for each acre.</P>
    <P>The big farmer who is not working his land, if it is still left with him, should have to pay a much more substantial rate than he is paying.  This might be an awkward thing for the Department to administer but every assistance should be given to the small man who all the time finds it extremely difficult to exist.  There is no reason why the man who is making no use of it should be able to get that type of rebate and in fact over the last two Budgets he has received increased rebates to which he is not entitled.  The number of farms in the £20 category or less, according to the Minister, are more than 77 per cent of all rated holdings of agricultural land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Seventy per cent, is it not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Seventy-seven per cent, and 80 per cent of the rates on those holdings will be borne by the Exchequer. This poses another problem, that of the rate collector.  The rate collector who has to visit every ratepayer will, I am sure, find it much more inconvenient to visit the number of small holdings.  He might not get his money as easily from the big ones but one visit might cover as much ground as 20 visits to the smaller ones.  The remuneration of all these must be taken into account when an alteration <Col N="209" /> is being made and therefore Deputy Dillon is correct in suggesting that having gone so far we should now cover the 100 per cent and see whether or not it would improve the lot of the unfortunate people who are living on holdings under £20 valuation.  In addition, it would mean a big saving in the running costs of rates offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure so far as it goes but it does not go far enough by any means.  The distribution of the amount involved would appear to be a very generous gesture in a country this size but I would like to point out that as far as I know, the people I represent, and the people represented by western Deputies generally, will get very little indeed of this alleged generous handout. This would appear to be quite all right for the big midland farmer or, indeed, for the big farmer anywhere. It appears to me to be a measure deliberately designed to give the major benefit to the man who least requires and least deserves it.</P>
      <P>I have nearly always taken exception to the type of jargon used in Civil Service documents.  I do not know what interpretation other people may put on this sentence, but I find it difficult to put any interpretation on it other than my own.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>The Bill will apply to the three financial years ending on the 31st March, 1967, and will increase the primary allowance from 70 per cent to 80 per cent of the general rate in the £ on land valuations up to £20 and on the first £20 of higher valuations. </P>
      <P>Am I to take it that is a way of covering up the big man's gain?  Does it mean he will get this full allowance on £40 valuation?  I think the true interpretation is that the man with £40 valuation will get the same allowance on a percentage basis as the man with £4 valuation.  I regard that, if it is true, as grossly unfair.  I would be prepared to go to £15, or something like that.  I know other subtle changes are made, but it looks as if the man with £40 valuation will be as well catered for as the man with £4 valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is really a well-designed method <Col N="210" /> of feather-bedding the big farmer with a large valuation on his land and a proportionately meagre amount of valuation on his buildings.  Under this system he is getting away with downright murder.  The man in Mayo, west Galway, west Donegal, parts of Sligo, Roscommon and Kerry, has a higher valuation on his buildings than on his land and he gets a few meagre shillings of this handout of £11 million.  That is grossly unfair.  It means the rich man gets the subsidy, and not the poor man. Surely it is not beyond the imaginative capacity of the Minister to find some way of redressing that obvious wrong? In my constituency there are people with valuations of £3, £4, or perhaps only 30/-, on their land, and with valuations of £5, £6 or £7 on their buildings, and what will they get of this £11 million cake?  The Minister should seriously consider doing something for them.  If people in the West had £40 valuation, we would not be looking for any soft money from any source.  We would work the land and make it profitable.</P>
    <P>There is an even worse aspect.  While this £11 million handout is going, no man living in a town will get anything out of it, unless he owns land.  Surely at this stage, from travelling through the country, the Minister must know that small business people in towns have been very badly hit over the past few years because of the unprecedented increase in rates.  They are paying rates on a system of valuation.  The valuation increases as a result of the slightest improvement a man makes to his buildings.  Surely that is a brake on progress?  It is enough to keep a person from putting up as much as a new door.  If he alters the size of a window, he is reported, and his valuation, and consequently his rates, is increased. That is a grossly unfair way of dealing with such matters at this stage of our existence.  It may have been a simple way of dealing with them in the past when people were not very imaginative, but surely there must be some other solution today if we are not to shift all our people out of the towns.</P>
    <P>Of course, if it is national policy to wipe out towns, no better policy could be found than that which has been <Col N="211" /> followed for years and years past, but to my way of thinking, it is not a proper way of dealing with these matters. I see no reason why a man in a small town should not get some kind of subsidy on the valuation of his buildings, just as the man out in the country can get a subsidy on the valuation of his lands.  Many people in towns can get no grants of any description for carrying out improvements, while people in the country can get any grant they wish for.  The Minister should seriously consider finding some way out of this utterly fantastic and impossible rating position.  It is wrong, and if the Minister does not change it, some future Minister will definitely change it, no matter what steps he may have to take.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the great disparity in rates.  In my county the rates are well over £3 in the £, and I suppose in Meath they are not 30/- yet.  That means that industrialists will not come to Mayo, or other western counties, where rates are high, because it is cheaper to operate a business where rates are low, even if valuations are high.  The Minister should also very carefully examine that side of the problem.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking I welcome what the Minister has done.  It is a step in the right direction, although a very short or very small one.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the whole rating and valuation set-up, and come to the House in the near future with something better than what we have been used to getting for a number of years past.</P>

      <P>It is very interesting to see that we have now reached the stage where we can give an 80 per cent allowance on the first £20 of land valuation, and such valuations account for 77 per cent of the farms of this country.  The first two speakers seem to think it is hardly worth the candle and that we should go the whole hog in derating land.  I am delighted to hear that because the record over the years since 1898 does not indicate that anyone did anything to get as far as we did, except Fianna Fáil in 1946, 1953, 1962 and 1964.  It does not really stretch the <Col N="212" /> imagination on the part of the Leader of the Opposition, as it were, to forecast where Fianna Fáil are heading, when we have reached an 80 per cent rebate on 77 per cent of the holdings in the country, but we should keep in mind that those who advocate are not the people who have performed.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Tobacco (Control of Sale and Advertisement) Bill, 1964: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed : &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point that in proposing that some action of the kind recommended in the Bill be taken by the Minister, I was not proposing anything that was strange or unusual.  Already in our legislation we have many precedents for taking action, sometimes action the public might dislike but action which is taken <Col N="213" /> for reasons of health, public security or a better ordering of the society generally.</P>
      <P>I need hardly dwell on that but a point made by the Minister earlier on and taken up by a number of people in correspondence was that I appeared to get a certain delight out of restricting individual freedoms.  As an individualist myself, nothing could be further from the truth.  Anybody who knows me will realise that I should not like to interfere with individual freedom.</P>
      <P>Take the licensing laws, for example. Clearly, there are people who would like to drink all night but they are not allowed to do so.  This House exists for the passing of laws of one kind or another which restrict a freedom of one kind or another.  Cigarettes can be called a drug to some extent.  We have restriction on the sale of cocaine, hashish, marijuana, opium: I suppose a certain comparison can reasonably be drawn between the two.  They are all restricted by law.  No matter how much the public might think they enjoy using these drugs, or how much value they might get out of using these drugs, we do not permit them to use them.  We believe that that is in their interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To his embarrassment, I praised the Minister for introducing the 1947 Health Act, which contains a section which is relevant at this time. In section 65, the Minister has power to prohibit the advertisement of preparations to which certain regulations refer.  The section then goes on to require the printing on the outside of packets or containers in which the preparations are to be sold of the composition of such preparations and the prohibition on the sale of any preparation in a packet or container which has not printed on the outside thereof the preparation.  There are other paragraphs dealing in much the same way with undesirable substances or substances which it is desirable that the public should know they are taking in a drug, or in a medicine, or in a toilet preparation or in any other preparation that the Minister decides to lay down as being a preparation that <Col N="214" /> requires this condition that it shall not be advertised without his authority and, if it is advertised, the preparation contained in the packet will be stated on the outside.  Therefore, the Minister must accept the completely unexceptional nature of the proposals contained in my Bill now before the House.  In fact, the wording is very close to the wording of his own legislation.</P>
    <P>The summary conviction for breaking the Minister's law is £500, a fairly stiff fine, if the preparation contains a substance which he is of opinion involves a risk of serious injury to health or body.  I think I can show that the free sale and advertisement of cigarettes as at present&mdash;the wide promotion of cigarette sales as at present &mdash;implies the selling of a substance which involves a serious risk of injury to health or body.</P>
    <P>The fact has been noticed in most other countries, believed to be associated to some extent with the improvement in the standard of living, that there has been a widespread increase in cigarette consumption.  In our own case, cigarette consumption has gone from 3,400 thousand lbs.  in 1926 to 11,000 thousand lbs. in 1963.  With it, again noticed in most countries in which the matter has been looked into, have gone deaths from lung cancer. In 1925, the death rate was 56 and by 1962, it had risen to 697, quite a spectacular rise.</P>
    <P>Excessive cigarette smoking is a factor attributed to the other disease I mentioned&mdash;death from coronary heart disease.  The figures are: Deaths from coronary heart disease in 1950, 2,900; in 1962, 4,500&mdash;a very spectacular increase in the death rate.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to mislead the House by the lung cancer figures.  They are dramatic&mdash;a rise of from 56 to 697 deaths over 40 years.  The better diagnostic services available have made it easier now to diagnose lung cancer than it was at the time the earlier figures were available.  Therefore, to some extent, the great increase we now note is due to the much better facilities for diagnosing lung cancer.  There is, at the same time, the fact that there has been a proportionate dramatic increase <Col N="215" /> in the number of lung cancers diagnosed compared with a number of other cancers diagnosed.  All forms of cancer appear to have increased in their incidence but the rate of lung cancer is disproportionately high. Therefore, to that extent, I think the apparent increase due to better diagnostic facilities can be said to be ruled out.</P>
    <P>The real problem, I think, which is facing the Minister is the problem of revenue and that is a problem every country is facing in this matter.  I am giving these figures because it was in 1957 that the cancer scare first started, and I think it important that we should deal with these two figures.  I would imagine the revenue for 22 years would be astronomical if it were given.  That would be unfair because we are only concerned with the change in revenue since the public became aware of the danger of cancer from cigarette smoking. The two figures I have are 1957, £22 million; 1962, £30 million.  It is quite an increase, if you take into consideration other factors such as a falling population during a number of these years.  It is a considerable increase and even the lowest figure, £22 million, must weigh very heavily with the Minister for Health and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, when they are attempting to deal with this problem.  There must be a certain amount of ambivalence in their attitude in bringing about a significant reduction in the incidence of cigarette smoking in the country.</P>
    <P>It is important to notice that, in spite of the fact that the Minister for Finance put it forward as his reason for increasing taxation on at least one occasion, it really had no effect at all on the reduction in consumption.  The State is very much dependent on the continued existence at a high level of cigarette smoking.  The figure usually given is three out of four.  Apparently 75 per cent of the people smoke cigarettes so that the incidence is very high indeed and it is unfortunate that the State has a vested interest in the continued existence of this very high rate.</P>
    <P>Consideration was first given to this problem following a clever piece of <Col N="216" /> work by two general practitioners. They carried out what is called a retrospective examination of certain death rates in a number of people who died from lung cancer and they found a very definite relationship.  It was a crude experiment in its own way but was sufficiently important to worry the British Royal College of Physicians. From the information the two doctors, Doll and Hill, got from their small survey, they became worried and felt there was a reasonable case and believed there might be some association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.  The College of Physicians then established an inquiry into the whole matter.  They set up a committee to report on the question of smoking and atmospheric pollution in respect of cancer of the lung and other diseases.</P>
    <P>The first time I referred to the matter in the House was in 1958 when I put down a question to the Minister, and he was worried at that stage.  His general attitude was that he had drawn the attention of the public to the relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.  At that time it was very speculative and certainly not established with any great scientific certitude.  I would concede that.  Therefore 1956/57 was the beginning and then a series of surveys was carried out by the Americans, Canadians and some of the European countries.  In fact, 23 different investigations, in nine countries, were carried out.</P>
    <P>I think everybody will agree that the diversity of the inquiries carried out by all these necessarily independent authorities is one of the most striking factors in the minds of the sceptic, should he have any doubt at all as to the reliability of the conclusions arrived at.  The conclusions were practically universal in agreement on the dangers to health associated with cigarette smoking.  Various scientific tests were carried out which do not concern us here.  The simplest one was the fact that they were able to grow skin cancer in laboratory animals from the products of cigarette smoke.  That in itself was not absolutely final evidence but it was supporting evidence to all the other statistical inquiries carried out in <Col N="217" /> the most meticulous way by trained scientists with no vested interests whatever except in finding out the truth.</P>
    <P>A number of these inquiries carried out in the United States, Britain, the Netherlands and Canada were submitted to various independent authorities in order that they could assess the facts as ascertained by the various scientific tests.  The British Medical Research Council, the British Ministry for Health, the National Institute for Health, Canada, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Public Health, Netherlands, the United States study Group, the United States Public Health Services and the World Health Organisation are all absolutely above reproach when it comes to the question of the assessment of facts.</P>
    <P>The other compelling factor was the retrospective studies of how a person died from lung cancer, going back through their life and finding out what their cigarette smoking habits were, and, in that way, finding out whether lung cancer resulted from cigarette smoking.  The retrospective studies were borne out by prospective studies carried out on people who were asked what their smoking habits were.  These people were followed up for a number of years and when they died the prospective studies bore out the findings in the retrospective studies, that those who were heavy smokers increased the likelihood of lung cancer.</P>
    <P>Heavy smoking showed the highest rate, moderate smoking the next rate and the non-smoker represented the lowest rate in death from lung cancer. In the non-smoker the chance of dying before the age of 65 was one in six.  In the heavy smoker, the chance of dying before the age of 65 was one in three.</P>
    <P>There is another way of putting it. If one has a series of cards and one card is marked in a group of cards, a person aged 35 who is a heavy smoker, there is one card in 23, that is one chance in 23 of his dying from lung cancer within the next ten years.  In a person aged 35 who is a non-smoker, the chances are one in 90&mdash; one marked card in 90 in one case and in the case of the heavy smoker the chance is one in 23&mdash;a very considerable <Col N="218" /> increase in the risks of his getting lung cancer.  The average male cigarette smoker has nine to ten times the risk of developing lung cancer, and the heavy smoker 20 times the risk of getting lung cancer.</P>
    <P>In regard to coronary heart disease, the chief condition which causes excess deaths in cigarette smokers over non-smokers is coronary heart failure. Second place is given to lung cancer. There are other conditions, of course. One of them I mentioned last night, chronic bronchitis, which is also associated with cigarette smoking, is a very disabling disease which costs the State great sums of money.  Anybody in medical or hospital practice finds that a very considerable part of one's work, certainly as a physician, is in relation to persons disabled because of bronchitis of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>From observation, everybody is satisfied, scientific investigations have proved, that the rate of lung cancer in cigarette smokers is becoming a very serious question.  Also, there is the other point that there is a very high incidence of coronary heart failure in relatively young people associated with cigarette smoking.  These are disagreeable truths for people who have the cigarette habit, who find it difficult to stop cigarette smoking, but these are all scientifically established truths.  It does not rest with the individual person as to whether he will smoke or not: in view of the evidence, it appears that every possible assistance should be given to those who wish to stop smoking.  The State should help them to get rid of what I know myself to be a particularly difficult habit to give up, once started.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to give so many figures.  They tend to weary, but they tend also to impress the more intelligent. In regard to cigarette smoking habits in Ireland, Dr. Flynn in County Westmeath carried out investigations and found some interesting facts about the habit.  He showed that 24 per cent of boys and 12 per cent of girls started smoking where there were non-smoking parents in the family.  The rate for boys and girls where both parents smoked was 44 per cent and 18 per cent respectively&mdash;practically double <Col N="219" /> the percentage where the parents both smoked.  That is of interest to us later on, when we are dealing with the question of who should be educated and who should be, if possible, prevented from smoking.</P>
    <P>It has relevance in so far as cigarette smoking is a social habit, one which young people take up largely for imitative reasons, because they want to feel grown up&mdash;the Minister himself concedes that in his little booklet&mdash; particularly if the adult is an admired and respected person like the parent should be.  The likelihood of young people's smoking is very much greater if the parents in the home tend to smoke.</P>
    <P>Dr. Flynn's findings were supported by Dr. Corridan of the Cork Health Authority who found that in his area the rate of smoking was the same as in County Westmeath.  He had one interesting figure which, I think, illustrates the cumulative effect of smoking &mdash;the way it grows.  Incidentally, both doctors found that children started to smoke at the age of seven.  At the age of 11, apparently, they are well on their way to becoming habitues.  At 11, the rate is 22.3 per cent in Cork, the same as Westmeath.  At 12 the percentage is 23, at 13 it is 40 and at 14, 48 per cent&mdash;one in every two nearly.</P>
    <P>That was a survey of children in 27 schools between the ages of 11 and 14. Another disturbing fact, which is the Minister's worry, is that 78 per cent of the boys and 72 per cent of the girls were aware of the connection between smoking and lung cancer and did not deter them even at that stage.  The habit was fairly well established.  Both doctors made the same point about trying to do something about the problem. The kernel is parental propaganda because no propaganda aimed at the child will avail against contrary example by the parents.  I would extend that to contrary example from adults: so long as adults continue to smoke, I have no doubt we will continue to see children smoking in their turn in this progressive way&mdash;20 per cent to 40 or 50 per cent, according to Dr. Corridan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> He says that anti-smoking propaganda must take account of parents no less than children.  Again emphasising the danger of smoking, a paper by Dr. Risteárd Mulcahy in 1962 showed that heart failure is five times greater among cigarette smokers than among non-smokers between the ages of 40 and 49 years, a very young age.  He points out that the policy of the American Heart Association is to discourage cigarette smoking.  That is in respect of one form of heart failure. Another, coronary heart disease, is the subject of a paper based on a survey of 500 patients.</P>
    <P>The paper says that a significant number of male patients with heart disease are cigarette smokers, 90 per per cent of them being heavier smokers than are to be found in the average population.  It is the same in relation to females.  It does not say it is causative but does assert that there is no other reasonable alternative.  It adds: &ldquo;We believe it is a most significant influence in Ireland in causing coronary disease in persons under 60 years&rdquo;, and concludes: &ldquo;It is likely that without cigarette smoking, disease and the death rate from premature heart disease would decline significantly&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>All of these facts are confirmed by all the literature on this subject.  The paper I have been citing refers to peripheral heart failure, a disease causing gangrene of the legs and pain, which are never found in non-smokers. I am sorry to delay the House with those figures but this is the first stage in a campaign which, I presume, will go on for a number of years until eventually we succeed in making ashtrays as rare as snuffboxes in this country.  It is important to emphasise the case for taking this action.  The proposition is serious for the community, for the Minister and for the Government.  I have gone to some pains to emphasise that there is a serious need for more comprehensive action than the Minister has already taken.  I believe it is wrong that only one side of the case is put continuously to the public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> I have found it difficult to get figures of the amount spent on advertising cigarettes.  In Britain it went up from £3.7 million in 1955 to £11 million in 1960 and I would not be surprised if there was a proportionate increase in Ireland.  In 1958 the tobacco industry's aggregate expenditure on cigarette advertising in this country was £295,000 and in 1959 it was £323,000.  That is five years ago and I am sure that there has been a significant increase since then.  The amount spent on television advertising in 1963 was £107,456 and in 1964 it was £150,100.  That is on television alone and I suppose that is only a small proportion of the amount expended. That represents, as everybody who reads the papers or looks at television knows, an enormous expenditure on misleading and dishonest advertising.  I say &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo; because they are suppressing the truth. It is positively amoral that they should continue to sell these things without making any serious attempt to draw public attention to the dangers involved.</P>
    <P>I know that the tobacco companies have a huge financial stake in this matter but down through history financial stakes have had to be superseded in the general interest.  There was a huge financial stake involved in the anti-slave trade campaign and the opium trade caused wars in its time. Various other limitations have had to be placed on the ambitions of people to make money in the interests of the public.</P>
    <P>A case can be made here in this matter of cigarette advertising.  We have the continual distortion of the truth, the implication that cigarette smoking is harmless, and that is the only implications one can draw from advertisements such as &ldquo;Players Please&rdquo; and all the other stuff they put out, all designed to suppress the truth and cloak the facts.  These people know that there is in the public mind a slight and lingering belief that cigarette smoking is allied to ill health and therefore, they do all they can to create the impression that cigarette smoking is healthy, that it is allied to walking through mountains, walking <Col N="222" /> down mountain roads, sailing on the open sea.  All such advertisements are designed to damp down the reality working in some minds that cigarette smoking leads to lung cancer.</P>
    <P>Most people who smoke have the slightly guilty feeling that they are wrong and so this highly emotive anodyne continues to be administered through the mass media of television and the newspapers.  It is unfair to the unfortunate person who is doing his best to give up the habit when all the time he is being told that cigarette smoking is all right.  He is confronted with the colossal figure of a man sucking at his cigarette which gives the impression that this man is one of the strongest men in the world and the unfortunate person who is trying to give up smoking is inclined to get the same feeling.  The cancer hospital bed and the dreadful operations carried out in the cancer hospitals, which are generally without avail, are never brought to the public attention at all.</P>
    <P>Instead this highly intelligent advertising material is poured out by very highly skilled technicians.  Probably the finest intellects in the world are absorbed in propagating two of the most sordid habits, in propagandising the beer drinking industry and the tobacco industry.  These men bring all their skills and talents into helping to sell cigarettes thereby increasing the incidence of lung cancer amongst members of the public who cannot stop smoking.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister in time has been one of the best of our propagandists and politicans, one of our most skilled politicians in the various controversies in which he has been involved from time to time.  I am certain that he would consider that if a point of view was stated which one believes to be wrong then one must establish what one believes to be the proper point of view.  The Minister has always been very careful to say: &ldquo;No, you are wrong there. This is the truth.&rdquo;  The necessity of establishing what he believed to be the right point of view has always been put forward by him and he must know that that is a form of propaganda for such an idea.  He knows the necessity <Col N="223" /> of stating one point of view as against another if we are to arrive at the truth.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point in reply to questions of mine: &ldquo;If it appeared to me that such advertising media could fruitfully be used, I would make use of them&rdquo;.  I do not believe that the Minister believes that the effort which has been made to counter cigarette advertising propaganda is a serious effort or that he seriously believes that he has played the part that he would play if he were seriously concerned with this problem.  If he is fighting this as a struggle for the establishment of a point of view, then he must know quite well he has made no significant attempt to establish a contrary point of view and that he has allowed the case for the cigarette companies to go virtually by default.</P>
    <P>The educational propaganda put out by the Minister's Department is completely light-weight, completely unimpressive and grossly inadequate.  I wonder how many Deputies have seen it?  They may have seen it in their literature.  These two little booklets were put out by the Minister's Department. One is entitled Summary of Surveys of Evidence.  It is factual; it does not misrepresent the position.  But this little two-page leaflet&mdash;not desperately inspiring; indeed the contrary&mdash;is meant to counter the £2 million or £3 million constant barrage of propaganda for cigarette smoking which the youngsters have to face all through their days in our society.  The Minister cannot seriously suggest that that is the answer to the cigarette manufacturers' case for smoking.</P>
    <P>Recently, a correspondent in one of the papers was very critical of the decision by Mr. Callaghan in Britain to stop cigarette advertising on television there.  It will be interesting to see what they do, because Mr. Wilson is on record before the election as saying he was in favour of restricting advertising.  If what I read is true, it appears they are going to restrict cigarette advertising on television in Great Britain.  But it was suggested that this was a typical socialist idea of interfering with the right of adults to make up their own minds.  There is no <Col N="224" /> question of that at all.  The barrage of the tobacco companies, costing £30 million in England, is directed at the adults, forcing them to make up their minds in a particular direction.</P>
    <P>All we suggest is either stop them advertising or counter it with an equally clever barrage in the opposite direction.  There is no socialist idea in that.  It is merely common-sense.  As I said, the Minister would be the first to accept that it was a reasonable proposition for anyone attempting to establish a point of view in the face of the propaganda used by the cigarette manufacturers.  The fact that the British have taken this action at a difficult time financially for them should be some encouragement to the Minister, in his own worries, that it is morally justified.</P>
    <P>The other spectacular decision was by the United States Surgeon-General, who hopes to implement the suggestion that the cigarette packets will carry a couple of sentences saying these cigarettes may cause cancer of the lung.  I made that suggestion to the Minister many years ago.  I must say I did not make it seriously.  It was a magnificant suggestion, but I did not think it would ever be carried out by anybody.  We look forward with great interest to see whether the American Surgeon-General is able to overcome the resistance of the cigarette manufacturers to his suggestion.  It is interesting to notice that, while the Minister has got agreement on the joint proposals put forward by his Department and the cigarette manufacturers here, the American Surgeon-General, apparently, is faced with the likelihood of having to go to the Supreme Court on the constitutional rectitude of his decision to insist on the tobacco companies carrying out his propaganda.</P>
    <P>It would be very silly of the Minister to spend millions fighting these people.  Both sides would be wasting a tremendous amount of money.  The simplest thing to do would be to insist that they discontinue their advertisements altogether or carry on the packets this simple truth, that these cigarettes may cause cancer of the lung, and then leave it to the adult, in the light of that information, to decide whether he will smoke or not.  Many <Col N="225" /> of them will continue to smoke no matter what is put on the packet, but I think a number of them will be influenced.</P>
    <P>That must be the influence that changed the smoking habits of so many members of the medical profession.  We are no different at all to anybody else in our liking for cigarettes or any other form of addiction.  But it is striking that there has been a continual reduction in the number of doctors who have discontinued smoking.  Apparently, the incidence of coronary heart disease among doctors has also begun to decline concomitantly with, apparently, the decline in cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>This is the Minister's little leaflet.  I just wish to draw his attention to a couple of matters.  It says:</P>
    <P>Why do you want to start smoking? Isn't it because smoking seems to be a grown-up thing to do? </P>
    <P>That is a perfectly true, intelligent remark.  But it does make nonsense of the Minister's proposal to direct his propaganda at the children.  As I understand it, his general proposal is to see that children do not start smoking.  Clearly, if this is true&mdash;I believe it is and the Minister believes it to be true&mdash;then the person who has to be stopped smoking is the grown-up, because, according to the Minister's propaganda, as long as it is a grown-up thing to do, the child will smoke.  As long as the Minister allows the grown-ups to continue to smoke then, clearly, he will not have any significant influence in stopping youngsters smoking.</P>
    <P>The Minister then goes on to talk about the first cigarettes giving them a choking cough and so on.  He goes on:</P>
    <P>All right; you may say, then why do so many grown-ups smoke?  If you ask them, 90 per cent of them will admit that they thought it was the grown-up thing to do. </P>
    <P>Continually in his propaganda, the Minister reiterates the point that the child has already established for himself that it is the grown-up thing to do <Col N="226" /> to smoke.  He continues to remind the child.  I suspect that this leaflet must have been written by persons who were themselves heavy smokers and more anxious to convert people to smoking than to convert them to being against smoking.  Certainly, there is this continual reminder to the child that it is grown-up to smoke.  That is one of the truths which it would be better to try to counteract rather than remind the child about it.</P>
    <P>The leaflet then, incidentally, goes on to call it a drug habit:</P>
    <P>They will tell you, too, that once the first nasty effects are overcome (and it takes quite an effort to overcome them) smoking, like any other drug habit, becomes very hard to give up. </P>
    <P>That is extraordinary stuff to tell the child.  If he has any worries about the unpleasantness of smoking, he is reassured by the Department of Health that if he persists, everything will be all right, because, after a while, it is like any other drug habit: it becomes very hard to give up.  So, naturally, the child will persist in acquiring this habit which is very hard to give up.</P>
    <P>The Department plods its weary way and talks about the &ldquo;unpleasant and exhausting cough&rdquo;.  That should be frightening but it does not seem to frighten the children because, as we have found out from two separate counties, they start smoking at the age of seven and are fairly well on their way at the age of 11 and one in two is smoking by the age of 14.</P>
    <P>The leaflet goes on to say:</P>
    <P>If you want to be good at games, for instance, you'll find that most really good athletes don't smoke at all. Then there's the question of cost. </P>
    <P>The leaflet goes on to point out that if you start smoking, you will probably find yourself, in a very few years, with a craving that only 40 cigarettes a day will satisfy.  That is true but the Department of Health emphasises the seriousness of this cigarette-smoking habit by saying that it does create a craving that only 40 cigarettes a day will satisfy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> I do not see how you can expect to influence children merely by directing propaganda at them and letting the adult addict carry on in his ordinary way of continuing to smoke.  I do not know how any self-respecting adult could go, with a cigarette hanging from his lower lip, to a child and tell him: &ldquo;You had better stop smoking because if you continue to smoke you will get lung cancer, coronary thrombosis, coronary infarct, bronchitis and various other diseases,&rdquo; and go through this list of diseases which the child will get if he smokes.  The obvious thing the intelligent child will do is to turn to the adult, to the teacher, the clergyman, the doctor, the politician or the parent and say: &ldquo;Why not do it yourself? Why do you not give it up yourself? Why did you ever take it up?  Is it not a very stupid thing to have done?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We adults set ourselves up as the final arbiters in everything that is good and desirable: &ldquo;What shall I eat? What shall I wear?  Where shall I go to school?  What shall I study for? &mdash;the child all the time turning to the adult and the adult expecting this near-idolatry. Having established that kind of conditioned reflex, the acceptance by the child of the parent's point of view on practically every subject under the sun, the parent suddenly comes along and says: &ldquo;Do not smoke&rdquo;, and then, completely unreasonably, continues to smoke himself.  It seems to me it is like expecting some sort of drooling alcoholic to go along to a Father Mathew meeting and expecting him to impress the Pioneers there with the necessity to give up alcohol.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>They would be impressed if they saw a drooling alcoholic at such a meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether they would be impressed in the right way or not is a thing that I would not be sure about. It seems to me that no adult can have any authority over a child or can influence a child where he himself is unable to control a habit.  The child will continue to see adults smoking in cinemas, in restaurants, in the streets, in buses, in theatres, probably at <Col N="228" /> school, certainly in Leinster House. Everywhere adults congregate he will find this habit being carried on by them and it will still continue to be the grown-up thing to do.</P>
      <P>The Minister says it is a bad thing to do but the Minister keeps pointing out that it is the grown-up thing to do. That is why children smoke.  It is an imitative act on their part.  That is why we expect children to behave well.  The parent hopes that the child, consciously or otherwise, will model himself on the parent.  That is pretty well what happens, generally speaking, and the well-behaved child usually comes from a well-behaved family.  The contrary is also true.  This is an act carried out by the parents and, as Dr. Flynn pointed out in his paper, the incidence is twice as high in households in which the two parents smoke than where the parents do not smoke, so it is imperative that the Minister should take some action as far as parents are concerned.  I do not think the action he has taken is adequate.</P>
      <P>One unpleasant development in recent years has been a very clever one on the part of the advertising companies, that is, to create an impression, completely contrary to the Minister's propaganda here: &ldquo;If you want to be good at games, for instance, you will find that most really good athletes do not smoke at all.&rdquo;  The companies appear to have been a bit worried about that fact, although scientifically there is little proof for it and one of the cleverest forms of propaganda indulged in in recent years&mdash;and the Minister if he is serious about his little leaflet and about sportsmen and the value of not smoking should take some action in regard to it &mdash; has been to sponsor sports tournaments.  Where the hero is a golfing hero or a racing jockey, it is of relative unimportance but of great significance is the decision to take the winners of an All-Ireland Final around the tobacco companies and give them a dinner and so on and fete them generously because they won that particular final.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, Wills and Gold Flake, or Carrolls, do not give two hoots about the winner or the loser in the final but these men who, I am sure, are <Col N="229" /> completely innocent in the matter, are used as advertising copy for the tobacco and cigarette companies in order to promote sales of cigarettes.  I do not suppose they are even paid for it but they are a most potent influence as an advertising medium.  The fact that these people who are certainly for that year and for most years the great heroes in their own area and in most of this island are seen in a tobacco factory going around handling cigarettes and appearing to be taking presents of cigarettes drives a coach and four through the Minister's suggestion that good athletes do not smoke at all.</P>
    <P>GAA footballers and hurlers recently took part in the making of a film about Christy Ring with Gael Linn.  If Gael Linn or the GAA want to make a film about this very famous person, they ought to pay for it themselves. They surely can afford it.  This again is a very clever piece of propaganda by the bright boys in the back room in Players or Gold Flake, or whoever it is, in London or wherever they have their headquarters.</P>
    <P>People like footballers or hurlers are used in the most cynical way to persuade youngsters that they can play these games and smoke as well.  They now have created in many different aspects of our sporting life, horse racing, golf and certainly GAA football and hurling, a vested interest because they are prepared to put up a few hundred pounds of the consumers' money.  The dividends do not change in the slightest.  The companies recover the cost of whatever prizes they give to the footballers or golfers or the price they pay for the hurling pictures by increasing the price of cigarettes.  It is wrong that reputable organisations of this kind which are concerned with the welfare of youth in particular should lend themselves to this type of cheap advertising for the cigarette companies.</P>
    <P>I want to quote from the Minister's memo on health a summary of surveys issued by the Department of Health in March, 1964, just to corroborate what I have said:</P>
    <P>In 1958 the Minister had considered <Col N="230" /> these reports.  He was satisfied it was his duty to bring the results to the notice of the public. </P>
    <P>That was at that time.  Then he repeated some of the recommendations of the Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of London, April, 1959, and the various findings which are contained in the points I have made: their recommendations that there should be more education of the public, especially school children, more effective restriction on the sale of tobacco to children, a restriction on tobacco advertising, a wider restriction on smoking in public places, an increase in the tax on cigarettes, an adjustment of the tax on pipe and cigar tobacco, that purchasers should be informed of the tar and nicotine content of cigarettes and that the value of anti-smoking clinics should be investigated.</P>
    <P>Those are the recommendations of the Royal College of Physicians Committee. The other associated conditions, in addition to the ones mentioned by me, are referred to in this Departmental leaflet: the association between cigarette smoking and peptic ulcer, dimness of vision, sclerosis of the liver.</P>
    <P>These are other points brought out by the Minister's leaflet.  How many people have read that leaflet or seen it?  It would not surprise me if the number were not very high.  Half the number of doctors are non-smokers compared with a quarter of the other sections of the population.  In a survey of 500 doctors between 1951 and 1961, one in three gave up smoking and one in 12 were either non-smokers or ex-smokers, which is vastly less than the number of smokers in the ordinary population.</P>
    <P>The agreement arrived at between the Department of Health and the cigarette companies is, to my mind, inept and likely to be completely ineffective and for that reason agreed upon by the cigarette companies.  There are a number of points: one, that the person appearing in the advertisement should be over 21 years of age. Clearly if we are to go by the findings of Dr. O'Flynn and Dr. Corridan, they <Col N="231" /> should not be over the age of seven years; that is when they start smoking, certainly from 11 to 14.</P>
    <P>Another point is that the advertisement should not feature smoking by conventional heroes of the young.  I wonder whether that would cover the point I have mentioned in relation to the golf, horse racing, GAA and television personalities.</P>
    <P>There is then the point that advertisements should not convey the impression that to be grown-up one should smoke cigarettes.  The very fact that the advertisement carries the head of an adult or adults smoking conveys the impression that it is grown-up to smoke.  Consequently unless they are going to remove human beings, male and female, from their advertisements, then they cannot eliminate the creation of the impression that it is grown-up to smoke.  I wonder will the Minister tell us it is intended that they will stop all adults appearing in their advertisements.</P>
    <P>The rest of it is such rubbish that it is hardly worth dealing with.  It says advertisements should not over-emphasise the pleasure of smoking, that they should not emphasise inhalation or exhalation of smoke, nor should they exaggerate enjoyment of smoking by facial expression, and so on.  This must have been devised by the company clown.  He really did have his tongue in his cheek when he set it out.  It certainly will not have any significant effect on the incidence of cigarette smoking among adults and &mdash;which is the most important consideration because young people are influenced by the regular rate of smoking by adults&mdash;I do not think it will have any effect in reducing the incidence of smoking in the community at all.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, other countries have faced this problem, and distasteful and difficult and all as it is to cope with it, they have decided to do so. Apparently the British are getting some sort of agreement to ban advertising from television and the US Attorney General appears to be trying <Col N="232" /> to get agreement for the inclusion in advertising of a statement that cigarettes are likely to cause lung cancer.  The Minister has taken action on much less flimsy ground in regard to, say, the fluoridation of water, an action all-encompassing since it affects everybody in the country, whether they like it or whether they do not, whether they agree or whether they do not, and it is debatable that it will be particularly efficacious or useful.  But the Minister has insisted on its being carried out.  He has also made regulations governing the type of food additives permissible in certain circumstances. There is one in relation to flour.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there is anything like as compelling a case in regard to these as there is here.  I believe the Minister, no matter how difficult it may be for him, is morally bound to take really strong action in this matter.  Up to the present he has allowed the cigarette companies to have it all their own way.  The rate of consumption continues to increase.  The tobacco companies are very powerful in their attempts to counter propaganda. The newspapers are beholden to the tobacco companies for very large amounts of advertising revenue and invariably the leaders and comment generally are hostile to any serious effective action suggested against the tobacco companies largely because of their powerful vested interest in the continuation of this substantial advertising revenue.  Television is in the same position.  It has a stake in the continuation of advertising.  The radio is in the same position.</P>
    <P>I imagine there will be no action on the part of any of these people.  They will take no serious action and it is now a matter of conscience, I think, for the Minister for Health to decide whether he should, as Minister for Health, continue to allow a dangerous practice of this kind, a practice which results in the maiming and death of many people, many of them in the prime of life.  Will the Minister allow this to continue without taking some really serious action?  I believe he will have in this Bill all the powers he requires and I think he should agree to accept it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> Finally, the Dáil is composed of ordinary men and women.  I suppose three out of four smoke.  That is 75 per cent of the members and I do not think the Minister need have any fear of the Bill being carried by an overwhelming majority.  In those circumstances, I wonder would he be prepared to allow Deputies to put their own point of view, and have a free vote of the House to see if there is any significant measure of enlightened opinion in Leinster House on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;An independent member&rdquo; were the words he used and therefore, as I say, the only conclusion one can draw from that is that Deputy Dr. Browne is dissociating himself from the Labour Party, or else, in the councils of the Labour Party, Deputy Dr. Browne was told that the Labour Party wished to dissociate themselves from the Bill.  Mark you, having listened to his speech tonight I am not surprised.  The Deputy covered a great deal of ground but he did not throw bouquets anywhere.  The tobacco companies appeared in his eyes to be the <Col N="235" /> very pariahs of commercial life, who should not be allowed to sponsor sporting events or support any sort of social occasion.  They are apparently corporations which exist for the sole purpose of destroying the population by propagating disease.</P>
      <P>Next to the tobacco companies, among the lowest grades, in Deputy Dr. Noel Browne's esteem, come the brewers.  This Bill is supposed to relate to the control of the sales of tobacco but some part of Deputy Dr. Browne's speech was devoted to deprecating the very existence even of brewing companies.  Now, after all, it has been long established tradition in this country, and in history, that there is some solace in conviviality, some solace to be found in certain beverages and alcoholic drinks, just as more recently man discovered there was some solace in the smoking of tobacco.  Apparently, however, Deputy Dr. Browne wants this to be a joyless, hag-ridden, cheerless world in which nobody is permitted to do anything which Deputy Dr. Browne thinks it is not right that he should do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I did not really intend to embark on that theme because it is the sort of theme that does not have to be laboured here or elsewhere. Deputy Dr. Browne has established himself in the public eye as the kill-joy of Irish politics.  I do not think it is necessary for me to endeavour to elaborate upon that, particularly as time is running out.  Let me say this, if it were not for the rather discursive speech to which we have just listened and which sometimes might have tried one's patience, I would have begun by saying that Deputy Dr. Browne had made an impressive case against excessive cigarette smoking, that the case which he put to us tonight is a case which has been established in many authoritative publications.  It is not any part of my case to underrate or to minimise in any way the statistical evidence which suggests that there may be a causal association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.  Cigarette smoking may be the cause of lung cancer.  Statistical research, as I have said, seems to <Col N="236" /> indicate that it is.  These statistics do not prove, however, have not proven, and will not prove that, as a positive established fact, excessive cigarette smoking is the real cause of cancer. For that, different disciplines and different procedures will have to be employed.  These procedures have been employed, and with them there have been many attempts to ascertain and establish whether there exists a true causal association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. So far such a scientifically established association between them has not been proven.  Therefore, I suggest that we cannot invoke a sort of repressive, terrorist apparatus, as Deputy Dr. Browne proposes we should do, in order to discourage smoking.  We cannot invoke such a measure until it has been established that everything he has said about cigarette smoking is true.  As I say, attempts have been made to do this.  There is worldwide research going on to ascertain the causes of cancer, as a step towards the cure of cancer, but nobody yet has come forward and said: &ldquo;Here is the evidence which I have discovered by experiment, indicating that beyond doubt excessive cigarette smoking is the real and primary cause of lung cancer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am prepared to admit&mdash;and, in so far as my attitude to this problem is concerned, I have been proceeding on such a basis&mdash;that the statistical evidence is very strong.  But it is not conclusive.  There are others who believe that lung cancer is occasioned by different factors.  Deputy Dr. Browne believes the sole cause of it is cigarette smoking; Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde, on the other hand, is equally emphatic that it is not due to cigarette smoking but is due to the pollution of the atmosphere by the exhaust gases from diesel engines. And there is a somewhat similar sort of statistical association between the prevalence of lung cancer and a certain pollution of the atmosphere by exhaust gases as would justify one in saying that this pollution may be &mdash;just as cigarette smoking may be&mdash; a cause of lung cancer.</P>
    <P>There are others, however, who take another line and they say that perhaps <Col N="237" /> the main or true cause of lung cancer is to be found in the stress factor which permeates our whole existence.  They will argue that cancer is a consequence of this stress and they will argue that excessive smoking is indicative of the stress under which a particular person lives.  They will argue&mdash;and mind you it is very hard to answer them&mdash;that this is why one finds that excessive smoking and lung cancer sometimes go together.  The conditions go sometimes together, not always; since people have contracted lung cancer who do not smoke at all.  That is a significant fact which must be taken into consideration. We must have the answer to this question: If excessive cigarette smoking is the root cause of lung cancer, why is it that sometimes people suffer from lung cancer who are non-smokers?</P>
    <P>Despite the argument which has been put forward against my view in this controversy by other people, not in the House, I feel it is quite possible, even highly probable, that the association which Deputy Dr. Browne believes in so firmly subsists, but this has not been proven to absolute certainty.  I do not think it has been demonstrated absolutely and there is still a strong element of doubt and while, therefore, I think that excessive cigarette smoking in itself is bad from many points of view and while we are justified in endeavouring to discourage it by using persuasion and persuasive progaganda I do not think we are entitled to go the lengths they did in America in relation to alcohol, and try to prohibit it altogether, or, as an alternative, try to make it impossible for people to enjoy a cigarette, or to get a cigarette at all without finding a death's-head on every packet.  Deputy Dr. Browne by his Bill apparently wishes the cigarette makers to make an equivalent display.  If it were justifiable to compel the tobacco manufacturers to put the imprint of a grinning skull, a death's-head on every packet of cigarettes would that be a more practical way of tackling this problem than on the lines which Deputy Dr. Browne has suggested it should be tackled?  I hope I shall show that his is a completely impractical <Col N="238" /> way of tackling the problem when we resume the debate on this Bill.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was dealing with very briefly was the suggestion that we should derate land under £20 valuation, having gone so far.  All I can say is that the past record would seem to indicate that if that is to take place, undoubtedly only Fianna Fáil are likely to do it.  So far as farm buildings are concerned&mdash;and quite a lot was said about the rates impact on them&mdash; the average valuation on houses and offices on these various farms is something under £1.  It is true that in certain cases they depart quite a bit from the average but, taking the average from the entire country, the valuation of these buildings is under £1 and, therefore, the impact of increasing rates has not got the punitive effect some speakers would seem to imply.</P>
      <P>It is also true that in so far as out-office buildings are concerned, quite recently I brought to the House&mdash;and it is now on the Statute Book&mdash;a measure which gives complete remission of rates for 20 years after the erection of out-office buildings.  Like all other houses that fall under the Housing Grants Acts, there is a graduated scale of remission for the first nine years of the life of a new house. Reconstruction is also dealt with in various enactments which were carried through the House over the years by Fianna Fáil Governments.  There is also relief in relation to re-valuation following any reconstruction work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested here as indeed elsewhere, that the bigger farmers are really the people who are getting something for nothing out of these rates reliefs.  The fact is, of course, that the figures do not bear that out. Of the £11.14 million which will be <Col N="239" /> the total amount this year going to the relief of land rates, £7.95 millions actually go to the primary allowances; in other words, to the £20 and under land valuations.</P>
    <P>Another matter raised was the different categories who do not benefit from this, those who are not land holders and whose rates are continuing to go up, putting them out of business in small towns.  Deputy Dillon mentioned the shopkeeper who has to pay 10/- a week in overheads, and is being driven out of business.  If 10/- a week in overheads is driving some people out of business, if they can find some alternative&mdash;as undoubtedly they must be doing according to Deputy Dillon&mdash; it might be better for them.  This is not an increase of 10/- on the total overheads, and probably in the past they paid 5/- or 7/6.</P>
    <P>The other thing that should be said about rates generally is that taking into account depreciation of money values for quite a number of years, taking into account also the very great expansion in the services rendered through the local authorities under heads such as housing grants, water schemes, sewerage schemes, road works, health services, vocational education and the advisory services under the committees of agriculture&mdash;taking into account the difference in the value of money today and 25 or 30 years ago&mdash;I do not think anyone can make the case that the ratepayers are not getting pretty good value for money spent on rates, despite the inequities which I agree exist in the system.  I say that deliberately because of the fact that so much misrepresentation goes on in this regard that I think it should be said.</P>
    <P>The amount coming from the Central Exchequer towards those services is an increasing percentage year by year.  That is why it is possible to have these services vastly expanded.  Though money has depreciated in value, the ratepayers and local residents get better value for what they pay in rates today than ever before.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said the only thing we can boast about is that we brought the rates back to where they were during his last year in office.  Lest it was not <Col N="240" /> possible to hear me because of the noise he made as a result of his annoyance, I want to say it is not a boast.  It is a fact that the people today are better able to pay rates than they were in his last year in office.  The trouble then was not whether the rates were big or small but that the people were put to the pin of their collar to find that amount in any quarter.  Today we do not see the same situation.</P>
    <P>I would remind Deputy Dillon and his colleagues that they had their opportunity to do all the things he was advocating, including the complete derating of land of £20 valuation or under, but the fact is that they did nothing except on a few occasions when they came to the House and continued what previous Fianna Fáil Governments were doing.  Now that we are progressing further by giving further reliefs we are being criticised about the &ldquo;ha'porth of tar&rdquo; and asked why we do not go the whole hog.  It is typical of the minimisation the Leader of the Opposition is capable of when it suits his book, that that &ldquo;ha'porth of tar&rdquo; would be at least £1½ million out of the £11.14 million odd we are providing this year.</P>
    <P>So far as the farmers generally are concerned, it is only a small part of what is being done.  In fact it is less than one quarter of what we know to be the total amount going by way of assistance to the various farmers. During the year the total is in the region of £47 million odd.  We are not segregating the farmers from the rest of the community.  We are giving that money for various reasons, not the least of which is to endeavour by this and other means to keep their standard of living in line and not to allow it to fall behind the rising standard of living of other persons in other walks of life.</P>
    <P>This, I think, is generally understood. However, the Leader of Fine Gael would wish to imply it was otherwise and that we were merely running to panic stations to relieve in this measure the plight of the farmers. That, of course, is entirely wrong and is not the case in any way whatsoever. We are merely coming in because of the improvement in the lot of other people in this country.  We feel that this, <Col N="241" /> together with other aids, is necessary to keep the farmer up with them and also to encourage him to improve still further his lot by improving and increasing his output, efficiency and production.</P>
    <P>These measures, this being only a minor one, although costing a great deal of money, are having the desired effect of boosting production on our farms both big and small.  Anything that does that in a substantial way, such as, for instance, the heifer subsidy scheme&mdash;any of these things that bring about a good return and a higher output from our farms and a higher net income to the farmer, his operatives and his labourers &mdash; is to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>To throw cold water on it and to say that this measure does not go far enough, coming from a person who in his position in past government had the opportunity to do even this and did not do it, sounds very badly and I do not think his statement will really weigh with anybody.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon probably foresees that Fianna Fáil's progressive abatement of rates on the under £25 valuation and, indeed, on the larger farms as well is indicative of the possibility, that may take place in the not too distant future, of derating: he will say he thought of it first.  Whether he thought of it first or last, the main thing is that we are giving it: we are giving quite a substantial amount of money.  We believe that, in the division of that money, we have done fairly as between the different sizes and categories of farmers. Deputy Dillon, furthermore, did not do anything to improve this situation while he was in office despite the fact that the total rates bill was rising in his years as it has done in the years since then.</P>

    <P>That it is expedient to authorise such payments out of moneys provided <Col N="242" /> by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present session to amend and extend the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Acts, 1939 to 1962. </P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which we cannot amend, being a money Bill, and for that reason there is no point in not giving the Minister all stages of the Bill now.  I was disappointed that the Minister did not deal in his opening statement or when replying on the Second Reading with a resolution which was sent to him by Naas Urban Council.  The position in relation to farmers in urban council areas is that they are not included in the relief given by the various Relief of Rates Acts.  The official case is that people in urban areas receive benefits arising out of their proximity to the town and are in a different position from people in rural areas.  In certain cases, that may be true but it is not true in the case of the very large urban areas.  Anybody who knows large urban areas will realise that there are substantial areas of land in these urban areas which are not getting any benefit whatsoever out of the urbanisation and, at the same time, are being penalised very heavily indeed, because of the provisions of these Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, one talks about the areas one knows best.  The Naas urban area is within the first five largest urban areas in the country.  Whether one examines it from the Mowread end, the north end where the dual carriageway now ends, or from the south-west, round Jigginstown, where the by-pass road goes off what used to be a very dangerous canal bridge, the same thing must strike any observer.  In both cases, there is absolutely no difference between the land in the urban area at those extremities and the land outside that area.  Yet the farmer who happens to be just outside the urban area gets this measure of derating while the farmer within the urban area does not get any such measure of relief at all. The Minister has probably seen correspondence sent to him from time to time by the members of the Naas Urban Council who feel that they are being most unfairly penalised and that <Col N="243" /> the substantial part of the Naas urban area that is in that area and yet is, in fact, nothing but farmland should receive attention.</P>
    <P>I do not know what statistics the Minister may have but I think it is an undoubted fact that there are, perhaps, a dozen urban areas in the country that are too big for their present urbanisation.  It would seem that the only remedy is to deurbanise completely and that it is not open to them to shrink the urban areas.  If it were open to them to do so, I know that Naas and Kildare would be prepared to consider doing so with a view to making the urban area responsible for genuinely urban problems and leaving the rural area to be dealt with by the county council.  As they understand the position, it is not possible to do that and it is a question of complete deurbanisation and the status of town commissioners such as Droichead Nua or leaving it as it is.</P>
    <P>The members of the urban council petitioned the Minister on many occasions and again this year when the relief was announced in the Budget. I have not the exact details to my hand what they put into that petition but it was a well-reasoned case and gave a great deal of statistics, facts and figures in relation to it.  I am disappointed, as I know the farmers in the urban periphery of Naas will be disappointed, that their appeal has not been met by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a problem which I have heard on a number of occasions.  I should say briefly that until we started stepping up the percentage relief, which we have done in the last few Bills in this House, the farmers in Naas were doing much better than the farmers outside with their land.  The reason I did not mention it in this Bill was that it was not in order to discuss it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have been in order on the Second Reading but I was at another meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mention it <Col N="244" /> because I was not aware of it.  It is also true to say that until those outside the urban area have their lot improved under this measure, the people within the urban area, and particularly in Naas, are better off and more relieved to a greater extent than their neighbours across the boundry.  So far as the Deputy's grievance is concerned, the situation in Naas is, as I know it, that land values for building purposes are very stiff within the urban area.  It certainly is no reflection of what the value of land is outside in the ordinary rural parts.  It is not easy to get land for building purposes at all, as is instanced by a recent public inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think both the Minister and I should keep off that one for different reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>You can go back as far as you like.  £300 per acre had to be paid for over seven acres of land in Naas, which was not eminently suitable for building either.  Naturally, it was chosen only because nothing better could be got for less.  These sort of figures are indicative even in Naas where they have these large areas.  It implies that there is a buildup of values there, a disproportion in relation to agricultural land outside and in rural parts.  Over and above, I think it is fair to say that, although Deputy Sweetman appears to think differently.  I believe if the urban council feels strongly about this, it should, in fact, seek to have its boundary changed and have some of the land now not wanted and not used agriculturally added to the county health district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they are aware of that.  They thought they had to deurbanise completely, or not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  This is purely legal and technical.  My advice is that they could so do, though <Col N="245" /> I do not expect they actually would. Being near Dublin and having fair prospects, as I see it, the possibility is the land within the boundary, even though it may suffer comparatively, has likely possibilities as against the advantages we had in the past before we improved the agricultural rebate grant for lands outside urban areas. Despite all that, I think they are apt to stay in it rather than move out.</P>

      <P>I do not read all I should.  I think it is really true.  There are the services and the advantages which follow and accrue to those having property and residing within the urban boundary.  The fact that land is not easy to come by for building purposes in a wide area of the Naas urban council district is indicative that people think highly of it at the moment and have no urge to part with it.  Over all, I do not think if they had the option, they would opt out. I think they could have that option if the urban council and the local people thought strongly about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The Bill arises in consequence of the enactment of the Local Government (No. 2) Act, 1960.  Part II of that Act rationalised local borrowing powers by giving local authorities a general power to borrow for the purpose of any of their functions or duties, and provided for the control of such borrowing.  Prior to 1960, the practice was that every statute enabling or requiring local authorities to perform a function or carry out works included provisions to authorise borrowing specifically for the purpose of performing that function or carrying out such works.  The statute usually regulated the manner of borrowing and in some cases the repayment of loans and related matters.  All of these matters are now governed by the 1960 Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be personal so I shall not indicate where the muck is at the moment.  Section 9 of the 1960 Act precluded borrowing by local authorities save pursuant to Part II of that Act.  This provision rendered ineffective a wide range of earlier enactments empowering and regulating borrowing by local authorities. When section 9 was under discussion during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil, I intimated that these enactments would fall to be repealed in a separate Bill.  The primary purpose of the present Bill, therefore, is to remove from the statute book the provisions which were rendered ineffective by section 9 of the 1960 Act.</P>
      <P>These provisions are contained in a multitude of enactments, reaching back in time for more than a century.  It will be appreciated that the borrowing powers were associated in a good number of cases with enactments which are now in themselves ineffective or obsolete, having been superseded by modern legislation, or having otherwise become unnecessary through lapse of time.  Some of these enactments have been included in the schedule of repeals, where repeal seemed desirable and could be effected without widening unduly the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> I would emphasise that, with one exception, the provisions proposed for repeal are already inoperative.  The one exception to which I refer relates to grants by a local authority to a Vocational Education Committee under the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  That Act required the consent of the Minister for Local Government to the making of the grant, and gave power to borrow for the purpose of making a grant.</P>
    <P>The function of sanctioning the borrowing has already been transferred to the Minister for Education by the Local Government (No. 2) Act, 1960, and the proposed repeal of the relevant clauses in subsections (1) and (2) of section 51 of the 1930 Act will transfer to that Minister also the function of consent to a grant.  This step is a logical sequel to the 1960 Act and, apart from this, the Bill will serve only to remove from the Statute Book provisions which are already spent or obsolete, and will effect no change whatever in current Local Government controls or practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know, frankly, whether the Seanad were given the certificate from the Attorney General that this is, in fact, only a consolidation of the law.  Therefore, I am not quite clear whether the Bill is intended to be such or not.  I am not very happy in relation to the wording used, from time to time, in the explanatory White Paper.  The word &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; is used loosely whereas one would gather from the Minister's speech that it is not really so much that the provisions are obsolete but that, in fact, they have been superseded by the 1960 Act.  Perhaps the Minister would let us know whether that is correct or not.</P>
      <P>If they were being superseded, as it would appear on a first impression of the Minister's speech, why did the 1960 Act not repeal them as such? Why is it left to another Act to do the job one would have imagined could have been dealt with by the previous legislation?  It is a very technical Bill and nobody other than the Attorney General would be in a position to give a certificate or an opinion in relation to the repeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I was surprised such a <Col N="250" /> certificate was not presented to the House.  Perhaps it was presented to the other House.  Is this the prelude to a consolidation Bill of this sector of Local Government legislation, the one that deals particularly with borrowing powers, or is it not now necessary to have such consolidation in view of the provisions of the 1960 Act?  It is a technical matter and I think it should be dealt with as such.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the certificate which the Deputy seeks troubles us, this is not an appropriate measure in relation to which a certificate would be required or, indeed, in respect of which it would have any meaning.  The certificate the Deputy is inquiring about is one where consolidation, in fact, would be taking place.  This really is a consequence of a certain amount of consolidation that has already taken place which has made certain provisions obsolete.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the operative section.  It operates largely to abolish the obligation of the local authorities to apply, <i>ad hoc</i>, for power to borrow for specific purposes.  It substitutes for the general power given in the 1960 Act.  It leaves a queer overall power in the Minister for Local Government which, I often wonder, the Oireachtas ever intended should remain.  It is not <Col N="251" /> appropriate on the occasion of a Bill of this character, which consolidates generally the powers of local authorities to borrow, to raise this issue.</P>
      <P>Since 1898, the local authorities have gradually become more and more under the control of the executive, as represented by the Department of Local Government, as a result of a development of which I do not believe the Oireachtas was ever fully conscious. The original purpose of the 1898 Act was to distribute the functions of Government, to decentralise them and set up a whole lot of local authorities which would act not only as administrative authorities operated through people in close contact with those whom they were charged to serve, but also as a kind of training ground for the public life of the country, such as operated in Britain, the United States and other countries where people graduated to the public life of the country through service in the local authorities.</P>
      <P>The design was that these local authorities would be given the widest possible discretion to use funds which they were charged with the responsibility of raising through local rates but as the system of local government developed these funds were supplemented by grants from the executive and the local authorities became largely administrators of schemes entirely financed out of State funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Side by side with these developments there grew up a practice in the Department of Local Government of saying that wherever a local authority was borrowing money for the operation of any of its various functions, inasmuch as the Minister's authority was required, every detail of the scheme for which money was being borrowed must have the prior approval of the Minister.  We have now reached the stage where practically every activity of a local authority, whether it be the provision of houses, or drainage or roads, is controlled by the Department and is subject to this general regulation by the Custom House.  This is tending to make the elected representatives on the local <Col N="252" /> authorities more and more frustrated and convinced that they have very little real function left and that they are no more than rubber stamps of the central executive.</P>
    <P>Before we irrevocably consolidate that position, I would like to know the views of the House on this particular matter.  The conviction is growing on me that the powers of the local authorities should be substantially restored to them and that this control of their powers by the Minister should be curtailed.  It is my growing conviction that the local authorities should be given a general approbation to borrow money, if the purpose of that borrowing is deemed to be good, and then let the local authorities and their elected representatives answer to the electorate for the proper operation of the schemes for which they borrow the money. In the absence of this, the tendency will grow for local representatives to say: &ldquo;We really have no power in this matter at all.  It is the Minister for Local Government who controls the whole matter.  If there is any delay it is his fault.  If housing is not going forward, it is because the Department of Local Government is interfering with our plans.&rdquo;  I think there is a good deal of truth in that alibi when it is put forward by members of local authorities and I think it is time to restore autonomy to these local authorities.</P>
    <P>Mistakes may sometimes be made as some sums of the money which have been borrowed under the Minister's general authority may be misspent, but, in the long run, the general work of the local authorities will be better carried out with a greater sense of responsibility if the Minister, while sanctioning loans for the various services, leaves it to the local authorities to carry that work out well or ill.  If that kind of autonomy were restored to the local authority, more people would be prepared to offer themselves for election to local authorities, in the belief that membership would create a greater measure of responsibility and potential for good rather than at present living under the constant and ubiquitous control of what is <Col N="253" /> commonly known as the Custom House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>All that has been said by Deputy Dillon sounds very reasonable but the fact remains that the 1955 Act was given to the House and to the country as a measure of emancipation for local authorities and a restoration to them of powers that had been filched from them, so it is strange to me to hear these remarks coming from Deputy Dillon.  I will say that in regard to local authorities it is true to say that over recent years the number of them who have had to be suspended for not doing their work or for doing it badly is an indication of the better order of things, despite their greater responsibilities and the greater amount of money they had to spend.  Whatever may have been said about this situation in the past and whatever criticism there may be of local authorities, that criticism should be tempered a little by the record, which shows that very few of our local authorities have fallen foul of the central Government in recent years.  This is indicative of the fairly good relationship between the local authorities and the central Government in recent years.</P>
      <P>However, such have been the developments in regard to grants and subsidies for local authority operations since 1898 that seldom is any worthwhile amount of money borrowed for a service that the Exchequer does not come directly into by way of grant or subsidy, or both.  By and large, 50 per cent of the money spent by local authorities derives from the central Exchequer and who will say that the local authority should have the right to borrow money to do this, that or the other things when by so borrowing, they expect to get certain grants and subsidies from the central Government? This would mean that, for whatever the local authority determines to do, the payment of these loans and grants would be on call without regard to what the central Government may think about the matter or what is being done with the money from the Exchequer.  This is part of the problem that makes it more difficult than it would appear at first sight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> However, as far as I am concerned any of the responsibilities the Department feels appear to be unnecessary in any way are under examination by the officers of the Department and myself, and if no other complications would arise by our action, we will endeavour to get the authority of the House for any changes necessary for the giving to the local authorities of further and wider responsibilities.  But it is not just that easy to give these to them offhand.  We are looking into certain aspects of this affair and if we do come up with certain changes, we may have to come to the House to deal with them.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, certain regulations may only have to be changed. Where that is so, this is in fact being done.  Indeed, it would help my Department greatly if our technical people, who are in short supply, were relieved of some of the detailed work by passing a greater amount of responsibility to the technical staff of the local authorities.  We are looking into all those things, and any changes we can make will be brought about by changes in regulations or, if necessary, by coming to the House.  But we cannot hand everything over to them and say: &ldquo;Go ahead; borrow, make your own decisions and take the consequences.&rdquo; We are unlikely to hand over the responsibility of making subsidies and grants to any outside body. I am responsible to this House in most cases of local authority borrowing and spending.  The House probably would not agree that I should delegate to local authorities the power to spend on behalf of the House moneys collected by the Government through taxation.</P>
    <P>That general view must be weighed against the view that by giving people greater responsibility, you make them more responsible.  The two may balance each other out&mdash;I do not know.  Certain questions have to be answered.  Although Deputy Dillon's solution may seem plausible and good, it is not the whole story.  We are looking into the whole matter and, if changes are necessary or desirable, we will make them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting to the Minister at this stage that there should be no central control over the borrowing of money, particularly where up to 50 per cent of the total cost may fall on the Exchequer.  What I had in mind is this: If a local authority desires to undertake the building of 24 houses in its area and the Department of Local Government come to the conclusion that 24 houses are needed, then the local authority should have the power to go forward with the construction of the 24 houses at the lowest price they can command, and, if the houses are not satisfactory, let the local authority answer to the people who elected them.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, they submit a scheme to the Minister because the Minister sanctions the borrowing and, perhaps, undertakes repayment of part of the loan.  He must be satisfied that the development plans and the plans for the houses, even down to very considerable detail, satisfy the technical officers of his Department.  I think that is where the mistake was made. What the Minister ought to say is: &ldquo;We agree 24 houses are required in this area.  We approve the proposed expenditure on the houses.  You will be eligible for the grant.  Now, go and build them.&rdquo;  If the houses fail to come up to the proper standard, the ratepayers of the area will rightly blame the county council.  But the houses will be built six to 12 months before they would have been built if they were subject to repeated surveys of the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has to bear in mind that the Department feels it incumbent on it to provide against every conceivable contingency, because the local authority is in the position of passing off responsibility for the ultimate end result by saying: &ldquo;We submitted everything to the Department and everything was approved.  If there is any fault, it is due to the Custom House.  They sanctioned the ultimate plan.  In fact, we altered our plans to meet their wishes.&rdquo; I think that is a mistake.  I think the Custom House ought to stop at saying: &ldquo;Yes, 24 houses are needed, and you are entitled to build them.  The contract <Col N="256" /> price for the accommodation envisaged is within the limits of what we consider to be rational.  Go and build those houses, and answer to the ratepayers for them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest if in that particular a start were made, it would become more and more possible for the Department to say in respect of drainage schemes, sewerage schemes and so on: &ldquo;Yes, we agree the scheme is necessary.  We agree the contract price is within the limits of prudence.  Go and do it.  If the drainage system does not work, do not pretend to the local people that the reason is that the engineers of the Department of Local Government altered the plan.  You have your own county engineer and all his assistants. His technical staff are responsible for the scheme.  It is for you to answer to the local electors if you and your technical staff fall down on the job.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister he might well begin in the matter of housing.  If he did that, he would find in the long run much time would have been saved and probably a great deal of expense. Gradually other blocks of work would appear eligible for similar treatment. I believe it would expedite local Government work.  It would fix responsibility more clearly on those who ought to have it.  It would make the technical staffs of local authorities have a much higher sense of responsibility than they can be expected to have now, when their every decision is subject to review by a superior technical staff. Ultimately, it would result in the quality of local authorities being improved, because persons belonging to them would acquire a growing sense of responsibility when they realised they could no longer have the alibi for any failure on their part by saying they had consulted the Department of Local Government who had approved their plans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That, again, is an over-simplification of the situation. In the past couple of years, the situation in regard to housing has been eased by me to some extent, in that I no longer have any say in formulating housing schemes in the sense of knowing in advance whether <Col N="257" /> 24 houses are needed.  This is entirely a matter for the local authority and their engineers to determine.  They do not have to come to the Department and say they have established a need for so many houses.  They establish it to their own satisfaction.  If it turns out the need is less than the accommodation provided, that is their headache.</P>
      <P>Subsidy makes up a large part of the cost of these houses.  That subsidy is the responsibility of the central Government and I, as Minister, am responsible to this House for it through my Estimate and in many other ways. Over and above that, the difficulty arises that the balance of the money raised through borrowing is obtained from the Local Loans Fund, which again is under the control of the Government and is funded by them. Therefore, a responsibility devolves on the Government and on me in respect of that Fund.  It is all very well to say: &ldquo;Let them do this job and that job.&rdquo; If the job did not work out, I would be very happy to say that it was never submitted to me, that they had done this job entirely themselves.  But whose money is in it?  It is not local money. The greater part of the money comes from the Local Loans Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would love to see the situation arising, in respect of any scheme proved to be defective, that I, as Minister, refused to pay the subsidy because it was not up to the accepted standard as a result of the fault or the neglect of either the local authority or their agents.  If I proposed to do that there would be murder in the House. They would be screaming on all sides of the House that this was a dastardly thing to do, that it was unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you ought to pay the subsidies for the houses and let the local authority answer to the people if they are not satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No&mdash;do not let us get around that far.  This money from the Local Loans Fund is raised by the <Col N="258" /> Government from the people by national loans and otherwise.  The subsidies and the grants are raised by direct taxation, again by the central Government, and the money is voted from the Central Exchequer for these various purposes.  We are responsible in this House for that money and as to how it is used we, surely, are responsible.  If I had to pay grants or subsidies regardless of whether the money that went into the job was Local Loans Fund money or not, if that job was not up to the normal standard that has been laid down and agreed, either in regulations or on the Statute Book, by this House and I had to O.K. them and say, &ldquo;You have to pay them all back now.  Here is the money,&rdquo; that would not be accepted by this House.  I know that if I were a member of this House and such a proposition was put to me I would not accept it.  If I were on the other side of the House I would not accept it.</P>
      <P>I do agree that in so far as we can compress the duplication, as it were, of operations, whether administrative or technical, as between ourselves and the local authorities, it will be done and, in fact, as I say, there is a number of these things that we have been able to trim off.  There may be further things that we can trim off.  But to say, &ldquo;All right, you can spend what you like but you will pay the piper and will take the blame locally&rdquo; would not excuse us in this House where Central Exchequer moneys are concerned. Where it is out of the Local Loans Fund, a subsidised job or a grant job, to which we have paid capital grants, we would not get away with it that way.  It would be all too simple to do that.  In fact, if we were to give this freedom it is only on the basis of some effective measure of not paying them the grants for doing a bad job or not paying the subsidy or the whole of it for doing a bad house that we could possibly allow that sort of thing.  It is a question of weighing that up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been thinking about it for some considerable time as to whether or not we could give them that further freedom but that, if they did <Col N="259" /> not do the job fairly, if they fell down on the job as a result of being given their freedom, the rest of the community was not going to be allowed to pay as if the job were a good one. Whether we can make that stick or not is really the problem.  I do not believe that if a scheme of houses or a water job were done and for some reason was a bad job, the members of the House on any side would be with me as Minister for Local Government if I said, &ldquo;All right, you have done a bad job; you are not getting the subsidies. You will have to carry the whole burden yourself for a bad job.&rdquo; I do not think I would have the House or a majority of the House with me and I have been thinking along these lines for some time.  My own feeling is that while I would like to do it from the point of view of the Minister and the Department of Local Government, I do not really think it is probably the way to do it in the long run.</P>
    <P>The other thing, of course, is that on housing examinations, plans and details and all the rest that come up, the average time taken by my Department is just under three weeks.  Within that average, undoubtedly, there are extremes of a day in one case or a couple of months in others and, indeed, stretching into much longer.  The reason for the extreme in the long term is probably a bad job proposed that takes time to iron out.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>An International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations was concluded at Rome in October, 1961.  The Convention was drafted under the auspices of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, the International Labour Office and the Bureau of the International Union for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.  It was open for signature until 30th June, 1962, by which date it was signed by 36 countries, including Ireland.  In accordance with the provisions of Article 25 the Convention entered into force on 18th May, 1964, following ratification by six countries, one of which was Britain.</P>
      <P>The requirements of the Convention, in so far as they relate to Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations, will be met by the provisions of the Copyright Act, 1963, which came into operation on 1st October, 1964.  The Convention cannot be ratified until legislation is enacted to meet its requirements in relation to the protection of performers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 4 of the Convention requires that national treatment shall be granted to performers whose performance takes place in another contracting State or is incorporated in a phonogram or a broadcast which would be the subject of protection under the Copyright Act.  &ldquo;National treatment&rdquo; as defined in the Convention would be the treatment accorded by our domestic law to performers who are Irish nationals as regards <Col N="262" /> performances taking place, broadcast, or first fixed on Irish territory.  The Convention, at Article 7, sets out certain acts in relation to performances and requires that the protection to be given to performers shall include the possibility of preventing those acts.  It is not proposed to create a property right in a performance, in the nature of a copyright, which a performer could enforce by civil action or which he might assign to any group such as a performers' union for enforcement. The proposals provide for protection of performers by making it a penal offence to do certain acts in relation to performances.  It will, for instance, be an offence, punishable by fine on summary conviction, to make a record or a film of a performance, to sell or hire such a record or film or to use it for the purpose of giving a public performance without the consent of the performer.  The necessary provisions are contained in sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill.  These will meet the requirements of Article 7 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Article 12 of the Convention provides that where commercial records are used for broadcasting purposes or for public performance, the user shall make a payment to the performers or the producers of the records or both. Under the provisions of the Copyright Act, 1963, payment is required to be made to the owners of copyright in records, that is to the recording companies, when their records are broadcast or used for public performance. It is understood that, under an agreement made between the recording companies and the various performers' unions, a percentage of the money which the companies receive for this use of their records is paid over to the performers' unions for the benefit of their members.  The proposals in the Bill will not interfere with this arrangement.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to take powers to make an Order or Orders extending the protection of performers to records and films made in countries of the Convention, under circumstances which would be in contravention of the Act if they were made in the State.</P>
    <P>The initiation of proceedings under <Col N="263" /> the Act will be the responsibility of the person aggrieved.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is designed to give to actors, singers, musicians, dancers and others who perform in public the same kind of protection against the piracy of their work as is given, as I understand it, to writers under the copyright legislation.  The Bill will give to those people protection against the unauthorised use of their efforts by persons who make records or broadcasts of their performances and generally it will provide the protection which was given under the Copyright Act in respect of writing.</P>
      <P>There are, however, one or two points about which I want to query the Minister.  I notice from the Bill, and also from the concluding remarks of the Minister's speech, that the initiation of proceedings will be the responsibility of the person concerned.  Does that mean that if a person contravenes this Bill, the State will not prosecute for an offence under it and the aggrieved person, in other words, must take proceedings himself?  In that regard, is the proposed procedure the same here as in other countries which are parties to the Convention concluded at Rome in 1961?</P>
      <P>In section 10, it is proposed to provide that, by order, the provisions of the Bill will be applied to the selling of records and the using of them for public performances where these have not been authorised in foreign countries which are a party to the Convention. I should like to inquire from the Minister why the unauthorised making of a record of the performance of foreign artists is not being made a contravention of the Bill.  As I understand it, under subsection (1) of section 10, paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (1) of section 2 and paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (1) of section 3 do not apply in the case of foreign artists' performances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point is in relation to the definition of a performance in section <Col N="264" /> 1, the interpretation section.  Does this definition exclude and, therefore, give no protection to a variety artist such as a comedian or to the producer or conductor of performances and, if so, why are they excluded?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first question raised by Deputy Cosgrave about the initiation of proceedings is that the State may take action against a person who has a record of one of these performances illegally in his possession and there is provision for certain penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Suppose the Performing Rights fees in a parish hall are increased from £8 to £24, and the trustees appeal, is it within the power of the Controller to say: &ldquo;We think they should be £12&rdquo;, and can that decision stick?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke from memory of the passage of the Copyright Bill. My information is that the Controller has power to fix fair rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.  I think that should be made known.  I do not know whether the Minister can do it, but there have been big increases in recent times and I think the public ought to be made aware, especially people interested in parish halls, dance-halls, hotels, restaurants and so on, that they have a right of appeal.  I asked also if the Minister had been in consultation with the Irish Federation of Musicians.</P>

      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.55 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 2nd December, 1964.</P>
