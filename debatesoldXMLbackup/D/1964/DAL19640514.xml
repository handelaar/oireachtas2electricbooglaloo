    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to secure a reduction in the time-lag in the provision of telephone facilities, I should like to ask the Minister if he has considered whether or not it would be of assistance if the regulation requiring application to be made for permission to erect lines along public roads, which involves delay in respect of the publication of statutory notices amounting to six weeks to two months, were eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position is that the Minister must make application for permission for the erection of lines along public roadways and then has to wait a certain period after the publication of these notices.  Such regulations do not apply in regard to the provision of other services of a <Col N="1521" /> type in which the public interest is involved.  The Electricity Supply Board may erect lines over property after serving notice in the ordinary way.  On the other hand, if such procedure is desirable in the case of public roads, it should be retained.</P>
    <P>A second suggestion I would make is whether the microwave might not be used more extensively with a view to improving the telephone service.  In some instances it might have the effect of reducing the load on the ordinary carrier lines and provide a faster service, thus reducing the time-lag in some cases.</P>
    <P>I should also like to draw the Minister's attention to a problem in connection with radio and television reception.  It is still true that in certain parts of the country interference is experienced with radio reception which some people attribute to the television service.  I do not know whether that is the case or not.  The technical advisers to the Minister would be in a position to advise him as to that. People who pay for wireless licences are annoyed by interference of any kind.  If the television service does interfere with radio reception, perhaps a way might be found of eliminating such interference.</P>
    <P>In regard to the television service itself, we have certainly made a very good start.  A creditable amount of native talent is being used.  The interest in programmes is all the greater because of this, since the type of entertainment with which the people are familiar is being provided. Plays and features such as &ldquo;Question Time&rdquo;, along with the programmes which give an opportunity to native talent, are very creditable.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education is now making available school libraries in certain selected areas, and I understand it is the intention to expand that service throughout the State.  I would appeal to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that there should be consultation in regard to the type of material used for children's programmes. A series of great interest to children was that in which the Outside Unit of Telefís Éireann visited such places as the Zoo.  This induced <Col N="1522" /> in children a lively interest in these places.  I wonder if such visits could be expanded and if he could correlate the children's programmes with the school library service?  In this way an interest in books on nature and travel might be supplemented by films which would give children a healthy interest in the outside world.  The best type of approach for children is the living picture, which can convey to them a greater knowledge of the world in which they live.  I believe such films are available and could be used by Telefís Éireann.  They would be both instructive and entertaining for the children.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to find a place for more of our native music, particularly band music, in the television service.  A great tradition has been built up around the Army No. 1 Band, and the appearance of this Band on any occasion excited admiration and interest.  Our great heritage of Irish music was popularised by the Army Band, but I am afraid it has been too readily forgotten in the maelstrom of modern music.  It would not be of any harm to the culture of the country if from time to time the television and broadcasting services were used to enable our people to hear our Irish music played by the Army No. 1 Band and the other Army bands.</P>
    <P>It is also a pity that some of the treasures in the National Gallery and the Museum cannot be seen by more of our people.  The interest children show in these when they come to Dublin on trips is very marked, but a large number of people will never have an opportunity of seeing them. I ask the Minister if it would be possible for Telefís Éireann to use the modern media available to them to bring to the people some of the treasures we have in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the matters with which I should like to have dealt have been commented on at length by other Deputies and I shall not delay the House.  Speaking generally on the new charges which have been imposed on the public as a result of the second Budget.  I believe that a Department which has to increase its charges, by <Col N="1523" /> as much as 66 per cent in some cases, for its services is either being very badly run or not under control at all. It is a bad example to set private enterprise, to set those people outside who have no compunction whatever about increasing their charges to the public.  I refer to the various manufacturers and industrialists who, at the slightest excuse, seize upon the opportunity to increase their charges and increase their profits.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand how the Minister can justify an increase of up to 66 per cent.  Such an increase coming so suddenly requires a very clear explanation from the so-called planners in this Department.  We heard a lot from the Government recently about planning.  I have always maintained they are not serious about planning. It is only a cant as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned.  It is proof of how incompetent they are to plan, if as a result of their planning the public are to be mulcted to the extent this Estimate envisages.</P>
      <P>I remember over the years being told in this House by former Ministers that the more people avail themselves of a service such as the telephone service, the lighter the charge would be.  In fact, we have the very opposite happening.  The greater the demand for such an essential service, the greater the imposition on those who seek that service.  There is something topsy turvy about that.  Other Deputies suggested that the capital cost of the equipment should be repayable over a very long period.  Nobody owns a telephone except the Department or the company.  The householder or business man simply rents this facility.  He is paying a rent for life for the equipment.  I cannot understand why charges should be so high in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The worst feature of the Government's mentality in this regard is, I think, the suggestion that these increase, upon which I have just commented, increases up to 66 per cent, are necessary to pay the increase in salary and wages of the personnel in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs <Col N="1524" /> and that, if this House does not vote the money, we are thereby objecting or refusing to agree to the increase being paid.  Other Deputies have referred to this matter.  A Government who adopt that attitude have nothing but contempt for the intelligence of the public.</P>
    <P>I should like now to comment upon our television service.  I shall not deal with the programmes because, if I did, I should say too much.  I look upon myself as a television fan, but I would not pay the licence fee for a television set if I were confined to Telefís Éireann as my sole source of viewing.  It is most aggravating to find, when I try to get reception from UTV or the BBC, that there is deliberate jamming of these stations by the powers who control Telefís Éireann.  There is no end to censorship in this country and here we have an attempt made to prevent the viewing public from seeing and listening to some of the very wonderful programmes available on both the BBC and UTV.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister has put himself on record as saying there is no jamming and no deliberate interference. I would point out to him that Eamonn Andrews, the Chairman of the Board, is on record as saying that there would be interference with the BBC and UTV when Telefís Éireann came into operation.  The Minister's reply, when challenged, was to the effect that, when Mr. Andwers made that statement, the Minister himself sent out for the script and the statement did not appear in the script; therefore, it must have been an off-the-cuff statement.  But, whether or not it was in the script, the statement was made and we know today that there is deliberate interference.</P>
    <P>I shall give the Minister two examples now.  Take the city of Galway. Until Telefís Éireann was established, there was perfect reception of UTV in Galway.  Since Telefís Éireann was established, there is simply no possibility of seeing UTV in the Galway area.  In Roscommon, up to the time Telefís Éireann started to beam its service down that way, we had a clear picture from the BBC.  People <Col N="1525" /> in those areas bought their television sets before ever Telefís Éireann was heard of.  In what position do these people find themselves now?  They are lucky to get a blurred picture and, when they do get this blurred picture, bad as it is, the situation is aggravated by the sound interference; and this sound interference, in my opinion, comes at the most extraordinary times.  It is intended evidently to interfere with some of the best programmes beamed from UTV and BBC in case the watching public might be induced to watch these programmes in preference to some of the rubbish Telefís Éireann has on at the same time.</P>
    <P>When I say the rubbish that Telefís Éireann has on at the same time, I do not mean to suggest that all the programmes are bad&mdash;anything but. There are some excellent programmes at the moment and, although I am critical of Telefís Éireann, I admit that a great improvement has taken place with regard to the type of programme within the past 12 months. I do not think, however, that any of us can be satisfied with the standard at the moment.  I am very interested when I hear Deputies talking about Telefís Éireann because I can very frequently know that they come from an area where UTV and the BBC are not available.  If they were available, they would not praise Telefís Éireann so highly.</P>
    <P>After all, the only way one can judge any service or programme is by contrast or comparison with some other similar programme or service. When one sets the programmes on Telefís Éireann side by side with those available elsewhere, it is then that the true situation is established. I shall be told, of course, that we have not got the money, and so forth, available in Telefís Éireann that is available to these other stations.  I am not concerned with that.  It would be a better proposition for this country to reduce the hours of operation and have good programmes as against filling in time with imported rubbish from America, rubbish on which somebody is making a damn good profit.</P>
    <P>American films are shown which <Col N="1526" /> are practically worn out as a result of being re-run so often over the past ten years.  They are now coming here, bought in bulk, I presume.  I should like to know who the agent is who is making money on this.  It is too bad that the public should have to suffer such a number of these programmes. We can, of course, cater for the lowest common denominator, if that is what Telefís Éireann is after. The Authority has a glorious opportunity to fulfil two functions&mdash;provide something which will help to educate the people and, at the same time, programmes that are amusing or interesting. A happy balance should be established.  If we are to overload the screen with what I describe as rubbish, then I should prefer a blank screen for one or two hours.  The public would be none the worse off.</P>
    <P>When people look at this crazy box, they get hypnotised after a while and they forget that what they are looking at is, in fact, something which, if it were shown in the cinemas, they would refuse to go and see.  It is all too easy to bring this rubbish into the home and have it there until people forget to ask questions and demand better programmes.  The only way we will get better programmes is by co-operation with UTV and the BBC. Instead of erecting a green curtain along the Border we should have the greatest co-operation possible with the BBC and UTV.  After all, if UTV and the BBC are encourged to beam their programmes to reach the farthest part of this country, that will generate a greater interest in television and thereby help Telefís Éireann.  One can travel along roads in the west for ten or 15 miles without seeing a single television aerial.  The people will not pay £5 for the sake of looking at Telefís Éireann but, if they had a choice of station and could look at Telefís Éireann when they felt like it, the revenue of the Department would be increased, through increased licence fees.</P>
    <P>The new idea of school programmes is very welcome, but it is very limited. I can cast my mind back to the time when, in this House and outside it, <Col N="1527" /> people advocated that Radio Éireann should be used for a period every day for school programmes.  That suggestion was thrown out.  It is very sad now to find that only a select few will benefit from the new programme being made available on Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister has power to decide on what type of advertising takes place on Telefís Éireann, and I want to ask him, if he has the welfare of the young people at heart, to do something about television advertising of cigarette smoking.  There is no use in telling me the Minister believes in the complete freedom of the individual. No one believes in the complete freedom of the individual to damage others.  The Minister should not stand over the outrageous claims made in the advertisements for cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>If it is a question of making money, there are other ways of making money. After all, if a parish priest were building a church, I do not think he would be happy if someone said to him: &ldquo;I will rob a bank and make you a present of £10,000.&rdquo;  That person would be condemned by the priest. If the advertisements say cigarette smoking is healthy, and makes a person vigorous and &ldquo;with it&rdquo;, they are inducing young people to harm their health, and they should not be given facilities to do that on a public service like television.</P>
    <P>I can suggest an alternative method of making money to the Minister.  He should tell the tobacco companies that he will allow them to advertise cigars and tobacco, but he should put the screws on so far as cigarettes are concerned. If necessary, he should suggest to them to reduce the price of tobacco, cigars and cheroots, and if that were done, I think quite a number of people who smoke cigarettes might be induced to smoke other tobaccos which are not considered harmful.  That would leave the money in the Exchequer which is now obtained from the tax on cigarettes. The Minister is in a position to say: &ldquo;I will not allow you to advertise on television unless you do that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1528" /> In addition, an effort should be made to alter the advertising times.  There is nothing so frustrating in a half-hour programme as to find that in the middle of that programme we have to suffer a series of advertisements.  In fact, if those people had any brains, they would realise that psychologically it is very bad to break into a half-hour programme. I find that if I want to buy an article, I will not buy the one which is advertised in the middle of a half-hour programme.  That is a form of revenge, if you like, for annoying me. Many people think on those lines.  I know we cannot force the Minister to get rid of advertising at present, but he has a duty to ensure that it is limited, and that short programmes are not interrupted by inane advertisements.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to comment on the cigarette advertisements on Telefís Éireann because the dangers involved in cigarette smoking will have to be tackled soon at Government level.  The Minister is in a position to take immediate steps to prevent improper advertising of that matter, without harming anyone, and without any restriction on the rights of the individual.</P>

      <P>During the course of his speech on 6th May, Deputy Dillon asked me about the wage claim of some Post Office grades.  I regret that in the reply which I made at that time I inadvertently misled the Deputy. The reference is column 1088 and column 1089 of the Official Report.  I said, correctly, that it is the Minister for Finance who deals with pay claims which the staff association request to have submitted to the arbitrator.  In reply to a further question, I gave the impression that the claim had been heard by the arbitrator.  What I had in mind was that this claim had been disposed of by the departmental conciliation council some little time ago.  I have since ascertained that it has not yet been heard by the arbitrator.  The order in which claims are taken by the arbitrator is settled between the staff representatives and the Department of Finance.  I understand the <Col N="1529" /> claim may be at present before the arbitrator.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  Another matter which was raised in the course of the debate was the pirate broadcasts from ships.  I want to tell the House that fresh legislation would be necessary before this Administration could take any effective action against the pirate broadcasts.  The Council of Europe has under consideration a Convention aimed at preventing broadcasting from ships outside territorial waters.  It is felt that the question of introducing fresh legislation in this country should not be pursued until agreement has been reached at the Council of Europe regarding the concerted action to be taken.</P>
      <P>The Department has of course already taken the one action open to it under existing legislation in that it has suspended since February, 1963, the radiotelephone and radiotelegraph services between the Irish coast radio stations at Malin Head and Valentia and any ship outside national territories engaged in broadcasting.  This suspension applies to all kinds of correspondence except messages affecting safety of life or navigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman questioned me about the meaning of a simple sentence in the English language.  He intervened to say he did not understand one particular sentence in my opening remarks. It appeared to me that Deputy Sweetman, thinking the sentence was not correct, and apparently not understanding its meaning was ready to pounce on the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and on the Minister for permitting a glaring mistake of this nature to appear in the script.  Deputy Sweetman avails of every opportunity he possibly can to highlight the Department as a Department of inefficiency and maladministration.  I explained the meaning of the sentence to Deputy Sweetman and I told him it was a simple sentence in the English language and should be easily understood but <Col N="1530" /> Deputy Sweetman seemed to persist in saying that it was an awkward kind of sentence.  I knew that Deputy Sweetman felt a bit humiliated as he stood there self-confessed to the House as being unable to understand a simple sentence in the English language and out of the fullness of the good nature with which God has endowed me, and for which my late parents were so well noted, I tried to soften Deputy Sweetman's humiliation by telling him it took me 15 minutes to understand the sentence without any consultation.</P>
    <P>When it came to Deputy Sweetman's turn to take part in this debate, he jumped up, and like the dog that bites the hand that feeds it, he snarled across the House at me; he bared his teeth and in the temper for which he is noted the bristles on the upper part of his lip stood on end and he tried in a slick manner to get on to the records of the House that I was the one who did not understand the sentence.  That was the reward I got from Deputy Sweetman for assisting him to understand a simple sentence in the English language.  I have come to the conclusion that Deputy Sweetman likes to hear himself abusing other people in what are known as dictatorial phrases.  I have a suspicion that Deputy Sweetman has some grudge which he is nursing against the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the reason I think that is so is that he never misses an opportunity to launch savage attacks on the personnel of the Department.</P>
    <P>I feel constrained here and now to do what I think has not been done before in this House by a Minister, that is, in a detailed way, to defend the men and women who are serving this country so well in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  This Department is constituted in the same manner as any other Department of State.  The chiefs of the Department are recruited in the same manner as their counterparts in any other Department.  The other grades are recruited in the same way; they come in through public competition conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners or in the very low grades&mdash;we call them &ldquo;low&rdquo; for want of a better term but I do not <Col N="1531" /> like using the word&mdash;they are appointed in other ways.  By and large, the 18,000 souls employed in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs deserve better treatment from Deputy Sweetman and other Deputies of the Fine Gael Party who launched attacks on them here in this and other debates.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate in this country to be blessed with a community who are honest in their approach to the problems of life and honest in the service they render to their employers. Our people, in view of their history, enjoy the highest reputation for honesty and integrity in the public and private sectors.  It will serves the public interest to highlight in the House any deficiencies that occur in the Post Office in relation to valuables the Post Office people handle, if and when in a very small number of cases valuables are lost by being extracted by the very few people employed by the Post Office who may be guilty of such offences.</P>
    <P>The Post Office handles million of letters and millions of parcels per year. Many of the letters contain valuables, money and dollar bills from America. There is not much point in Deputies holding forth here, asking questions and making charges against the Post Office administration in relation to the very small number of items that are lost, or the very small number of valuables extracted from packages carried by Post Office staffs, if they will not go to the trouble of giving the Post Office Investigation Branch all the details as quickly as they possibly can so that action can be taken to try to find the offenders.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I want it absolutely. However, I want to tell the House the Investigation Branch are ever alert and ever mindful of the obligations that have been placed upon them to follow whatever information they get and to keep an eye on any losses that may occur in the postal services.  As regards the people who are found guilty of these offences, the branch must bring them to court or take whatever other action the Minister can take against them and dispense with their services in the Post Office.</P>
      <P>The Post Office has a secretary, a talented man of high repute, a first class administrator, a man of ability who can give advice to a Minister to enable him to control the Department. The same applies to the heads of the other branches in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and I cannot see why Deputy Sweetman should make such savage attacks on the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to any Deputy challenging me with dereliction of duty or want of intelligence in the administration of the Department.  I have <Col N="1533" /> no objection whatsoever to a Deputy holding me responsible for any deficiencies that may exist in the Post Office or in the Department.  That is what I am here for and that is what this Parliament is here for, so that the affairs of the Post Office may be discussed openly and above board.  Therefore any Deputy is quite free to make whatever complaints, suggestions or observations he wishes in relation to the administration of the Department.</P>
    <P>Over the past year, many claims have been made on the Post Office by the representatives of the staffs.  It is not merely the ninth round or 12 per cent increase that is involved.  I have already indicated to the House we have had many status claims made on behalf of the staffs.  These status claims were submitted to the departmental council.  Some of them have been determined by the arbitrator and others are still pending.  During the year, also, the subpostmasters, through their representatives on the conciliation council set up specially to deal with their case, have agreed to certain proposals in respect of increased remuneration.  In addition, they will obtain the ninth round or 12 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>It is calculated that in a full year the increases will amount to £2,500,000. My problem is to collect that amount of money to pay the staffs.  It has always been the practice and the settled policy since the foundation of the State that the Post Office should pay its way one year with another.  Deputy Dillon seemed to think, from what he said in this debate, that increasing Post Office charges to customers was a fraudulent and deceitful method of escaping a further increase in taxation, that I was really letting the Minister for Finance out, and the increased charges should be provided for by additional taxation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney said it was a £2 million trick.  The Labour Party Deputies have made their policy statement in relation to this practice or principle which has stood the test of time since the State was founded, that the Post Office should pay its way.  I felt I had an obligation to continue that policy. I can assure the House and Deputy Dillon that I put the proposals contained <Col N="1534" /> in the published statement setting out the increased charges to the Government for approval and that I was not asked by the Government to increase postal charges as a substitute for additional taxation proposed in the normal way by the Minister for Finance.  I am not being used by the Government to extract £2,500,000 from the people.  I am following the practice which has obtained since the State was founded.</P>
    <P>There were increased charges in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in 1956.  On 4th June, 1956, it was proposed to raise the telephone rates as from 1st July, 1956.  The telegraph rate had been increased previously.  I do not like referring to deceased Deputies or quoting what they said, or making reference to what they are reported to have said in the Official Debates, but suffice it for me to say that in 1956 the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who unfortunately is no longer with us, assured Deputy Childers in this House when he asked him some question in this regard that he was following out the settled policy of previous Administrations and he was convinced that it was the proper thing to do.  He had convinced himself, and said from the first time he set foot in the Post Office, that the Post Office was to pay its way, and that the only method by which the Post Office would pay its way was by increasing the charges for Post Office services in order to obtain the increased revenue needed to pay the increased costs, from whatever source they arose.</P>
    <P>He also said at the time that the costs arose from increased pay awards. I fail to see why Deputies speaking from the Labour Benches think that because I followed exactly the same course as the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I was pointing my finger at the auxiliary postmen, the cleaners in the Post Office, the unestablished postmen or any other employee of the Post Office and bringing public attention to bear on these people in the sense that they, and they alone, are responsible for the increased postal charges.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Labour Party <Col N="1535" /> announcement of policy on this matter. I assumed that the Labour Party have committed themselves to the policy that the Post Office should pay its way. I was convinced on that point when I brought the matter to the notice of Deputy Tully when he was speaking here on this Estimate.  He felt cross at me when I made reference to that point, but I did so in all honesty.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing to know, and to have it from the Leader of the Labour Party, what the Labour Party's attitude is on this question now.  As I understand it, and as I understood from the speech by Deputy Corish, Leader of the Labour Party, the Labour Party advocate a different policy from that advocated by me on this matter.  The Labour Party believe now that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should be treated as an ordinary Civil Service Department, the same as the Department of Health, the Department of Defence or any other Department of State, and that the Department should depend on the revenue from taxation, through the Minister for Finance, for whatever deficits might arise from year to year.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me from the statement made by the Leader of the Labour Party that the Labour Party were prepared to go further than that and that they might consider the financing of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs entirely from the Department of Finance, with a refund of whatever income the Department of Posts and Telegraphs secured in any given year.  It might be that the Labour Party would favour the handling of this matter entirely by a Civil Service Department in the same sense as the Department of Defence, the Department of Health or any other Department, and not bother about income which the Post Office might or might not earn.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Fine Gael Party was not so clear in his policy statement, if he made a policy statement. Neither was any of the other Deputies of the Fine Gael Party clear on this question.  I should be glad if the Fine Gael Party would make up their <Col N="1536" /> minds on this matter and say once and for all whether they subscribe to the principle that the Post Office should be subsidised out of taxation.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the decision were taken to meet the deficits arising in the Post Office this year and last year as a result of pay increases and pay awards to the staffs in the Post Office and to the increased remuneration being paid to the subpostmasters, by subsidising the Post Office to that extent, and additional taxation were needed by the Minister for Finance, would the members of the Fine Gael Party do exactly as they did on the Budget divisions and vote against any increase in taxation to enable the Post Office to meet deficits that arose last year as a result of the retrospective awards and the status claims that will arise next year?</P>
    <P>Last year, the deficit was £300,000. This year it will be close on £2 million. Anyway, it will be over £1½ million. If I do not secure the necessary revenue from the increased charges which I have indicated in my public statement to the Press, and here in this House by circulation on the day I introduced my Estimate, I will have to take the necessary steps to meet the cost.  There are no two ways on this matter.  We must, if we are to continue the system of arbitration and conciliation, and if we are to meet the national agreements which have been arrived at in this State in relation to the pay awards, take the necessary steps to meet the cost.  In so far as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is concerned, it is my view that the Department should as far as possible pay its way. The increases in charges for postal services will not fully provide the increased amount of money needed to meet the pay awards.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the whole range. I have had the whole range of our services and their costs examined.  It is not true to say that these increases have been arrived at in a haphazard way.  That is not a fact.  We were faced with the task of securing a certain amount of money and I had to go through the whole range of services and make each service bear its share of the cost.</P>
      <P>I think I have dealt fairly fully with this question of increased charges and the reasons for these increases.  It naturally follows that if the motion which Fine Gael have tabled on this occasion, and which has been taken with this Estimate, is by any chance passed by this House, I shall not be able to pay the staff of the Post Office the increases which have been awarded or are in the course of being awarded, by the arbitrator.  I shall not be able to pay the additional remuneration which has been agreed on in the case of the subpostmasters, for whom Deputy O'Donnell's heart was bleeding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and for a long number of years has been bleeding.  He has been pressing me for a long time to do something about the subpostmasters. I do not think there is any consistency whatsoever in a Deputy who will press me to give increases or arrange for increases to subpostmasters and, when we arrive at an arrangement or agreement to pay the increases, will support a motion to prevent the necessary money being raised to pay them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said before, Deputy Dillon said that this was a fraudulent and deceptive method of imposing fresh taxation.  I do not think there was anything fraudulent or deceitful about the claims that were made by the staffs in the Post Office for status or <Col N="1538" /> other increases.  I do not think there was anything fraudulent or deceitful in the manner in which these claims were handled at arbitration.  I do not think there was anything fraudulent or deceitful in my announcement that the post office users would pay for the increases through the medium of increased postal charges.  I do not think there is anything deceitful in making an arrangement with the subpostmasters, through conciliation, to give them extra remuneration.</P>
    <P>The subpostmasters, as we know, were excluded from conciliation and arbitration in 1949.  They were fobbed off in 1956 with a consultative council and in 1956 the then Administration took every possible step they could take to exclude the word &ldquo;conciliation&rdquo; from the title of the council they set up and they called it a consultative council.</P>
    <P>During the past year, the subpostmasters withdrew their services.  There were two strikes, as a matter of fact. In the course of the second withdrawal of labour, there was an announcement of policy from the Fine Gael Party. After a meeting of the Central Committee of the Party, the Leader of the Party, Deputy Dillon, announced that the Party, or he himself, was in favour of the admission of the claims of the subpostmasters to arbitration.  We are here now with an agreement to give the subpostmasters an increase in their remuneration and Deputy Dillon will vote against the raising of the necessary moneys to meet the claim.  I call that the essence of fraudulent and deceitful behaviour.</P>
    <P>It is small wonder that the people of this country have taken the measure of Deputy Dillon.  It is small wonder that they regard him as the purveyor of fraudulent and deceitful statements of policy in relation to his Party.  They want to increase the pay of the auxiliary postmen; they want to increase the pay of all the staffs in the Post Office; they want to spend money on various services in the Post Office; they advocate that every time an Estimate is debated here for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs; but, when it comes to providing the necessary  <Col N="1539" /> moneys, they will not vote for it either through the medium of taxation or through the medium of increased charges.  That is what I call a two-way system whereby they think they are fooling the workers in the Post Office and codding the voters from whom they think they will catch a few votes at any election, by voting against increased taxation or increased charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's Government fobbed them off with a consultative council.  I gave them a conciliation council and I gave them a commission of inquiry into the workings of the system.</P>
      <P>Let us get down to the question of the telephone service and the provision of telephones.  My estimate of the needs of the telephone service can be measured, as can also Deputy Sweetman's estimate.  There is not much trouble in measuring either estimate. In 1956, he and his Government provided through the instrumentality of the Telephone Capital Bill capital to the extent of £6 million for the development of the telephone service and this year I am investing £6 million in the development of the telephone service&mdash;in one year.  But, in 1956, the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was very perturbed about his £6 million Capital Bill that was provided for by his Government.  He expressed himself on a few occasions in relation to it.  He was wishing that he had £8 million instead of the £6 million, and he said that if he had £8 million he would not have to cut down on some of the development work that he had prepared.  He referred to the shortage of capital then obtaining.  He made reference to the fact that money was needed for other purposes at the time and he spoke of what he proposed to do with the limited amount of capital made available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every time this question of shortage of capital in 1956 is mentioned, it draws from both Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Dillon a most shocking <Col N="1540" /> reaction.  They make all classes of savage attacks on me and on the Department of Posts and Telegraphs because I have the hardihood to mention this question of shortage of capital in 1956.  But the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs had no compunction whatsoever in making reference to it.  He indicated that if he had more capital he could do more to develop the telephone service.  In my view, he knew the problem he had on his hands in relation to the extension and further development of the telephone service.  He said this:</P>
    <P>We are concentrating at the moment on setting up small exchanges such as in Mullingar to link up with those remote areas and in that way to penetrate into the dark vastnesses that have not been penetrated. That will probably be difficult solely because I am not looking for enough money but we are not going to abandon any scheme we have on the programme. </P>
    <P>He was talking about providing a telephone service in the dark vastnesses. He was putting up a telephone exchange in Mullingar.  He said his aim was to continue the improvement of trunk services, particularly on routes on which there were delays. There were delays then as well as now. He said the programme would have to be a restricted one as compared with that which would be undertaken if there were no capital difficulties.  He said he personally would have liked to have looked for £2 million more as he told the Dáil when introducing the last Telephone Capital Bill.  That was for £8 million and covered a period of five years.  He was looking for £6 million to cover a period of four years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister looking for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1960, I introduced a Bill for £10 million for five years and we have that money already invested in the service.  Last year, I brought in a Bill for £30 million. That is £40 million for less than a decade.  I think Deputy Dillon, Deputy Sweetman and Deputy P. O'Donnell just cannot understand the extent of <Col N="1541" /> the investment this Government contemplate for the development and extension of the telephone service.  It is something they could not think of when in office themselves.</P>
      <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell, a Front Bench member of Fine Gael, threw out a suggestion at the end of his speech that the telephone service should be developed by a public company such as the ESB.  I do not know if that is the policy of Fine Gael.  I believe it is Deputy P. O'Donnell's own suggestion. Fine Gael deputies are great at throwing out suggestions, but when they are in Government they will not do these things themselves.  He was talking about going to the public for further capital for the telephone service.  At present we have no difficulty in obtaining the capital needed.  The capital for the telephone service comes out of the public savings invested in the Post Office.  What better way is there of getting capital for the telephone service than through this medium?</P>
      <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell also made a statement, that was either blatantly dishonest or stupidly foolish, in relation to what he called the recurring blister imposed on the users of the postal services to pay for the increased investment in the telephone service. That is not so.  That money was needed to pay staff and not pay for the telephone service.  We have no difficulty in getting the necessary capital.  The difficulty lies in the converting of that capital into equipment, in getting that equipment into the country quickly enough, in getting sufficiently trained staff to use it so that the exchanges can be extended, outlets from the exchanges increased, trunk lines installed, underground and overground cables fitted as soon as possible.  This is a tremendous, long-term task.  It is something that cannot be completed in a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already indicated my assessment of the needs of the telephone service in reply to Deputy A. Barry: £40 million of an investment in a decade, mainly for equipment and for the staff necessary to operate this equipment. This tremendous undertaking is now in full spate.  It has been going on since 1960, long before the Fine Gael Deputies <Col N="1542" /> thought about making any suggestion for an efficient and effective telephone service.</P>
    <P>I recognise that this is nation building, that an efficient and effective telephone service is necessary for the expanding economy we enjoy.  I recognise the future of this country depends on increased productivity and exports, increased work in factory and field, and that it is absolutely necessary to have an efficient and effective telephone service to serve those needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Engineering Branch and the Telephone Branch are staffed in much the same way as other branches of the public service.  The Telephone Branch is controlled by civil servants and the Engineering Branch by engineering graduates from our own universities.  The staff is composed in the main of personnel trained in the country by the serving staff.  I am satisfied these men have the knowledge to enable them to carry out this programme of work.  I would much prefer to rely on their advice in this matter than on the suggestions tendered to me by Deputy Sweetman or any other Deputy who may not be fully equipped to assess the extent and complexity of the work as they are.  It is their job.  That is the only method by which I, as Minister, can carry out this all-important programme of reconstructing almost completely the telephone network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of extra telephonists in the Central Exchange or any other exchange in Dublin would not improve the situation in view of what I have told the House in regard to the requirements of the telephone service. It is true we are increasing the telephone <Col N="1543" /> staff this year.  Deputy Dillon seemed to think we are doing it at his suggestion.  Last year, he and other Deputies suggested recruiting further telephonists in order to relieve the pressure on the Central Exchange in Dublin in the summer.  I know that pressure on the Central Exchange last summer was terrific and the exchange just could not handle all the traffic offered because of deficiencies on the technical side.</P>
    <P>The people responsible for maintaining exchanges know exactly the number of personnel that can usefully be employed in an exchange.  One has to have work positions and sufficient outlets to enable each person to be usefully employed.  If one has not got sufficient outlets and work positions there is no point in having a number of telephonists standing in the exchange with nothing to do.  The number of telephonists in exchanges will be increased so soon as work positions are available and additional outlets are provided to enable personnel to be usefully employed.  That is just plain common sense.  There is no other way out of the situation.</P>
    <P>I have indicated to the House the vastness of the job on which I am engaged in providing this country with an efficient and effective telephone service.  I should like now to make some comment on the waiting list of applicants.  It is true that there has been at all times over a long number of years a waiting list of applicants. This is a service in which one can hardly avoid having a waiting list. There are on the waiting list, I know, a number of people who applied up to three years ago.  There may be one or two who applied earlier than that.  I am aware of that but, when I was making my decisions in regard to the carrying out of this programme, I knew that the decision to defer applications for new telephones would not be a very popular one.  I do not see how it could be.  One is dealing with human beings and they naturally will complain if they cannot get the telephone within a reasonable time <Col N="1544" /> after making application.  They write to the Minister, to their local Deputies, local Senators, to the papers.  They will raise the matter as best they can. There are large numbers who do not write to anybody.  They just sit and wait.  The decision to defer applications was made deliberately by me because I felt it was much better to provide the essentials absolutely required, and quickly, to enable the users of the telephone to have the best use of the service until it was fully improved.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter I should like to bring to the attention of the House.  The capital cost of installing a telephone is not met fully by the subscriber.  Where one has to instal a telephone three miles, or maybe more, from the exchange the capital costs are very high.  It is my job to conserve as far as I possibly can the capital made available to me for the more essential part of the work, namely, the purchase of this very heavy equipment, which is very, very expensive, to enable the engineers to complete as quickly as they possibly can the work they have in hand.  It is no pleasure for me to have people on a waiting list for telephones.  None whatever.  I am having a look at the cases on the list for a long time to see if anything can be done to have their applications dealt with now.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage in this all-embracing programme at which we can look forward at least to the day when we can tackle more vigorously and with greater effort the waiting list of applicants.  I could by an administrative decision direct the Engineering Branch to connect applicants on the waiting list and they would do that, I suppose, inside a year.  I will not do that for the reasons I have stated.  I think the decisions I have taken are the correct decisions and the proper decisions, even though they may mean a good deal of criticism and a good deal of complaint, a good deal of grumbling from the people on the waiting list and, in some cases, a good deal of misunderstanding.  I am prepared to put up with that in the knowledge that the Engineering Branch are going full steam ahead with the provision <Col N="1545" /> of the essentials absolutely needed to give the country this service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I want to explain.  The Engineering Branch are continually taking applicants off the waiting list by installing telephones. They do that in areas.  They clear an area as far as they possibly can.  As the Deputy knows, there is a reason for that.  The Deputy understands the matter very well.  About a year and a half from now, we should be in a position to deal more vigorously with the waiting list.  We will be able to assess the situation and get a clear picture of how we stand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not commit myself on a matter of that kind.  In so far as the service itself is concerned, we have had many complaints here in regard to it.  We have had complaints about people not getting service when they dial or suffering delay.  It is true that in a service of this kind one simply cannot get perfection.  It is not within the ingenuity of man to perfect a machine that will give 100 per cent service at all times and the telephone service is no different from any other complicated machine man has invented. We are not alone in suffering delay and frustration in making telephone calls.  In the <i>Irish Times</i> of 21/8/63 an article appeared in the &ldquo;London Letter&rdquo; headed &ldquo;Wrong Number&rdquo;.  Reading it, one would imagine one was in Leinster House listening to a Fine Gael Deputy complaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Telephone subscribers in the Republic can, perhaps, gain some consolation from the fact that services in many parts of this country also leave much to be desired. Eighteen years after the end of the <Col N="1546" /> war many potential subscribers are still awaiting connection.</P>
    <P>And those who do possess telephones frequently experience inordinate delays in making calls over quite short distances.  For London subscribers, at any rate, another hazard has recently been added to all the others.  This is the frequency with which one gets either the wrong number or no ringing tone when dialing local calls.</P>
    <P>This latest development is possibly due to two causes, or a mixture of both.  One is the introduction of subscriber trunk dialling, which, being a complicated system, could lead to greater error in the post office's equipment.  The other is that some automatic exchanges are just worn out.  But whatever the reason the sum effect is frustration and annoyance not to mention wasted pence. </P>
    <P>As far as subscriber trunk dialling is concerned, we are installing subscriber trunk dialling here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman had complaints about the automatic exchanges in Kildare.  Unfortunately, when the automatic exchanges were opened in Kildare, we ran into a good deal of trouble with them, through no fault of the engineers of the Department.  They rectified whatever mistakes appeared in the system.  Deputy Sweetman admitted that the local call areas served by the exchanges were all right. The difficulty arose in relation to calls made outside the local call areas.  That matter will be looked into, and is being looked into, but unfortunately these deficiencies and these faults arise. When there is a fault on a line and a person dials, he can dial until he gets tired and get no answer.  It is not easy to account for these matters, nor is it easy to find a solution for them.</P>
    <P>In that connection, <i>The Times</i> of 26th August, 1963, had this to say about tricks of the telephone subscriber trunk dialling system:</P>
    <P>Subscriber trunk dialling was ushered into this country almost five years ago in a blaze of progressive, go-ahead publicity by the Post <Col N="1547" /> Office.  By 1965, after some fits and starts&mdash;like the business in Kildare &mdash; rather more than half the subscribers in the country will be able to test the claims made on behalf of the system.  The grand design itself can hardly be faulted. It is convenient to be able to dial distant telephones directly, a convenience often taken for granted when the variable quality of operator service has disappeared from the memory.  That being said there is&mdash;in the report published on another page today&mdash;a suspiciously defensive note in the Post Office's answers to some common criticisms of the service.  We are told that there appears to have been an increase in the number of crossed lines, due to faults in the machinery; but that these represent &ldquo;only a small percentage&rdquo; in view of the volume of traffic handled.</P>
    <P>Some people may well wonder whether the percentage is as small as all that and whether, in view of the very large amount of capital being sunk into the telephones system each year, they should not demand a higher standard of efficiency. To say that the system handles a &ldquo;fantastic number&rdquo; of calls each year is really no answer.  Both the Postmaster General and his deputy have been willing to brag about the success of their work here, pointing to the rapid increase in the annual total of trunk calls since STD began.  Hence a &ldquo;small percentage&rdquo; means a steady rise in the absolute figures of abortive telephone calls.  Why?  Is the machinery being overloaded, or is it poorly maintained?  Or are we to be told, yet again, that these are merely teething troubles which are inseparable from any major programme?</P>
    <P>It may be true, as the Post Office says, that some proportion of the difficulties are caused by people who are unfamiliar with the technique required for the new method of dialling. </P>
    <P>There is a good deal in that.  It continues:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> Even the regular user of the telephone may, at the start, find it relatively simple in a moment of aberration to find himself speaking to a florist's in Bradford instead of the shipwright in Bristol that he wanted to talk to.  This kind of error will be reduced by practice. But it does not account for being precipitated into the middle of the conversation of utter strangers, for having one's own conversation interrupted by other callers, or for the prolonged and enigmatic silences&mdash; much longer than eight seconds, incidentally &mdash; which the system frequently imposes upon the caller. In short, there is much room for improvement.  The system may, like its human counterparts, have off days.  It certainly shows an almost sentiment perversity from time to time. </P>

      <P>I have another article dealing with telephones in Britain which gives the numbers on the waiting list.  There are thousands on the waiting list.  I shall not burden the House by reading this long article but I shall read the first sentence:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is all very well this Telstar business&rdquo; wrote one old lady to the Chief Engineer of the Post Office. &ldquo;I would just wish you would move my telephone to the back room.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Apparently this lady wanted to have her phone removed from one room to another, and the Post Office were not able to get around to doing the job for her, while someone was talking about Telstar.  When I mentioned Telstar in my opening statement, I thought great play would be made by Opposition Deputies about the anxiety we were showing in relation to intercommunication by Telstar, and the number of people on the waiting list for telephones, or who wanted an extension to their phones.  As I say, this old lady was seeking to have her phone moved from one room to another, and the great organisation of the British Post Office was not able to facilitate her.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1549" /> I would not wish the House, or anyone else, to think I would be satisfied with an inefficient or bad telephone service.

      <P>Now the Deputy knows.  Deputy Kyne asked me about the buildings and supplies branch.  He raised the question on the 1962/63 <Col N="1550" /> Estimate also, of the purchase of a site for a new post office at Dungarvan. A rights to light question, between the vendor and an adjoining tenant which needed to be investigated before building operations could commence, has been resolved to the satisfaction of the Department and a contract for the sale of the property has been executed.  The remaining legal formalities in connection with the purchase of the site are proving to be more troublesome than originally expected but every effort is being made to complete the purchase as soon as possible.  The Office of Public Works have prepared preliminary plans for the erection of a new post office and automatic exchange on the site.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy criticised the pay for the hours of attendance of night and Sunday telephone attendants. The present rates of pay were settled following agreement between the Post Office and the union in March, 1962 and were increased by 12 per cent, the ninth round, from 1st February.  A claim for improvement in the present rates is being considered under conciliation and arbitration.  These are paid on an hourly basis and no request has been received for a reduction in the existing hours, but if any such request was received, it would be considered sympathethically.  The number of hours of attendance varies widely and is usually agreed on between the night and Sunday telephone attendants and the local postmaster. As Deputy Treacy indicated, these people do not work throughout the night and after midnight only deal with occasional calls which are in fact so rare that an attendant is provided with a bed and an especially loud bell rings to awaken him if a call comes in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies raised the question of the present uniform, which is made of a woollen and worsted material.  It was introduced in 1955 after consultation with the men's union.  Having regard to the nature of their work, the uniform has to be a good quality and capable of standing up to the abrasive action of postbags.  A claim received from the Post Office Union suggested that the uniform tends to become baggy and shows up dust.  Deputies <Col N="1551" /> have also brought this matter to my attention.  I want to tell the House that discussions have been initiated with a view to obtaining an improved quality of cloth which will be more serviceable and have a better finish and give better service.</P>
    <P>Deputy A. Barry raised the question of the symphony orchestra and suggested it should give performances in the provinces more often.  The radio orchestra has achieved its primary aim when it broadcasts.  It is well recognised that even radio orchestras must appear occasionally in public, if only to maintain interest in their work. Nothing can be worse than allowing instrumentalists to feel they are all the time playing in a vacuum.  That is why audiences are allowed into the studio to hear the orchestras.  I use the plural because we have of course two orchestras, the Symphony Orchestra and the Radio Éireann Light Orchestra. Deputy Barry knows that and appreciates it.  This in part has been the justification for allowing orchestras to participate in public performances of opera and ballet at many concerts in theatres and halls throughout the country.  This has added considerably to the cultural life of the country, as Deputy Barry said, but it also added considerably to the cost of the orchestra and with salaries and other costs mounting, the point has been reached where Radio Éireann must look closely at any commitments by way of tours or otherwise.  I deeply regret that we have to look at this matter in this way.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Authority had planned to give four concerts in Cork, one in Limerick and one in Waterford, in 1963-64.  The Limerick concert had to be postponed on that occasion and five were given to <Col N="1552" /> Cork.  I know that this matter of providing concerts in public is constantly before the Authority and that they will have read Deputy Barry's remarks with attention.  Personally I am fond of good music and avail of every opportunity of hearing it and I must confess I always have been.  I should like to agree also with Deputy Jones in regard to the television nature programmes, those relating to the zoo and so on.  I have always been fond of such programmes.  As Minister, however, I cannot give the Authority any direction and I feel the Authority must be allowed to decide these questions themselves.  Having regard to the extra cost and the support given to previous concerts, it must be borne in mind that the cost of the orchestra is already quite high compared with the number of listeners and viewers.  It is a pity that we cannot spend much more money on an orchestra such as the Symphony Orchestra or the Light Orchestra.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman had something to say about the postal service between here and Great Britain.  The service between Ireland and Great Britain is organised to give afternoon delivery in London.  The use of the air service for transit means that mails arrive earlier than when the steamer service between Dun Laoghaire and Holyhead was used.  This has enabled us to give better service and in Naas, for instance, the collection time is 6 p.m. for next day delivery in London.  In the reverse direction, I understand the latest hour of posting is 3.30 in the afternoon.  This is a matter for the British Post Office but by and large the service works to schedule, but like printers' errors and slips made by the most polished speaker, it is beyond human nature to expect there will not be the occasional lapse and that the odd letter somehow or other should not manage to escape the normal treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Crotty inquired about a claim on behalf of postmasters and why it has not been dealt with.  A status claim was received in December, 1963 and received a preliminary hearing in January, 1964.  In all, over 30 claims were received in the period September, 1963 to January, 1964. <Col N="1553" /> Deputies will appreciate that it is not possible to deal with all claims immediately and the order in which they are dealt with is agreed upon with the Staff Side.  I cannot say exactly when the postmasters' claim will be dealt with but all claims will be disposed of as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The question of piped or wired television was raised by Deputy O'Donnell. The Deputy spoke to me in my office some time ago about this matter. Listening to Deputy O'Donnell speaking here, one would think that the group of people he mentioned were going to provide this piped television out of their own good nature, that they were philantropists.  They were coming in as business people looking for a concession.  I think they wanted a monopoly.  Other people were seeking the same concession.  There are people in Deputy A. Barry's city who would be glad to go ahead with that sort of work.  When we came to discuss it, we found that the local authorities had not the power to grant authority for the erection of masts.  That has been rectified by the Minister for Local Government in legislation.  Deputy O'Donnell's group was not the first group and other people wrote to the Department earlier.  It was the first time that an outside person brought it to my notice.  I presume that Deputy O'Donnell called as a Deputy on me in this matter.  Having consulted with the Broadcasting Authority and with the responsible officials in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs on this question, I was advised against giving this concession to anybody except for transmissions from our own station. We gave a limited licence and power to erect a single aerial for this sort of reception for flats and a limited number of houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The one station only. That apparently did not meet the desires of the people who wanted to get the concession of piped television reception. This matter will be considered again.  The Authority asked me to defer making any concession to anybody <Col N="1554" /> in relation to it, otherwise than as I have stated, until the Authority found its feet and was in a position to withstand competition that might come from piped television through the other stations broadcasting to this country.  As I am sure Deputies will know, piped television will give better reception over a wider area from stations outside the country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jones referred to the delay of six weeks in the publication of the statutory notice of the erection of telegraph lines.  This obligation applies to the extension of overhead telephone lines along the public thoroughfares. The elimination of this obligation would relieve the Department of a moderate amount of administration work but would not effect the majority of cases at present on the waiting list in relation to the overall completion of the installation work involved.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister bear in mind the need for discretion in making these telephone connections? I think Deputy Tully referred to the poles erected in front of the average house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall do that.  It is a question of cost as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes these things are worth money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give attention to it anyway.  Some Deputy asked me about television satellite transmitters and transposers.  The expression &ldquo;satellite transmitter&rdquo; is loosely used to describe a low powered transmitter to which TV programmes may be fed in one of a number of ways, for example, by coaxial cable, or by microwave link or direct from another transmitter.  The word &ldquo;transposer&rdquo; on the other hand has a more definite meaning in that it describes a piece of equipment which is a combined TV receiver and transmitter.  Actually it receives the programme off the air from another transmitter and rebroadcasts it on a different channel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Authority's satellite programme is in two stages.  Stage I comprises the transposer which is now serving the <Col N="1555" /> northern part of Cork city; low power satellite equipment to cover the South Dublin region and which will involve separate transmitters for the 625 and 405 line standards; three transposers for County Donegal, one for County Monaghan and one for the Cobh, County Cork area.</P>
    <P>This stage should be completed by early 1965.  Stage II has not progressed far enough to enable definite plans to be made to cover other areas of poor reception.  On present estimates, stages I and II may cost £150,000 in all.</P>
    <P>I was also asked about the VHF service.  That is considered to be the best technical solution to the problem of providing sound broadcasting coverage in areas where it is at present unsatisfactory.  I decided after consultation and advice tendered to me by the Broadcasting Authority and by the Department to go ahead with the provision of the necessary capital moneys to enable them to provide this VHF service.  I know it will mean that a large number of radio receivers will not be capable of receiving this service from VHF and I understand that it will cost from £3 to £5 extra for a new set&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean it would cost £3 to £5 for adjustment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is interrupting me too soon.  We have had consultations with the manufacturers and the officials of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the manufacturers are not inclined to provide adapters for the sets that are at present in use.  I do not know what the ultimate outcome of the consultations will be.  I have no power to compel them to provide the extra equipment that is needed for the set.  Nevertheless, I have come to the conclusion that VHF is the answer to the problem and that we shall have to go ahead with it. Of course, the owners of sets that are at present in use will continue to get reception from sound radio wherever that reception is possible but in areas where it is not possible at the moment, <Col N="1556" /> where the reception is poor or bad, I am afraid that unless the manufacturers come over and provide the necessary extra equipment, these people will have to purchase new sets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but the decision to provide the VHF service could not be withheld.  This problem is of long standing and I felt I should take this decision.  At the time I took the decision I did not know that the manufacturers might not be too anxious to provide this necessary extra equipment.  I hope they will meet the situation and that they will provide the extra equipment.  It might be we could import that equipment.  I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Not all.  A number of statements on television were made here and they mostly concerned the day to day programmes of the television service.  I have indicated to the House on many occasions what exactly was the business of the Broadcasting Authority and I feel sure the majority of Deputies are satisfied with the conduct of affairs by the Broadcasting Authority and the Director General, Mr. Kevin McCourt.  I should like to pay my tribute to the work the Broadcasting Authority are doing and to compliment them on the service they are giving generally.  They realise their job is to improve the broadcasting service as far as they can within the limits their income imposes upon them.  If they continue to improve the television service and the sound broadcasting service as they have been doing since they were established, we cannot expect much more of them.  Television is a difficult, intricate business.  It is hard to please everybody.  The Authority must rely on imported programmes. However, because of the admirable way in which they have met their obligations and have dealt with any suggestions put to them by members of this House and by people outside, I feel certain they will create a <Col N="1557" /> fund of goodwill for themselves among the public and that in time they will give excellent value to the public for the cost.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman complimented the Department on the production of the new format of the accounts.  I am grateful to the Deputy for his remarks on this matter.  He complained, however, that the latest available ones were those for 1961-62 and drew an analogy with commercial concerns.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs, as far as these accounts are concerned, is primarily a Government Department and its definitive accounting statements are not the commercial accounts but the appropriation accounts.</P>
      <P>All internal accounting is related to the Appropriation Account.  Only when that Account has been completed and audited can the figures in it be reanalysed and classified on a commercial account basis.  Other Departments who supply us with important figures for the commercial accounts have also to complete their accounting processes before they can do so.  When it comes to the preparation and printing of the accounts, we are up against difficulties of a kind the Deputy is aware of. During his period as Minister for Finance he was responsible for the publication of the accounts and there were usually delays of eight to ten months between the completion of the accounts in my Department and their publication by his.  I do hope, however, to speed up the production of the commercial accounts.</P>
      <P>But I think that I should point out that, to facilitate Deputies, I introduced in the 1961-62 Estimate an appendix giving a summary of the latest commercial account results.  If Deputies turn to page 245 of the present volume, they will find in Appendix D such a summary of the results, including those for 1962-63&mdash;the latest year for which accounts are available. Perhaps I might also remind Deputy Sweetman that, in reply to a question of his on 9th April last, I gave him not only a summary of the results for 1962-63 but also an estimate of those for 1963-64.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1558" /> The Deputy also raised some questions of detail about the accounts, I think that if he looks at the Notes on page 14 of the accounts volume, he will find the answers there.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies seem to think that our postal rates, and the new postal rates after the increases are introduced, will not bear any comparison with British rates.  That is not so.  When the proposed new rates come into operation many of our charges will still remain below the corresponding British levels.  Our telephone exchange line rentals will be £12 a year, residence rate, and £14 a year, business rate, as compared with £14 and £16 a year respectively in Britain.  Our day-rates for long distance trunk calls i.e., for those over 75 miles, will be 3s. 0d. as compared with 3s. 6d. to 4s. 0d. for similar calls within the British service.</P>
    <P>On the postal side our minimum registration fee will be 1s. 0d. compared with the British rate of 1s. 9d. and our maximum insurance fee will be 1s. 3d. compared with the British fee of 1s. 11d.  Our main telegraph rates will be brought up to the British levels although the size and distribution of our population is such that on a comparative basis higher rates could be justified.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crotty felt that the proposed increases in parcel post rates were particularly outrageous but here again our revised rates will still be more favourable than British rates; our new scale of parcel charges will run to a maximum of 6s. for a 22 lb. parcel as against 6s. 6d. in Britain.  I would also like to point out that the Post Office enjoys no monopoly in the carriage of parcels.  Senders are free to avail of the services of other carriers or make their own arrangements for carriage and delivery.</P>
    <P>If they decide to do so, they will, I feel sure, find that the Post Office charges in question, which cover transport from the nearest Post Office to the most isolated part of Ireland or Great Britain are not unreasonable after all.  The Post Office is only seeking to recover its costs and to do so directly from the persons who use and benefit from the service.  The alternative  <Col N="1559" /> is to pass those costs on to the general taxpayer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

As I said in introducing the Estimate my Department is highly cost conscious and there has been a constant striving for improvements, modernisation and economies.  Through its membership of the Universal Postal Union and the International Telecommunications Union the Department keeps in close touch with improvements and developments in the postal and telecommunication services and also as required it avails itself of the specialist services provided by these organisations. In 1958 for instance we had the services of a United Nations expert to help plan the subscriber trunk dialling network and some of our Engineers went abroad under UN Fellowships to study certain aspects of telecommunications. Incidentally the Department holds a high reputation internationally and in recent years several of its officers have been selected to assist developing countries under schemes sponsored by the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the telecommunications side, the outstanding examples of the Department's drive for efficiency and economy are the telephone automisation programme incorporating subscriber trunk dialling, the modernisation of the Telegraph service and the introduction of the new service Telex.  Even with the increases in charges recently announced the percentage increases in telephone charges since the war are lower than in those of most other commodities and services.  The modernisation of the telegraph service and the introduction of Telex service have reduced substantially <Col N="1560" /> the losses incurred in the operation of the telegraph service.</P>

      <P>I know it has.  On the postal side, sorting fittings have been modernised, mail circulation arrangements revised and mechanical aids installed wherever their use was warranted.  The new sorting office being built in Dublin will incorporate the most up-to-date mechanical aids for sorting and mail handling.  The entire rural services have been reorganised since the end of the war and six day delivery was introduced on a country-wide basis at no extra cost where previously delivery had been restricted in many cases to 3, 4 or 5 days weekly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We are introducing motor transport in certain places. There are some small areas where the reorganisation I have mentioned has not been fully completed.  There is another matter affecting the auxiliary postmen about which I might tell the House and Deputy O'Donnell.  A competition was held last year for established postmen who will be assigned to established posts throughout the country.  Some of these posts are filled by temporary or auxiliary postmen and this will mean that people temporarily employed will be replaced by established men.  I would not wish that to be confused with the idea that we contemplate doing away with posts.  There is no decision on that at all.  I think a number of auxiliary postmen services are suitable for this country and suit the Post Office as well as the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1561" /> The entire operations of the workman staff engaged in telephone construction and maintenance were examined and overhauled by a firm of industrial consultants in the period 1953 to 1955.  The question of their further employment has been considered from time to time but the prospect of economies was not regarded as sufficiently encouraging to warrant doing so.</P>
    <P>The Department will have no hesitation in employing industrial consultants at any time if it considers that the results will justify the expenditure involved.  The Department has been a pioneer of Organisations and Methods in the Civil Service and it has a number of officers who have been trained specially for this work.  Substantial economies have been achieved as a result of the activities of the Organisation and Methods staff.  For example, automatic data processing was introduced into the Savings Bank in 1962, yielding considerable staff savings.  It has recently been extended to telephone accounting which was previously overhauled and modernised some years ago, and it is intended to extend its use into other fields of activities where this can be done with advantage.  In addition various accounting and other clerical procedures in the Post Office have been examined in detail over the years to ensure that wasteful practices are eliminated and that checks are reduced to the minimum consistent with the proper conduct of the work.</P>
    <P>The outline I have given is necessarily very brief but I hope that it will serve to show that the Post Office has been alive to its responsibilities to increase efficiency and keep the costs of the services it provides at the lowest possible level.  This is not to say that the organisation is perfect, that there is no scope for further improvements. There is undoubtedly scope for further improvements and I can assure the House that the Post Office will spare no effort to secure them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon seemed to think that he could absorb the increases that have fallen due to be paid this year and last year out of the surpluses that accrued in the Post Office over a number <Col N="1562" /> of years and he quoted years and the amounts of surplus since 1956-57. That is true but, of course, there is a hole in that bucket.  In the commercial accounts, even on the page where surpluses are shown, the deficits are shown from 1952 to 1963 and, taking it all over the years, the deficits and the surpluses just about balance each other.  There is a small surplus at the end of whatever number of years the Post Office has been working since the establishment of the State.  There is no fund there which could absorb the shock of the £2½ million increase in any given year.</P>
    <P>I want to say in conclusion, that the debate was a peculiar debate.  I am regarded as a courteous person.  I am regarded by some Deputies as a person who should not be here at all.  Others say I am doing a reasonable job.  I am not in the least affected by what people say about me.  I never was.  For some reason or other, I do not bother about praise or criticism.  It does not affect me in the least.  I just carry out my work in a cool, calm and collected manner.  As long as I am giving to the country service to the best of my ability, I am quite satisfied.  Any day the public are not satisfied with that, when the election comes along, they know what to do.</P>
    <P>I pass over Deputy Sweetman's personal references to myself with the contempt they deserve.  It is something that he recognises that I know more about the cattle trade than he does.  I would hate, however, to be judged on what I know of the Post Office by what he pretends to know about it.  I wish the Fine Gael Party would put their heads together and settle on some line of policy in relation to the Post Office.</P>

    <P>Ceithre mhilliún déag, sé chéad nócha a naoi míle agus dhá chéad punt méid glan an Vóta.  Tá an tsuim seo £849,700 níos mó ná suim na bliana anuraidh, nuair a chuirtear san áireamh meastachán breise de £1,170,000.  An chuid is mó den méadú sin, ba le haghaidh tuilleadh tuarastail a thabhairt do na hoidí é de bhárr cúrsaí Idir-réitigh agus Eadrána.  Bhí de thoradh ar na méadaithe tuarastail seo, stádas na n-oidí i gcoitinne a ardú i measc an phobail. Cosnóidh sé £1,600,000 sa bhliain chun an &ldquo;naoú babhta&rdquo; dena hardaithe tuarastail a thabhairt do na hoidí náisiúnta; beidh gá le meastachán breise ina chomhair sin.</P>
    <P>Sa scoilbhliain dar chríoch 30 Meitheamh, 1963, bhí 14,218 oidí ar fostó i scoileanna náisiúnta, i gcomórtas le 14,091 díobh sa scoilbhliain roimhe.  Dá bhrí sin, thárla méadú 664 i líon na n-oidí le cúig bliana anuas, ó 13,554 ar 30 Meitheamh, 1958.  Bhí 501,981 daltaí ar na rollaí i scoileanna náisiúnta ar 30 Meitheamh, 1963, méadú 1,187 ar an bhfigiúr a bhí ann cothrom an lae sin 1962.</P>
    <P>Is maith an dul-chun-cinn a deineadh anuraidh maidir le scoileanna nua a sholáthar agus dea-bhail a chur ar scoileanna eile.  I rith na bliana airgeadais seo caite, ceadaíodh deontais de £3,093,031 i leith céad is a dó dhéag scoileanna nua agus céad dachad a dó mór-scéimeanna méadaithe agus feabhsaithe.  Seo barr saothair nár baineadh amach ariamh roimhe. Soláthrófar áiteanna nua le haghaidh 20,854 daltaí scoile de bharr an tsaothair seo.  I gceantracha a bhfuil an pobal gann iontu agus mar a bhfuil éigcinnteacht ag baint leis na riachtanais scolaíochta fá chionn cúig bliana déag nó fiche bliain, tá leas á <Col N="1566" /> bhaint as foirgintí adhmaid atá réamhdhéanta chun cóiríocht chompórdach scoile a sholáthar do na daltaí.</P>
    <P>Beidh cuimhne ag Teachtaí gur cuireadh feabhas ar an gcoibhneas oide/dalta gach bliain le cúig bliana anuas.  Dá thairbhe sin, tá méadú sé chéad seasca a ceathair ar líon na n-oidí anois, mar atá luaite agam.  Níl deireadh fós, áfach, le fadhb na ranganna plódaithe sna scoileanna móra faoi na bailte móra agus cé gurbh fhéidir liom faoiseamh éigin a thabhairt dóibh siúd gach bliain le dhá bhliain anuas, chonnaictheas dom nár mhiste dlús a chur leis an bhfeabhsú.  Do chinneas, mar sin, go ndéanfadh cigirí mo Roinne suirbhé de na ranganna móra fá Bhaile Átha Cliath, ós é sin an áit is mó a bhfuil ranganna plódaithe ann.  Tá rún agam an líon daltaí a laghdú iontu chun go ndéantar inláimhseála iad.</P>
    <P>Tá fúm sin a dhéanamh tré na ranganna d'atheagrú; ach in aon áit nach féidir an t-atheagar a chur i gcrích gan dochar do chúrsaí oideachais, chuirfidh mé rangsheomraí réamhdhéanta ar fáil agus ceadóidh mé ceapachán pé oidí breise atá riachtanach.  Fá chionn na bliana seo beidh ó nócha go céad rangsheomraí réamhdhéanta agus fán tuairim chéanna d'oidí curtha ar fáil i scoileanna fá Bhaile Átha Cliath. Nuair a bheidh an suirbhé sa réigiún sin críochnaithe, tá beartaithe agam ceann cosúil leis a chur ar bun sa chuid eile den tír.</P>
    <P>Ina theannta seo, is ábhar pléisiúir dom a bheith in ann eolas a nochtadh faoin seú ceann sa tsraith feabhsúchán i gcúrsaí foirne.  Tá socair agam feabhsú na bliana seo a dhéanamh sna scoileanna sin a mbíonn raon fóirne ó chúigear go dtí aon duine déag acu, óir is iontusan is airde an coibhneas idir oidí agus daltaí.

I mbliana, tá an soláthar i leith leabharlanna méadaithe agam go dtí tríocha cúig mhíle púnt.  Cuirfidh an tsuim seo ar mo chumas leabharlanna a bhunú i níos mó ná míle dhá chéad scoileanna eile.  Seo leanas na contaethe atá roghnaithe agam: Sligeach, Roscomáin, Tiobraid Árann, Longfort, an Clár, Iarmhí, Ua bhFáile, Cill Manntáin, Loch Garman agus Lughbhaidhe.  Lena gcois siúd, cuirfear leabharlanna i scoileanna na gcontae-bhorg Luimneach agus Portláirge.  Is rún dom leabharlann a chur i ngach scoil náisiúnta laistigh de chupla bliain.  Na leabharlanna seo, i dteannta seirbhísí iasachta na n-údarás áitiúil, cuirfidh siad fairsinge leitheoireachta ar fáil do na daltaí scoile bíodh siad ar thóir an tsuilt nó an tsochair.  Agus an soláthar méadaithe seo dá chur ar fáil agam, is ábhar mór dóchais dom an fháilte fhonnmhar a fearadh roimh an scéim. Ba mhaith liom, ag an bpointe seo, mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl do na húdaráis áitiúla agus go háirithe do na leabharlannaithe contae sna cúig contaethe inar cuireadh tús leis an scéim as ucht ar thugadar de chomhoibriú agus ar chaitheadar de dhúthracht i dtionnscnamh na scéime.</P>
    <P>Ba mhian liom le tamall maith anuas na deontais le haghaidh téamh agus glanadh scoileanna náisiúnta a fheabhsú.  Is cúis áthais dom, mar sin, a fhoilsiú go bhfuil £100,000 eile sa soláthar i mbliana agus go bhfuil £237,000 ar fad ar fáil le haghaidh na ndeontas seo.  Ba chóir go gcabhródh an soláthar fónta seo chun feabhas mór a chur ar chúrsaí téite agus glanta in ár gcuid scoileanna.</P>
    <P>D'fhonn cuidiú leis an Aire Rialtais Áitiúil sa bhfeachtas atá ar bun aige chun na bóithre a dhéanamh slán. tá <Col N="1568" /> coiste idir-roinneach curtha ar bun agam leis an cheist a scrúdú maidir le sábháilteacht ar bhóithre a theagasc do na páistí scoile, agus le moltaí ina thaobh a dhéanamh liom.

    <P>Is féidir obair oideachais a bheadh thar a bheith éifeachtach a dhéanamh i gcúrsaí sábháilteacht ar bhóithre ach saothar a bheadh rialta agus bríomhar a chur ar bun sna scoileanna. Chabhródh sé sin go mór chun taismí bóthar a sheachaint agus, sa deireadh thiar chun glún óg a oiliúint a bheadh cúramach, ciallmhar agus eolach ag dul na bóithre dóibh.</P>

    <P>Ceithre mhilliún, dhá chéad seasca is dhá mhíle agus sé chéad punt an meastachán glan don mheánoideachas. Is ionann é sin agus £517,600 de mhéadú ar an méid a vótáladh anuraidh. Le deontais do scoileanna, tuarastal múinteorí agus scoláireachtaí iarbhunscoile is mó a bhaineann an méadú sin.  Níl aon soláthar ann do na méaduithe turastail do mheán-mhúinteoirí i leith stádais agus an &ldquo;naoú cúrsa&rdquo; a ceadaíodh le déanaí.  Cuirfear meastachán foirlíontach don mhéid atá i gceist&mdash;tuairim is £725,000 &mdash;os comhair na Dála in am tráth.</P>
    <P>Tá dhá chúis leis an méadú ar na deontais.  An chéad chúis díobh is ea an méadú atá ag teacht i gconaí ar an líon daltaí atá ag freastal ar mheánscoileanna agus an dara chúis is ea na rátaí méadaithe deontais chaipitíochta. Ní dheallraíonn sé go bhfuil aon mhaolú ag teacht ar an bhfás ar líon na ndaltaí.  Ag cruinniú luathais atá sé agus an t-iomlán don bhliain seo&mdash;beagnach 90,000&mdash;tá sé 4,300 níos mó ná an tiomlán don bhliain seo caite.  An méadú a deineadh sna rátaí caipitíochta is ionann é sa mheán agus méadú de tuairim is 20%.</P>
    <P>Tá airgead breise a sholáthar do bhreis-tuarastal chun freastal ar an bhfás ar líon na múinteoirí agus imeacht ar aghaidh na múinteoirí ar an scála incriminteach.  Sa scoil-bhliain <Col N="1569" /> reatha tá breis-tuarastal dá íoc le 3,734 múinteoirí cláraithe.  Clárófar 300 eile ó mhí Lúnasa seo chugainn. Tá na h-uimhreacha sin níos mó faoi dhó ná na huimhreacha a bhí ann cúig bliana déag ó shoin.  Tagann méadú cuí ar líon na múinteoirí do réir mar a thagann méadú ar líon na ndaltaí, ach is mó ná sin i mbliana an méadú ar líon na múinteoirí de bharr na socruithe speisialta atá déanta agam maidir leis an gcoibhneas idir múinteoirí agus daltaí.  Cuirfidh na socruithe nua seo ar chumas scoileanna teagase a thabhairt i réimse níos leithne ábhar.  Ón lú Lúnasa seo chugainn sé an cóta de mhúinteoirí i gcóir tuarastail a bhéas ann ná duine amháin in aghaidh gach cúigear déag daltaí in ionad an chóta atá ann faoi láthair, sé sin, duine amháin in aghaidh gach cúigear déag daltaí suas go dtí seasca daltaí agus duine amháin in aghaidh gach fiche dalta ina dhiaidh sin. Chomh maith leis sin, aithneofar, ó thaobh tuarastail a íoc, an tArdmháistir nó an tArdmhaistreás taobh amuigh den chóta.</P>
    <P>Oibriú Acht na nÚdarás Áitiúil (Scoláireachtaí Oideachais) (Leasú), 1961, agus an méad atá feidhm dá bhaint as sin ag Comhairleacha Contaethe agus Contae-Bhuirg is ea is cúis leis an méadú ar an líon scoláireachtaí. Scair an Stáit chuige sin&mdash; £77,500&mdash;tá sé níos mó faoi dhó beagnach ná mar bhí sé anuraidh.  Ba mhaith liom breith ar an bhfaill seo chun moladh a thabhairt do chomhaltaí na n-údarás áitiúil de bharr a ndearcadh i leith scoláireachtaí.</P>
    <P>Céim mhór ar aghaidh maidir le h-airgead a chur ar fáil don mhéanoideachas a b'ea an fógra i rith na bliana go raibh beartaithe ag an Rialtas go ndéanfadh an Stát deontais thógála do thabhairt go díreach chun meánscoileanna a thógáil agus a leathnú. Do réir na mionscéime a fógraíodh le déanaí tabharfar, faoi réir rialachán áirithe, deontais a chlúdóidh suas le 60 per cent de chostaisí aisíochta a bhaineas le hiasachtaí is riachtanach chun meánscoil a thógáil nó a leathnú. De bhrí nach gcríochnófar sa bhliain airgeadais reatha aon obair thógála go mbainfeadh an scéim leis ní gá aon <Col N="1570" /> soláthar airgeadais a dhéanamh i mbliana.</P>
    <P>I rith na bliana deineadh tosnú le cláracha teilifíse do scoileanna le dhá shraith a bhí bunaithe ar na cúrsaí i bhFisic don Mheánteistiméireacht agus don Ardteistiméireacht.  Is mór an t-uchtach é an t-éileamh atá ar na cúrsaí sin, mar ghlac ochtó faoin gcéad de na scoileanna go mbainfeadh na cláracha leo páirt iontu.  Beartaítear scóip na gcláracha a leathnú ó thaobh ábhair agus éagsúlachta dhe sna blianta atá le teacht.</P>
    <P>Dheineas tagairt anuraidh don tsraith chúrsaí samhraidh do mheánmhúinteoirí. Tá méadú mór dá dhéanamh ar líon na gcúrsaí sin i mbliana agus tá an soláthar dóibh imithe ó £1,500 go £6,150.</P>
    <P>Tá na cúrsaí tráthnóna Ollscoile do mhúinteoirí Matamaitice agus Eolaíochta gur bliain is faid dóibh dá reachtáil i mBaile Átha Cliath, i gCorcaigh agus i nGaillimh agus tá breis is 600 múinteoirí ag freastal orthu.  Leis an mhórshuim sa nuadhearcadh i leith múineadh na Matamaitice bhraitheas gur gá soláthar a dhéanamh do mhúinteoirí ná beadh i ndon freastal ar na cúrsaí tráthnóna sin.  Tá socruithe déanta agam, mar sin, go dtionólfar chúrsaí speisialta sa Mhatamaitic, gur faid dóibh ceithre seachtain an ceann, i mí Iúil seo chugainn ag roinnt ionad ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>Gné mhór eile de na cúrsaí i mbliana is ea go reachtáilfear dhá chúrsa conaithe ceithre seachtaine sa bhFraincís san ionad nua do theangacha atá dá chur ar bun i gColáiste na bProinsiasach, Rinn Mhic Ghormáin.  Ag na cúrsaí seo sé is mó a luífear air ná na modhanna is nua aimsearaí maidir le múineadh teangacha.  Tá Rialtas na Fraince trén a gcuid flaithiulachta ag cur beirt shaineolaí ar fáil a bhéas ag comhoibriú leis an Athair Colmán Ó hUallacháin ag stiúradh na gcúrsaí. Tá slí do 40 múinteoirí ag gach cúrsa díobh.  Is mór an t-uchtach an téileamh ar áiteanna ag na cúrsaí.  Is mó ar fad an téileamh ná an líon áit atá ar fáil.  Tá fúm a shocrú go reachtáilfear a lán eile cúrsaí den saghas seo sna blianta atá le teacht dtreo is <Col N="1571" /> go bhféadfadh gach múinteoir go mba thairbheach dó é freastal ar chúrsa. Níl aon dabht ach sa tslí seo go dtabharfar spreagadh breise do mhúineadh teangacha sna scoileanna agus go gcuirfear an múineadh sin ar bhonn i bhfad níos fearr.</P>
    <P>Sara n-imeóidh mé ón mheánoideachas ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do rud eile atá le tamall fada ag cur as dom.  Is é rud é ná chomh gairid is atá an scoilbhliain i gcuid mhaith de na meánscoileanna. Ní mór dúinn i saol na linne seo saol na mór-iomaíochta&mdash;bheith ullamh chun an dúthracht agus an dianiarracht céanna a chaitheamh len ár saothar as atá na tíortha eile atá in iomaíocht linn.  Is den riachtanas é, mar sin, nach lú ní hamháin ábhar ár scoil-chúrsaí ach chomh maith leis sin, faid na gcúrsaí sin ná ábhar agus faid na gcúrsaí i dtíortha eile.  Dá bhrí sin tá moltaí maidir le scoil-bhliain mhinimum de dhá chéad lá curtha faoi bhráid na scoil-chumann aithinte agam.  Is áthas liom a rá go bhfuil san iomlán na freagraí atá faighte agam go dtí seo fábharach do na moltaí sin.</P>

    <P>Nuair d'fhógair mé mo phlean i gcomhair iar-bhun-oideachais thrácht mé go speisialta ar na ceantair sin den tír nach bhféadfaí i leith an oideachais sin freastal orthu faoin gcóras atá ann faoi láthair.  Is ins na ceantair sin a bheartaigh mé scoileanna coimsithe do bhunú.  Sul a bhféadfaí dul ar aghaidh leis an mhion-phleanáil b'éigin aontú i bprionsabal d'fháil do na nithe bunúsacha a ghabhfadh leis na scoileanna san.  Tá áthas orm é do bheith le hinsint agam go bhfuil na nithe bunúsacha san socair anois.  Beidh coiste bainistíochta do gach scoil ar a mbeidh ionadaí a ainmneoidh an tEaspag agus a ghníomhóidh mar Chathaoirleach, an príomh-oifigeach feidhmiúcháin don choiste gairmoideachais agus ionadaí an Aire Oideachais.  Léiríonn an réamhshuirbhé atá déanta go mbeadh gá le scoileanna coimsitheacha i gceantair áirithe ins na Contaethe, Cabhán, Dún na nGall, Liathdrom, Muigheo, Gaillimh, <Col N="1572" /> An Clár agus Iarthar Corcaighe.

    <P Just="Center">GAIRM-OIDEACHAS&mdash;VÓTA 32.</P>
    <P>Is maith liom é bheith le tuairisciú agam go leanann i gconaí den bhforbairt agus den dul chun cinn sa ghairmoideachas.  Sa scoilbhliain 1962-63 bhí 29,689 daoine óga ar chúrsaí lánaimsire oideachais sna gairmscoileanna, cúig faoin chéad de mhéadú ar an líon a bhí ann an bhliain roimhe sin.  Ar chúrsaí teicniúla le haghaidh printíseach &mdash; scolaíocht pháirtaimsir-each í seo&mdash;bhí 4,542 i gcomparáid le 3,955 sa bhliain 1961-62.  Agus ar chúrsaí éagsúla lae, seacas iad siúd atá luaite agam, bhí 7,330, ocht faoin gcéad de mhéadú ar fhigiúr na bliana roimhe sin.  Ar ranganna agus cúrsaí oíche, bé líon daoine a bhí ann don bhliain 1962-63, beagnach seasca míle, a cheathair faoin chéad de mhéadú thar an líon don bhliain roimhe sin. Tá fás fós ar an líon scoláirí ar na cúrsaí agus ranganna éagsúla sa bhliain reatha seo, agus nuair a bheidh na figiúir ar fáil ag deireadh na scoilbhliana inseoidh siad a scéal féin.</P>
    <P>Comhartha eile ar an bhforbairt is ea líon na múinteoirí a fostaíodh sa scoilbhliain dheireannaigh, i gcomórtas le mar bhí sa bhliain roimhe sin.  An líon múinteoirí lánaimsire a bhí ar fostú sa bhliain 1962-63&mdash;1,826&mdash;ba mhó de 76 (nó a ceathair faoin chéad) é ná líon na bliana roimhe sin agus, i dtaca le múinteoirí páirtaimsire de, bhí 255 de mhéadú ar a líon thar mar a bhí bliain roimhe sin.  Míle, ocht gcéad, nócha agus seisear de mhúinteoirí páirtaimsire a bhí ann sa bhliain 1962-63.</P>
    <P>Níl sa mhéid sin ach cuid dena figiúir a léiríonn an fás.  Críochnaíodh aon cheann déag de nuafhoirgintí scoile sa bhliain dár chríoch 31 Lúnasa, 1963, agus cuireadh tuilleadh cóiríochta le scoileanna a raibh gá lena méadú mar gheall ar an éileamh atá ar an ghairmoideachas.  Idir scoileanna nua agus méadaithe le scoileanna a bhí cheana ann, soláthraíodh <Col N="1573" /> cúig cinn agus seachtó de rangsheomraí breise sa bhliain atá faoi thrácht agam.</P>
    <P>Ní i líon na scoláirí agus i méadú cóiríochta amháin, áfach, a léirítear an fhorbairt a rinneadh agus atá á dhéanamh, ach in éagsúlacht na seirbhísí oideachais a sholáthraítear.  Tá mo Roinnse ag obair i ndlúthpháirtíocht le Ranna Stáit eile agus le heagraíochta éagsúla chun an freastal is fearr a dhéanamh trí na gairm-scoileanna ar fhorbairt eacnamaíoch na tíre.  De bharr comhoibrithe leis an gCeard-Chomhairle, mar shampla, leathnaíodh go mór ar na saoráidí atá ann d'oideachas printíseachta.  Tionscnaíodh cúrsaí speisialta de phrintísigh chlódóireachta ar fud na tíre&mdash; ceann acu sa Choláiste Teicneolaíochta i Sráid Bholtúin, Baile Átha Cliath, agus ceann eile san Instiúid Oideachais Teicnicigh i gCorcaigh.  Rinneadh scrúdú agus breithniú ar riachtanais thionscal an troscáin, agus cinneadh ar dhá scoil speisialta a bhunú le haghaidh oiliúna sna ceardanna a bhaineann leis sin.  Tá an dá scoil sin&mdash; ceann ar an Uaimh agus ceann i gCathair Chorcaí&mdash;beagnach i gcóir chun na printísigh a ghlacadh iontu.</P>
    <P>Ag an gceann eile den saol tionscalach, bhí comhar ag mo Roinnse le hInstitiúd Bhainisteoireachta na hÉireann chun go mbainfí feidhm níos leitheadaí as an gcóras gairmoideachais maidir le cúrsaí ar léann agus ealáin na bainisteoireachta a chur ar fáil.  Dá thairbhe sin, leathnaíodh ar an obair a dhéantar i Scoil na Bainisteoireachta i Ráth Maonais, i Scoil na Tráchtála i gCorcaigh agus i Scoil na Tráchtála i Luimneach.  Bunaíodh cúrsaí ar bhainisteoireacht den chéad uair sa Cheardscoil Chathartha i nGaillimh.  D'éirigh go maith leo.  Tá comhchoiste curtha ar bun, a bhfuil ionadaithe ó mo Roinnse air, chun soláthar oiriúnach maidir le cúrsaí i mbainisteoireacht a dhéanamh, ar bhonn réigiúnach, tré na gairmscoileanna.</P>
    <P>Ba liosta len áireamh iad, agus ba mhór é an díol ama a theastódh le cur síos orthu, na slite inar leathnaíodh ar obair na ngairmscoileanna ar fud na tíre.  Ar éigin atá Teachta sa Tigh seo, <Col N="1574" /> measaim, nach bhfuil fianaise aige air sin ina dháilcheantar féin.</P>
    <P>Go dtí seo is ar an fhás nádúrtha ar an gcóras mar atá sé le blianta maithe anuas a bhí mé ag caint.  Ábhar sásaimh, gan aon amhras, an fás sin, ach is léir liom go bhfuil an t-am tagtha ina gcaithfear bunathraithe móra chun leasa a dhéanamh ar chóras na ngairmscol meáneistiméireacht haghaidh iarbhunscolaíochta a d'fhoilsigh mé i mí na Bealtaine seo caite, leag mé béim ar dhá rud go speisialta i leith an ghairmoideachais: an gá a bhí ann leis an gcúrsa lae a shíneadh i dtreo is go mbéadh ar chumas daltaí na ngairmscol meánteistiméireacht agus ardteistiméireacht a bhaint amach ar an gcaighdeán chéanna atá i bhfeidhm do lucht a chomhaoise sna meánscoileanna; agus an gá atá le soláthar níos leitheadaí a dhéanamh d'oideachas teicneolaíochta.  Maidir leis an gcéad rud acu siúd, is maith liom gur féidir liom a rá go bhfuil an chéad dréacht den chlár le haghaidh na hArd-Teistiméireacht Teicnicí curtha faoi bhráid An Chumainn Ghairmoideachais in Éirinn agus Chumann na nGairm-Mhúinteoirí, le haghaidh a dtuairimí.  I dtaca leis an Meán-Teistiméireacht de, tá coiste d'oideachasóirí ag obair go dícheallach chun clár oiriúnach a dhéanamh amach do scrúdú Meán-Teistiméireachta a d'oirfeadh do idir aos léinn gairmscoileanna agus aos léinn meánscoileanna. Tá na siollabais le haghaidh cuid mhaith de na hábhair léinn réidh lena gcur i láthair na n-eagraíocht cuí oideachais.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh an oideachais teicneolaíochta dhe, mhínigh mé gurbhé ba rún dom roint áirithe de choláistí réigiúnacha a bheith ann ar fud na tíre.  Is iad na háiteacha atá im intinn agam do na Coláistí sin: Baile Átha Cliath, mar a bhfuil dhá cheann cheana; Corcaigh, Ceatharlach, Luimneach, Gaillimh, Portláirge, Sligeach, Dún Dealgan agus Áth Luain.  Táthar ag dul ar aghaidh leis na réamhshocraithe. Mar gheall ar go raibh toscaí ann a d'fhág an-oiriúnach é go raghfaí ar aghaidh le coláiste réigiúnach i gCeatharlach níos tapúla ná in aon áit eile, tá moltaí curtha ag mo <Col N="1575" /> Roinnse go dtí Coiste Gairmoideachais Chontae Cheatharlach i dtaobh na cóiríochta is ceart a sholáthar san choláiste réigiúnach atá á phleanáil agus cuireadh tugtha don Choiste teacht i gcomhairle le hoifigigh de chuid mo Roinne maidir leis an bpleanáil.  Ní ceart a mheas as sin, áfach, nach n-aithnítear go bhfuil práinn le coláistí mar seo a bhunú sna hionaid eile atá luaite agam.  An t-eolas a bhaileofar le linn pleanála an chéad choláiste, beidh sé tairbheach maidir le pleanáil coláistí in ionaid eile.</P>
    <P>Sara gcríochnaím mo chaint ar ghairmoideachais, is ceart dom tagairt a dhéanamh do cheist an tsoláthair múinteoirí.  Ábhar imní é ag daoine áirithe nach mbeidh le fáil don obair sna scoileanna, do réir mar bheidh sí ag leathnú, riar cheart de mhúinteoirí cáilithe.  Is ceist í sin a bhfuil staidéar agus machnamh géar déanta agam uirthí agus, cé go n-aithním gur gá bheith ag faire go síor sa scéal, ní dóigh liom gur gá dúinn aon imní ná eagla mhór bheith orainn.  Ceann de na rudaí ba chúis le gan oiread céimithe ollscoile a bheith ag dul le gairm-mhúinteoireacht agus ba mhaith liom do b'ea iad a bheith gan eolas ar an taobh seo den tseirbhís mhúinteoireachta seo.  D'fhonn an scéal sin a leigheas, chuaidh cigirí de chuid mo Roinnse go dtí na coláistí ollscoile i dtús na bliana seo, gur labhair siad le fochéimithe i dtaobh na gairm-mhúinteoireachta, agus thug eolas dóibh a spreag a suim ann.  De bharr na gcuairteanna seo, agus i láthair an mhéadaithe atá déanta anois ar thuarastal na ngairm-mhúinteoirí, tá gach uile dhócas ann go dtiocfaidh tuilleadh céimithe isteach sa tseirbhís.  Maidir leis na haicmí múinteoirí nach céimithe iad &mdash; múinteoirí ábhar praiticiúil &mdash; beidh gá le modhanna eile, seachas na modhanna atá ann faoi láthair, chun iad a fháil.  Bhí comhráite agam cheana féin le hionadaithe na gcoistí gairmoideachais agus le hionadaithe na múinteoirí faoin scéal seo ar fad, agus beidh mé ag plé leo arís go luath slite áirithe atá ar intinn agam le deimhniú go mbeidh leorsholáthar de mhúinteoirí oiriúnacha ann don bhrainse seo den tseirbhís seo.</P>

      <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is less than ten weeks since we had a discussion on the Estimate for 1963-64 and we then fully covered all the curriculum of the Minister's Department. I want to criticise this Estimate for its omissions rather than for its inclusions.  For the first time in the history of this State, no reference whatever has been made in the Minister's Estimate to the Irish language.  When we discussed the 1963-64 Estimate, we postponed any discussion on methods of revising the Irish language, pending the publication of the Report of the Commission that had just been announced during the <Col N="1578" /> period of the discussion on the Estimate and I looked forward to hearing from the Minister to-day whether he proposed accepting all or any of the findings of the Commission but there is no mention whatever of the Minister's policy in regard to the findings and no mention of the findings.</P>
    <P>One thing which strikes me in dealing with the Irish language is that the university scholarships which are confined to students from Irish-speaking homes have been reduced from £67,050 last year to £45,600 this year. We are reducing the scholarships made available to pupils of Irish-speaking homes by the significant sum of approximately £22,000.  The subsidies to publications in Irish have also been reduced by £5,000.  Do we intend to throw our hat at the revival of the language by reducing the provision for scholarships for the children of Irish speakers?  I shall deal with that later. I merely mention it now as one of the omissions from the Minister's speech on the Estimate.</P>
    <P>In the Press over the past three weeks, one of the matters of controversy is the dispute between the secondary teachers and the Department of Education.  No reference whatsoever is made to it in the Minister's speech.  I looked forward to hearing the Minister to-day possibly giving us the outline of the cause of the dispute, telling us what steps he had taken for the holding of the Intermediate and Leaving Certificate examinations, what steps he had taken to meet the representatives of the secondary teachers in an endeavour to settle this dispute.</P>
    <P>The third omission is the comprehensive schools.  Last year the Minister announced the setting up of these comprehensive schools and told us he was practically in a position to site the schools.  Now we find the only advance made in the setting up of these comprehensive schools is that he has now decided on the management system for them.  The schools will be managed, he said, by a representative of his Department, a representative of the vocational education authority and by a nominee of the Bishop.  Incidentally, he did not tell us what Bishop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to think what will happen in my county. I see Donegal is one of the counties earmarked for the provision of a comprehensive school.  Will the religious minority have no representative on this committee?  It is something which might cause a lot of controversy later. I do not wish to throw anything into the arena at the moment but it is something the Minister should certainly consider.</P>
      <P>Other than that he has given us no information.  He goes on to say he proposes to site these schools in the very near future.  He does not tell us whether he proposes to build a pilot school or whether he proposes to build them all at the one time and have them all staffed at the one time.  I hope it will not take as long as it takes to build a national school.  I have made inquiries from school managers and I have been told that from the time the decision is taken that a national school is necessary in a locality it takes 10 years to build a school, to have it opened and staffed.  If the Minister wants me to cite him an example I shall be very pleased to do it.</P>
      <P>Those are the omissions from the Minister's speech on the Estimate, most important ones: the Irish language, the dispute with the secondary teachers and the programme for the setting up of these comprehensive schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing that has struck me about the Estimate and what it contains is that we shall have another estimate in the very near future to make provision for the ninth round. In dealing with each and every one of the various categories of education, <Col N="1580" /> primary, secondary, vocational and university, the Minister opens his reference to each branch with the following sentence: &ldquo;The application of the ninth round increase to salaries of teachers will cost ... per annum and it will be necessary to provide for this by way of Supplementary Estimate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us two Estimates this year already and we shall have more Estimates for this Department. It is a tragedy that we cannot have one Estimate for the entire year. Even if the Minister had to postpone the debate on this Estimate, it would be much better to do that and deal with the matter <i>in toto.</i>  To bring in these piecemeal Estimates is very unsatisfactory indeed.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provision of national schools, to which I shall refer in more detail later, the Minister refers to it at page 3 in his speech and appears to throw his hat at any hope whatsoever of retaining the population in rural Ireland.  He says:</P>
    <P>The total number of new pupil places to be provided in these building projects is 20,854. </P>
    <P>Then he goes on:</P>
    <P>In sparsely populated districts where the need for schools after a period of 15 to 20 years is uncertain, use is being made of a prefabricated timber structure to provide comfortable school accommodation for the pupils. </P>
    <P>In other words, for the next 15 to 20 years prefabricated schools will be built throughout Ireland because we can see no future for building permanent schools, because there is bound to be depopulation.  It looks as if the Government have no policy whatsoever for retaining the population in rural Ireland.  If we cannot retain the children there is not much hope of retaining the adults.  It should give us all cause for alarm and cause for thought that rural districts will be depopulated during the next 15 to 20 years.  Again, I am merely dealing with what the Minister said in his Estimate speech.  He talks about building new <Col N="1581" /> prefabricated schools.  Does the Minister wish to say something?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to a statement that the Estimate shows a decrease in regard to scholarships to the university.  In fact, there is an increase.  I should not like it to go from this House that the provision was reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>My reading of it has been quite clear.  It gives the Estimate for 1963/64 and 1964/65.  If the Minister looks at page 135 of the Book of Estimates for 1964/65, he will see that it is £1,500 and for 1963/64, it was £2,000.</P>

      <P>The Minister refers to the erection of new classrooms, prefabricated buildings attached to existing schools. I take it these are new schools, which the Minister has referred to, in recently built-up areas.  The Minister referred to them at page 3 of his statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to them.  I think they are a good thing. I thought possibly they were being erected at the expense of the erection of new schools where these were necessary, but I understand now.</P>
      <P>In regard to national schools, I am glad to hear the Minister say that he is stepping up the grant for the cleaning and heating of national schools by £100,000.  That is something that is badly wanted.  I cannot speak for the city, but I certainly can speak for rural Ireland, and I am afraid that very often the grant does not reach the teacher.  I know for a fact that in most schools in rural Ireland the cleaning is done by the pupils themselves.  No official is appointed to clean the schools and in most cases fires are set and attended to by the pupils.  I think it would be a good thing&mdash;I do not say this in any derogatory sense&mdash;if we could have a &ldquo;char&rdquo; of some description attached to national schools. I do not wish to use the word &ldquo;char&rdquo; in any derogatory sense whatsoever.  If some neighbour could be employed for the purpose of cleaning schools and for the purpose of arranging the heating of the schools, it would be a good thing.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to grants for the erection of secondary schools, though he provides no money this year and gives a good reason.  He gives no indication of the extent and amount of grants towards loan charges which he is prepared to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>60 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not refer to the particular type of school to which he will give it.  I understand a rumour was circulated that such a grant would not be given to schools where there were fewer than 150 pupils.  I should be glad if the Minister would confirm that that rumour is not true.  In many parts of the country there are secondary schools which could not possibly cater for 150 pupils and I should like to see such small schools getting a similar grant of 60 per cent towards loan <Col N="1583" /> charges.  Some existing small schools would like to enlarge but they know they could not possibly acquire a school roll of 150&mdash;I refer to secondary schools.  There are schools of the religious denomination of the minority of the country and it would be a waste of money for them to erect schools catering for 150 because they would not have 150 pupils.  I hope the Minister will be realistic in that matter and that schools, say, with 60 to 70 students will qualify for such a grant.  I hope the rumour of a figure of 150 is untrue.</P>
      <P>The Minister tells us what he has done for television programmes and what he is doing for television grants. The extent to which he uses television for the purposes of education relates to secondary schools.  I should like to compliment the Minister on this and I should also like to compliment the schools for the manner in which they are co-operating in the provision of television sets.  The Minister, his Department, and the Broadcasting Authority are to be complimented for the manner in which they are operating these programmes.  I think this development could be greatly extended.</P>
      <P>I note also from his speech that the Minister proposes to extend the secondary school year to approximately 200 school days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that later.  I notice the Minister does not mention it.  Deputy Coughlan will not draw me on that at this stage.  I hope the managers' association, or the principals of the secondary schools, will be consulted.  Personally, I think it is a very good thing.  The Minister has said he has consulted the men and that their reaction has been favourable.  Not so much now as in my time, the summer vacation was far too long.  Now, when the staffs can find more remunerative employment during the summer, possibly they do not feel it is too long. However, I believe it would prevent cramming to a considerable extent if the school year were extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1584" /> The Minister refers to the technological schools which he hopes to set up. In this age, of course, such schools are very useful and will be of considerable importance, but I wonder whether the siting of these schools is just right. The Minister gives the various towns in which such schools will be sited&mdash; Cork, Carlow, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Sligo, Dundalk and Athlone &mdash;but there is no mention whatsoever of Donegal.</P>
    <P>The greater part of our county has now no rail communication and no direct bus communication with Sligo and it is a pity, therefore, some town in Donegal was not selected, in preference to Sligo, to cater for Donegal. On that point, may I mention that if facilities were made available in the existing school in Derry, it might be of considerable advantage to young people in Donegal?  Perhaps the Minister might take the matter up with his opposite number in the Six Counties to see if something could be done.</P>
    <P>Another omission from the Minister's speech is the question of a new university college.  The Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>More than the Minister find it slipping from under them, sometimes.  I wonder what is to become of this brainchild of the Parliamentary Secretary?  No mention is <Col N="1585" /> made whatsoever in the Minister's speech of any extensions or of any new colleges.  Neither is provision made for it.  The Minister does not even suggest he is considering it.  He does tell us he is providing money for extensions to Trinity College, to UCD, that there is a grant-in-aid in respect of the Royal College of Surgeons and Maynooth, but there is no mention whatsoever of the provision of a constituent college at Limerick.</P>
      <P>I reminded the Minister last year that Donegal County Council were anxious to gain access to Magee College in Derry and that an effort was being made by Magee College to secure university status.  Resolutions were passed by the Donegal County Council supporting that effort, I recommended to the Minister last year that in co-operation with his opposite number in the Six Counties, he should try to persuade the education authorities in the North to extend university status to Magee College and, by so doing, assist students in Donegal who are precluded from such facilities at the moment.</P>
      <P>The Minister refers to reformatory schools in his speech but we are making no provision whatsoever for any reform of the old reformatories, if I may use the pun.  I wonder are we tackling youth delinquency in the proper way? First of all, we try to cloak it by holding courts <i>in camera,</i> by refusing admission to the Press.  Then we continue to use the old form of reformatory school.  Quite recently a judge in one of the western States in the US found that by trying juvenile delinquents in open court, there was a considerable improvement in his court area.  There may be something to be said for it.  Parental control might be greater if they knew that their names and the names of the children might be published in the public Press.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly, but we are dealing with reformatory schools for which the Minister for Education <Col N="1586" /> is absolutely responsible.  That is my principal reason for mentioning it.  I merely mention it by the way.  Afterwards there comes the question of the <i>modus operandi</i> in the school itself.  A change there might well repay our efforts.</P>
      <P>We in Fine Gael have on many occasions announced our policy towards education.  First of all, we have told the people we are anxious to see the Irish language revived.  One of the things we are most anxious to see is the language of the native Irish speakers revived; we are anxious to see it revived as a spoken language, but I certainly would not in any way contribute to or support the survival of a language that is not the language spoken by the people of the Gaeltacht areas.  The Minister set up a Commission to inquire into the revival of the Irish language.  They have published their report and the Minister's Department cannot be blamed for it. However, that Department have set up more Commissions in their history than any other Department of State. Some 25 years ago, the Commission on Vocational Education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Taoiseach who set it up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it was the Taoiseach set it up but he has no responsibility for any legislation based on the findings of that Commission. That is the reason I mention it now. Last year he told us what great hopes he had for this new method of teaching the language, which at that time was being studied by, I think, a professor in Gormanston.  He does not even tell us what progress has been <Col N="1587" /> made since then.  We know nothing whatever about his future policy towards the language.  We do not know whether he will continue the method of teaching infants subjects other than Irish through the medium of Irish in a non-Irish speaking locality.  He has not told us whether he will concentrate more on the revival of Irish through oral classes, through revival of the spoken language as such or whether he will continue the method in operation for the past 30 years of concentrating on the teaching of reading and writing the language through a medium which the native Irish speaker does not understand.</P>
      <P>With regard to the curriculum in the national schools, I am sorry, indeed, to hear to-day that the Minister does not propose to add to it in any way. Last year, I advocated here the teaching of civics in the national school.  It would be a great help if we had a course in civics in all our primary schools.  Most of the vandalism done by students of the national school is done through sheer ignorance, through sheer lack of knowledge of civics, and it is something which the Minister should consider.  It would be of considerable help if one hour per week were devoted to the teaching of civics.  We could vary the programme by having, say, an hour per week devoted to the subject of road traffic.  It is part of civics and it would be of considerable help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most accidents to pedestrians and cyclists are caused through a lack of knowledge of road traffic regulations. The Minister should take up the matter with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, and arrange for the giving of road traffic lessons in the national schools possibly with the aid of the Garda.  The Minister may tell me that he has arranged to do that in certain localities.  Bear in mind, however, that it is not in the built-up areas, that it is not within the areas of the speed limit, that most accidents occur.  They occur on the open roads in rural Ireland where, unfortunately, classes such as these are not given.  Physical drill is no <Col N="1588" /> longer taught in our national schools. There is no greater example of it than the Minister himself.  He is a man who believes in an outdoor life and in physical fitness.  He should pass on his enthusiasm for physical fitness to the teachers and the pupils.  In my day in the national school, half an hour was devoted practically every day to what was known as drill.  The same thing applied in the secondary school where we had drill at least once a week.  It is unfortunate that these exercises have been dropped.  I am certain that there would be no difficulty in procuring teachers, again, with the co-operation of the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Drill and discipline are two of the finest things that could be taught and there is no better way of teaching discipline than through drill.  With the co-operation of his colleague, the Minister for Justice, the Minister should concentrate more on physical fitness in the national schools.  I feel certain that, with the co-operation of the Garda or of members of the FCA who would be only too anxious to help by way of lectures and classes on physical fitness, beneficial results would follow.  Television could also be used for that purpose. In Britain, television has been used for the giving of physical fitness lessons.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has considered the setting-up of multi-teacher parochial schools as distinct from the small rural national schools located throughout a parish.  He admitted in his speech today that it is impossible to cater for the sparsely populated areas.  When you build a two-roomed school you find, after a few years, that only one room is occupied.  On the other hand, possibly when you build a one- or two-roomed school you may discover that, as a result of an increase in the population in the locality, it may be necessary to add to it but, more often than not, it is necessary to close down these schools.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister would consider the question of centrally sited parochial schools.  Not only would they give all national school pupils the same facilities for study but they would give the teachers a better opportunity <Col N="1589" /> of employing their talents.  It is most difficult for a teacher in a one- or two-teacher school to teach eight classes, usually, I think from first to eighth, and two infant classes.  It is very difficult for such pupils to reach the same standard as pupils where a teacher concentrates on merely one or two classes.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for pupils in one- or two-teacher schools to compete in open competition with pupils from a multi-teacher school.  The Minister should seriously consider now, when this building programme is being revised, whether it would be worth while building parochial schools in agreed centres and concentrating on them.</P>
    <P>I do not know very much about the present-day and modern curriculum in secondary schools.  The Minister did not refer to it in his opening speech. I hope there will be more concentration on the teaching of modern European languages.  If we enter the Common Market, as the Government anticipate, it is essential that we concentrate on European languages.  Even though we may have to sacrifice the teaching of some of the dead languages such as Greek and, possibly, Latin, it would be a very good thing if at least one modern language were made an essential subject in the curriculum of all secondary schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister has informed us of the counties in which he proposes to site the comprehensive schools.  I personally made representations to him some time ago about the siting of one of them in Donegal and I am very glad to see from his speech that one of them will be sited in that county. I also appealed to him to site a comprehensive school in the town of Ardara, which is on the fringe, if not in the centre, of the Gaeltacht.  It is about the only town in Donegal in which there is not an opportunity of secondary education for post-primary students.  So far as I know, there is no vocational school.  The town is fairly centrally located and I appeal to the Minister to consider it favourably as a site for a comprehensive school.  I would also ask the Minister to announce as soon as possible the <Col N="1590" /> actual location of these schools to which he has referred today and I appeal to him to consider the appointment of a representative of the minority on the management committees of such schools.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more done with and for graduates before they take up the practice of their professions.  I know the Medical Schools now insist on a graduate doing at least one year's hospital course prior to being permitted to practise as a doctor.  That is a very good thing and the example should be followed by various other faculties.  I should like to see the engineering faculty insist on at least one year's practical work in the field, so to speak, before permitting an engineer to graduate as they have been accustomed to do in the past.  The same would apply to dental surgeons and other professions.  I think it does apply in the case of secondary teachers who, I think, must do a year of practical teaching before being recognised. This could be done in the other professions, not leaving out my own profession.  It would be a very good thing when a solicitor qualifies, passing his final examination, that authority should insist on his doing one year's practical work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am in full agreement with the Minister on that and I think many others could follow the example of the Minister's profession in that way.  Some post-graduate work should be insisted on before young graduates are launched on the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because there is so little in the <Col N="1591" /> Minister's Estimate speech, there is little left to which I can refer, other that the most important matter, the fact that the Minister made no reference to the dispute between his Department and the secondary teachers.  I hold no brief for the secondary teachers.  I understand they claim they are entitled to an increase in salary and, if they are, they should get it.  I understand the Minister's answer is that their salary is related to the salary of somebody else and that the differential must remain.  I know nothing whatever about that. All I know is that a young secondary teacher after five years in a secondary school and four in the university is offered £950 as a secondary teacher in his first year.  There are many trades in which a man could earn that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And more.  The Minister should endeavour to settle this dispute before it is too late.  If he does not he is creating a very bad precedent.  What must be the opinion of young pupils of their teachers when they see these teachers rebelling against their employer?  The psychological effect must be bad.  Instead of refusing to negotiate, the Minister should meet them and hear their case. If an arbitrator is being appointed, the full facts should be placed before him.  I understand that the previous arbitrator who acted in this matter had a wrong hypothesis; that he was informed he should act within certain limits and that he could not go outside them.  I do not know if that is true.  The Minister should try to meet the teachers soon, even if it is only for the psychological impact it would have on the pupils, if only to give good example to them.  He should meet the teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to use a certain expression but somebody must be procured to superintend the examinations and examine the papers and results of the examination, somebody whose job it has not been in the past.  In other professions and trades, this might be called &ldquo;scabbing&rdquo;.  I do not wish to <Col N="1592" /> refer to any person who may be found to take these jobs as a scab because I believe the Intermediate examination must be held and the results published at the usual time.  Somebody must be found to do these jobs.  It has a very bad psychological effect on the pupils to find a dispute such as this may be ignored by the employer and that substitutes can be procured to replace those who allege they have a legitimate grievance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware of the grave dissatisfaction among the lower grades of the Civil Service, such as the clerk-typist grade, concerning their inadequate rates of pay; whether it is correct that clerk-typists are directed to perform duties of a character formerly performed by higher grades in receipt of much <Col N="1595" /> higher pay; whether the performance by them of such higher duties carries a reward by way of increased pay, and, if so, of what amount; whether he is aware that many of those recruited to the grade come from provincial areas and, owing to the inadequacy of the pay offered in relation to living costs, often have to be subsidised by their parents so as to avoid dangers to health; and whether in all the circumstances he proposes to increase scales of pay substantially to take account both of the character of the duties and present living costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Matters affecting the grades to which the Deputy refers are appropriate to be dealt with under the conciliation and arbitration machinery for the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>Following an agreed recommendation made last September by the General Council under that machinery, an adjustment of clerk-typists' pay was effected as from 1st November, 1961.  In consequence of the pay settlement recently recommended by the Council, a further increase of 12 per cent was granted as from 1st February, 1964.  There is no claim concerning the grade before the Council at present and I am not aware of the allegations mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The grade of clerk-typist came into existence on 1st July, 1960, following an agreed recommendation of the General Council which set out not merely the pay but the range of duties attaching to the grade.  Details are set out in the relevant Department of Finance circular, a copy of which I have had placed in the Library.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that part of the reply in which the Minister said he was not aware of the allegations mentioned by the Deputy, is the Minister not aware of the fact that all of those lower paid civil servants must have a secondary education and must pass a proficiency test in Irish and are offered a sum of £5 10s per week as a starting salary?  Will the Minister tell me frankly: does he consider that a salary of £5 10s per week at this stage is a living wage to a young girl who comes up from the provinces to live in Dublin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that these grades have been fixed in agreement with the Official Side and the Staff Side, not merely as to the scale of salaries but also as to the duties allocated to them and it is always open to the Staff Side to ask for further conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to answer the question I put to him.  He said he was not aware of the allegations mentioned by the Deputy.  Is the Minister aware that many of the young girls who are clerk-typists in the Civil Service are subsidised by their parents, who have to pay at least £1 per week to them to enable them to feed themselves in this city, and does the Minister think that in these circumstances this is merely a question of arbitration?  Does he not realise that the question of the livelihood of these girls is involved and will he, as the responsible Minister, set the good example and see that a living wage is paid to these girls?  Will the Minister answer that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, of course, takes one particular figure, which is a very unusual figure, that is, that if a girl comes in under 18 years of age, she is paid £5 10s 4d.  When she reaches her eighteenth birthday, that goes to £5 17s 6d.  There are very few girls who come in under 18 years of age.  It would not matter very much to the Exchequer if that figure of under 18 years pay were done away with. I do not like to take the initiative in these matters if the Staff Side do not come along and ask for some discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>If an approach is made to the Minister by the Staff Side who act on behalf of these girls, may I take it that the Minister will be most sympathetic to their request in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that not many of these girls come in under 18 years of age.  The figure <Col N="1597" /> involved over 18 is £5 17s. 6d.&mdash;is that right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister does not consider that a rise from £5 10s. to £5 17s. 6d. will mean the difference between frugal comfort and a decent standard of living?  Is he serious in suggesting that that is sufficient increase, that because a girl is over 18 years of age she gets 7/6d. a week more?  It is absolutely disgraceful.</P>

      <P>The scheme is being made known to the Fishguard and Rosslare Harbour Shipping Company. However, a scheme for the improvement of Rosslare has to be worked out in conjunction with any improvement in the servicing of the vessels, the character of the vessels, the number of cars they are likely to take, the method of providing drive-on and drive-off facilities.  It has to be tailored to what the company propose to do in the way of improvement of the service. Therefore, a particular plan made by an engineer might not conform with those conceptions.</P>

The Committee estimated that, if the necessary adaptation measures are taken by the firms concerned, there may be redundancy in five of these industries of the order of 5,000 persons in free trade conditions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he can give comparable estimates of the different methods of construction of the dual carriageway to Naas, County Kildare, including cost per mile, man hours and employment per mile, percentage of native materials used, non-skid qualities, maintenance, probable duration, and any other similar data available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) (for the Minister for Local Government) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) (for the Minister for Local Government)</NameTxt>
      <P>The different methods of construction <Col N="1603" /> in use on the dual carriageway between Dublin and Naas are rolled asphalt on pitching and gravel in Kildare, and, in Dublin, reinforced concrete.  It is not possible to give precise comparable cost figures of the two types of construction by reference to the work which has been undertaken to date on this road and any comparison must be subject to a number of qualifications arising from various factors such as the period of execution, the standard of the old road, differences in terrain, special problems such as drainage, and the different methods of execution.  Subject to the foregoing reservations, the present indications are that the cost of construction per mile on this road in both Dublin and Kildare will be of the order of £135,000 including acquisition costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A more reliable guide, perhaps, to the comparative costs of flexible and rigid (concrete) construction is, however, available in alternative tenders received by Dublin County Council in 1962 for the Brownsbarn to Millbridge section of this road, which is about 1.3 miles long.  The lowest quotation per mile for construction in asphalt surfacing on a lean-mix base was £92,730 compared with £97,173 per mile for reinforced concrete.  These figures were exclusive of special drainage works, of land acquisition, fencing and compensatory works.  Dublin County Council opted for the concrete construction, although it was slightly dearer, chiefly because it is generally accepted as being a more durable type of road.  A concrete road of the standard of that being constructed in County Dublin at present may be expected to last for 30 to 40 years with only minor maintenance, as compared with some 20 years for the flexible type of construction.  Average costs for normal maintenance in both cases are estimated as being in the range of £100-£200 per mile per annum.  Precise information is not available of the comparative employment content per mile of the two methods.  The average number of men employed on the Kildare section over the past ten years is about 45.  The length of road concerned is 5¾ miles.  Average employment on the County Dublin section <Col N="1604" /> since work began some two years ago is 30 men.  This includes employment on construction by contract on 3.3 miles and on direct labour works of drainage, etc. on 6.8 miles approximately.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give the actual percentage of native materials used, but it may be accepted that with the exception of steel reinforcement and bitumen, which are estimated at £5,000 per mile for the rigid construction and £3,000 per mile for the flexible construction, all materials used are native materials.  Both types of road have high non-skid values under normal circumstances, while the concrete has better light reflective qualities.</P>
    <P>The question as to which type of construction is the more advantageous is one which must be decided in the light of the particular circumstances in each case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Minister has said about the non-skid property of concrete, could he say whether any other surface is to be superimposed?  It is common knowledge that a concrete road is very liable to cause skidding in any icing conditions at all.</P>

I refer to the subject of etiquette, table included.  It would be a very good thing, I think, if some standard textbook <Col N="1608" /> on etiquette were supplied and periodic lessons given to all grades in this particular subject.  I know that some secondary schools do this already. I also know there is no difficulty in picking out the students from these particular schools.  Now that is unfair to other schools, very unfair; there seems to be no reason why the pupils in these should not have the same opportunity as the students in colleges and schools where training in etiquette forms part of the curriculum. A simple textbook circulated to the teachers would be very welcome. Indeed, if the Minister made it available to adults also in libraries it might be no harm at all.</P>
      <P>The Minister should also consider the unification of the various teaching groups.  It may not be possible to include university personnel but there should be no difficulty certainly as between primary, secondary and vocational. Such unification would be a very good thing.  He should also consider making a university degree essential for all national teachers.  That would broaden their education.  It would also help towards unification of the various teaching groups.  I am certain it would be welcomed by the national teachers but I am equally sure they will not want to leave their own grade if the Minister continues to treat the secondary teachers as he is treating them at the moment.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister now to meet the secondary teachers and try to settle this difference with them.  If he does, he will be doing a good day's work, first of all, in setting an example to pupils as to how disputes should be settled and, secondly, satisfying the teaching profession generally.  If a teacher is not satisfied, he is certainly not in a position to impart satisfactorily the knowledge and the teaching he would otherwise give his pupils.  I appeal to the Minister to consider paying these teachers a reasonable salary and not, after nine years in secondary school and university, offering a salary of £950 in the first year as teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the preparatory colleges. I think the abolition of these by the Minister is the one black spot on his record for which he will be remembered. <Col N="1609" /> These colleges were located in the Gaeltacht areas.  They are now lying there, to use a Fianna Fáil expression, like so many white elephants. The finest and best of the lot&mdash;Coláiste Bríde at Falcarragh &mdash; is a white elephant costing the taxpayers £1,000 a year.  No effort is being made to use it.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health have been doing trojan work on the establishment of rehabilitation centres.  I do not know how the Department of Education and the Department of Health co-operate at the moment, but I think there should be some liaison between them on this question of rehabilitation. The unfortunates who require rehabilitation very often require re-education as well to fit them to adapt themselves to circumstances different from those in which they were brought up.  The Minister should take this matter up with the Minister for Health.  It is something which is now engaging the mind and the pocket of the public.  It is something which is canvassing active support.  The Minister should play his part by co-operating with his colleague, the Minister for Health, and, if possible, using some of these preparatory colleges which are now lying idle.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude, as I began, by saying that I am disappointed that in the Minister's statement there was no mention of the Irish language; secondly, that we heard nothing whatever about this unfortunate dispute between the Minister and the secondary teachers; thirdly, that none, or very little progress, has been made in the establishment of the comprehensive schools.</P>

      <P>This House and the nation were looking to the Minister for Education to give us an outline, on this occasion, of his revolutionary plans to modernise our educational system.  We anticipated that because, at a Press conference held 12 months ago, on 21st May, 1963, the Minister outlined the changes he proposed to make in the Irish educational system.  The <i>Irish Times</i> carried a banner headline: &ldquo; A Revolution in Education Plans&rdquo;. &ldquo;Minister speaks of comprehensive schools and new colleges&rdquo;.  The article stated:</P>
      <P>A revolutionary change is about to be made in the educational system in the Republic.  Comprehensive schools are to be set up and a new principle is being introduced &mdash;the direct provision of post-primary school buildings by the State.</P>
      <P>The new schools will cater for children&mdash;one third of the total in the State&mdash;who receive no post-primary education, and they are planned to overcome some of the disadvantages in the present separation of secondary and vocational education. </P>
      <P>Plans were also announced for the setting up of a number of technological colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those announcements by the Minister gave new hope and enthusiasm to those who were looking for radical changes in our educational system, especially to parents and children who were hoping to see a breakdown in the class barriers with which our educational system still reeks.  In the Minister's speech today, there was nothing to indicate that this revolutionary plan, or any part or facet of it, would be implemented, because no money has been provided for that purpose.  In the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> there is a stipulation that education should get priority in the new Ireland.  There is revenue of £14 million from the turnover tax, and there is an extra £7 million from taxation <Col N="1611" /> on beer, spirits and petrol.  Out of that kind of bonanza in the lap of the Minister for Finance, it was expected that the Minister for Education would take unto himself the money required to implement the desirable changes he mentioned in his speech to the nation on 21st May, 1963.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech is a great source of disappointment to all of us who are concerned about the education of the children of the country. Apart from token increases for heating and lighting in schools, small increases in contributions to industrial schools, and the usual increases to cope with salary increases for teachers, there is nothing whatsoever to enable the implementation of this so-called revolutionary plan.  We must ask how long must we wait for the new schools of technology?  How long must we wait for the breakdown of the class barriers with which our educational system is riddled?  How long must we wait until the children are given free post-primary education? Clearly the foundation has not been laid for those ideals in the Minister's speech.  If the Minister cannot avail of this opportunity to launch out on this scheme, and indicate that it will be realised within a reasonable period of time, we cannot hope for much in the future.  This is the opportune time.  Positive promises and proposals were made in a pretty ruthless manner, without the provision of the necessary revenue to carry out any plans.  In my opinion, that is disgraceful, and it is a betrayal of the trust reposed in us by our people that nothing is coming from the proposals of the Minister to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The views of the Labour Party on education should be well known.  We maintain that the criterion in our educational system should be the ability of the children to learn, assimilate and go on to higher education, not the ability of the parents to pay.  Our educational system is part of the class-ridden society we still possess.  The opportunities are there for the rich, but there are none for the poor.  We had hoped that, pending the day when we will have free education for all, <Col N="1612" /> not merely primary but secondary, vocational and university, the Minister would have had the decency to increase the number of scholarships out of all proportion, in order that children could go on to secondary and university education.</P>
    <P>We desire, moreover, not merely to see an improvement on the physical side of education, such as the building of much-needed new schools, and the repair of many dilapidated hovels in which our children and teachers are forced to work, but also an improvement in the quality of our education. Our present system relies too much on passing on to children a mass of undigested and ill-understood information, rather than giving them proper guidance and training.  We are turning out machines, as it were, to deliver certain specified types of knowledge. Education of that kind is no more education in the real sense of the word, than a dictionary can be regarded as a work of literature.</P>
    <P>Education should ensure that we have independent citizens capable of thinking for themselves and exercising sound judgment.  It should also ensure that our children become citizens who can play a full and constructive part in our society.  Our system of education does not do that.</P>
    <P>There are few features in the Minister's speech which I can applaud.  The £100,000 increase for heating and lighting in schools was long overdue and was a dire necessity.  As Deputy P. O'Donnell said, the conditions in our schools, especially in rural areas in the wintertime, bereft of lighting and heating, were nothing less than a disgrace. We know of cases where the fire had to be lit in a national school and the children were obliged to find the timber to light it.  They had to do the necessary work in preparing fires and they also had to clean these schools.  The Minister should exercise more authority in regard to this question of the proper lighting, heating and cleaning of schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister's plans for the comprehensive schools which he outlined in May, 1963, have not advanced very much in the past 12 months.  He has merely been able to tell us that the <Col N="1613" /> proposal is in the embryo stage and where he hopes to establish these schools.  It is disconcerting to find that these comprehensive schools will, in the main, be confined to the west of Ireland and certain other regions known as the &ldquo;undeveloped areas.&rdquo; We had got away from this kind of partitioning of the country in respect of Industry and Commerce and the withdrawal of the preferential grants to these areas, and it was unnecessary for the Minister to start partitioning the country in respect of these schools. We could show as great a need for a comprehensive school in parts of my constituency as the people in these other parts can.  If it means the provision of free education, all our children are entitled to that facility. It is as difficult for a poor family to live in any part of Ireland as it is in the areas mentioned by the Minister in which these comprehensive schools are to be located.</P>
    <P>I might not be right in saying that it means free education because regrettably it does involve the payment of a fee for certain children.  The Minister will say that those who are unable to pay need not pay, that it will be free for them, but there again we have that class distinction entering into the picture.  It is humiliating in the extreme for any poor child to have to display his parents' inability to pay a fee and it must of necessity have a bad psychological effect on that child to have to accept education in those circumstances.  It would be far better if the Minister took his courage in his hands and conceded the principle of free education in these comprehensive schools rather than allow this distinction to continue.  I do not know what kind of means test will be applied but obviously some kind must be applied and it is a regrettable feature of the establishment of these schools.</P>
    <P>I have noted also the personnel who will control these comprehensive schools.  There will be the appointment of a representative of the Bishop and the appointment of the chief educational officer of the vocational committee, with a representative of the Minister.  I have certain misgivings about this kind of committee because <Col N="1614" /> it allows for no representation for the parents.  I have always felt that the vocational committees are highly representative and highly competent to carry out the educational plans of the technical schools in their areas. They are representative of the clergy, as well as having on them the education officer and public representatives, and I suggest to the Minister that this new committee will not be comprehensive if the parents do not have representation.  Whether that is done by way of the appointment of a local representative to speak on behalf of the parents or directly from a parents' committee constituted for that purpose, is a matter of indifference, but I feel that the parents have a right to representation in some form or other.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can tell us that there has been any worthwhile improvement in the sorry situation that less than one quarter of our children between the ages of 12 and 18 go to secondary schools and only one-third are receiving secondary and vocational education.  I made a fervent appeal to the Minister last year to have regard to the crushing burdens which the provision of books placed on poorer parents and I asked him to be more generous in regard to the grants for school requisites.  I had in mind particularly the provision of free books and I told the Minister and the House of the humiliation caused when children cannot hand up the required amount of money for new books.  It is a great embarrassment for a child to have to admit this and I would urge the Minister not to allow children to become pawns in the hands of certain vested interests.  It has now become the policy to issue new books almost every year and this is placing an unnecessary and unjustifiable burden on parents, especially poorer parents.  They must provide a complete change of books almost every year for the different members of their families.  Heretofore, the same book was used in a class for a long number of years and books were passed on from brother to brother and sister to sister, and the parents spared great expense.</P>
    <P>In these times, the provision of £2 <Col N="1615" /> per primary school for the provision of ink, chalk and free books is totally inadequate and should be considerably increased.  That is the figure I have for the provision of these items.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong.  I am suggesting the Minister is being advised by the wrong people if he assumes the children in rural Ireland, or indeed in many cities and towns, can buy, out of the earnings of the breadwinner, the costly new books and appliances that are demanded from year to year and from week to week.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that while there is an increase in the Minister's Estimate in respect of secondary schools, it is not a very substantial increase and will be very largely absorbed by increases in salaries arising from arbitration awards to the teachers.  There will be very little left for the provision of the additional scholarships required and the attainment of the free education we seek in our secondary school system.</P>
    <P>I have said the secondary school system is a class-ridden system, that all the State expenditure on secondary education is tending to endow the rich, buttress privilege and disfranchise the poor man's child.  The secondary system of education, with its varying degrees of fees, the cultivation of accents and the different brands of uniform, is evidently the most class-conscious section of our educational system.  We as a Party have no hesitation in saying that we would undo that system and claim for our children free post-primary education, free secondary education and free university education.  Pending the attainment of that ideal, we would extend out of all proportion the required number of scholarships so that every child who had the ability could pass on from the primary school to the secondary school or vocational school of his choice, and thence to the university.</P>
    <P>Again in regard to vocational education, it is significant to note that of all the secondary scholarships which have been availed of&mdash;and there must have been many thousands in the past few years&mdash;I do not know of a single instance where a parent opted to send <Col N="1616" /> the child who had won a secondary scholarship to a vocational school instead of a secondary school.  Clearly, and it is regrettable, there seems to be in the mind of the parent some stigma attached to the vocational school.  Rarely, if ever, have we found that a pupil availed of a secondary scholarship to go to a vocational school. It has always been to the secondary school.  I am suggesting that parents must feel there is a higher social status attached to the secondary school as against the vocational school, and that is to be greatly deplored.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing something to build up the status of the vocational school in introducing the Intermediate and Leaving Certificate examinations. It is something we recommend very much.  I note from the Minister's speech that plans are going ahead for these examinations in the vocational schools.  They will have the effect of upgrading these technical schools, giving them a better status and ensuring that boys and girls who have a bent for vocationalism will avail of these schools in future.</P>
    <P>Money expended on education, and particularly vocational education, in these times is money well spent and it will reap a rich reward not merely for the pupil or the parent but for the nation in the immediate years ahead.  We are facing difficult times. There are serious problems confronting this nation, problems which may very well put the survival of this country as an independent State in jeopardy.  We will be relying, in the main, on a highly-educated, highly-trained and highly-adaptable labour force in order to contend with the economic battles we shall have to fight in the future.  It is in the sphere of vocational education that the greatest good can be done.  That is why we support the Minister in respect of the improvements he is making in vocational education.  Many old skills are passing away.  Industry is being forced through competition to adapt itself and introduce the most modern techniques and devices available.  The vocational school of the future will have to realign itself and change its curriculum to ensure the children of the future have the training required <Col N="1617" /> to cope with these new devices which industry has been forced to adopt.</P>
    <P>Again speaking on vocational education, I want to impress upon the Minister the importance of a transport system.  While there are very many primary schools and possibly somewhat fewer secondary schools dispersed throughout the country, there are still fewer technical schools.  If the children of the rural areas are to avail of vocational education, we must be prepared to transport them long distances to the vocational school.  I would ask the Minister to treat with urgency all proposals he may receive from the vocational committees in respect of travelling facilities of this kind and to be as generous as he can in the provision of the subvention in order to ease the burden on the parents in respect of the transport provided.</P>
    <P>I have also felt that when children are being transported to primary, secondary or vocational schools which might be in the same town or region, it is extremely wasteful to provide different sets of transport.  Clearly, the one transport system ought to provide for all the children of the various schools when they are in the same region.  I understand that this waste and extravagance is bound, of necessity, to occur where you have an educational system which is in four watertight compartments, a primary department, a secondary department, a vocational department and a university department.  There would not seem to be any cohesion among these various branches of our educational system.  We have appealed time after time for the abandonment of this wasteful and stupid policy of having our educational system confined in those four compartments.  They should be placed in one department under one heading, so that we shall have the co-operation and the cohesion which is desirable for the implementation of of an educational policy proper.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to allow the occasion to pass, Sir, without raising again the question of the mentally handicapped child.  I know there are various grades of mental handicap and I know, too, the Minister's Department, despite <Col N="1618" /> sincere effort on his part to grapple with this serious national problem, has up to now made very little impact on the problem of the care and education of the mentally retarded children of this country.  Despite constant appeals in this House, the Minister's Department has failed to do anything about this and voluntary organisations have been forced to take up the work.  These voluntary organisations get subscriptions, together with an amount of goodwill and support, in many counties, particularly my own&mdash;County Tipperary&mdash;and they have now been forced to raise colossal amounts of money, seek suitable buildings and secure the necessary staff for the establishment of schools for the physically and mentally handicapped.  They propose to establish a central school in the county but they propose moreover to establish day centres in certain of the big towns where these mentally retarded children can be taken along, trained and educated for five days of the week, and return to their parents afterwards.</P>
    <P>I have said this is a national problem, but it is an indictment of the Department of Education that voluntary organisations can do these things, and are doing them well.  I hope, when these voluntary organisations call on the Minister for financial support or moral support, guidance or advice, it will be readily forthcoming.  I know the Minister has been assisting those voluntary organisations with advice and guidance but I am primarily concerned that, when it comes to the acid test of providing the necessary money, the Minister will, as he is indicating to me physically, dig deep into his pockets and give generously to these organisations to whom we owe a deep debt of gratitude.</P>
    <P>No words of mine could adequately express the suffering and great anxiety of mind which prevails in a home where one, and perhaps more than one of these children has to be maintained. Clearly, the teachers in our schools are unable to cope with this type of child.  He, or she, is usually relegated to the back of the class.  Interest may be taken in him, or her, for a short period, but, eventually, that child is <Col N="1619" /> completely ignored and is left alone and lonely.  In time, it is decided that it is purposeless and foolish to continue the spurious attempt of educating that child.  The child is confined to the home and in many instances becomes a problem.  We have cases of children of tender age&mdash;as young as ten years&mdash;of this kind in my county who have been confined in a mental hospital.  There is no provision in this country for a proper institution for the care of that child, or for the training or education of the child, and the child has been placed in a mental hospital, which is clearly unsuitable for a child of such tender age.</P>
    <P>I want to plead with the Minister for proper educational facilities for mentally retarded children, whether their condition is mild, medium or chronic.  I should wish, while nothing is contained in his speech in this respect, that the Minister might reply and tell the House and the nation, what the parents can hope for and what these children can hope for from the Minister in the coming year from any proposals he may have to alleviate this serious problem.</P>
    <P>I noticed that the Minister proposes, and has suggested to the representatives of the secondary schools, that the school year should be extended to at least 200 days.  I wish to say now as I have always felt, that children have too many holidays.  It is purposeless leaving children off from school for six or eight weeks every year.  It is wasteful in the extreme.  It is certainly no help to the child and very little help to the parents.  I am glad the Minister has had the wisdom now to provide that the school year will be extended to 200 days.  Extra instruction of these children will result, and the wastage arising in the past by children being away from school for virtually two or three months of the year will cease.</P>
    <P>The same might apply to primary and vocational education.  Here again the period of holidays seems excessive and is not in the best interests of the children.  I know the argument has been made from time to time that parents were able to utilise the services of their children, especially the older <Col N="1620" /> children, on the farm or in the business during the holiday period.  That may be so, but I am of the opinion that it is not in the best interests of the children that they should be allowed to play around and that their education should be disrupted for such an extensive period every year.  It is only right and proper that the Minister should see to it as far as he can that a reasonable work year is maintained.  Most of us get only a fortnight's holidays every year.  When one considers that, one would regard three or four months' holidays as excessive.</P>
    <P>With the exception of some provision for heating and cleaning, provision for secondary education, a slight increase for industrial schools and an increase in the State subvention for scholarships, there is nothing in the Minister's speech which gives us any hope of the implementation of the revolutionary plan outlined 12 months ago.  I ask the Minister to indicate more clearly and in greater detail when we may hope to see the establishment of these regional colleges.</P>
    <P>I know the centres the Minister has designated for such colleges; I know, too, he has said he is having particular regard to the establishment of such a college in Carlow, that he is in consultation with the vocational education committee there in an effort to gauge the requirements of that college. It would seem&mdash;I hope I am wrong&mdash; that the Minister looks upon the establishment of the Carlow college as a pilot plan, as an example of what the other colleges should be, and that until such time as the establishment in Carlow is a reality, work will not begin in other centres.</P>
    <P>That is the inference I draw from the Minister's remarks.  It would be tragic if the people of the country at large had to wait for a number of years for the establishment of colleges in their areas.  Apart from the great wastage of talent, many young boys and girls who could be trained as technicians, scientists and technologists, will have been lost to the nation.  This, I would impress on the Minister, is a matter of extreme urgency.  If we are to progress in the industrial sector, if we are to take our place in the European <Col N="1621" /> economy, if agricultural output is to be increased, we urgently need these schools of technology for the training of personnel.</P>
    <P>When the Minister outlined his proposals in May, 1963, and when these revolutionary plans were outlined, I thought we would proceed with all haste.  It is not merely disconcerting but alarming that the Minister has not positive proposals for the commencement of work on these establishments. He has not even indicated when these schools will be in operation.  Thousands of our young boys and girls have been looking with hope and enthusiasm to the day when they can go on from the technical schools and the secondary schools to technological colleges and the university.</P>
    <P>When are these hopes to be realised? Clearly it is not to be this year, next year.  Will it be in ten years time? How many thousands of boys and girls with great talent, aptitude and ability, will by then have been lost to the nation?  I can only urge on the Minister the necessity for proceeding with all haste in the centres mentioned in his statement today.  While I realise every town in Ireland of any size cannot have a college of technology, I regret the Minister did not think fit to propose a school of technology in the Premier County.</P>

      <P>Tipperary, of course. The Minister should know that when we are speaking of the Premier County, we mean Tipperary.  We had hoped that Clonmel, the capital of that county, would have been given one of those schools.  Likewise, Thurles, in North Tipperary, had a compelling claim.  It is regrettable that Tipperary, the Premier County, in case the Minister still does not know it, has been left without such a school.  I hope that when additional schools of this kind are being considered, Tipperary will not be forgotten again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin, at the moment, has two.  It is proposed to establish one in Cork, Carlow, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Sligo, Dundalk and Athlone.  In reference to his remarks on the establishment <Col N="1622" /> of the Carlow school and to the fact that he was in consultation with the education authorities there, the Minister added:</P>
    <P>It should not be inferred that the urgency of establishing such colleges in the other centres I have mentioned is not recognised. </P>
    <P>That is all right, but he should have been able to indicate when work will commence on these new colleges.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the courage he has shown in indicating promptly where the colleges will be sited.  Many towns throughout the country were vieing with one another for these schools and it was good that we should know early how we stood in that respect.  The Minister took a lot of us out of pain when he announced the towns and cities in which the schools would be established. That, of course, does not mean we have given up hope of seeing one in our town, where there is an abundance of suitable material and, indeed, a new £150,000 school in which are all the facilities necessary for staff and pupils of a technological college.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the Estimate last year, I adverted to the state of affairs in the reformatories, the industrial schools.  I see the Minister has increased the State allowance by 10/-per pupil, but I had hoped that as a result of remarks made on this subject this year the Minister would have done something to segregate in these schools the offenders from the nonoffenders. In 1959-60, there were 3,805 children in reformatories in this country and I understand that 3,000 of them had not committed any crime. These children guilty of no crime, were domiciled in the schools due to parents' lack of means&mdash;due to poverty and nothing else.  Their parents were unable to care and provide for them, they had given them up voluntarily in some cases and there were cases where the children had been taken away from them.  We felt it was wrong that these young innocent children, who had not committed any crime, who had not offended society in any way, should be placed in the new category as offenders against society <Col N="1623" /> who had been sentenced in the courts and transferred to these institutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, the Minister will admit he has sole responsibility for industrial schools.  It is a matter, I suggest, for the Minister for Education, not the Minister for Justice.  Reference to this subject is contained on page 16 of the Minister's speech where he says, in respect of reformatory and industrial schools:</P>
      <P>The sum sought under this Vote is £256,800, that is, £27,150 more than last year's estimate.  This is due to the weekly contribution per pupil to schools having been increased by 10/- as from 1st November, 1963. </P>
      <P>The capitation grant or award to industrial schools from the State is now 27/6d. and a sum of 27/6d. is payable also from the local authority. The Minister should, then, do something towards ensuring a better deal for these children to whom I have referred.  Those children who, through destitution or the inability of the parents to provide for them, are domiciled in industrial schools ought to be given a better deal.  Many of us feel that a home, however poor it might be, is a better way to bring up and rear a child than to place it in surroundings of this kind.</P>
      <P>With these sentiments, it only devolves on me again to express my profound regret that, so far we have looked in vain to the Minister with hope and enthusiasm to implement many of the things we are aspiring to in education in this country.  The Labour Party spelled out in a policy document what we believe in and what we think should be done to provide equal rights and equal opportunities for all our children.  In the first instance, that means giving them an education in accordance with their ability to assimilate it and to benefit from it and not one based on the ability of the parents to pay for it.</P>

    <P>When shall we see the realisation of the impressions needed in the banner <Col N="1624" /> headlines in the daily papers of May 21st, 1963?  When shall we see the realisation of that freer educational system and the attainment of the comprehensive school and the schools of technology?  I sincerely hope it was not a mere political gimmick on the Minister's part.</P>
    <P>I should hate to think that the Minister availed of that occasion to make a statement of that kind which would give hope to so many people and then deprive them of that hope.  I do not believe that was his intention but I think he was unwise in the extreme not to avail of this occasion to secure his requirements from the present Budget &mdash;the turnover Budget&mdash;which provided such a vast amount of extra revenue.  It is indeed a great pity that he did not avail of this occasion to garner into the Department of Education the extra millions required to ensure free post-primary education for all our children and thus implement in the spirit and in the letter the intentions contained in his statement of some 12 months ago.  In the absence of more positive evidence that this plan will be implemented, I can only conclude that the Minister's opening statement to the House today, 12 months after that other statement, is in effect a sterile effort and must of necessity cause deep disappointment to all those who are interested in the great social problem involved in education in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past few years, we can see that there has been a terrific increase in the volume of interest in our educational system. The increase in the number of parents who are really taking an interest in the education of their children has been remarkable in the past ten years or so.  Casting our mind back ten or 15 years, I recall that not much interest was taken in the homework the children were expected to do. Now, if a child is in any way bright, or with any child for that matter, I notice, going around the constituency, that the parents are very keen about its education.  They see that they do their homework and they bring them along as they value education for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> Nobody can fail to notice at the present time the extra number of children attending secondary and vocational schools.  That is a healthy sign in any nation.  I always heard, when I was going to school, that education is no load to carry.  It is certainly pleasing to see that the people realise how important education is for the welfare of the children and, for that matter, of the country. They realise that if they want to get a good position in life, they must have education, either secondary or vocational.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of this matter on which I should like to see a greater realisation as to what is likely to happen if a child follows either secondary or vocational education. I have a feeling that on quite a number of occasions the child is sent to whichever school is the more convenient or nearest and that account is not taken of whether or not it is the most suitable for the child.  Take a child going to a vocational school who would be more suited to secondary education, and <i>vice versa.</i>  We see quite an amount of the results of this, particularly in September, after the Leaving Certificate results.  We see children looking for positions and finding it difficult to get them.  In some cases, those children might have been better off if they had pursued a course of vocational education.  If they had become apprentices, then, by the age of 21, their apprenticeship would be served.</P>
    <P>An inspector could readily go to some institutions and talk at some stage to the teachers and children of the value of secondary education or vocational education and point out where each type of education leads.  If that were done at the Intermediate Certificate and the Group Certificate stage a child could change from one type of education to another.  It is good to see brought home, more so this year than ever, that the Intermediate and the Group Certificates are rated the same for apprentices.  Even at that stage, something should be done so that a child can go from one type of education to another if deemed desirable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1626" /> In other countries, particularly in England, quite a number of children have been diverted from one form of education to the type of education which is considered most suitable for them.  I feel we should guard against that here.  It is happening to some extent because our vocational schools are fairly far apart and quite a number of secondary schools are springing up throughout the country.  I do not know if it is possible to have all systems combined under a county management so that there could be co-ordination between them because we must look to the future.</P>
    <P>It was good to see in the Minister's speech that new colleges of technology are coming.  That will possibly provide an outlet for some children in the vocational schools who want to get into higher education.  It is important that during his school-going years a child should get the best out of whatever system of education he can avail of.  That was forcibly brought home to me a couple of years ago when I was going around before an election and came across a family where one boy, not so bright, was apprenticed to the local garage.  He got on well and is foreman at present.  The other boy was the bright boy.  There was only a year or so between them.  He won a county council scholarship and did his five years in a secondary school.  He was not able to get any position after getting his Leaving Certificate.  He was forced to emigrate and at present he is driving a milkvan in England.</P>
    <P>If that boy had been properly directed at some stage, I think he should be able to get a good living in this country.  When you find a boy whose brains are not so good and who did not get an opportunity of further education getting on much better than his brother who had the brains and the opportunity, something is obviously needed.  The second boy is earning a good deal more than his brother.  I know there must be many cases like that.  If there had been guidance each year, possibly there could have been a <Col N="1627" /> switch from one school to another in the case of the first boy, but when he went to secondary school, he could not very well go back to vocational education because of his scholarship.  He might have achieved better results if there were a system whereby education could be paid for at university level, something like the case of the national teachers.  The Department pays for all teachers called to the training colleges for two years and this is stopped out of their pay afterwards.  If there were some form of hire-purchase or if advance payments could be made, either through an independent body or through the Department&mdash;that might be rather expensive&mdash;or possibly a combination of both so that a young man could pay for his university education after being qualified, it would meet a very definite need.</P>
    <P>I understand there are some snags in this proposition but I sincerely hope the time is not too far distant when some such scheme can be operated. There has been some talk of this in the past few years but it has so far come to nothing.  I feel the idea is there and some way will eventually be found to put it into effect.  At present we have university students going abroad to work during the summer to earn their fees for the coming year.  Two plane-loads of them are going to America by chartered aircraft to work there for three months for that purpose. This shows how interested people are becoming in education.  We see a great deal of that in America, where boys work their way through college, even though they may have to go many miles away to do it.  If there were some hire-purchase system for university education, the boy to whom I referred would not be driving a van in London at present.</P>
    <P>I know that vocational schools are completely linked up with industry.  In Dublin, they have an office at Ballsbridge to help students get positions and also to give them a test after they have gone through the vocational schools.  Something like that would be a benefit in the country.  We find a number of boys with Group Certificates <Col N="1628" /> not able to secure positions. Perhaps they are unlucky.  Often others do not know what to do.  Much of the trouble may be due to lack of advice. The teachers, as a rule, try to help but if it were driven home to both parents and children, more of those boys would get into apprenticeships.</P>
    <P>An aspect of vocational education we do not hear so much about at present is rural science.  That is a very good course, devised for the benefit of the farmer, and any of the boys who have done the course find it gives them exceptionally good groundwork in agriculture.  Where a boy goes back to the farm, one can certainly see how he benefits from it, but it often happens that the boy is too young to go back or that the farm is not able to support him and his father, but the boy finds it hard to get a job in some sphere of farming. Quite often, good boys are lost to the farming community in that way.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased to see that more money is to be devoted to scholarships, both to secondary schools and universities, because the more scholarships we have, the better incentive it gives children to work. Naturally, some who fail to get scholarships will be disappointed but they will still have learned a good deal.  They cannot all succeed and it will give them an idea of the advantages of education, and even though they fail to get a scholarship, usually some way is devised of sending these children to secondary or vocational schools subsequently.  It starts them training for study in the future.  I should like to see more scholarships being provided.  The Minister has not inexhaustible funds from which to provide money for everything but as the country's economy expands I hope he will be able to increase the number of scholarships provided.</P>
    <P>I have come across a case where a person who had won a university scholarship became ill and missed a year at the university.  When that happens the parents have to bear the expense of the period that the student has missed.  That creates a very serious problem.  I realise, of course, that <Col N="1629" /> the clause is in the scheme to prevent students wasting their time at a university at the country's expense but there are cases where a student may contract a serious illness and provision should be made to continue the scholarship on his resumption of studies, not to have the parents at a loss.  There are not many such cases but some provision should be made for them.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the problem of mentally handicapped children.  It has been suggested that the Department should provide special schools for such children.  Very useful work is being done by voluntary bodies in this connection and if the Department were able to subsidise such bodies they would be able to carry out very valuable work.  There is a saying that God helps those who help themselves. Self-help should be encouraged. Many mentally handicapped children require individual attention and patience.  If the education of the mentally handicapped were confined to State-owned schools it is possible that the children would have to be removed from their homes and would not have any contact with the outside world and would be institutionalised.  In my view, the voluntary bodies are best suited to help with this problem.</P>
    <P>I wish now to refer to the question of the provision of transport to and from schools.  Transport facilities for school children should be extended. Generally speaking, school managers have not made much use of the facilities available.  There are a few reasons for that.  One may be that the children living on one road would qualify for school transport while those living on another road would not. There is a growing demand for transport of children to and from school. A scheme of transport to vocational schools is only starting and possibly it is in this respect that the greatest extension of the services could be made, particularly when the new schools of technology are provided. Attendance at vocational schools usually involves long journeys for the pupils attending them and if transport is not provided, particularly in the winter, the children may have to remain at school for a long number <Col N="1630" /> of hours, perhaps in damp clothes. A transport system would be greatly valued.</P>
    <P>There should be a system of guidance for school children at various stages, possibly each year, to investigate where the education course they are following will lead them and whether it is best suited to them. There should be freer exchange between secondary and vocational schools.  I would suggest that there should be some assistance given when the pupils leave school in the matter of obtaining positions for them.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more scholarships offered and some form of deferred payments introduced into university education.  Such a facility is badly needed and I hope it will not be too long in coming.</P>
    <P>The valuable services provided by building instructors attached to vocational schools is greatly appreciated. The instructor helps the people in the locality in the matter of drawing up plans for houses and outoffices and guides them in building.  I suggest that more instructors should be appointed and greater use made of their services.  They are handicapped to a certain extent by the fact that they may not have a car and cannot cover all areas.  The same would apply in the case of domestic economy teachers.  They could be used as part of an advisory service for rural homes in such matters as cookery and house decoration.</P>

    <P>Education is more than a topic nowadays; it is a live issue amongst all sections of the people.  We heard this afternoon varying opinions expressed as to the type of education we should have in this country.  Before dealing with that I should like to say that I think, generally speaking, the aims of education from the beginning have been of a very high nature.  I do not think anybody has ever attempted to introduce anything like snobbery or class distinction into education.  If it has come into it, it has come in in an involuntary fashion.  I prefer to believe that nobody has consciously given any slant like that to education here.</P>
    <P>As far as primary education is concerned, I do not think it has ever been brought to the notice of the <Col N="1632" /> Department or any responsible person that children in the primary schools have been treated in any different fashion because they came from different strata of society.  The child coming in to the primary school is regarded as a human individual entrusted to the care of the teacher to mould and shape its mind and soul. That has always been regarded as a sacred trust, never at any stage to be betrayed by the teacher to whom it is given.  It would be a wrong impression for us to create that there is anything like that type of snobbery and class distinction.</P>
    <P>In this connection it is axiomatic that from the beginning everybody must have an interest in primary education.  Primary education is not the care of teachers.  It is not the care of the Department of Education. Primary education is the responsibility of the parents to whom children are given.  If they took that interest in the education of their children, you would find that, if there were glaring faults, these would be very readily ventilated. Then everybody concerned&mdash;teachers, Department and Minister&mdash;could take steps to deal with the faults that exist.</P>
    <P>There are, undoubtedly, minor imperfections which any educational system in any part of the world will have.  They say that education is as good as the teachers who provide it. I would be less than candid if I did not say here, as I have said previously, that, by and large, the standards, both from the point of view of academic attainment and devotion to duty, are as high as anywhere else.  In regard to primary education, the Minister has to contend with the difficulties under which the system may labour.</P>
    <P>The Minister realises, I think, that the greatest fault at the present time is in the pupil-teacher ratio.  The Minister finds a problem in the larger built-up areas, and particularly in the larger schools.  He announced today that he intends to take further steps designed to reduce the ratio.  That is both admirable and desirable.  It is often forgotten that where a teacher is dealing with a number of pupils within a specified timetable, extending over a range of subjects, the amount of <Col N="1633" /> personal attention the teacher can devote to the individual child is very small indeed.  What the practical teacher does, having dealt with some facet of a subject, and having ensured as far as possible within the week that the majority of the pupils have grasped the point, is to try then to devote the balance of any time available to the weaker members in the class.</P>
    <P>I regretted learning this afternoon that anybody should think that a retarded child or a backward child is put at the back of the class and not attended to thereafter.  I have never known that to happen in my 37 years of teaching.  I have never had the experience in any school in which I worked of children being segregated because they were not able to keep up with the others.  It is true there is a problem and what is required in the case of such children is teachers with a special aptitude for dealing with backward children and, as well as that, a school apart in which the children can move at their own level, without feeling the inferiority naturally attached to trying to answer amongst pupils who are brighter and who may unwittingly be hurtful because of the lack of knowledge on the part of the child.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us some indication as to the rate of progress in this particular respect.  Some years ago, the Minister sent some of his inspectorial staff to, I think, Scotland.  The idea was that this staff would be available to give advice to teachers on this problem of mentally handicapped children.  I know special schools have been established in some places.  Limerick has one.  The number of such children is small and it would completely defeat the ends of education if the numbers of pupils in such a school were to be so large that the individual child would suffer the further handicap of a diminution in the time made available to him, or to her, by the teacher.</P>
    <P>We all recognise the problem and I regret that such a number still remain to be dealt with.  It is largely, of course, a matter of providing the specially trained staff.  Not all teachers have the aptitude to deal with this type of <Col N="1634" /> child.  The work requires an extra amount of patience, an extra amount of what might be described as mother love.  Where there is that attribute, the teacher has a loving understanding of the problem of the child in trying to grasp what the teacher is trying to get home.  I should like to think progress is being made in this work.</P>
    <P>I regret that children of tender years should be confined in mental hospitals. It would be a shocking dereliction of duty on the part of parents to confine a child in such an institution.  It is something we can hardly contemplate happening in these modern times.  I should be very sorry to hear that this does occur and I trust the Minister will be able to reassure us that it is not allowed to happen or will not be allowed to happen in future.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the problem of the pupil-teacher ratio in the larger schools.  I would ask him to bear in mind the problem in regard to the rural school.  In the larger schools here in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and elsewhere, you have four, eight or 12 teachers and it is a case of one teacher, one class.  There is the handicap with regard to the amount of individual attention the teacher can give to any particular pupil.  The provision of prefabricated classrooms and extra teachers will undoubtedly contribute to the advance of education in the larger schools.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the smaller two-teacher schools in which a teacher may have the third and fourth, fifth and sixth classes.  There the teacher divides his attention over four classes.  The point I want to make is that the Minister should also reduce the ratio of average enrolment in order to ensure that these small schools will continue in operation.</P>
    <P>Where separate schools have existed for boys and girls, he should not allow a system to develop whereby the identity of these separate schools vanishes and we have what has come to be regarded as inevitable, a type of amalgamation.  Opinions differ on amalgamation.  I myself hold very firm ideas on it.  If it is at all possible, I do not think amalgamation is desirable. <Col N="1635" /> Others hold the opposite view.  If there is any reasonable hope of the average rising, either in relation to enrolment or attendance or a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio generally throughout the country, then he ought to have a look at this problem again.</P>
    <P>Manners and etiquette were mentioned here this evening.  I suppose it is symptomatic of the age in which we live that there is apparent lack of etiquette.  The homes cannot shed the responsibility they have to inculcate such knowledge into the children. By and large, the homes are doing that.  At any time, and in any school, there will be problem children; the type of child who grows up and is referred to today as a Teddy boy or a Teddy girl.  That is a problem of this modern age and modern society, and society must deal with it.  It is not the complete and sole responsibility of the schools.  It is a problem for all other media of instruction in this country, or in any country.  It is the responsibility of the Press which has such power in influencing opinion in any country.  It is the responsibility of the radio and television.  There is an old saying that kind words never broke any teeth.  That is as true today as it ever was.</P>
    <P>The parents must realise that the children are in school for only a small proportion of the day.  Normally, the child who goes to school at 9 a.m., if there is no midday mealbreak, goes home at 3 p.m. or a little later.  He spends approximately a quarter of his time under the influence of the school. Admittedly, the influence of the school can be great.  The school can impose on the child a certain discipline in regard to manners, but it is not a lasting impression.  They are not the manners that will last.  The manners which will last are those which grow from the respect the child has from the beginning for his parents at home, and for those with whom he is brought into contact.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge, no opportunity is lost in the schools to impress on children the need for manners.  I am sure that is the experience of the Minister, and of his officials who go <Col N="1636" /> into the schools.  I take it that it is the primary schools which were referred to.  As a matter of fact, and as a matter of record, very often the officials of the Department have been able to record the good manners of the children, their diligence and neatness of dress, their carriage and so on.  They have all become a feature of the schools.</P>
    <P>For the information of those who may not know it, there is a little book available at present.  I gladly pay tribute to the Minister for including it in the stock of books which he has made available as a basic library for the schools.  As I say, there is such a book, and the children reading it will find a certain amount of information, and perhaps they will be able to equate their own ideas on etiquette and manners with the ideals expressed in the book.</P>
    <P>The school library system to which the Minister referred is, I believe, one of the major advances of these times in the primary schools.  It is novel, and it will certainly confer great benefits on the children in our primary schools.  We have been fortunate in Limerick in that we are one of the areas selected as a pioneer centre in which the library scheme is being tried out.  I want to join with the Minister in paying tribute to the library officials, and to our chief librarian, for their hard work and co-operation in the initiation of the scheme.  I should also like to pay tribute to the lecturer who was sent to Limerick recently, Miss Ward, who spoke to the teachers on how the library system might be used to the advantage of education in general and, in particular, to the benefit of the pupils in the schools where the libraries are situated.</P>
    <P>During the past week, the basic stock of books arrived in my school. I think that for a start the teachers spent more time looking at them than the pupils.  They are of very varied interest.  We are only awaiting covers to let the pupils avail of them.  That scheme has long been lacking here.  It brings, for the first time, visual aid into the schools, and places readily at the disposal of the children the means of acquiring knowledge on their own. <Col N="1637" /> It can be a most interesting and fascinating pursuit for the children, as well as being a very important educational work.  It used to be said that self-education was the best education.  Here we are employing the natural interest of the child in his pursuit of knowledge and placing it at his disposal in very well-illustrated books.  They are very well written and very well chosen.</P>
    <P>The working of the system will be a matter of trial and error in its first years and in any particular school, with the assistance of the county librarian, a system must be devised to make it work properly.  I take it from what we heard that the intention is that what was the halfday in the week will be used for this purpose.  I think it is the only feasible way.  Other systems have been proposed but the ordinary working of the school cannot be interrupted.  Consequently what would be a free period is a more desirable thing and will more readily ensure that children will get the books and that the books can be properly given out and returned.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister intends to expand this scheme in the coming year.  I take it that not alone is it the intention to expand this scheme until it will embrace all primary schools but that the scheme will continue to expand with the provision, over the years, of extra books in order to build up a wider reference library.  The co-operation of the country library committees will be a very valuable asset. Speaking for County Limerick, I can say that the librarian is making available a stock of 300 books to supplement the number of books sent to each school.  This will ensure a wider variety of reading for pupils and will, I hope, provide a useful outlet for their spare time and provide recreational facilities other than television, the radio, attending cinemas or playing games.  I welcome it very much and I hope that it will prove, as I believe it will, to be of great benefit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crinion mentioned rural science.  In regard to the school curriculum, a great many people desire a great many different things and all that schools can do is provide a reasonable and balanced programme within the <Col N="1638" /> time available.  There are a certain number of basic subjects which are required and which have to get priority.  There is the question of the Irish and English languages and when we mention these, it is too often forgotten that with any language, you are not alone concerned with reading and speaking the language but also with writing the language and the grammar of the language.  These are all separate facets which have to be dealt with, particularly in the primary school.</P>
    <P>It is very important that children should have a good basic knowledge of how they should proceed in their studies of the language at any stage. Consequently quite a large amount of time is devoted, understandably, to the Irish language in particular.  By the time provision is made for arithmetic, with history and geography thrown in, I do not know how the rest can fit into the school day.  As it is, anybody with a knowledge of a school timetable knows that all these subjects I have mentioned do not fit every day into the school programme.  There are other desirable subjects such as music and for girls, there has to be needlework.  There is not much use loading a programme with desirable subjects, if in the long run we cannot get them done.  Rural science is one of those subjects that might with good effect be left to the vocational schools. Schools at present have not got the equipment or the gardens to enable a proper course of rural science to be taught and I think we would only be tinkering with the situation.  We can develop a healthy interest in plants and flowers, and in the common animals and birds and in kindness to them, and that is done by way of conversation at present without teaching formal rural science.</P>
    <P>In regard to heating and cleaning in primary schools, the Minister might give some details about how he intends to implement the increased grants.  Are they to be implemented in the existing fashion?  In that regard I previously mentioned, and I make no apology for mentioning it again, that the heating and cleaning of national schools has become the responsibility of the local manager <Col N="1639" /> and in some extraordinary way, he is charged with this responsibility of providing the money.  I said previously that the Department should as far as possible provide the full cost of heating and cleaning.  We should not impose undue responsibility on the manager.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his brief referred to road safety.  Generally speaking, I think leaflets have been sent to the schools by the Department and these have been acted upon.  Lectures have been given to the children and in Limerick, for instance, we have a Safety First Officer who has lectured to the children in the schools.  I think <Col N="1640" /> it was in Holland that I saw in the schoolyards where there was sufficient space, roads, junctions and so on, painted on the concrete.  Once a week the children would provide their own policemen&mdash;one youngster controlling the crossing and the others obeying him&mdash;and if the children had scooters, tricycles or bicycles, they would use them and be taught how to keep to their proper side of the road and what they should do when crossing the road.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 20th May, 1964.</P>
