      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,744,830 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1965, for the salaries and expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission.</P>
      <P>I propose to take Votes 36 and 37 together this year for the first time and, as generally arranged, I shall deal with both Estimates in this opening address so as to permit a combined discussion.  Vote 37 will be formally moved after the motion in respect of Vote 36 has been put, when the debate concludes.</P>
      <P>Vote 36, Lands, shows a net increase of £241,460 compared with last year. I shall first of all refer to the salient features of the Estimate, with particular reference to those items which reflect a significant change from last year's provision, and follow with a short review of the main activities of the Land Commission during the year ended 31st March last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Book of Estimates, as published, subhead A, which provides for salaries, wages and allowances, shows a decrease of £11,465 compared with last year.  This is largely attributable to normal retirements and replacement by staff at lower points of salary scales.  The establishment strength remains unchanged.  I should point out, however, that the published figures do not reflect the increase provided for the Civil Service under the ninth <Col N="957" /> round salary and wage agreement, effective from 1st February last, application of which will mean an increase of the order of £97,000 in the provision under Subhead A for the current financial year.</P>
    <P>Subhead B is in two parts this year. Part 1 relates mostly to expenses for travelling and subsistence arising from the inspection, survey and division of lands under the Land Acts.  It also provides for incidental and miscellaneous expenses, such as advertisements etc.  The increase of £2,700 this year is largely due to an anticipated increase in travelling expenses in connection with land settlement operations.</P>
    <P>The second part of subhead B is a new item.  In previous years, only such Post Office services as telephones, telegrams and foreign postage were separately provided for in Part 1 of the Estimate, other services, that is, inland postage charges, handling of stores and miscellaneous items, being shown without recoupment in the &ldquo;allied services&rdquo; in Part 11.  This year, subhead B.2 provides for actual payment to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for all services rendered by the Department.  The total amount required this year, under the general heading of Post Office Services, is £46,000; the corresponding amount for last year was approximately £38,000.</P>
    <P>Subhead D represents the taxpayers' contribution in the current year towards the service of land purchase debt, accumulated, since 1923, on both tenanted and untenanted land.  The moneys in this subhead are in the nature of statutory commitments.  The total contribution this year, namely £989,950, constitutes about one-third of the entire net Estimate.</P>
    <P>Of the total subhead provision, more than £843,000 is required to make good deficiencies in the Land Bond Fund arising from the statutory halving of annuities under the Land Act, 1933. The overall increase of £24,200 in subhead D this year is attributable almost entirely to the halving of purchase instalments payable by new allottees as land settlement continues.</P>
    <P>I should mention that in anticipation <Col N="958" /> of the passing of the Land Bill, 1963, section 23, a sum of £10 is included in subhead D this year to meet deficiencies arising from the application of the Statute of Limitations, 1957.  The purpose of the provision is to prevent annuities which have lapsed by reason of the operation of section 24 of the Statute of Limitations, from remaining a charge on the ratepayers and to enable any resultant deficits to be defrayed out of central funds.  A number of annuities payable out of holdings situated mainly on remote islands are becoming affected by the Statute of Limitations, 1957.</P>
    <P>Subhead G this year, consists of four separate items and I think it would be as well if I dealt with each of these individually.  In former years, the first part of subhead G related to the purchase of land by the Land Commission for cash in the open market under section 27, Land Act, 1950.  As Deputies know, such transactions are as yet confined to lands required for migrants' holdings or to facilitate the rearrangement of fragmented holdings. A sum of £185,000 was estimated for these purchases last year and actual expenditure amounted to £196,199.  In all, 23 properties, comprising 2,773 acres, were purchased for cash under Section 27 during the year ended 31st March last.  The corresponding figures for the previous year were 29 properties, aggregating 2,231 acres, total expenditure amounting to £182,279.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that section 44 of the Land Bill, 1963, envisages the elimination of the restrictive application of section 27 of the Land Act, 1950 so that, following the enactment of the Bill, lands purchased for cash will not be confined to the limited purposes of providing migrants' holdings and facilitating rearrangement of fragmented holdings.  Moreover, as the House knows, section 6 of the Bill provides that where elderly, incapacitated or blind persons voluntarily sell their interest in land to the Land Commission, the Land Commission may, at the option of the vendor, and in lieu of payment in cash in whole or in part of the purchase price, provide the vendor with a life annuity.  In anticipation of <Col N="959" /> the passing of the Land Bill, 1963, therefore, provision is being made for the proposed expanded application of section 27 of the Land Act, 1950, and for payment of life annuities on the lines mentioned.  This explains the increased provision of £85,000 under item 1 of subhead G for the current year.</P>
    <P>The second part of subhead G is a new item which also anticipates the passing of the Land Bill, 1963.  Section 5 of the Bill will enable the Land Commission to make loans to progressive farmers in congested areas for the purchase of viable farms of their choice, subject to making their existing lands available to the Land Commission for land settlement purposes. As the relevant statutory proposals were recently debated here at some length, it is scarcely necessary to go into any further details at this stage. Estimated requirements for the current year are £30,000 but any expenditure will, of course, be contingent on the enactment of the Land Bill.</P>
    <P>The remaining items included under subhead G do not call for much comment. A provision of £10,000, which is at the same level as last year, is being made for the payment in cash of compensation for tenancy interests resumed on the small outstanding residue of Congested Districts Board estates.  The final item relates to payment by the Land Commission of auctioneers' commission on relevant purchases of land for cash and land bonds. This matter was fully explained on the occasion of its original introduction to the Lands Vote last year.  The relevant provision for 1963-64 was £20,000 and expenditure was slightly in excess of £25,000.  For the current year, it is expected that £25,000 will be required.</P>
    <P>Subhead H makes provision for the payment of gratuities, pursuant to section 29 of the Land Act, 1950, to persons displaced from employment on estates taken over by the Land Commission for distribution.  Last year, gratuities totalling £9,532 were paid to 45 ex-employees&mdash;an average of £212 each.  In all, from the passing of <Col N="960" /> the Land Act, 1950, to 31st March, 1964, a total of 324 displaced employees have received gratuities aggregating £46,678.  Displaced employees who are deemed competent to work land are automatically considered for allotments; indeed, this is only right and proper.  If they are not considered suitable for allotments, however, they become eligible for a cash gratuity, depending on such factors as length of service, personal and family circumstances and availability of alternative employment.  An accurate forecast of likely commitments under Subhead H in any particular year is difficult, being dependent on the level of Land Commission acquisition activity and the extent to which workmen are displaced from their employment as a result of the Land Commission's operations.  Present indications, however, stemming from the acceleration of the acquisition sector, are that a sum of £11,000 will be required for the current year, and provision is being made accordingly. This represents an increase of £3,000 as compared with last year.</P>
    <P>Subhead I, for the most part, provides the funds required to meet the cost of improvement works on estates being divided by the Land Commission. These works, which are an essential feature of land settlement, include the erection of dwellinghouses and out-offices; the provision of access roads, fencing and drainage; provision of water supply for domestic and stock requirements; turbary development; repair and maintenance of embankments and so on.  The expenditure incurred on such works each year is inevitably heavy: in fact, it invariably accounts for more than a quarter of the entire Estimate.</P>
    <P>The amount provided under subhead I last year was £790,000, of which £725,114 was expended, including £325,848 on building projects.  It was planned to spend about £380,000 on buildings but unexpected difficulties and delays arose in getting smaller lots of buildings set to contract.  This occurred especially in Leinster, through the high level of general building activity.  The various estate improvement <Col N="961" /> works provided employment for about 660 workmen in the course of the year and their wage bill aggregated £292,000.  The continued application of work study techniques to general estate improvements and the operation of an incentive bonus scheme for Land Commission workmen have resulted in a significant increase in productivity in recent years.  In terms of money, this increased productivity represents a net saving of over £35,000 on Land Commission improvements works during the past financial year after allowing for bonus payments totalling £38,500 to the workers.</P>
    <P>For the current financial year, the amount proposed under subhead I is £850,000, which represents about 28 per cent of the entire Estimate.  There is an increase of £60,000 over last year's provision, including about £35,000 to meet the cost of the ninth round wage increase for Land Commission labourers and tradesmen.  As land settlement expands in line with the continued impetus on the acquisition side, the need for estate improvements works grows, giving rise to additional expenditure.  However, I have no doubt that the importance of and the resultant benefits from these works, in the context of land settlement, will commend themselves, especially to rural Deputies who, I think, will agree that any curtailment in the Land Commission's housing and general estate improvements programme would be undesirable.</P>
    <P>Grants for the preservation and improvement of game resources are provided for under subhead L.  As is generally known by now, these grants are made, within the funds available, to assist approved game development schemes formulated by local organisations representative of all appropriate interests and are confined to assisting locally organised direct improvement schemes formulated by local organisations representative of all appropriate interests and are confined to assisting locally organised direct improvement schemes which hold promise of worthwhile practical results and which are backed by efficient local organisation and initiative.  The schemes include provision for vermin destruction, that is, the control of predators, other than foxes.  Grants are also made available for game-farms and for general restocking purposes.  I want to <Col N="962" /> emphasise once more, however, that the major part of the expenditure must be provided locally: my objective is to provide encouragement and incentive for local initiative.</P>
    <P>Last year, a sum of £25,000 was provided under subhead L.  In the course of the year, grants totalling £21,920 were made to assist schemes involving an aggregate expenditure of £42,000.  In addition, grants amounting to some £3,000, applicable to some of the previous year's schemes, also fell due for payment.  By 31st March, 1964, the financial provision for the year was fully expended and outstanding approved grants, together with any supplementary grants, which may arise, will fall to be paid in the current year.  To meet such commitments and in anticipation of a greater volume of game development schemes, provision under subhead L is being increased this year to £30,000.</P>
    <P>This is the fourth year of active State participation in game development and, while I am glad to say that good progress has been made in many respects, much still remains to be done at both local and national level.  Nevertheless, I feel that the progress already made justifies a broader view of the objectives of game development and that the attraction of sportsmen from abroad can now be included in these objectives with resultant benefits, at both local and national levels.  In reconciling the legitimate claims of native sportsmen with the provision of attractive sporting facilities for tourists, some practical difficulties will doubtless arise; but I am convinced that no real conflict of interest exists and that, given goodwill and understanding all round, these difficulties can be resolved.</P>
    <P>The majority of the 24 regional game councils established to date are doing good practical work in a spirit of mutual understanding and co-operation of all local interests.  I trust that this example will provide a headline for the few remaining counties.  However, my repeated appeals for an end to faction and mutual suspicion in the sphere of game development planning on a national basis have not so far <Col N="963" /> been as fruitful as I wish.</P>
    <P>Having explained in some detail the major items of the Lands Estimate, I feel that the few remaining items&mdash; which are either unchanged from last year or else merely token provisions&mdash; do not call for any specific comment by me.  However, should Deputies wish to obtain further information or clarification as regards any of them, I shall be glad to furnish it when I am replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>As the House has been afforded&mdash; and will continue for some time to have&mdash;ample scope for discussion of various aspects of the Land Commission's operations, I feel that the customary detailed account of these activities is not called for this year.  I propose, therefore, to confine myself to a very brief summary of the main results for the year ended 31st March last.</P>
    <P>On the acquisition side, the total area inspected exceeded 102,000 acres, while the area for which compulsory proceedings or voluntary negotiations were instituted was approximately 55,000 acres.  An aggregate area of some 36,800 acres was taken over by the Land Commission for division and at 31st March last the total area in the machine was in the region of 69,000 acres.  As regards land distribution, a total area of over 34,000 acres was divided amongst some 1,650 allottees, including the provision of 95 fully-equipped new holdings for migrants and the rearrangement of some 430 fragmented holdings.  In all, 158 new dwelling-houses and 261 new out-offices were provided for tenants and allottees during the year.  A total of about 3,600 holdings, parcels and rights of turbary was revested in tenant purchasers and allottees in the course of the year.  The collection of land annuities continues satisfactory: out of a collectable total of £2,686,952 for the year, the amount actually collected at 31st March, 1964, was £2,557,122.</P>
    <P>I regard the results which I have just outlined as very satisfactory, particularly in the sphere of acquisition which will ensure continued progress in <Col N="964" /> land settlement in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Forestry Vote, Deputies will note that the Grant-in-Aid for the Acquisition of Land, subhead C.1, shows a decrease of £200,000. The only significant variations in other expenditure subheads are increases as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The decrease in the gross Estimate is £55,600.  The Estimate provision for Appropriations-in-Aid, subhead H, is up by £106,000 leaving the net Estimate lower by £161,600 than in 1963-64.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal first with a new subhead G&mdash;John Fitzgerald Kennedy Memorial Park.  Shortly after the tragic death of the former President of the United States of America, a group of Irish-American Organisations came together to establish a fund to finance a fitting memorial to the late John Fitzgerald Kennedy in the land of his ancestors. It was decided that this would take the form of a Memorial Park incorporating an Arboretum and Forest Garden.  The American group aimed at a target of 100,000 dollars and have already donated 50,000 dollars as a first instalment.  The Government have indicated, on behalf of the Irish people, their willingness to meet the cost of the project in so far as it exceeds the American contribution.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to provide the money necessary for the project in the Forestry Vote and provision of £50,000 has been made in respect of the current year.  Receipts from the American societies are being treated as Exchequer extra receipts and will not, therefore, be offset against expenditure in the Forestry Vote.</P>
    <P>Apart from our natural desire to support the American project to honour <Col N="965" /> the late President, there has long been need for a full-scale arboretum, as now envisaged, in this country. This is a project that it would have been necessary to undertake sooner or later and the action of the American societies has provided the impetus.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that Deputies on both sides of the House will join with me in welcoming the initiative which resulted in this arboreal tribute and will support the decision of the Government that the State would financially underwrite the success of the project.</P>
    <P>Subhead A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;shows an increase of £24,840 on the provision for 1963-64. The rise in requirements is due mainly to increase in forester staff, together with the usual allowances for incremental expenses.  The Estimate was framed prior to the agreement on the ninth round of pay increases and does not, therefore, provide for these increases.</P>
    <P>Subhead B1&mdash;Travelling and Incidental expenses&mdash;are £9,450 higher than the provision for 1963-64.  The entire increase is attributable to increased travelling and subsistence costs arising from the steady expansion of the area of the State forests and the resulting increase in field staff requirements.</P>
    <P>Subhead B2 is a new subhead providing exclusively for Post Office services. The direct provision for such services in 1963/64 was £5,900 which was included with incidental expenses. There is, therefore, an increase of £24,300 in the provision for these services in the current year.  Of this increase, however, £22,900 is in respect of services formerly provided without repayment by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>Subhead F&mdash;Agency, Advisory and Special Services&mdash;shows an increase of £12,820 over the amount provided for 1963-64.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Estimate for 1963-64, I informed the House that subsequent to the framing of that Estimate, my Department had formalised arrangements with the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards <Col N="966" /> for the initiation of a programme of testing of Irish grown timber in the Institute's laboratories and that the costs for 1963-64 would be met by savings on other subheads of the Vote. In the current year's Estimate, specific provision is being made for the first time for this programme which is designed primarily to establish the mechanical properties of the tree species grown on a considerable scale in Ireland, and which will provide data of great use both in the development of markets for our future produce and in the settlement of forest management policies.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.1&mdash;Acquisition of Land &mdash;is down by £200,000 but this does not indicate any curtailment in the land acquisition programme.  The balance in the Grant-in-Aid fund on 31st March, 1964, was £264,900, so that a total of £384,900 will be available for land purchase within the year.  The incoming balance was inflated because proceedings had not concluded for two large areas for which provision had been made in the 1963-64 Estimate.</P>
    <P>The total area acquired for State forestry purposes in 1963-64 was 29,634 acres, of which about 26,000 acres were plantable.  The area was acquired in 588 separate transactions &mdash;an average of 44 acres per acquisition, which is about the same as in 1962-63.</P>
    <P>The effective plantable reserve at the end of 1963-64 was about 55,000 acres.  While this represents an increase of some 3,000 acres on the reserve at the end of 1962-63, it is still insufficient and continues to give rise to management problems.  Without an adequate reserve of land the programme of planting cannot be allocated on as wide a basis as is desirable.  Consequently, stabilisation of employment is difficult and, with heavy concentrations of young plantations in some forests, the fire hazard is increased.</P>
    <P>Further progress was made during 1963/64 in the advancement of land acquisition cases being handled under the Forestry Act, 1956.  Proceedings were brought to a successful <Col N="967" /> conclusion in four such cases involving an area of 422 acres.  It is of interest to note that of 425 such cases on hand on 31st March, 1964, 2,984 interests were involved.  This is indicative of how troublesome and time-consuming such acquisitions tend to be.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficulties arising from the small average area of normal transactions and of the diversification of interests in commonage cases to which I have referred, my Department is pressing forward with all possible speed in its acquisition programme and the total availability of almost £385,000 for this year is an earnest of the Government's intention that the programme will not suffer through lack of funds.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2,709,000 is being provided for subhead C.2&mdash;Forest Development and Management.  This is an increase of £21,350 on the provision for 1963/64.  Provision for labour represents, as usual, the major, part of the subhead.  A total of £2,101,000 is being provided for labour.  This is an increase of £20,500 on the provision for 1963-64.  I wish to draw the attention of Deputies to the fact that the figure of £2,101,000 provided for labour does not include any provision in respect of the ninth round increase in basic pay.</P>
    <P>Neither does it allow for the effect on operational costs of a pending reduction of the working hours of forestry labourers to 45 hours per week all the year round, whereas a 48 hour week was hitherto worked in Summer. Present indications are that the cost of the ninth round and of the reduction in working hours will make a Supplementary Estimate inevitable.</P>
    <P>The provision for State forest nurseries at £226,000 is £11,500 greater than the estimate for 1963/64 and slightly less than the actual outturn of £226,393.</P>
    <P>The provision for the establishment of plantations at £650,500 compares with a provision of £675,000 for 1963-64 and an actual outturn of £655,583.</P>
    <P>The planting programme for 1963/64 totalled 25,940 acres and included 694 <Col N="968" /> acres on State forest lands from which marketable crops had been removed. Planting was carried out on a further 930 acres of land, on which existing crops had been destroyed by fire.</P>
    <P>By the end of 1963/64 the total planted area held by my Department had increased to 405,476 acres.</P>
    <P>A further 25,000 acres are scheduled for planting this year.  Planting will be as widely dispersed throughout the country as the level of land reserves held in the various areas allows.  The western counties will continue to occupy a predominant place with a programme of almost 10,000 acres, 40 per cent of the entire national programme. Forestry development provides work for some 2,000, with a wage bill of over £800,000, in the western counties.  There can be no doubt that opportunities for employment will continue to expand in these counties as land acquisition is accelerated and as crops planted in recent years reach productive stages of growth.</P>
    <P>The provision for New Roads and Buildings&mdash;Head 3&mdash;is £488,500 compared with a provision of £450,750 in 1963-64 and an outturn of £438,406.</P>
    <P>Some increase in road construction, over last year's figure of 191 miles completed, is expected and it is hoped to expedite the construction of official residences for forester staff.</P>
    <P>A sum of £960,000 is being provided under Head 4 &mdash; General Forest Management &mdash; against £958,000 last year.  Expenditure was £896,028 in 1963-64.  There was a considerable reduction in the cost of grass cleaning during the year.</P>
    <P>This head of subhead C.2, representing over one-third of the subhead, bears the cost of maintenance and protection in the State plantations.  The extension of the State forest by some 25,000 acres per annum must inevitably increase the work of management and maintenance, including the cleaning of young plantations, repair of fences, drains and forest roads, pruning, fireline construction and so on.  It is in anticipation that the savings achieved last year can be repeated in part in 1964-65, that the provision for forest management is being repeated <Col N="969" /> at approximately the figure provided for that year.</P>
    <P>The provision for Head 5&mdash;Timber Conversion&mdash;is £118,500.  Provision for 1963-64 was £110,500 and actual outturn £113,649.  £106,500 of the provision is in respect of labour.  As the great bulk of forest produce is now sold standing, direct employment by the Forestry Division represents only a fraction of the total employment provided in felling and extraction.</P>
    <P>Head (6) &mdash; Mechanical Equipment for Forest Development and Management&mdash;at £265,500 shows little change from last year's provision of £278,900.</P>
    <P>A total of £2,101,000 is being provided in respect of Forest labour in 1964-65, against £2,098,000 in 1963-64. Actual outturn was £2,033,256, so that the provision for 1964-65 is almost £65,000 in excess of the actual 1963-64 expenditure.</P>
    <P>The average weekly number of men in direct employment of my Department during 1963-64 was 4,773, against 4,663 during 1962-63.</P>
    <P>Employment in 1964-65 is expected to average about 5,000 and I have already alluded to the probable need for a Supplementary Estimate to meet a wage-rise and reduction in working hours.</P>
    <P>The provision for subhead D&mdash; Grants for Afforestation purposes&mdash;is the same as the figure for 1963-64 although actual expenditure in 1963-64 amounted to only £10,870.  During that year, first instalments of grants were sanctioned in respect of newly-established plantations totalling 1,195 acres, a drop of over 1,000 acres on the previous year, the decrease being presumably associated with the very unfavourable weather in the winter of 1962-63.</P>
    <P>The Department has continued its efforts to promote increased private planting during the past year.  The Planting Grant Scheme was extensively advertised and lectures on tree planting were given at 23 centres during the planting season. The Department also co-operated with &ldquo;Trees for Ireland&rdquo; during the planting season just closed by providing a substantial <Col N="970" /> subsidy in respect of each of a series of one acre demonstration plots which the organisation had planted throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There are no significant changes in the provision for Sawmilling (Subhead C.3) and Forestry Education (Subhead E).</P>
    <P>The total provision for receipts under Subhead H&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;at £684,000 is £106,000 more than the provision for 1963-64.  Actual receipts for the latter year were £704,709&mdash;a record&mdash;so that we are, in fact, budgeting for some £20,000 less in the current year.</P>
    <P>1963-64 receipts for Sales of Timber were very buoyant and it is in anticipation of continued buoyancy in the timber and pulpwood market that the provision for the current year was framed.</P>
    <P>Last year's receipts of £647,349 for timber sales were the highest ever achieved by my Department.  The total volume of material sold from State Forests in 1963-64 was about 6¾ million cubic feet of which about 2 million cubic feet was in the larger sizes that is of 8&rdquo; quarter girth and upwards.</P>
    <P>Revenue from Rents and Miscellaneous Receipts is expected to be on the same scale as for the past few years.  An increase of about £5,000 is expected in Sawmill Receipts.</P>
    <P>Over £20 million have now been invested in Irish State Forests and the present value of the investment is of the order of £45 million.</P>
    <P>The greatest danger to our forests is fire.  Last year almost 300 fires occurred in the vicinity of State forests. Watchfulness and hard work by forest staff, gardaí and voluntary workers prevented all but 10 per cent of these fires reaching State forests, but nonetheless over 130 acres of State plantations were destroyed.  Every week news of further fires is being received. The protection of the State forest is the business of the entire community and I would close with an appeal for greater care by the public in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probable that there will not be the usual lengthy debate on this Estimate this year <Col N="971" /> because of the very great detail in which the Land Bill, 1963, was so closely examined.  The debate on that Bill is likely to continue for some time.</P>
      <P>It is extremely regrettable that the Minister for Lands should avail of every possible opportunity outside this House to use his eloquence in endeavouring to discredit the Opposition and, indeed, other Parties, who have opinions to express in relation to land policy.  I want to assure the House that so far as we on this side of the House are concerned, it is very far from our intentions to obstruct or to offer destructive criticism.  We all realise that the Government have a great responsibility.  The Opposition have an equal responsibility.  When offering criticism of an Estimate or of the line of procedure adopted, we do so in order to make known our views as to what should be done.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands has not helped to relieve the problem of congestion, which is his primary responsibility, by the unreasonable and very cheap type of speech in which he has indulged in recent weeks outside the House.  We agree with the Minister when he says that it is the Government's duty to deal as effectively and efficiently as possible with the congestion problem but it is entirely wrong for him to say that there was an organised effort on the part of the Fine Gael Party, or, indeed, the Opposition in general, to obstruct his efforts in relation to this matter.  That is unreasonable, and I hope that when this Estimate is passed and until such time as we get an opportunity of resuming the debate on the Land Bill, 1963, the Minister will cease his practice of availing of every opportunity outside this House to say that his efforts are being deliberately obstructed.  That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I solemnly guarantee that to the Minister.  This Bill is given the same close examination by this Party as any other Bill presented by any other Minister.  We are as anxious as he is to assist in every way towards relieving congestion, but our policies for achieving it are different, particularly when <Col N="972" /> it comes to some of the objectionable sections of the Bill.  However, the least said about that until we have an opportunity of debating it, the better. I want to make this final reference to it.  We propose to examine the Land Bill line by line and word by word. That is the duty of an Opposition interested in good legislation.  We do that because it is our duty as an Opposition and not because we want to obstruct the Government.  If the Minister introduced legislation we felt we could co-operate with, we would gladly give that co-operation.  The Chair is aware that we are taking in conjunction with this Estimate the Land Bond Bill, 1964.  It is only a Bill of two sections listed in today's Order Paper. Here is an example of our anxiety to co-operate and show commonsense, unlike the Minister's attitude towards those with whom he disagrees.  We agree that this Bill is necessary and we are prepared to give it to him. Who is responsible for the Bill I do not know.  There appears to be some confusion. I thought the Minister for Finance said he was responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran) Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>He is, in fact, responsible for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, we are prepared to give all Stages of the Bill.  I hope the fact we are facilitating the Minister will deter him from making some of the foolish speeches he made recently.</P>
      <P>The Estimate is more or less a re-hash of what we have had in recent years. I note with interest that there is an increase in the amount required under subhead B2, Post Office Services. The amount required this year is £46,000 compared with £38,000 last year.  What is the position of a private industrial concern having to meet increased postage charges when we find one Government Department alone obliged to budget for an extra £8,000 this year?  That increase is very high.  It has been brought about because of the state of affairs the Government allowed to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reference whatever to the purchase of land by aliens.  I suppose the Minister did not think it <Col N="973" /> desirable that any reference should be made because he does not really believe there was or is a problem.  It was ignored in the Estimates this year and last year and there is not even a two line section in the Land Bill dealing with the matter.  I put it to the Minister that it has and is creating a problem. The public are alarmed at the extent to which land is being purchased by aliens, particularly when there is a vast number of uneconomic holders, well-prepared and financed to work land, but who cannot obtain it.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Minister and the Government in relation to this matter is to defend the purchase of land by aliens and, by their silence and inactivity, to encourage the purchase of land by aliens.  If I had my way I would prevent all aliens from purchasing land when we have such a congestion problem among our own people.  More than anybody else the Minister will admit that we have a serious problem of congestion.  Despite that, foreigners are purchasing large tracts of our agricultural land which should be used for the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the course of the Minister's speech to the preservation and development of game. Any action taken by his Department in this regard is worthy of every support. A vast amount remains to be done.  We have 24 active regional game councils doing excellent work. They deserve the continued support and good wishes of everybody interested in the preservation and development of game.  Nevertheless, more can be done.  I realise it takes time, patience, organisation and, indeed, money. I wonder whether the Minister has in mind any long-term policy in relation to the preservation and improvement of game, whether his Department are examining any legislation to set up a permanent game council and fix by statute certain areas where special improvement schemes would be carried out?  This matter has been neglected down the years.</P>
    <P>I also feel that we are not putting sufficient emphasis on the preservation and improvement of our game stocks. <Col N="974" /> There should be greater encouragement for hatcheries and, indeed, substantial grants should be made available, not only to regional game councils but also to enterprising individuals, many of whom have been in very close touch with the Minister's Department.  The equipment necessary for large-scale modern hatcheries is very expensive.  Private individuals are prepared to interest themselves in, and perform, what I consider to be a great national service. They are prepared to spend their own money on the development of these hatcheries, and I believe a generous measure of State aid in the form of grants should be made available to them.</P>
    <P>I am slightly disappointed in the Forestry Estimate because I expected that during the past year there would have been a greater effort by the Department to increase vastly the numbers employed in forestry.  Forestry is quite capable of giving employment to at least three times the number engaged in it at the moment.  We have something like 2,000 persons employed at present and there is evidence that in practically every part of the country, schemes of forestry development could be carried out.  There may be something in the policy of having forestry schemes and plantations convenient to the large-sized State forests, but never-the less there are many parts of the country in which the development of forestry should be examined.  Even ten to 25 men could be employed in those areas on the preparation of the ground and on drainage work.  Consideration should be given to the selection of the various plants suitable for growing in the different areas.</P>
    <P>May I say in relation to our programme of forestry that we have what can be described as the best foresters in the world? That tribute has been paid to them by world experts on afforestation.  The Minister, I am sure, will agree that no more highly qualified foresters can be found in the world than the men in charge of our State forests.  They deserve the gratitude of all who are interested in afforestation and forestry development. If the Department of Lands are to embark <Col N="975" /> upon an extensive long term plan for afforestation, they would be wise to make it clear to young men who are anxious to take up that profession that there is a future in it.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent&mdash;perhaps the Minister will enlighten us if it is convenient&mdash;there has been a response to the forestry training colleges. We have one of those training colleges in my constituency and there is excellent training to be had in it under probably the best management and the best supervision that can possibly be provided.  We can justly pay tribute to the supervision, the expert advice and the surroundings available to those trainees.  I often wonder whether our accommodation has been taxed to its fullest capacity.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a very good future in forestry, and the prospects for the future should be made known.  The Forestry Division and the Minister seem to be rather silent about that matter.  Why, I do not know.  Of all the countries in the world we hold out the greatest possibilities for forestry. When Bord na Móna have carried out schemes of bog development, large tracts of cutaway bog are left on their hands.  There should be a greater liaison between Bord na Móna and the Forestry Division.  I suggested before that a permanent committee should be set up by the Minister with representatives of his Department and Bord na Móna.  At the turn of the year when employment in Bord na Móna is running short, if there were dovetailing between the two bodies, the Forestry Division could give employment. There may be bog land and mountain land which Bord na Móna have surveyed and which does not come within their scope for development purposes.  That territory could be utilised by the Forestry Division, and employment could be provided on work which would beautify the country.  Nothing beautifies a country more than growing trees.</P>
    <P>I suggested last year, and I think, two years ago, that the Department of Lands should make an effort to give more publicity to forestry.  The Minister <Col N="976" /> has undoubtedly made a tour of our major forestry centres, but I venture to say that there are many Deputies, particularly those who represent areas in which there has not been full-scale forestry development, who would be astonished and amazed to see the beauty of the country, the beauty of the plantations, and the layout of the forests.  Efforts should be made to encourage people to visit those areas and see the wonderful developments that have taken place.</P>
    <P>I know that it can be dangerous to welcome visitors to State forests, and it is extremely regrettable that such an amount of damage has been caused by forest fires.  People are careless.  They do not seem to realise that one single match can be responsible for tens of thousands of pounds worth of damage. In addition, the beauty of the country can be ruined.  Publicity should be given to this matter; observations in this House, or five or ten minute talks on the radio are not sufficient.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Forestry Division notices are sufficient.  Usually the notices merely say &ldquo;Keep away&rdquo;, &ldquo;Do not light fires&rdquo; etc, at the entrance to a State forest.  I do not think we have sufficient notices convenient to all State forests and, in addition, these notices should be more spectacular.  The notices we have are rather like the old notices saying &ldquo;These lands are poisoned&rdquo; or &ldquo;No trespassing allowed&rdquo; The present form of notice has not proved effective and some thousands of pounds worth of damage has been caused through people's carelessness.</P>
    <P>How are we to impress on the people, more than we are doing, their duty not to light fires near a State forest?  It would be wise for the Forestry Division to have a fire prevention staff.  They may have one or two of their men out on Sunday afternoons in the summer to see that there are no fires but there is nothing to stop a person from lighting a fire, then kicking it out and the sparks being responsible for destroying tens of thousands of pounds worth of valuable work.  It is penny wise and pound foolish for the Department to curtail <Col N="977" /> staff of that kind because 20 times the amount given to one or two extra workers employed to do this work would be saved by preventing fires.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department should get down to examining this matter seriously because there has been too much carelessness and the losses have been too great.  That has been particularly noticeable in the past few years.  A team of workers will have to be devoted to this work permanently during the summer months and particularly to keep a careful watch at week-ends.  The Minister will find if he goes back over his statistics, that most of the fires take place on Wednesday or Thursday afternoon or on Sunday afternoon. Wednesdays and Thursdays are usually the half-days in the large provincial towns and are days on which people go out for picnics and to view the scenery.</P>
    <P>Every forester should have the right and the authority to see that his forest is protected.  All of us who have property like to protect it but we find the Department of Lands, for some reason or other, do not seem to be protecting their property in the manner in which they are expected to protect it.  The Minister feels he must economise and cut down but cutting down or economising on the safeguarding of forests against fire damage is penny wise and pound foolish.  We will always have careless people and it is necessary that there should be sufficient staff to prevent these fires.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal regarding the Kennedy Memorial Park.  I can assure the Minister that we on this side of the House will readily and wholeheartedly co-operate in this matter.  We are very glad that the Memorial Park has taken this form. The amount provided in the Estimate for that purpose is £50,000.  The Park will be a small contribution to the memory of, I suppose, the greatest man the modern world has known. For that reason, we hope this Memorial will be a fitting one to his memory and that so far as beauty and design are concerned, they will be firstrate, that only the best and most <Col N="978" /> expert advice will be availed of and that expense will not be spared so that the Memorial will be a credit not alone to this great statesman but to the country.  As time goes on and as the Minister realises what expenditure will be required, he will find when he comes to the House for the necessary money, he will be well received by us.</P>
    <P>There is still ample room for considerable improvement in regard to forestry workers.  Deputies who have State forests in their constituencies are familiar with the fact that this is definitely very skilled work.  Not every labouring man can undertake the very special type of work which a forestry worker must undertake.  I understand the question of a five-day week for forestry workers is still under consideration. In addition, there has been considerable delay in providing forestry workers with a comprehensive pension scheme.</P>
    <P>Forestry workers, because of the specialised work they do, should be provided with protective clothing to a greater extent than they are.  The present provision is niggardly and I say &ldquo;niggardly&rdquo; because I know what I am talking about.  They should also be given shelters in the forests in which to have their meals.  Neither do I agree with the system by which one or two pairs of boots are used by different workers on drainage work. That is wrong.  I do not know what the views of the Minister for Health would be in this regard, when one worker is asked to step out of boots and another worker is asked to step into the same pair.  I cannot understand why a State Department such as this cannot ensure an ample supply of protective clothing for its workers and an ample supply of the thigh boots required for the work that must be undertaken.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that workers should be asked to use their neighbours' boots and that there is not a sufficient number of boots available for the men engaged in drainage work.  I understand it is only for drainage work that such boots are required.  If there were proper planning, a certain number of men who specialise in <Col N="979" /> drainage work could be chosen and the boots provided for them and nobody else allowed to wear the boots except the workers to whom they have been supplied.  The other practice is unsatisfactory and unhealthy and one which ought to be discontinued. This House would have no objection to having funds made available so that our forestry workers would have the best possible protective clothing.  There is a great deal to be desired in that regard.</P>
    <P>The huts which can be seen near some of our State forests in which the forestry workers shelter in bad weather and in which they have their lunch or afternoon meal are no great credit to the Forestry Branch.  They should have seating accommodation and should be reasonably comfortable for the workers.  We have gone beyond the stage in this country when workers can be treated like animals.  It is time the Forestry Branch moved into line with outside concerns.  One can see the canteens and beautiful recreation rooms provided by some of our industrial concerns for their workers and the hovels set up for forestry workers where they sit down and have their meal.  I would ask the Minister to get some of his forestry inspectors to visit the State forests for the purpose of checking up on the facilities available for forestry workers convenient to these State forests.  A contented staff means a great deal.</P>
    <P>Nowadays when so many people in other walks of life are losing pride in their work, it is refreshing to notice the interest the forestry worker takes in his work.  Some of the old forestry workers who have now gone beyond their working years stand back near the State forests and take pride in what has been achieved.  They remember when there was not a twig there.  They can remember helping to drain the land and seeing the plants going down.  They remember participating in the thinning of the plants, and now they can see the beautiful trees they helped to plant.  Forestry workers take particular pride in their work.  Like the people on the land, they are very close to nature.  They <Col N="980" /> love looking at the trees growing, knowing they have taken an active part in their production.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say the great interest forestry workers take in their work is due in large measure to the amount of useful knowledge the State foresters have imparted to them.  A great tribute is due to the foresters for the advice and guidance they have given. That is in contrast to the great degree of covetousness to be seen in other trades and which results in the apprentices not being educated properly in the trade they are prepared to follow. The amount of knowledge imparted to the workers by the State foresters has been mainly responsible for the splendid advance taking place in most of our forests.  In order that that may continue, forestry workers ought to be given recognition over and above that given to any other section of workers. That is why I hope at some future date the Minister will concentrate on securing better facilities and a greater degree of co-operation from his Department for the benefit of those who have given their best years in this great national work of afforestation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would let us know about a comprehensive pension scheme for forestry workers.  Perhaps he would also let us know whether there have been any talks with Bord na Móna in relation to the planting of cutaway bogs.  There are many parts of the midlands in which very valuable local employment can be given.  It may be over a scattered area but with the transport facilities we have, the local State foresters would still be in a position to keep a close eye on a very small number of men three, four or six miles away from them.  Having regard to the fact that forestry workers have now become skilled at their job, they do not require to have the forester at their side always when they are carrying out their work.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take these few remarks in the spirit in which I make them.  I make them in the intimate knowledge that the constituency I have the honour to represent contains some of the finest and the most beautiful forests in Ireland.  An effort should be made to invite the <Col N="981" /> Press, including the British Press, if necessary, to look at these forests and to write them up in order to make it known that there is one thing of which we can boast, that is, the manner in which our country has been beautified by the State forests.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note the position in regard to the sale of native timber.  We heard some time ago that one of the master builders had commented that we had reached the stage at which Irish timber for constructional purposes could be ranked as being superior to the timber imported for these purposes.  That is a great tribute to the foresight of those who 30 or 40 years ago were responsible for the commencement of afforestation in Ireland. I pay a tribute to the members of the first Government of this State, the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, who realised the value of afforestation. The trees that have been grown and used since for building purposes are the very small plants that were put down by the first Cosgrave Government. The foresight and initiative of that Government have borne fruit and are likely to continue to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to detain the House any further on this matter.  I have no objection to letting the Estimate go through, for the simple reason that the unfinished Land Bill is available to us for debate on these matters. The debate on this Estimate this year is what I might describe as hampered by reason of the fact that there has been such lengthy debate on the Land Bill and that it is likely to continue. Good work has been undertaken in afforestation.  The money allocated to it has been well spent and is being well spent.</P>
    <P>The only faults I can find I have pointed out to the Minister already and I hope they will receive his favourable and sympathetic consideration. We are all anxious to get ahead with extensive new schemes of afforestation and I hope the Forestry Division will in the near future be able to give us long-term plans for increased employment under this heading.  Five thousand people employed in forestry in this country are too few.  In a new <Col N="982" /> energetic programme, I would expect that 10,000 men would find employment in the first stage, progressively increasing to 20,000.</P>
    <P>I recall that the Minister for Lands &mdash;I seem to remember that the present Minister for Transport and Power occupied the office at that time&mdash; promised to examine the possibilities of planting the Shannon Valley.  Perhaps the Minister would now tell us what progress has been made in that matter.  He did not refer to it either last year or this year.  As I say, it was the present Minister for Transport and Power who promised us to have a survey made of the Shannon Valley for afforestation purposes.</P>

I submit there is great scope for a comprehensive afforestation scheme in the Shannon Valley.  In the country generally, greater development, greater drive are needed in afforestation which can become such a great national asset, apart altogether from the potential employment content.</P>

      <P>The Estimate refers in more than one place to the 1963 Land Act.  I would remind the Minister, and through him, the Land Commission, that the Bill has not become an Act yet.  Apparently this is not realised or appreciated by some of the Land Commission inspectors because on at least three occasions in the past few weeks, I have been approached by people who have been told: &ldquo;Even if you get land from the Land Commission under the new Land Act, you will have to pay the full annuity and you would not be able to afford that.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>For goodness' sake, will those people have a little savvy and realise that until it is put through this House, passed by the Oireachtas and signed by the President, the Bill is not the law of the land? I was afraid something like that would happen and I expressed it during the debate on the Bill&mdash;that people would be frightened off because they lived in a certain area. I would accordingly ask Ministers to see to it that at least until the law is passed, those people do not use that argument.  Surely they have sufficient arguments to use against local people without that one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as land division is concerned, I had hoped there would be a sizeable increase in the amount of money allocated this year for the acquisition of land.  As we know, land values are rising and we must assume that higher allocations of money will be necessary to acquire more land.  If the Minister's ambition to take over much more of <Col N="984" /> the land which is not being used properly is to be realised, there must be bigger allocations of money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan referred briefly to the acquisition of land by aliens.  This has been discussed at length on the Land Bill, but may I again ask the Minister what machinery he is employing to prevent the second or third wave of alien acquisition which is now in progress? He knows from recent incidents how extremely difficult it is to get back land from aliens who have acquired it, for the purpose of division.</P>
    <P>I shall cite an instance in my constituency of which the Minister is aware and in respect of which questions have been asked in the House.  The reply to such questions is always the same: &ldquo;Negotiations are at a delicate stage and it is not in the public interest that such information should be made available here.  If the Deputy repeats the question in a few weeks, the necessary information will be forthcoming&rdquo;. That was months ago and I gave up asking questions on the subject.  Somebody went into the area, bought a farm but is not using it. Consequently, the employment has dropped from 40 temporary men at times and 20 regulars to two or three. I do not think the Minister is personally slipping but the onus is on him to see such farms are not allowed to go into the hands of people who will neither use them nor allow the Land Commission to get them.  These lands are simply being used as an investment by these people in the belief that if they buy a farm and leave it for a number of years, its value will grow so that they will be able to make a fat profit on it and it does not matter whether it is used or not.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to lands being taken over by the Land Commission, but one thing was not mentioned&mdash; perhaps because it is too delicate a subject&mdash;the manner in which the lands are used.  The Land Commission have been taking over farms&mdash;I think this cannot be repeated too often&mdash;and holding them year after year.  The Minister says, and we must take his word for it, that there is good reason for that, but how the Land Commission <Col N="985" /> or anybody can justify the taking over of a sizeable farm because the owner has been setting it for a number of years and its being then set by the Land Commission for four, five, six or seven years, is beyond me. It cannot be justified.  If the Land Commission decide to take over land, they should take it over in the shortest possible time.  I know there are legal complications, but when those are eliminated, there should be an effort to have it allocated as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I want to refer here also to the question of tree planting and to what happened in Boyne Valley when an estate was taken over there.  This was dealt with by way of question and the Minister told me that 498 mature trees on the Beauparc estate in Boyne Valley were sold for £800.  The purchaser was allowed to go in there and indiscriminately knock down some of the most beautiful trees in the country. If the trees of Boyne Valley are not worth 35/- or 36/- each standing up, we should give up planting trees.  This was an act of vandalism and the greatest complaint I have about it is that apparently it was done without consultation with any outside body or interest.  I asked the Minister for a guarantee that it would not recur, that other trees in the area would not be knocked down, and he could not give it.</P>
    <P>I am aware there was a meeting last week of local members of Muintir na Tíre at which an inspector attended and from what I am told, he was not prepared to listen to the local views.  I gather he had a host of smart answers. We do not like people with smart answers in County Meath.  We are very reasonable and we will discuss anything with those in authority who come there.  The only object of the local people was to point out to the Land Commission inspector&mdash;I do not know who he was&mdash;that it is not desirable to have this sort of thing happen.  I ask that the matter be dealt with as it should be dealt with and that there will be no more codology of this kind.</P>
    <P>The question of who gets land is <Col N="986" /> one which I have discussed again and again with the Minister by way of question and on the Estimates.  I am intrigued by one statement made in his opening remarks when he referred to displaced employees.  &ldquo;Displaced employees who are competent to work land,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are automatically considered for allotment.  Indeed, this is only right and proper.&rdquo;  How right the Minister is, but if that is laid down by him, why is it that so often such people do not get allotments?</P>
    <P>There was a very recent case which I brought to the Minister's attention of a man living on an estate for a long number of years in a house belonging to the estate.  He was approached by a Land Commission inspector who offered him something over £400 in return for vacant possession of the house.  The man with his wife and family were supposed to find housing accommodation for themselves and find a new job, just like that.  The Land Commission and the Minister must not be aware of money values if that is how they think. This was a man with a growing family.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted, and 20 Members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing out how this man, with a wife and growing family, was offered something over £400 for vacant possession of the lodge in which he was living and was told this was compensation for the loss of his job.  That is not the way people should be dealt with if we are to bear in mind the words of the Minister's statement I have quoted.  I agree with the Minister's point of view as quoted but it is entirely contrary to the action taken by the Land Commission in this particular case.  I gave the particulars to the Minister and I am sure he will have the matter investigated or perhaps he has had that done by now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a number of cases we find something extraordinary happening: the Land Commission make it known they are interested in an estate and the employer, that is, the owner of the <Col N="987" /> estate, reduces the number of the staff and knocks off all of them except those he can just struggle on with. When the Land Commission take over the estate, they claim they are responsible only for those who are left there and who are displaced as a result of their taking over the estate.  I suggest to the Minister that everybody who was employed by the estate, not alone those who are there when the Land Commission take over but who were there before that, are entitled to compensation. When I say compensation, I do not mean what is being offered to them at the present.</P>
    <P>The average compensation is so terribly small that I am sure nobody would suggest that it is any use at all for the people concerned.  Forty-five ex-employees were paid £9,532.  First of all, we are to assume that in the case of all the estates taken over last year, only 45 people were dispossessed, only 45 people lost their jobs.  I suggest to the Minister that a quick check will prove that that is entirely wrong. Secondly, the average amount of money paid in compensation was £212 each.  Let us assume that some people must have got very much less and that a few people must have got much more.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Minister to the action of the Department of Health who sanctioned for ex-employees of a hospital in County Wicklow which was closed the payment of sums of money amounting to more than £2,000 for loss of employment.  We must be realistic in this matter of compensation to people who have lost employment by reason of the taking over of estates by the Land Commission.  If the Land Commission for good reasons known to them decide they will not give farms to ex-employees of estates, then I believe the onus is on them to give decent compensation to them, not £212 which cannot be called decent compensation for anybody.  I suggest if the Minister has a look at that, he will agree with me that there is something very wrong.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the people who get land locally.  This cannot be said <Col N="988" /> too often.  While we all appreciate the difficulties of people living in congested districts, nevertheless we believe that people who are smallholders or who have a knowledge of the working of land are entitled to some land when the Land Commission are dividing farms in their area.  There is another thing, and one of the inspectors in my constituency has been doing this recently: no matter how small a farmer may be and no matter how hard a man may find it to live off that farm, when a farm is divided locally, that man is told: &ldquo;You are not a married man.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say if it is a fact that there are no unmarried men getting farms?  Will somebody tell the inspector he does not make the allocations of land and he does not make the regulations governing the allocations? His job is to seek out what farms there are and to report on them.  He should be stopped from making comments which tend only to irritate people.  I am not accusing the Minister of anything in this matter but I think these are things he should look into.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to look into the provision of access roads, fencing and drainage and the provision of water supply for domestic and stock requirements.  It is a common thing over the years to find that a pump was set up somewhere where it would be convenient for a group of farmers, but very often the pump did not last too long.  There was water there in the winter months but when it came along to September and October, there was no water.  There is another aspect of the matter.  We all know, unfortunately, a communal type of pump does not work too well in this country.  It is a cumbersome type of machinery and we have one case where one farmer has a pump on his land and he does not want anybody else to use it.</P>
    <P>Would it be possible for the Minister to ensure that where houses are being built there will be a water supply for each one of them?  There should be cooperation with the Department of Local Government to ensure that water schemes, even if they are group <Col N="989" /> schemes, are put into operation so that there will be an adequate water supply. As some of the farmers in his Party will tell him, there is nothing so useless as farmers not having an adequate supply of water.  We see all sorts of rows cropping up because somebody has not got an adequate supply of water and his neighbour has.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see that the Minister considers the introduction of the bonus incentive scheme for the Land Commission workers was satisfactory. May I also state at this stage that I am glad the Minister has used his good offices with the officials to have the 5day working week introduced as from 14th July next.  It is a step forward. The incentive bonus scheme not alone put £35,000 into the pockets of the workers but in addition, it has saved the Land Commission approximately £35,000 in the year.  The incentive bonus scheme was a good idea and I congratulate everybody associated with its introduction.</P>
    <P>Let me say, as far as I am concerned, personally, I get the greatest co-operation from the Establishment Officer and the officials of both the Forestry Division and the Land Commission. I am glad to say also that because of numerous rows by myself and others in this House, the system of replying to letters about recommendations for land has been altered. Some of us were not getting replies for months and eventually when we got a reply, it was a stereotyped thing which did not mean very much to anybody. I am glad to say that system has been changed and that we are now getting replies in a reasonable time.  We are also getting replies which make sense.</P>
    <P>This is a step forward.  It may be additional trouble to the officials concerned. I am quite aware that may be so but I believe a public representative when looking for information is entitled to an intelligent reply.  I am glad to see that the decision has been taken to give that reply and to give it in good time. I am grateful to the Minister if he has taken a hand in having that done.</P>
    <P>There is another thing about the Land Commission which I should like to mention.  I would ask the Minister if <Col N="990" /> he has the details available to give them to me and it will save me putting down a question.  There is an estate in County Meath called the Wooton estate, The Ward.  There have been all sorts of charges made about the allocation of the land.  Would the Minister be able to say if a scheme has been drawn up and, if so, what type of scheme has been introduced on that farm? As the Minister may have heard, there are allegations that someone with influence has got 150 acres because of the fact that he had pull in the Department. I do not believe that, but I should be glad if the Minister would deny it publicly because it is doing no good to him, the Land Commission or to anybody in public life.</P>
    <P>We all agree with the John F. Kennedy Memorial Park.  It appears some money will be required from the State for the purpose of completing the Park, but it may not be very big, as suggested here.  Even if it is, nobody will quarrel with the idea, and this Party will give it full support.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister says that :</P>
    <P>subhead C.1&mdash;Acquisition of Land&mdash; is down by £200,000 but this does not indicate any curtailment in the land acquisition programme.  The balance in the Grant-in-Aid fund on 31st March, 1964, was £264,900, so that a total of £384,900 will be available for land purchase within the year.  The incoming balance was inflated because proceedings had not concluded for two large areas for which provision had been made in the 1963-64 Estimate.</P>
    <P>I was wondering what had happened. I am glad this is the explanation and that there will be no reduction in the amount of money available for the acquisition of land.</P>
    <P>In regard to State forests, I should like to say there seems to be a turn for the better in everything connected with forestry over the past few years. I am interested in the suggestion made by the trade unions on more than one occasion that a pension scheme should be introduced for forestry workers.  We have now reached the stage at which the only type of rural worker employed by State or semi-State bodies, <Col N="991" /> who has not a pension scheme, is the forestry worker.  Many of them should qualify for a pension after very long service, and I would ask the Minister to give his attention to the matter in order to do what he can for them.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the use of rubber boots.  Perhaps Deputy O.J. Flanagan has more up-to-date information than I have.  The trade unions have objected, on medical grounds, to the use of rubber boots by more than one person in rotation. We have always insisted that the boots, once used, should not be used by another person.  A perfectly clean, healthy person may have worn a pair of boots but then if they are passed on to somebody else, it is common knowledge that there is a grave danger of dermatitis being contracted. This is the medical advice given over a number of years.  It was understood that the Forestry Division had accepted similar advice and had stopped the wearing of a pair of boots by more than one person.  I am surprised that this practice appears to continue, and I should like to ask the Minister to see that it will be stamped out, if, in fact, Deputy O.J. Flanagan is correct in what he says.</P>
    <P>According to my information, the number of forestry workers rose to approximately 4,700 during the last year.  I understand the figure will increase to over 5,000 this year.  The fact that over 2,000 of these workers are employed west of the Shannon is not surprising because there is substantial land available for forestry purposes there.  From time to time complaints arise, but, as I said earlier, a very good feeling exists between the trade unions and the Establishment Section and most of these complaints are straightened out before reaching the Minister.  In fact, foresters in practically every case seem to be prepared to perform their job in a reasonable way.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that so much damage is still being done by forest fires.  Perhaps the general public will in time become educated in the danger of allowing any fire near a State forest, or any type of forest.  It would be a good <Col N="992" /> thing if we reached the stage where no damage will be done.  These fires double losses as they damage the growing timber and this means the whole forest has to be replanted.  Perhaps the Minister would say whether there is insurance cover against loss of this sort.  To put it plainly, it would be too bad if the loss is a dead loss. I think some attempt should be made to try to insure against losses through fires, and other types of vandalism, whether intentional or not.</P>
    <P>During the period of the last inter-Party Government, a decision was taken that timber would be sold standing instead of sold when the forestry workers cut it down.  I quarrelled with this decision at the time, and I still think it is not a good idea.  The Minister is well aware that from time to time when people buy timber in a forest, they are interested in getting it out as quickly and as easily as they can.  A lot of damage is being done to the standing timber by people who go in and, in getting their own timber down, do not mind what happens to the standing timber. Of course, people engaged in this work are paid very poor rates.  The Minister has nothing to do with that particular aspect of it but it is a pity that the decision to change over was ever taken.</P>
    <P>One of the matters mentioned here is the question of sawmills.  I have not been able to get entire agreement with the Forestry Division on the question of wage rates in State sawmills. The Minister is aware that the sawmills are in an area where other mills are run by private concerns.  I believe the rates should at least be as much as those paid in private concerns. I think there is nothing unreasonable in asking that this matter should be looked into.</P>
    <P>On the question of postage, perhaps I have misread the Minister's document, or perhaps Deputy O.J. Flanagan misread it.  My reading of it is:</P>
    <P>Subhead B.2, is a subhead providing exclusively for Post Office services.  The direct provision for such services in 1963/64 was £5,900 which was included with incidental expenses.  There is, therefore, an increase of £24,300 in the provision <Col N="993" /> for these services in the current year. Of this increase, however, £22,900 is in respect of services formerly provided without repayment by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>This, in fact, means there is not such a big increase.  The estate paying for it means that, in fact, it is changed from one Department to another.  Therefore, the increase is not of the amount suggested by Deputy O. J. Flanagan.</P>
    <P>We have not made provision in this Estimate for the 45-hour week, or any reduction which may occur, or any increase which may result because of the ninth round.  Am I to assume that we have made provision for the increase in postal charges?  They will increase by roughly one-fourth.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate whether he has information on this.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying that the information given by the Minister, even though put in an abridged form, has covered a wide field.  The discussions which took place on the Land Bill earlier have reduced the amount of material which could usefully be used in this debate.  I believe that money spent by the Land Commission and on the provision of State forests is money well spent.  We shall not quarrel with it.  I believe the new Bill for the provision of additional money for land bonds is a step in the right direction. This had to come because of the falling value of money and the extension of services, and we give it our full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I welcome the introduction of this Estimate and congratulate the Minister on the very interesting document which he produced this morning.  As regards resettlement of people on the land, I should like to compliment the Minister's Department for the wonderful work they have achieved in my constituency in the past few years in the resettlement of people on the land.  The amount of land in the west is very limited and with little fields here and there mixed up with one another, it is very difficult to reach agreement with the owners.  However, I wish to compliment the Minister on <Col N="994" /> the great work done in the past few years but I should like more people to be taken out as migrants so that the land they leave, such as it is, can be distributed amongst the people who remain.</P>
      <P>There is one point on which I feel very strongly.  Where there is resettlement in different townlands, the position is that any person transferred for resettlement will get a new house.  We all know that no matter what part of the country you go to, you will come up against the case of the individual with the large family and in poor circumstances who cannot avail of the grant to build that new house.  In cases of hardship such as that, the Department should build the house.  I know of a few of these hardship cases that are at present awaiting decision by the Department and the decision should be that the Department will build the house.  Some of these people have families of ten or 12 and they could not afford to embark on the building of a new house.  In these cases the Department should build the house.</P>
      <P>We welcome the improvement in forestry as a whole and we cannot stress too often the danger of forest fires.  If you light a match in any forest in the west of Ireland, the fire could travel 15, 20 or 30 miles without stopping.  More notices should be erected, especially if the forest is near a main road.  These forests cannot be signposted sufficiently.  Foresters generally leave a belt of about eight feet around a forest.  To my mind, that is not enough to prevent a fire getting into a forest and destroying the whole place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where areas are offered to the Department for afforestation, there is sometimes considerable delay before the Department investigates.  Then the people offering the area may get a reply that the land is unsuitable for planting, that the soil is either too poor or that the bog is too deep.  I wonder if there is any kind of tree that could be grown on such soil and if the Department have tried to test trees that would grow there or that would form a shelter belt. My information is that bamboo will grow in a bog, no matter how deep it is and I believe bamboo is very <Col N="995" /> valuable.  The Department should investigate that matter.  If bamboo can be grown, it should be grown as it would overcome some of the difficulties that face us.</P>
    <P>Where land is offered for afforestation and is found unsuitable because the bog is too deep to grow trees, I wonder if the Department have ever thought of turning it over to a number of tenants who may be crying out for turbary rights and making arrangements with those tenants to cut it to a certain depth.  The Department could get the tenants to cut the bog for five, six or eight feet and leave the rest there. The Department could then come along in four, five or even 15 years time and plant what is left.  A bog 12 or 14 feet deep could be cut for seven or eight feet down and it could then be replanted some years afterwards.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned at the moment that some of my constituents are still awaiting turbary rights.  If there are areas such as those I have just mentioned, they could be handed over to these tenants who could use them over a number of years and then they could be replanted.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the making of roads into turbary plots. The Department should get these roads made as soon as possible.  There is little use in giving a person a turbary plot a quarter of a mile from the road. He cannot take a tractor in and the only thing he can do is to carry out the turf on his back.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying to the Minister that where there is rearrangement in any townland and where there are hardship cases such as I have mentioned, a woman whose husband has died leaving her a family of eight or nine children, the Department should consider building a new house for such a person who could not undertake to do it herself.  I wish the Minister and his officers in the Department the best of luck in their programme of work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House very long but I should like to say to the Minister that I appreciate <Col N="996" /> the fact that when I came in here this morning, there was a copy of his brief available to members of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  I want to thank him and the officers of his Department for that.  I have not much to say on this Estimate except to deal with the matter of forests and forest fires.  I join with Deputy Geoghegan and Deputy Cunningham in urging that more and bigger notices should be erected around forests, warning people of the danger of fires.  I would also suggest that the notice should indicate the location of the nearest telephone and the nearest forest ranger or fire station.  The forests are coming on in recent years and they are beautiful.  I had the experience of seeing where there was a forest fire last year.  It left a scene of desolation and was a blot on the landscape in addition to being a loss to the nation.  The Forestry Commission are doing great work in planting these forests.  That would be a way, possibly, to ensure that a forest fire could not spread.</P>
      <P>I shall not go over all the details already covered by Deputy O.J. Flanagan and Deputy Tully.  I should like to make a suggestion in regard to the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Memorial Park.  Any Irishman must discuss a matter such as this with deep regret and great sorrow.  We gladly give whatever money the Minister wants for this purpose with the greatest of sentiment.  I have no doubt the Forestry Commission will do a magnificent job in the landscaping of this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the late President John Fitzgerald Kennedy addressed the Oireachtas, he mentioned the Battle of Fredericksburg and our countrymen going into action that day behind their General Thomas Francis Meagher and the fact that they plucked sprigs of green from a box hedge there and put them in their hats and pinned them on their flags.  I suggest that the Minister should write to the Battlefield Curator in Fredericksburg and also to the forestry authorities in the United States asking them to send some box cuttings from the field of Maryes' Heights in Fredericksburg.  They should be planted <Col N="997" /> in a special place in the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Memorial Park.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we are obstructing his Land Bill but we do not obstruct when he is reasonable.  If he wants his Land Bill to go through this House as quickly as this Estimate will go through, I suggest he look again at sections 11 and 12 under which the rights of landholders will be in jeopardy.  I would again thank the Minister for providing copies of his brief.  The Minister for Transport and Power should do likewise rather than to send over only one copy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to compliment the Minister on the short and precise way in which he presented his brief to us. The Department of Lands require much larger sums than are indicated in this Estimate to carry out the vast amount of work which still remains to be done.  Travelling around the country, one cannot but notice that it is a pity that very large sums are not channelled for the drainage of small streams and rivers which do so much damage to our land through flooding.  If that were done, a high acreage of land could be made fertile and would add to national productivity.</P>
      <P>In my county, vast sums were expended on two major rivers.  Nevertheless, four-fifths of the land damaged by water and some of which is totally under water, has not been touched by either of these schemes.  Furthermore, the very areas that are still under water, and probably will be for many years, are owned by the smallest and poorest of our holders. The Minister should take the drainage of land under his wing and try to get the necessary money for this purpose. A survey of the areas of land subject to flooding should be made by his Department and the money should be available for the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are on the eve of great things in this country and it is important that our farmers should be able to develop to the full the amount of land which they have.  Even in the very best of farms, there is always at least one-quarter or one-third affected by <Col N="998" /> rivers or streams at certain times of the year.  When animals have to traverse lands which are under water it becomes cut up and there is a consequent loss of grass and feeding material.  There is much room for development in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing a very good job of work particularly as regards his recent scheme for purchasing lands at market price.  We are making very good progress in County Kerry in that direction.  A large number of people there are seeking to extend their holding and others are seeking to get into new holdings.  We need much more land than is available in the county or outside it but I think the best opportunity offers itself within our county if extensive drainage is carried out.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department should also carry out a survey of lands held by old people who are not able to work them and who, in the ordinary way, would be very slow to hand over those holdings.  Contact should be made with them by the Minister's officers.  If he has not enough of them to carry out a survey and to make the necessary contacts, then certainly more staff should be recruited by his Department for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of holdings, good holdings, are held by elderly people who are not working them or making a serious attempt to work them.  This naturally has a deleterious effect on productivity and output generally from the point of view of our agricultural economy.  The situation is being dealt with, but to a limited extent only, and it would appear now that we have only a short few years in which to gear ourselves to get a footing in that last outside market which will be available to us, provided we have enough livestock to export, either on the hoof or processed.  The actual organisation to meet the situation is moving rather slowly and it is hindered to a great extent by the loss of feeding possibilities.</P>
    <P>Last Monday some of us visited some of the Foras Talúntais farms in Limerick and Mallow.  We saw a farm which was taken over about three or four years ago; it was then in a very <Col N="999" /> indifferent state and pretty well waterlogged. It is now able to feed an animal to an acre and a quarter.  If we could bring the bulk of our land&mdash;this is what we should be aiming at&mdash;up to that state of production, we should certainly increase national productivity many times above what it is at present.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the progress and advance made in the development of afforestation, particularly in my own county. Numbers of workers are engaged in afforestation.  I think that the takeover of the lands is, perhaps, somewhat slow.  Some method should be devised whereby lands offered would be taken over as quickly as possible, certainly quicker than they are taken over at the moment.  It sometimes takes as long as three or four years before the lands are taken over for afforestation.  I do not know the reason for the delay but it should be possible in this year of 1964 to speed up acquisition.  The Minister should take whatever powers are necessary to speed up acquisition of land offered for forestry purposes.  It is one of the best methods of providing work for people in backward areas, people who have very little means of making a livelihood otherwise, and who, in the past, had no option but the emigrant ship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the work carried out by the Minister and his Department, both in relation to the acquisition of land and activities in connection with afforestation. I am always gratified by the courtesy that I at all times receive from the Minister and his officials when I have occasion to approach them in connection with matters relevant to the Department of Lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it comes to the acquisition of land, there is to my mind a good bit of difficulty, difficulty which the Minister and his officials are trying to surmount. It is to their credit that they have made progress.  I should like to suggest that people who are displaced by acquisition, especially farm labourers living in the immediate vicinity of some of the larger estates, should get allotments.  As a country man, and knowing conditions as I do, <Col N="1000" /> I know that the farm labourer who has enough land to sustain a cow is in a much happier position from the point of view of rearing his family than is the man who may have a bigger pay packet but no land.  The man with the bit of land will always have new milk and butter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the division of land acquired, I am in full agreement with the system practised.  It is very clear that in the division of estates the object is to try to bring those who are adjacent to the estates up to an economic standard.  It is better to bring a few up to the economic standard than to give dribs and drabs to everyone. There will be at least one good job done if there are three or four uneconomic farmers rendered economic.</P>
    <P>I have nothing but praise for the afforestation work that is taking place. Some persons may hold the view that progress is not sufficiently fast, but, in my view, tremendous progress has been made over the years.  According to the copy of the Minister's speech which has been circulated, there is a provision of £20 million for acquisition of land for afforestation.  That is a good thing.  Our forests have become a great national asset and I join with others in expressing the view that all precautions possible should be taken by the officials of the Forestry Division and the general public to prevent devastating fires and where, unfortunately, fire breaks out to confine the damage to the smallest possible area.</P>
    <P>I have noticed along the mountainsides near where I live that the ground adjoining plantations is made fireproof by the removal of vegetation.  It would be no harm if that system were developed.  I do not know whether the forestry people do so or not but in my view it would be a very good thing to use a system of chemical spraying where vegetation has been removed to prevent regrowth.</P>
    <P>It is a gratifying feature of the Estimate that the amount to be spent on labour for the coming year will be of the order of £2,101,000.  I am also pleased that terms more closely related to those obtaining for county council road workers are being provided <Col N="1001" /> for foresty workers.  Forestry workers have a pretty tough life.  The majority of afforestation takes place in exposed districts where there is little or no shelter from the elements.  Forestry workers must brave the elements. They do very good work and they are entitled to the consideration that any worker is entitled to get.  The labourer is worthy of his hire.  He is also worthy of decent conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>I have noticed in my district lorries and trailers going long journeys hauling thinnings from some of the forests in the south.  I do not know whether the lorries belong to the Department or not.  On a few occasions I have seen in the town where I live a lorry and trailer loaded with nice handy timber parked overnight because the distance involved and the time taken in loading would make it impossible to make the return journey in one day. I regard that as a waste.  Factories should be established closer to the source of supply for the conversion of such timber.  It may be that it is impossible to avoid haulage of timber over long journeys.</P>
    <P>I hope that the co-operation which has always prevailed between forestry workers and the officials of the Department and the Minister himself will always remain at the high standard experienced in the past.  I wish the Minister, his officials and all concerned the best of luck in the work in which they are engaged.</P>

      <P>Níor mhaith liom an deis seo a ligint tharm gan focal molta agus cógháirdeachais a ghabháil leis an Aire agus leis na daoine atá ag cooibriú leis as ucht na hoibre atá á déanamh sa Roinn seo.  Tá a fhios agam gur obair an-thábhachtach ar fad í, go bhfuil a lán fadhbanna le réiteach agus go bhfuil na fadhbanna sin andheacair ar fad, go mór mhór na cinn a bhaineann le feabhas níos fearr a chur ar na feirmeacha ins an tír seo agus an deacracht atá ag an Aire níos mó talaimh a fháil chun na feirmeacha seo a mhéadú.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam gurab í an phríomh-dheacracht atá ann go bhfuil níos mó ná 60,000 feirmeoirí ann nach bhfuil a ndóthain talún aca.  Tá siad ag iarraidh feirmeacha níos fearr <Col N="1002" /> d'fháil.  Fiú amháin dá mbeadh na Sé Contaethe atá gearrtha amach ón chuid seo den tír istigh againn ar maidin agus gan daoine nó tithe leo bheadh againn an talamh go léir atá ag teastáil uainn chun an fadhb seo a réiteach.</P>
    <P>Tá an tAire ag déanamh sáriarracht chun cuid de na deacrachtaí seo a laghdú.  Tá stair na tíre fite fuaite tré thalamh na tíre agus is eol do gach duine a bhí ar scoil an scéal&mdash; teacht na stróinséirí agus díbirt mhuintir na hÉireann go dtí na portaigh, na sléibhte, na h-oileáin agus na h-áiteanna iargcúlta.  D'fhan na daoine ansin agus tá a fhios againn nach raibh na feirmeacha beaga nua a bhí acu ábalta iad a chothú agus go raibh saol cruaidh deacair acu leis na céadta bliain anuas.  Nuair tháinig ár Rialtas féin thosaigh siad ag déanamh iarracht chun an cheist sin a réiteach.  Le cúpla bliain anuas, bhí an Rialtas sásta níos mó airgid a chur ar fáil gach bliain chun iarracht a dhéanamh cuid de na daoine seo a thógaint amach as na h-áiteanna iargcúlta sin agus feirmeacha nua agus tithe nua a thúirt dóibh in áiteanna eile.  Is fíor a rá go bhfuil sé níos deacaire breis talaimh a fháil.  Tá luach an talaimh ag méadú anois.</P>
    <P>Rud eile, de bhrí go bhfuil innealra feirmeoireachta ar fáil anois tig le daoine saibhre breis oibre do dhéanamh gan líon a gcuid oibrithe a mhéadú dá réir.  Dá bhrí sin, tá sé deacair don Aire an fhadhb seo do réiteach.  Tá sé de chiall ionainn a thuiscint nach dtig leis an Aire é seo do dhéanamh i gceann míosa nó bliana.  Táimid sásta go bhfuil sé ag déanamh iarracht é sin do réiteach.</P>
    <P>Do throid muintir na hÉireann go fíochmhar fadó chun tailte agus talamh do chaomhnadh.  Uaireanta, is oth liom a rá, bhí daoine ann nach raibh sásta nuair a tháinig daoine ón iarthair agus gur tugadh feirmeacha dóibh in áiteanna eile sa tír.  Ní ceart é sin.  Ba cheart go mbeadh fáilte roimh na daoine sin.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil athrú déanta ag an Aire.  Anois nuair a dhíolann fear talamh leis an Roinn bíonn sé ábalta a chuid airgid féin a fháil.  Ní mar sin a bhí an scéal go <Col N="1003" /> dtí seo agus ar an ábhar sin bhí ar na daoine seo an talamh a dhíol le daoine eile.  Ní rabhadar sásta an talamh a dhíol leis an Roinn, agus ní fhéadfaí milleán a chur orthu.  Tá anáthas orm go bhfuil athrú scéil ann anois.</P>
    <P>Chítear dom go mbeidh airgead le fáil as seo amach ag feirmeoirí nó daoine go bhfuil taithí acu ar obair a bhaineann leis an talamh nó atá ag obair go dícheallach sa pharóiste agus nach bhfuil a ndóthain talaimh acu. Tá an Rialtas sásta airgead do thabhairt dóibh chun feirmeacha do cheannach.  Tá a fhios agam, nuair a rithfear an Bille seo go mbeidh athrú eile ann.  Maidir leis na sean daoine go bhfuil cúpla céad acra talún acu agus nach bhfuil sásta an talamh sin a dhíol, beidh scéim nua ann.  Tabharfar pinsean dóibh agus roinnfear an talamh ar dhaoine eile.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil eolas mór ag na feirmeoirí ar an scéim seo.  Sílim féin gur ceart fógraí do chur ins na páipéir áitiúla nó ar an radio nó ar TV.  Dá ndéanfadh oifigigh na Roinne an méid talaimh atá ann a liostáil dhéanfadh sé maitheas dúinn, nó b'fhéidir go mbéifí in ann an scéim do mhíniú. Nuair a chloiseann daoine an nuacht ó na comharsain b'fhéidir nach dtuigeann siad go bhfuil scéim den tsaghas sin ann.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an bhforaoiseacht agus scéim na gcrann i gcoitinne, sílim go bhfuil dul ar aghaidh íontach déanta. Tá i bhfad níos mó acraí fé chrainn anois ná mar a bhí le blianta anuas. Tá go leor airgid le fáil ach sílim go mbeidh sé níos deacaire an talamh d'fháil ins na blianta atá le teacht.  Tá a fhios agam fosta go bhfuil an praghas ag árdú.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil scéim nua deontas ag an Rialtas.  I gContae an Chabháin agus ins na contaethe eile tá na feirmeoirí ag cur crann.  Amach anso ní bheidh an talamh le fáil.  Sílim go bhfuil lucht na foraoiseachta ábalta socrú a dhéanamh leis na daoine atá ina gcónaí imeasc na sléibhte chun chrainn a chur i ndruileanna.  Deineann na teinte móra damáiste do na crainn agus don tír ar fad.</P>
    <P>Nuair a thagann cuairteoirí ba <Col N="1004" /> chóir do Bhord Fáilte cúpla líne a chur isteach ins na fógraí a chuireann siad amach ag innsint do na daoine sin go bhfuil muintir na hÉireann ag iarraidh na coillte a chosaint agus gur cóir dóibh bheith an-chúramach nuair a théann said amach agus gan teine a lasadh comhgarach do na coillte sin.</P>
    <P>Na feirmeoirí féin atá in a gcónaí comhgarach do na coillte tuigeann siad an baol atá ann agus tuigeann siad fosta gur comharsain mhaithe iad an Roinn Tailte, go dtugann na coillte fothain dona ba agus na caoirigh.  Ach anois agus arís lastar teine agus ba chóir go mbeadh deontas le n-íoc ag an Aire nó ag na h-oifigigh d'éinne a mhúchfadh teine nó a innseochadh do na gardaí nó do lucht foraoiseachta go raibh teine comhgarach don áit agus go raibh baol go rachfadh an áit ar fad tré theine.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin, tá dualgas ar gach duine atá ag obair ins na coillte aire a thabhairt.  Mholfainn don Aire, b'fhéidir, breis airgid a thabhairt dóibh má bhíonn a súile ar oscailt acu, fiú amháin nuair nach mbíonn siad ag obair, chun bheith cinnte nach mbeadh aon teine mhór againn ins na coillte.</P>
    <P>Measaim go bhfuil obair an-mhaith dhá déanamh ag an Aire.  Tá a fhios agam gur fear tuisceanach, stuamdha an Aire, go dtuigeann sé go maith na deacrachtaí atá ann maidir leis an ganntanas talún agus go bhfuil sé ag déanamh sár-dhíchill na deacrachtaí sin a réiteach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran) Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was inevitable that a great deal of the material relating to the land problem should have been discussed pretty fully on the sections of the Land Bill that were before the House for some time. Many of the matters that would normally be debated on this Estimate were debated then and indeed quite an amount of statistics were given by me in reply to some of the points made by Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on the Land Bill I dealt very extensively with the question of alien purchases.  The statistics which, let me reiterate, are there in the statutory register kept under the provisions of the 1961 Finance Act do not indicate any <Col N="1005" /> change from the position I indicated to the House in the debate on the Land Bill.  There is no great trend one way or the other and the position still is that these transactions comprise between 6,000 and 7,000 acres per annum.  That still is the picture and, as I indicated to the house before, if that picture changes or if the Government feel that any further steps are necessary to deal with any emergent problem, these steps will be taken.  The position does not create a problem from a national point of view and is not the problem from a national point of view that those exploiting the sensitivity of our people on this issue would have us believe.</P>
    <P>It is untrue to say that the new Land Bill has not some provisions that would be of assistance in dealing with this alien problem, should it get out of hand.  Deputy Tully stated he had no objection to aliens buying land, provided they gave good employment, but he did object to any person who bought land going away and leaving it in the hands of others.  So would I, and there is a section in the new Land Bill which provides that the Land Commission can use their new powers where an owner is not resident on or in the immediate vicinity of that land.  That is the section which could certainly effectively be used against the undesirable type of alien mentioned by Deputies,</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary for me today to devote very much more time to this question of alien purchase.  As the House is aware, some of the purchases by aliens are exempted from the 25 per cent stamp duty on the recommendation of two Commissioners of the Land Commission to the Revenue Commissioners.  I have given before the figures covering all types of transactions that have taken place, and the picture of the sale and purchase of agricultural land is about the same and is still within the same limits.  I notice that on this question of completely prohibiting purchases of land by aliens, Deputy Flanagan said he was expressing his own view.  I take that to be his personal view, because I could quote some of his colleagues&mdash; including Deputy Donegan on 22nd April, 1964, Deputy MacEoin, and <Col N="1006" /> other Fine Gael Deputies&mdash;who have taken an entirely different view from that of Deputy Flanagan on this issue.  It therefore appears to me that the Fine Gael Party as a whole are not of the opinion, as we are not, that the purchase of land by aliens presents any national problem, requiring any further special measures to deal with it than those we have already taken under existing law.  Time and again I have reiterated that should a different picture emerge, the Government will take steps to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Inevitably we had references to some sections of the Land Bill.  We will have another day to deal with that Bill.  Immediately the debate on this Estimate is over, I propose to move the Second Stage of, and the necessary money resolution in respect of, the Land Bond Bill.  In passing, I may say that as a result of Deputy Flanagan's efforts in his obstruction of the Land Bill, he has succeeded in compelling me to bring in this Land Bond Bill which provides for the creation of £10 million in land bonds to carry on the work of the Land Commission.  The present issues of land bonds are coming to an end and we would not have enough money to carry on with the ordinary programme of land acquisition by the Department, unless this Bill were passed.  There was a section dealing with the matter in the Land Bill but due to the long delay in the passage of that Bill through the House, it was clear to us that we could not have it before the adjournment.  Therefore it became necessary to introduce this two-section Bill to provide us with the necessary land bonds to continue with the programme of the Land Commission up to next October and, indeed, from then onwards.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice that while the amount mentioned in the Land Bill, 1963, for land bonds was £5 million, we have made that figure £10 million in the Bill.  That is an indication of what we consider will be the increased activities of the Land Commission in the acquisition of land when the new Land Bill becomes law.  There are some subheads in the Estimate which we are discussing which indicate that <Col N="1007" /> increase.  The Bill in itself creates a new ceiling of £10 million in land bonds for the purpose of land acquisition. It is introduced in the way I have described to implement what we believe will be the increased activity in land acquisition when the new Land Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>The fact remains as I have said outside &mdash; and, indeed, I have said nothing outside that I did not say here&mdash;that a tremendous amount of parliamentary time was taken up by Deputy Flanagan and his friends on section 12, which, in my view, is a completely non-controversial section. Repetitive speeches were made here time and again on that section, and the result has been that while all that was going on here in Dáil Éireann, hundreds of derelict farms throughout the length and breadth of the country, and farms the owners of which have been abroad for many years, have been sold in anticipation of the powers the Land Commission will have to acquire land under the new Bill.  There has been that move in the ownership of land.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot of talk about the few thousands of acres acquired by aliens which would not compare in any degree with the holdings that have changed hands in anticipation of the passage of the Bill.  The congests who are living in those areas are well aware, as I am well aware, of this movement in the sale of land in anticipation of the passage of the Bill and they will, no doubt, in due course fix the blame for that situation, and will consider the amount of unnecessary time that has been taken up in this House in giving the Land Commission the necessary powers to deal with the situation by the enactment of the new Land Bill.</P>
    <P>It is the height of absurdity for people to argue here that these powers should not be taken and, at the same time, talk about the relief of congestion. As I explained, and will continue to explain, these powers are necessary in this day and age if we are to make any impact on the hard core of congestion that is left in the country.  We will deal with those powers when the <Col N="1008" /> House re-assembles and meanwhile, I suppose, those people who are jumping the gun and getting rid of their lands before the Land Commission can acquire them will continue that practice.  However, the Land Commission will, in some cases at least, be able to reexamine those quick sales that have taken place of derelict farms of which the Land Commission had made preliminary inspections but, due to the present cumbersome machinery, were not in a position to have the necessary notice published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> before the lands were sold.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the training of foresters, Deputy Flanagan inquired as to whether my Department had difficulty in interesting our young people in this work.  Indeed, the contrary is the case. There is a tremendous interest in forestry and we now have 30 boys in Kinnity and 60 in Shelton Abbey. These young men are recruited through the Civil Service Commissioners for our service, and they are turned out from our schools, knowing that there is employment for them in the State forests.</P>
    <P>I am having another look at the position in our forestry schools and considering whether some form of recognition should be given to those trainees when they are qualified.  I am having another look generally at the educational side of our forestry training service.  When vacancies in our schools are advertised, the Civil Service Commissioners are in the happy position, I am glad to say, of getting a great number of applications and first-class material applying for entrance into the service.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that there is a very wide awareness of the forestry service as a career and a very wide interest displayed by young men who wish to devote their lives to the service.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies, including Deputy Dolan, referred to this question of forestry fires and the matter is causing me some concern.  I have already had an examination carried out and certain new proposals are being examined to try to deal with this hazard. Generally speaking, where fires have occurred, it is not mainly the fault of <Col N="1009" /> what we might call trippers for the day, as some Deputies appear to think. In many instances, the worst fires have been started by adjoining landowners burning heather on their land or starting fires on their land, without complying with the regulations, giving the necessary notices and so on.  That is not done deliberately but mainly through ignorance and, in particular, through not ascertaining what the effect can be, for instance, if there is a change of wind or an increase in wind velocity once they have started fires to rid themselves of whins or unwanted heather. It is in many cases like this that we find great damage being done.  Of course it should not be necessary for me to re-state that these people are committing an offence by starting the fire without giving the prescribed notice to the Garda.  If that were done, and if we could get them to appreciate the great danger, then we could substantially reduce the fire hazard.</P>
    <P>As I said, there are different proposals under examination at present in regard to what further steps should be taken to deal with the fire hazard and some of the proposals have been reiterated from time to time in this House by different Deputies.  I think it was Deputy Lynch who suggested there should be a number which anybody could telephone immediately a fire was spotted.  Another suggestion was that streams in forest areas should be banked up so that a water supply would be available.  I can assure the House that all these suggestions are being actively examined at present.  I will also have the suggestion about the inadequacy of fire notices in our forests examined. Deputy Tully wanted to know if we insure against forest fires and the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I do not know whether insurance companies would be likely to accept this hazard but at all events the practice has been that we do not carry insurance and must bear the loss if we have the misfortune to have a fire, large or small.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully's interpretation about the reference in the opening speech to Post Office services is correct.  The major portion of the charge included <Col N="1010" /> in this year's Estimate covers services in connection with the purchase by the Post Office Stores of machinery and equipment, wire fences and so on used in forestry work.  The cost of these services will not be affected by the change in the Post Office charge and has nothing to do with it.  In previous years, there was no direct charge for these services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also made some allegations against Land Commission inspectors in his area.  This is a practice which I deplore in this House, unless of course there is reason and unless some notice of the matter has been given.  It is unfair to attack people here who cannot defend themselves and, in particular, it is most unfair that an attack should be made on an individual inspector in the course of an Estimate for the Department without making that complaint to the head of the Department or to me. I am confident that most of these attacks on individual inspectors are ill-founded and exaggerated.</P>
    <P>People who know the work inspectors have to do appreciate that it is a very onerous and difficult job.  Indeed, as far as complaints about land division are concerned, we will always have them and I have often heard it said, and I believe it is true, that the only successful division of land is the one in respect of which no applicant is satisfied.  Otherwise, all kinds of allegations are made against inspectors and those responsible for the division scheme and the allocation of the land on one ground or another by disappointed applicants.  While I would not for a moment stand over any public servant who did not do his duty, at the same time, it is most unfair that allegations should be made against individual inspectors without being substantiated and without these men being given an opportunity at least to let me know their side of the story.</P>
    <P>In regard to re-arrangement cases, some Deputies, particularly Deputy Geoghegan, suggested that the Land Commission should build the houses for the applicants.  In these cases, a special grant is given by the Land Commission for the different types of <Col N="1011" /> houses which is much larger than the ordinary assistance provided by the State for other people.  I fear, however, that it would be impossible for the Land Commission to carry out the Deputy's suggestion.  It is one which I would be very much taken with, except for my personal experience as Minister for Lands in connection with our building programme.  We have had grave difficulty in completing houses for migrants because of difficulty in getting contractors and indeed we have had to take on direct labour ourselves and try to get these houses completed. There has been a break in our migration programme because we are not equipped to do this job and I fear it would be impossible for the Land Commission, however much they might desire it, to erect houses directly for people in re-arranged holdings.  It may be of some benefit, but I do not suppose it would cover all the types Deputy Geoghegan had in mind when he referred to the new house building provision whereby a local authority can erect a house for a man who has a £5 freehold, and let it to him at 7/6 a week until he becomes the owner.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that innovation will not cover all the types of case Deputy Geoghegan has in mind.  However, I am satisfied my Department are not geared to go into this business of house-building directly.  If it becomes necessary that such a scheme should be operated, my simple answer is that some other Department should become geared to do this job.  I do not know how local authorities propose to implement this new £5 housing scheme&mdash; I do not know what they are doing in the different areas.  No doubt local authorities, if they are to make progress with the relevant section of the Act, will have to start a building force of their own.  That is my personal view.  I know that we are not geared to do any more housing in a direct way than we are doing at the moment.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the allegations made, particularly by Deputy Tully, on the question of protective clothing. This matter has been raised in the <Col N="1012" /> House before, particularly the provision of boots for forestry workers. With all respect to Deputy Tully, and acknowledging my lack of expert knowledge of medical matters, I cannot accept from him that dermatitis can be contracted by a man wearing a pair of boots worn by another man. As far as I know from my experience in dealing with Workmen's Compensation Act cases, dermatitis is a disease brought on by some allergy.  In forestry work, perhaps the man would be allergic to some growth or pollen and contract dermatitis in that way.</P>
    <P>Cases of dermatitis are few and far between among our forestry workers. I do not accept that dermatitis is contracted by a man using another man's wellingtons.  Indeed if that were so, I should have got it a long time ago from wearing other fishermen's boots when fishing, which is quite a common practice in the sport.  I do not think the suggestion is serious that if a man wears a pair of wellingtons provided by the Department only once, the boots must be scrapped immediately.  That is not logical and I do not think it will be seriously contended.  As it has been raised, however, I shall make inquiries into it. When that matter was raised before, the information I received&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree it is unhygienic in these modern times for one worker to wear another's boots, particularly working boots?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Wellingtons are provided for forestry workers engaged in drainage operations.  Normally, like other workers, they should provide their own boots.  The quality of the boots also enters into it.  I do not know where this idea has come from that there is something terribly dangerous in a man wearing another man's boots. Forestry workers are supposed to have these boots only while engaged in drainage operations.  However, I can have the matter checked, but, as I have said, if this practice of exchange of boots is not unduly abused, I cannot see why there should be objection to it. Of course Deputies may have a different view on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1013" /> A complaint we have also had before is about the Boyne Valley and the cutting down of trees there.  I gave full details to the House, in reply to questions, about this some time ago. Those lands were taken over and were in the hands of the Land Commission only for a short time before being divided.  It seems illogical that the Land Commission should not cut down mature timber rather than make a present of it to the tenant, who would cut it down anyway.  Any man in possession was entitled to cut down trees and what the Land Commission did was to cut down trees from land which they knew was good land which should be put to agricultural uses. Therefore it should not have timber growing on it.  I do not see any reason why the Land Commission should not have taken the action they took in that instance.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to the work in progress under the Game Section of my Department.  I am glad we have been able to report such progress in this field but I warn Deputies who spoke on this matter that it is far too early to start thinking in terms of national game boards.  At the moment we are only scraping the surface in the matter of organising all our people in this connection.  I am sorry to say that there is some disunity among some of the bodies concerned.  Still, a great deal of progress is being made, county by county, through the development of regional game councils, in the matter of game protection.</P>
    <P>Good progress is also being made in the establishment of game farms, hatcheries, the introduction of new species, but there is a tremendous amount of work still to be done, including the examination of different types of heather so that the regional game councils can attack the other aspect of game-rearing&mdash;trying to improve conditions in local habitats.  I repeat that we have a long way to go in this field before we get the country fully game conscious and to the stage in which the work of a national game board would be effective.  I ask Deputies to give their full co-operation and help to the game councils throughout the <Col N="1014" /> country who are doing such fine work in this field.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor and some other Deputies referred to the necessity for drainage.  No doubt such need exists, but, by and large, it is a matter for which my Department is not particularly geared.  Drainage in different parts of the country, depending on the Arterial Drainage Act, has gone on with greater or lesser speed, according to the catchment area being dealt with. I can quite accept that in Deputy O'Connor's county, there is urgent need for this minor type of drainage. Where the Land Commission are doing a rearrangement scheme they do a limited amount of drainage, particularly in opening outfalls to main drains, but to do it on a larger scale would require the expert staff and equipment we now see employed by the Board of Works on drainage work. I shall have the Deputy's suggestion examined, but if it were to be carried out on a large scale, my Department would not be geared for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may have overlooked one point.  He was asked what roughly is the acreage of mature timber that we can take off our forestry lands each year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>We sold roughly £600,000 worth to date this year.  I think that was the biggest amount sold since the beginning of forestry here. A survey has been partially carried out to try to get a very accurate picture of what timber will become available from time to time.  So far as the intense afforestation that has taken place in the past seven or eight years is concerned, it is easy enough to estimate, but in the case of previous plantations and old woodland, it is not easy to know what amount will be mature in three, five or ten years' time. Material from the survey is in process of compilation and we will have it very shortly.</P>
      <P>There are other factors that affect this, such as very heavy storm damage, and in one particular year you will have much more timber being sold than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again on the land side, we have <Col N="1015" /> had a very good year.  I regard it as a very successful performance on the part of the Land Commission that they got an area of some 36,800 acres for division in the intake machine and that approximately 34,000 acres were, in fact, divided.  That is a pretty good record for this difficult work and those Deputies who say the Land Commission should not be landlords but should divide the lands as soon as possible are simply reiterating my personal view and the instructions Land Commission officials have got from me.</P>
    <P>The quicker the land is divided, the better for the Land Commission and its staff but Deputies familiar with the problem realise that in some cases it is very difficult for the Commission to achieve division because of the noncooperation of the people themselves where there is a rearrangement scheme.  Where such a scheme entails the surrender of part of his land by an individual so as to make a neighbour's holding more compact, one contrary man may hold up his neighbours and the Land Commission for years.  We have such cases and there is no answer to them, apart from compulsory rearrangement, which would not work, as everybody knows.  In such cases the Land Commission very often must leave these cases rest for the time being and consequently land acquired for that purpose is on hands and there is nothing they can do with it.</P>
    <P>In other cases, they get one holding in an area and they know that to make a reasonable job, they need another which they are watching and expect to acquire in the course of a year or two.  In these cases, it is necessary to wait and let the land because they have not sufficient raw material to produce any kind of a workable scheme.  Invariably, Deputies will find that it is in cases of that type that long delay has occurred, unless there is some particular local difficulty regarding a particular case.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat what I have said before: the Land Commission do not let land because of any income from it.  The longer it is on their hands, the greater its nuisance value to them and the greater the drain on their <Col N="1016" /> resources.  It is a popular misconception to think that the Land Commission are letting land so as to &ldquo;get their own&rdquo; out of it, as is said.  That is not so, because the amount of revenue derived from letting of land in comparison with the national picture of the expenses of the Land Commission is infinitesimal.  I agree entirely with Deputies who say land should be schemed out and divided as quickly as possible after acquisition. That is the instruction the Commission have from me and they must give me a special explanation if cases are pending for more than three years as to why there should be such delay.</P>
    <P>Finally, when the idea of the Kennedy Memorial Park was first mooted by societies in New York, they felt that a good form of memorial would be something connected with forestry in Ireland.  When I made the suggestion that we needed a national arboretum, those concerned agreed and adopted the idea because they felt that we would have a Memorial Park that people would visit, particularly Americans when they came here on holidays.  We were fortunate in having lands at Slieve Coillte near the area from which President Kennedy's ancestors came.  We, in the Forestry Section, have appreciated the need for an arboretum for many a day.  The Botanic Gardens are most unsuitable in area and location.  The fact that this occasion arose and that we have suitable land will make it possible suitably to honour the memory of the late great President of the United States. When we have to come to the House for further finance in this connection, I am sure the House will give it to us.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the American organisations concerned who have made such wonderful progress in this connection in such a short time. They set their target at 100,000 dollars and, as Deputies have seen, one of their officers came over here and gave me a cheque for 50,000 dollars, half the amount which they propose to raise.  He assured me that they will have no difficulty in reaching their target and we are proceeding with the planning of this work as quickly as we can.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> I will have the suggestions made by the various Deputies in this connection carefully examined.  We are making a study of what is happening elsewhere and we are fortunate in the soil and the climate in the area chosen.  We believe that most species of trees from any part of the world will grow there. There will also be an agricultural school, if there is sufficient land available in the area.  When we get this under way, I am quite sure that the national arboretum which overlooks Dunganstown, the birthplace of the forefathers of the Kennedy family, will prove a big attraction for our own people and for foreign visitors to our shores, particularly those from the United States of America.  I wish to thank the Deputies for the manner in which they have received this Estimate and for its speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>Deputies may recall that in my opening speech on the Second Reading of the Land Bill, 1963, I drew special attention to section 26, which provided authority for the creation of additional land bonds to a total of £5 million, and I mentioned that it was imperative that some such provision should be enacted if the land reform programme was not to be brought to an abrupt halt through lack of funds.  Existing supplies of bonds are now expected to run out in the Autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1018" /> As the Taoiseach has already stated in the House, it will not be possible to deal with the whole Land Bill in this session and so it has been decided to segregate the Land Bond provision and make a special one-section Bill of it.</P>
    <P>Since that decision was taken, however, I have given further consideration to the steady rise in the price of land and also to the very lively tempo of the Land Commission's current work in the field of land acquisition and I have come to the conclusion that £5 million is not an adequate increase in the financial supply.  Accordingly I now propose to provide for an increase of £10 million over all.  This should keep the Land Commission supplied for a reasonably long period during which I expect to see them make a very big impact on the remaining congestion in the country.</P>
    <P>Save for this change in the money limit and some textual adjustments this Bill follows precisely section 26 of the Land Bill which, of course, will be deleted when we reach it.</P>
    <P>Land bonds finance on a substantial scale is vital to our land reform programme. I trust, therefore, that the House will agree to the immediate passage of this Bill so that the Land Commission's planned acquisition target for the immediate future can be achieved and the completion of pending voluntary purchase dealings finalised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to confirm my understanding that while it purports to relate to the new issue of land bonds, it is not so much the matter of a new issue as the extension <Col N="1020" /> of the power of the Minister for Lands, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, to determine the type of bonds that will be issued from year to year.  The position has been that every year, at about Christmas or January, an order is made that bonds for the year then about to commence would be issued at the rate of X per cent.</P>
      <P>It has happened in the past, as we all know, that, largely because of what has come to be known as the Daltonian era of cheap money of the late forties, many people have bonds at as low as three per cent.  The existence of those bonds is a matter of considerable trouble and make for bad public relations for the Land Commission.  When people hear that they are to be paid in bonds, their minds go back to these three per cent bonds and the general talk that such bonds are never worth par.  The six per cent bonds are generally above par, depending on the amount of interest accrued.</P>
      <P>It would be desirable if in future issues of land bonds two things were borne in mind in so far as possible. First, it would be utterly impossible to have any goodwill for the Land Commission unless the rate of interest were so fixed that the value of the bonds was slightly over rather than slightly under par.  To endeavour to cheesepare on the rate of interest in that respect would do so much damage from the public relations point of view of the Land Commission that it would cost a great deal more than the slight saving in interest to overcome it.  Secondly, I want to make it clear to the Minister that it is essential, in relation to any issue of land bonds, that there should be a substantial amount of that particular issue in existence.  One of the troubles about some of the earlier issues of land bonds, since the emergency period I am talking about, is that there is so little in volume of the 3 per cent and 3½ per cent bonds in existence that there is never any market for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Government stockbroker's shop does not operate for land bonds.  So far as land bonds are concerned, the Government do not <Col N="1021" /> stand ready to make a market and to buy or sell land bonds in the same way as the Government stockbroker does stand ready to ensure that there is a permanent market in national loans.  I can see the reason for it.  I think it is something that we could, perhaps, hardly change, but, when we cannot change it that way, there is all the stronger obligation on us to ensure that the amount of any particular issue of land bonds is such as to mean that there will be a market, even if the rate of interest were so to vary that it would not be practicable to continue to pay six per cent, which is the present rate.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a method by which, if the national rate of interest on money was changed up or down, six per cent bonds would continue to be issued but at a premium or a discount, as the case may be, at a discount if the rate of interest rises above six per cent and at a premium if the rate of interest drops below that figure. If that were done, the six per cent bond issue would be of such a size as to be freely negotiable.  It is because, in the case of the smaller issues, there is so little outstanding and so little held that it is virtually impossible to sell them for a considerable period of time.</P>
    <P>I doubt if the Minister has to his hand&mdash;I certainly have not got it to my hand at the moment&mdash;the amount outstanding of each particular issue of land bonds.  There was, of course, a very heavy issue of the 4½ per cent bonds and those bonds were the issue for many years, up almost to the beginning of the emergency, I think, unless I am mistaken.  Subsequently there was a four per cent bond issue, in which I believe there is a substantial amount outstanding, enough to make a market.  With regard to the three per cent and the 3½ per cent, my recollection is that the amount issued was so small that there is virtually no Stock Exchange issue.</P>
    <P>If the amount of any issue is small, where an owner has been paid in bonds for his land, he is unable to cash them for a considerable time.  That, of course, is most unfair.  It operates not merely to be unfair on the individual but, in addition, it operates also as a <Col N="1022" /> tremendous deterrent to the Land Commission making any acquisition with goodwill.  I take it I am correct in thinking that the purchase price of land is paid in bonds only when there are acquisition proceedings or agreement for purchase.  When there is a purchase by auction the position is that it is a cash purchase.  I have sometimes wondered, when I have come across cases in which the Land Commission do not appear to have been anxious to buy at the auction but have come along immediately afterwards and tried to negotiate, whether the reason was that the cash provision was not there and they wanted to pay for the land in bonds.</P>
    <P>I am bound to put on record that where a person is paid in six per cent bonds, if he wants to cash those, he is able to do so with reasonable facility and without loss.  That is not the case in respect of many people who were paid for earlier sales of land to the Land Commission in earlier issues of bonds and who are, in consequence, suffering at present, if they want to cash, losses down as far as 35 per cent of their purchase price.  It is unfair that that should be so and it certainly does not help voluntary acquisition.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister very strongly, therefore, that so far as this additional £10 millions is to be issued, it should be issued, as far as possible, in the one interest rate block so that there will be sufficient there always to find a free market for a vendor to cash in if he wants to, and therefore for the purchaser.  If the rate of interest changes at any time in the future, then that change should be met not by a change in the interest rate but by a change in the issue price of the bond, be it at a premium or at a discount.  Quite honestly, I do not know whether the Minister, with the Minister for Finance, has power under the existing land bond statute law to issue in that way, but, if he has not power to do so, I think it desirable that such power should be incorporated in the Statute Book with the appropriate usual safeguard of tabling a resolution, so that, if the power were used wrongly, the House would have an opportunity of reconsidering the matter.</P>
    <Col N="1023" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take one of the last matters mentioned by Deputy Sweetman first&mdash;the purchase of land by public auction by the Land Commission. In some of the cases he has in mind, possibly the Land Commission could not in fact purchase at the auction and had to try to make a voluntary deal afterwards because of the provisions of the Land Act, 1950, which restricts the type of land that can be bought by public auction by the Land Commission.  Under the 1950 Act, the Land Commission can buy land by public auction only in cases where there are intermixed holdings to be relieved or for migrants.  They cannot buy land under that Act by public auction for the common purposes of the Land Commission, that is, to give additions out to surrounding uneconomic holders and, therefore, when there is land on the market for sale by public auction and it is highly desirable that the Land Commission should buy, they are prevented under the present law from doing so.  They can only hope, if the land is not sold at the auction in such cases, to negotiate by private treaty so that it becomes a voluntary transaction between the owner and the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that under the new Land Bill we are curing all that and giving power to the Land Commission to buy for all their purposes at public auction without any restrictions, the same as an ordinary purchaser can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume it will have to be, although there is more awareness, I was going to say, of the value of land bonds now.  In respect of the new issue of land bonds, that is the six per cent issue, the interest rate is fixed by the Minister for Finance at a figure to keep it at or as near par as possible for a reasonable period.  It is on that basis that the Minister for Finance fixes the rate.  That is what is done at the moment and what I call the new issue of land bonds has been at or over par ever since this new issue came <Col N="1024" /> out, as far as my recollection goes, with very little fluctuation in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think they dropped to about 98 once.  I should not like to back my opinion on that but I think they did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in my recollection. As far as these old issues are concerned &mdash;the 3¼ per cent, 4½ per cent, and so on&mdash;the simple answer to that is that practically every other fixed interest security of that type suffered a similar fate&mdash;a reduction in value.  I know this is not the real answer but it is partly the answer at all events, that there is, as the Deputy knows, a draw for land bonds and whoever has these bonds and they come out of the hat and he is lucky enough to get them, gets the full value.  I do not know whether the Deputy was lucky in that transaction or not at any time but it is only, of course, a percentage of these people who are lucky enough to get full value for these depreciated bonds.  I suppose it is equally true to say that other securities of fixed interest issued in those days for whatever purpose have also suffered the devaluation which has been referred to here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This current series, at all events, is satisfactory so far as our experience goes and the prospects for the future of this series appear to me to be good. I am not quite sure&mdash;I would not commit myself now&mdash;but I do not believe, offhand, that there is power at law to do what Deputy Sweetman has suggested, that is, to have the issue of bonds at a premium or at a discount. I do not think that that power is there. Even if it were there I am not so sure that it would work in the way the Deputy says.  Again, indeed, by making one issue of all these together might defeat the purpose the Deputy has in mind.  We do not know how money values may change but the fact is that this new issue of bonds has been successful at six per cent and if, say, in a year's time or two years' time the Minister for Finance would make an issue of bonds under this Bill and make it in the financial climate then obtaining, either in increasing or reducing the rate, as the case may be, <Col N="1025" /> and taking into consideration current market conditions then, that would be a better system, in my view, in trying to maintain par or as near par for as long as possible.  A small issue in this way that covers a short period has, in my view, certain advantages from that point of view.  However, I will look into the suggestion made by the Deputy but I do not think it could be covered by legislation.</P>
    <P>While one may be able to do it to maintain even an artificial value in a small stock market like ours, many of these attempts by consortiums to keep share values at a special level in the national field have failed by some of the parties breaking in on them and I do not know how far it would be possible to rig the market by artificial means so as to keep bonds at a particular value.  However, I believe it would require legislation but I shall have the matter examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us how much of the six per cent issue is at present issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that we think about £4 million of the six per cent have been issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That was my recollection&mdash;that it was in the £3 million to £4 million category.  I would not like to be any more definite than that and would not expect the Minister to be any more definite than that without notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If in two years' time for a short period, as the Minister has said, the national rate of interest dropped to five per cent and during that particular year there was going to be, shall we say, a million even issued, the fact is that a small issue like that would never be marketable because there would never be enough out on the stock exchange at any one time for the purpose of making the market.  If the Minister is going to hold to the view that it is better to change the interest rate in the way he has suggested, then I think he should press the Minister for Finance very strongly to include land bonds in what I might call the Government stock.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of the <Col N="1026" /> fact that the Minister for Finance does, through the Government stockbroker, stand prepared to buy or sell National Loan at the prevailing price of the day up to a quite substantial amount so as to ensure that anyone who wants to buy or anyone who wants to sell always is able to buy or to sell.</P>
    <P>I see difficulties in that regard in respect of the land bonds, but, equally, I see that if the issue is a small issue, the person who has been paid for his land in bonds may very well find it virtually impossible to sell.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has ever had the experience, as I have had, professionally, of getting some of this small issue of land bonds transferred to us in payment for costs in a Land Commission sale.  In these small issues, it is very often a matter of waiting for a very long time to get a purchaser if one wants to sell and that is because the small issue is such that the financial houses are not interested in buying and, in consequence of that, there is no market in it and the person anxious to get his cash has to accept a very substantial sacrifice on his price for the purpose of tempting somebody to buy.  There is a similar position in regard to immature land bonds.  There is a market in immature land bonds but you can sell immature land bonds only at a substantial depreciation in the price because there is virtually no market in them and you have to tempt a purchaser to buy.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that if there were a small issue of land bonds made to cover a temporary change in interest rates such as that which the Minister has mentioned, we would find that that small issue was virtually unsaleable. One way of getting over it would be to provide that, in the case of a small temporary issue like that, it would not be dealt with by drawings but that the bonds would be redeemable at a fixed date.  If there was only a temporary change in interest rates and if the land bonds were made short-term bonds redeemable at a fixed date or transferable into other bonds at a fixed rate then there might be some sort of market for them.  I do not think the problem arises so long as one keeps <Col N="1027" /> the present six per cent issue, because there is enough of that outstanding to provide for the play of buying and selling.  It is only if one is going off that point of view that the matter would require to be considered.</P>
    <P>The Minister should prevail on his colleague, the Minister for Finance, when fixing the interest rates, to fix them not merely as estimated to be in or around half, but to fix them as estimated to be unlikely to fall below half in the immediate future.  It may be only a point or something like that in the capital price.  The aim should be not to hit par&mdash;unlikely to have par but equally unlikely to go below par. If it drops below the amount, that is the occasion on which there will be considerable hardship on the individual. In addition, it would create such ill-feeling against the Land Commission that there would be no hope of any voluntary savings at all.</P>

      <P>Is it not true that part of the objection by many landholders is due to the fact that land bonds have the reputation of not being easily convertible or, if they have to be converted into cash quickly, that they have to be sold at a very substantial loss?  I wish to join with Deputy Sweetman in urging that the Minister and the Minister for Finance take the necessary steps to keep the value of land bonds at or as near par as possible.  I know that may not be easy.  Because of the loss of face value on the Stock Exchange of the 3½ per cent Land Bonds, we know many people who sold land to the Commission in the past say they were robbed.  They either sold land or it was taken from them compulsorily and they were paid in bonds.  In addition, the purchasing power of that £100 has depreciated so much that there is a great deal of truth in the assertion that they have been robbed. The value of the £100 3½ per cent Land Bonds on the stock market today is around £65 or £70, and the purchasing power of that £70, as compared with the day they put it in, is less than £10.  In that way, a number of landowners, perhaps willing to sell to the <Col N="1028" /> Land Commission or not to resist Land Commission proceedings, are afraid when they are told they are to be paid in land bonds because they are not aware that there is a difference now with the six per cent Land Bonds.  We want to secure confidence in the value of our land bonds.  They should have as high a reputation as any of our national loans.  It is amazing that land bonds and national loans floated by the same Government should have such different values representing the same sums of money.  I join with Deputy Sweetman in appealing to the Government to make easier the acquisition of land in order to attain the objectives they have in view.  Land settlement is a very important matter requiring consideration.  It can be facilitated in a great number of instances. This is one of the ways in which much can be done to help.</P>

      <P>The Deputies are aware that this is not an easy matter to manipulate.  There could possibly be a new series issued and consolidated with some of these other issues in order to create a market of sufficient magnitude.  At all events, what has been suggested will be examined by me.  The series of six per cent bonds issued amount to £4,000,078 and there would be a balance of approximately £46,000 now available from that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we are doing.  The Deputy asked what amount was outstanding.  At this time, there is only about £346,000.  Of course, there will be need of much more before the House reassembles to continue this work.  The suggestion about the manner in which we issue this new £10 million will be examined to see can we devise any measures to ensure that they will maintain their value as near to par as possible.  Very many people who accepted land bonds did in fact sell them without the devaluation which occurred since.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise straight away that there is no indication whatsoever that there are any grounds for public alarm.  The chief medical officers of the various health authorities, however, have been alerted to ensure that appropriate action will be taken by them should the necessity arise.</P>
      <P>I should explain here that the usual manner of transmission of typhoid is through contaminated food or water and quarantine measures of the kind which might be applied to travellers in the cases of some other diseases such as smallpox would not be appropriate. Typhoid cannot normally be diagnosed during the incubation period of the disease, which is usually about ten to 14 days, and, accordingly, even if medical examination of all persons arriving from an affected area were feasible and justifiable, such a measure would not ensure the identification of cases in the early stages of infection. An absolute guarantee against the importation of typhoid from abroad could be achieved only by a complete prohibition on cargo and passenger traffic into this country, which I am sure will be recognised as not being realistic.</P>
      <P>There is one simple precaution which may readily be taken by everybody. It is to wash the hands carefully after using the toilet and before handling or eating food.</P>

      <P>The importation of meat into this country is strictly controlled by the Minister for Agriculture.  The importation of tinned corned beef of South American origin, to which the typhoid epidemic has been attributed, though it is fair to say that this has been denied by the producers, is not permitted and I am informed that there has been no such importation for very many years and certainly not since the end of the second World War.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware of the campaign by a joint committee of various organisations to secure signatures by a household canvass to a document relating to the Irish language; that it seems to be the proposal of this committee to present the signatures so secured to the Government as a valid reason for requiring the Government to take a line of action in accordance with the committee's wishes; and whether in order to provide proper statutory safeguards for ascertaining the people's wishes on this matter and to meet the obvious dangers inherent in the present campaign, the Government will take steps to initiate a referendum on the matter; or whether the Government are prepared to take other steps to secure an accurate reflection of the people's wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider the immediate desirability of holding an official referendum on the question of the Irish language revival having regard to the unofficial census of opinion which is at present being sought from the public and which may bring misleading results on many grounds, particularly owing to the lack of full knowledge of the repressive nature of the recommendations in the Report of the Commission on the Restoration of the Irish language by those now purporting to support a petition for its implementation.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I will take questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the campaign mentioned by the Deputies, which apparently includes an unofficial canvass or census of opinion.  I am not prepared to comment on their interpretation of the organisers' intentions.</P>
      <P>As regards holding a referendum on the matter of the Irish language, there are established parliamentary procedures for deciding questions of policy and we should in my view be slow to depart from these procedures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that people are being bluffed and cajoled into signing a cleverly-worded petition in ignorance of its full implications?  Is there not constitutional machinery for consulting the people in these matters and is this not an obvious case for availing of that machinery?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction on this matter in the public mind, especially among people who would like to see the Irish language revived and resuscitated in a proper manner with the goodwill of the majority of the people, would the Minister not agree that the attitude that has been adopted, where school children have been deliberately given a document to sign, which they do not know the meaning of, and then having signed it are informed that this is to help the revival of the language&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered the substance of the long supplementary question which the Deputy put.  I pointed out that there is a procedure for the holding of a referendum and that in this case people are merely being asked to express their desire that the Irish language should be made a living thing amongst us.  If the Deputy objects to that, I am sorry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what <Col N="1036" /> the Minister has in mind or what interpretation he is trying to put on my remarks.  Will the Minister take it from me that quite a large section of the people who are really as interested as those referred to in the question in the revival of the language believe that this is not an accurate or proper way to go about the question and that the proper way is to have a national referendum?  Will the Taoiseach&mdash;to whom I addressed the question&mdash;accept responsibility for such a grave matter as this?</P>

Under the terms of the Scheme, the proceedings of the General Council are confidential and I am, accordingly, precluded from disclosing any information concerning the matters under discussion until I have conveyed my decision on an agreed recommendation of the Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion that some form of official control be imposed in the case of young persons travelling to Britain involves practical difficulties which have been mentioned here on a number of occasions.  I would refer the Deputy to the replies given to questions by Deputies Russell, Sherwin and Hogan on 28th January, 1959, 23rd November, 1961, and 19th June, 1962, respectively.  I also dealt with the subject during the course of the debates on the Estimates for my Department on 11th July, 1961, and 5th April, 1962.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the imposition of a restriction of the type suggested would entail the introduction of a passport system.  Apart from the cost and inconvenience to all going to or coming from the Six Counties and Britain, such a system of control would be difficult, if not indeed impossible, to administer effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While appreciating the fact there is room for argument regarding the effect and extent of such a restriction, would the Minister not consider it desirable that members of <Col N="1043" /> the public should be made aware that such a restriction is not necessarily as restrictive as it might appear?  Furthermore, does he not think it would be desirable to prevent building contracts being drawn up which have this clause which misleads people into believing they are debarred from complaining after six months?</P>

The Minister must be well aware that the practice existing in many places is for people to engage the builder's solicitor to do all the legal work.

There will be no change whatever in the policing of Callan town and surrounding district.  The strength of the station party for all police purposes will be exactly the same.  All that has happened is that, in the interests of efficient use of manpower, two districts will be amalgamated administratively, Thomastown and Callan.  It is felt these two districts can be amalgamated without any loss of administrative efficiency.

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The Bill has three objects.  It proposes to give local authorities all the necessary powers for safeguarding life from the dangers of places such as water-filled quarries; secondly, it proposes a new and more effective procedure for dealing with dangerous buildings; and thirdly, it contains a general power to local authorities to enter into agreements with the Electricity Supply Board to abstract water from reservoirs provided by the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Water-filled, unprotected quarries have been the occasion of frequent drowning tragedies, usually involving children.  Sanitary authorities already have power to protect the public from dangers presented by open quarries which adjoin streets or public footpaths. They may require the owners to protect or enclose them or may, in default, carry out the works and recover the expenses from the owner. Local authorities, however, have no power to interfere in the case of quarries and other hazards not directly accessible from public roads but which are nevertheless dangerous to children and others who may gain access to them through private property.  Section 2 of the Bill proposes to remedy this defect.  This section, which refers to dangerous places wherever situated, will empower <Col N="1057" /> a sanitary authority to carry out whatever works are necessary to make such a dangerous place safe or at the request of an owner carry out such works and obtain a contribution from the owner towards the cost.  Alternatively, where the owner carries out the work the sanitary authority may contribute towards the cost.</P>
    <P>I have already authorised local authorities to take immediate action in regard to dangerous quarries in their areas in anticipation of this legislation. A circular letter was issued to all sanitary authorities last January, recommending that they should take immediate protective action in relation to quarries which are known to be dangerous; and that the owner's prior consent should be obtained on the understanding that the cost of protective works would be met in full from public funds.  It was also indicated that State grants would be available to local authorities towards the cost of approved works up to a maximum of 50 per cent of the approved cost.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council took immediate action, in accordance with the circular letter, in relation to a number of water-filled quarries in the county, but the council encountered difficulties where the owners of some quarries would not permit entry on the premises unless the council undertook that the land would not subsequently be acquired by them.  This the council were reluctant to do, as the filling-in works in question would be very costly, for instance in one case the proposed works would cost over £26,000.  Section 2 will enable the council to enter on these lands and carry out the necessary protective works.</P>
    <P>Sanitary authorities may undertake heavy expenditure as in the case I have just mentioned, in carrying out works under section 2.  The land when reclaimed by draining and filling may be very suitable for development by the local authority for housing, recreational or other purposes.  There is some doubt as to whether a sanitary authority's existing power to acquire land would apply in all such cases.  The provisions of section 6 give a clear authority for acquisition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> Sections 7 to 15 set out the procedure to be followed in regard to the acquisition, development or disposal of land acquired under section 6.  The procedure is substantially the same as that contained in sections 7 to 15 of the Derelict Sites Act, 1961, and which has been found generally satisfactory. Compulsory acquisition as under that Act will be effected by vesting order. Notice of intention to acquire land must be given to the owner and occupier who may object to the proposal within a month.  Where objection is made and not withdrawn the land may not be acquired compulsorily without the Minister's consent.</P>
    <P>There is one major departure from the procedure prescribed by the Derelict Sites Act.  In that Act, consent may not be given where the Minister considers that the owner should be given an opportunity to rehabilitate the site.  It is not proposed to carry this condition into the present Bill, in view of the element of danger to life and the consequent urgency in cases such as unprotected quarries, where the danger can only be removed permanently by costly works carried out by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the implementation of the second objective of the Bill.  It codifies and re-enacts, with some important amendments, the procedure in relation to dangerous structures which is operated by Dublin Corporation under various local Acts.  The section also applies the new powers to all sanitary authorities in place of the limited powers hitherto available to them.  The section covers dwellinghouses as well as other buildings and so will strengthen the powers of local authorities in dealing with unfit houses pending the enactment of new housing legislation.</P>
    <P>Under section 3, a sanitary authority may give notice to the owner of a dangerous structure requiring him within a specified period to make such structure safe and to terminate or modify any use being made of it. Power is also given to prescribe detailed conditions as to the manner of demolition of the building.  A fine of £100 is provided for failure to comply <Col N="1059" /> with such notice.  Special powers are also given to the local authority to carry out such work as is necessary to make a structure safe in the interests of the safety of any person, without prior notice if necessary.  The additional powers provided under the Section have been framed on the basis of requests received from Dublin Corporation and other urban authorities and are designed for more effective action than has been legally possible hitherto.  One of the more important additions to the powers of local authorities generally is that they will now be enabled to prevent re-occupation of buildings which they have caused to be vacated.</P>
    <P>Section 3 also strengthens the powers of the sanitary authority to recover costs and expenses from the owner and increases substantially fines for failure to comply with notices and empowers the district court to prohibit the repair or letting of the structure or the carrying out of any works on the site on which the structure stood until the local authority are paid the amount due in respect of works carried out by them.</P>
    <P>The section will also give local authorities power to provide other living accommodation for the occupiers of dwellings who have had to leave the dwellings as a result of auction under the Section or to give grants to such persons to enable them to obtain other living accommodation.</P>
    <P>The third main purpose of the Bill is set out in section 4.  This section will give general authority for the making of agreements between the ESB and sanitary authorities of the kind authorised by the Liffey Reservoir Act, 1936, in relation to Poulaphouca Reservoir between the Board and Dublin Corporation.  That agreement enabled the Corporation to take an agreed amount of water per day for the purposes of the Dublin Water Supply. The agreement contained provisions relating to the prevention of the pollution of the water in the reservoir; the level of water to be maintained in the reservoir; the point of abstraction and the rate of flow of water in the river downstream.  The consent of the Minister <Col N="1060" /> for Local Government will be necessary to an agreement reached pursuant to section 4.  With a view to safeguarding fishery interests, the section provides for consultation with the Minister for Lands before this consent is given.</P>
    <P>The sanitary authority must give a month's public notice of the intention to make an agreement and will be required to specify particulars of the proposed agreement in the notice. Persons who have objections to the proposed agreements will then be in a position to put their case to the Minister who will bear such representations in mind before coming to a decision in any particular case.  An agreement when sanctioned will have the same force as a proposal under the Water Supplies Act, 1942.  It will give the sanitary authority a right to abstract water subject to claims for compensation from persons alleging damage by reason of the authorised abstraction.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is designed specifically to meet a legal difficulty which has arisen in regard to the abstraction of water by Dublin County Council from the ESB reservoir at Leixlip.  After protracted negotiations between the county council and the Board, agreement on terms was reached, but the Board was advised that they had no legal power to authorise the abstraction of water on such a scale from a reservoir provided by them and that such abstraction might be liable to be stopped by injunction.  Section 4 will give the necessary statutory authority for the proposed agreement.</P>
    <P>Sections 16 to 21 which follow the same general lines as the Derelict Sites Act, 1961, provide for general matters such as inspection of land, penalties for obstruction, giving of documents under the Act, negotiations, expenses of the Minister, etc.</P>
    <P>Section 22 is the usual repeal section. It provides for the repeal of certain provisions dealing with dangerous buildings which will become redundant if the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, as outlined by the Minister, is to give to health authorities the power to deal <Col N="1061" /> with dangerous quarries and hazards of the kind mentioned in the definition section.  I should like at the outset to ask the Minister why it is that sanitary authorities are specifically mentioned here.  One would think that, in regard to matters of this kind, the local authority would be the body to deal with them.  We did have this combination before on the bringing into operation of the health authorities a couple of years back, whereby there was a unified health authority to deal with functions formerly discharged by the local authorities in regard to Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Waterford.  Even at the present time, these health authorities, as we are very well aware, are still dependent on the services of officers of the local authority for the carrying out of the many functions for which the health authority is now responsible.  I should like the Minister, when replying, to advert to this aspect and to explain why, on this occasion, he refers to sanitary authorities inasmuch as the local authorities in most areas deal with these matters at the moment.</P>
      <P>In giving the local authorities power to compel owners to deal with dangerous buildings, etc., the Minister rightly mentions this is an extension of a power at present enjoyed by Dublin Corporation under a very old Act indeed.  The part of the Bill dealing with quarries, quaysides and so on is long overdue.  There have been far too many accidents with tragic loss of life, lives which should not have been lost. Following on these tragedies, the public have legitimately cried out against the lack of attention displayed by local authorities in their refusal to deal with these hazards.  It is understandable that the public should be disturbed.  Local authorities have always had the power to deal with these hazards.  The Minister may say that fuller powers are being given under this Bill, but there were always sufficient powers in the hands of local authorities to deal with matters of this kind.</P>
      <P>There is the Public Health (Amendment) Act of 1907, the relevant section of which provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With respect to the repairing or <Col N="1062" /> enclosing of dangerous places the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
    <P>If, in any situation fronting, adjoining or abutting on any street or public footpath any building, wall, fence, space, structure or other thing, or any well, excavation, reservoir, pond, stream, dam or bank is, for want of sufficient repair, protection or enclosure, dangerous to persons lawfully using the street or footpath, the local authority may by notice in writing served upon the owner require him, within the period specified in the notice and hereinafter referred to in this section as the prescribed period, to repair, to remove, protect or enclose the same so as to prevent any danger therefrom.</P>
    <P>This section was introduced in the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948 and has been in force since. Therefore, all these authorities had this power to deal with that type of case.  The Minister says there are fuller powers and perhaps when we come to deal with the Bill in Committee the Minister will be able to indicate the differences in the present Bill and say what defect there was in the previous legislation in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>The sections in this Bill are permissive. I want to suggest that the Bill should go much further and should make it mandatory on the authorities to do certain things within certain stated periods.  The responsible authorities should carry out a survey of their own districts to ascertain where dangerous buildings are and in discovering where dangerous buildings or hazards exist for the public they ought to seek the co-operation, not alone of the public but of parents and of motorists who become aware of hazards in their journeys through the country.</P>
    <P>We may take it as a rather sad commentary that instead of repeal legislation in regard to dilapidated buildings we have to have a further Bill to deal with the matter.  Those who drafted the Bill must be aware of the many applications made by Dublin Corporation to the district court seeking the removal of buildings which <Col N="1063" /> are now described as dangerous but in this Bill when we come to deal with the people who are removed from these buildings the section says that the authority may, if they so think fit, house these people.  That seems to indicate an extraordinary type of approach to the problem of a person who is removed from his or her room which has been home perhaps for a lifetime.  Where is it intended to house these people?  Is it intended that they should be housed near to the place from which they are being removed, where they are amongst their friends and relations?</P>
    <P>Under the Dublin Corporation Act, 1890 there was a provision whereby people could be removed from buildings at that time and could be housed, as the term used in the Act was &ldquo;in the workhouse&rdquo;, which was available to the poor.  That Act of 1890 laid down very clearly and fully what could be done under the terms of that Act. Section 10, subsection (1) of that Act provided:</P>
    <P>Where a structure has been certified by the surveyor to be a neglected structure or a dangerous structure within the meaning of this Act the lord mayor or justice may, by order under his hand, direct the inmates or any of them to be removed therefrom by a constable or other peace officer, and if they have no other abode he may require them to be received into the workhouse established for the reception of the poor of the place in which the structure is situate.</P>
    <P>The section in this Bill seems to be a 1964 version of that section.  It does not seem to be very far removed from it.</P>
    <P>In a good many of these cases, where there is a question of paying the local authority for the removal of a dangerous building there is the question of the landlord contributing to the cost.  There should have been in a Bill such as this a section providing for compensation by the landlord to the tenants who are being removed from the structure.  At present, particularly in the city of Dublin and in the built-up areas of other cities, there <Col N="1064" /> is property occupied by tenements which, having regard to modern circumstances, provide valuable sites when they are cleared.  The people who own these property sites have a very valuable asset when the buildings are removed.  I want to ask the Minister whether there is not a danger that a landlord who owns such buildings would not be over-zealous in looking after them but would be left with a loophole whereby he might refer the building to the local authority for demolition as dangerous buildings and obtain possession of the site?</P>
    <P>In the ordinary way, up to the present time, the rights of the tenants have been very carefully protected and a very elaborate and careful procedure was laid down whereby a tenant was entitled to judicial protection before he could be removed from what was his home.  I want to ask the Minister are we giving in this Bill a power to the landlord and taking away from the tenant a valuable right and protection which he had?</P>
    <P>Under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, there was an implied condition that before a landlord let a premises the premises would be reasonably fit for human habitation. Section 31 of that Act provides:</P>
    <P>In any contract entered into after the passing of this Act for letting for habitation a dwelling-house at a rent not exceeding&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in the case of a house situate in the County Borough of Dublin or the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, thirty pounds per annum;</P>
    <P>(b)  in the case of a house situate elsewhere, twenty-five pounds per annum;</P>
    <P>there shall, notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary, be implied a condition that the house is at the commencement of the tenancy, and an undertaking that the house will be kept by the landlord during the tenancy, in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation ...</P>
    <P>Not alone was there that obligation on the landlord but the local authority <Col N="1065" /> had an obligation imposed on them by that Act and what would be the present position if they had been discharging their functions and their duties properly as provided in that Act?  It was provided in section 29:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of every local authority to cause an inspection of their district to be made from time to time with a view of ascertaining whether any dwelling-house therein is unfit for human habitation, and for that purpose it shall be the duty of the local authority and every officer of the local authority, to comply with such regulations and to keep such records as the Minister may prescribe.</P>
    <P>Surely it is clear that if a structure being used as a dwelling becomes dangerous it is unfit for human habitation? What has the local authority been doing in the meantime?  Has the local authority been discharging the responsibility which was placed on it by that legislation or is this measure now an admission of the failure of the local authority to deal with this matter?</P>
    <P>The section in the Bill dealing with reservoirs is a very necessary section. It can be said that it is a good thing that reservoirs are available.</P>
    <P>Will the type of occurrence envisaged in section 3, subsection (2) (a) arise only occasionally?  Or will this be used extensively&mdash;that tenants will be ejected from buildings on the opinion of an officer of the sanitary authority?  Again, the difficulty I raised when opening on this matter arises here. Who is a competent authority to decide this?  Normally at present the health inspectors in rural areas&mdash;and I presume they operate in Dublin also&mdash;have not got engineering qualifications.  They look at the structure&mdash;and one need not look at some of them too long to know they are dangerous buildings.  In writing into legislation a blanket provision such as this, are we not writing in that somebody may give an opinion which will be regarded as an expert opinion, although the person concerned is not qualified as an expert to give such an opinion?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> The question of the local authority &mdash;in this case the sanitary authority&mdash; obtaining compensation for their efforts in regard to the removal of buildings is dealt with fully in the Bill.  It is right that some of the landlords of dangerous property, who have become careless in regard to their obligations to their tenants, should have this money recovered from them, but is there any provision in the Bill for compensation to the person being removed from the building?  As the Minister is aware, there is a section of Dublin where very small shopkeepers are being removed from these buildings.  If these people were big enough, they would be compensated; but because they are little, they seem to be neglected.  No provision is being made to compensate these people in any way for the loss of the livelihood they enjoyed in that area, although there is provision in regard to habitation.  That is something of a weakness in a measure such as this and something to which the Minister should advert.</P>
    <P>Under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, and even under the Rent Restrictions Act, provision is made to safeguard the rights of tenants in these cases.  Even where it was decided after judicial investigation that the tenant would have to leave the property and that possession should be given to the landlord, there was placed on the latter an obligation of providing, I think, three times the annual rent of the premises as compensation to the person so affected.  I should like to see a section in this Bill which would equally recognise the rights of the people in these areas.  I should hope that the Bill would not seem to encourage the landlord anxious to get rid of the obligation imposed on him by the Acts I have quoted of maintaining structures as human habitations in proper order, who, instead, allows them to fall into disrepair and then, by drawing the attention of the local authorities to them as being dangerous buildings, obtains possession of them in very simple fashion indeed.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other sections dealing with compensation, the compensation is again to be assessed under the Acquisition of Land (Compensation) <Col N="1067" /> Act, 1909.  We had the same thing under the Planning Act.  At that time, and I repeat it today, I pointed out this could be a most unfair method of arriving at the compensation payable. The awards given on these occasions have often been proved to be wrong and unjust by as much as £2,000 or £3,000.  The District Court, the Circuit Court and the High Court are used to dealing with this matter of the determination of valuation.  I cannot understand why their services are not availed of to ensure that the rights of everybody are fully protected in this matter.</P>
    <P>We recognise that this Bill is necessary in the circumstances of the housing situation as it has shown itself, particularly in the built-up areas, and in the large number of very unfortunate and tragic occurrences in quarries close to large built-up areas, on quaysides and at dangerous points on roads and deep points in rivers where drownings have occurred.  We recognise it is necessary to reinforce the law on this matter.  I want again to say to the Minister that many of these powers were available to the local authority up to this in the legislation which existed prior to the establishment of the State, and which was adopted at the time, and in the legislation passed since that time.  However, it does not seem to have been acted on.  There are a number of sections in the Bill which will require amendment and we will from this side of the House put down the necessary amendments to deal with that matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is apparent that this Bill is before us as a result of the very justifiable indignation to which expression was given by people living in the suburban areas of Dublin earlier in the present year, during last year and indeed frequently over recent years, in regard to the existence of dangerous quarry holes which had become filled with water over the years.  This applied to my constituency, particularly to the Walkinstown district.  As Deputy Jones said, there have been many tragedies and indeed heartrending fatalities in which children have lost their lives because of <Col N="1068" /> the existence of these places.  It is obvious that this Bill is primarily an effort to meet and remedy that situation. In so far as it is, we welcome it and consider it overdue.  The previous speaker considered that existing legislation was sufficient to enable local authorities to deal with this problem without fresh legislation being introduced. All of us who have had experience of membership of local authorities have found that law advisers, like doctors, tend to differ greatly and the patients, in this case the ratepayers, the people resident in the local authority area, very often die as a result of this difference in the interpretation of statutes by law agents.</P>
      <P>All of these men, it is to be assumed, are able men but they are men of very fixed opinions on what the law means and we have seen in many cases opposite interpretations of laws being given by law agents from different local authority areas.  In County Dublin, it appears that the law agent took the view that existing legislation was not sufficient to enable the Dublin County Council to do what should be done, to move in where such quarries existed, have them filled in and made safe, and the result is that we have this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am interested to know just what is meant by the definition of &ldquo;dangerous place&rdquo;.  Amongst the definitions, it is stated that &ldquo;dangerous place&rdquo; means an excavation, quarry, pit, well, reservoir, pond, stream, dam, bank, dump, shaft or land that, in the opinion of the sanitary authority in whose sanitary district it is situate, is or is likely to be dangerous to any person.  For instance, I should like to know if this Bill envisages all the dangers that may be represented by a dump.  By virtue of the rapid expansion of housing in the immediate post-war years, we have in the Dublin suburban areas large housing schemes&mdash;I am thinking of one in particular in the Walkinstown area &mdash;where thousands of houses have been built under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts and very close to them are large dumps where a lot of the city and county refuse is disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> I should like to know if such a dump is to be regarded as a dangerous place in so far as it does constitute, unquestionably, a threat to the health of everybody living within half a mile of it.  These dumps are a public scandal because of their effluvia and the perpetual pall of smoke hanging over them.  Naturally young children will gravitate in the direction of a dump because there is activity there and they will root about in it.  The place in question is infested with rats.  Would such a place be regarded, for the purpose of this Bill, as dangerous, and what steps will be taken to eliminate this sort of hazard to the people's health?  It might well be that on Committee Stage, if it is possible to do so, we might try to have a section inserted to require local authorities to have these dumps situated at a considerable distance from housing schemes or built-up areas.  It is essential, in my view, that this should be done because the existence of these eyesores can result in just as much danger as quarries.</P>
    <P>I hope that when this Bill becomes law the local authorities will lose no time in putting it into effect.  I know that my colleague, Deputy Burke, has been agitating to have these quarries attended to.  In fact, I recall him stating at a meeting a year or two ago that if something was not done, he would go himself and drive in the stakes around a quarry.  It was a very noble gesture. I do not see the stakes yet and I hope this Bill will eliminate the need for such action on the part of my distinguished colleague.</P>

      <P>People of affected areas will be glad that this Bill is going through but I am anxious on their behalf to get an assurance that the Minister will recommend that the local authorities take immediate action. There have been problems arising from the fact that some landowners not only proved difficult and unreasonable but positively antagonistic to the <Col N="1070" /> public good, and when it was suggested that quarries should be filled in, they wanted them to be handed back to them to exploit them for building purposes. As mentioned in the Minister's brief, to fill in one such quarry would cost £26,000.  This Bill apparently will give the local authority power to do the work and to acquire such property compulsorily and ensure that the public good will be the primary objective with which the local authority will be concerned and that no presents will be given to unreasonable people.</P>
      <P>I do not know how far the Bill relates to the dangers created by canals but for many years it has seemed to me that something should be done about the canals, and certainly that canal which flows through Dublin, to make it safe for children.  It is used for young people for bathing but it is an open invitation to danger, and it is something which should be examined by the local authority and by the Minister.  There have been many cases of children, and even of adults, being drowned in the canal and it is something that must be examined and about which something must be done. Some protection must be provided so that when little children living in the areas adjacent to the canal go out, their parents will not be worried eternally about whether they will come back again or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jones referred to tenants who are displaced by action of the local authority in condemning houses and requiring their demolition, and the need for compensation for such tenants is very obvious.  There have been many cases, of which members of the local authority are aware, where tenants with families are being displaced by the present efforts of Dublin Corporation to secure the demolition of unfit houses and there are many people for whom no alternative accommodation is made available, or can be made available because of the shortage of houses or flats in the city. There should be some compensation for such people to enable them to set up a home again.  It is very unjust that they should be given no alternative in many cases except to go to <Col N="1071" /> Griffith Barracks.  The workhouse has been mentioned by a Deputy who spoke previously as being the place indicated in the Act of 1898.  Griffith Barracks is not very much better than the workhouse was and the conditions of the people there are depressing for anybody who has had occasion to witness them.  Families are divided and a most undesirable situation exists.</P>
    <P>I do acknowledge it is primarily the responsibility of the Corporation to provide accommodation for these people.  However, in the situation in which we now find ourselves, where it is obvious that the housing position in Dublin will not be normalised for several years at the rate building is going on, compensation of some kind should be provided to enable people to get accommodation other than that which is available in Griffith Barracks.</P>
    <P>In some cases where families are displaced from dangerous buildings, they are offered the only accommodation which may be available at the time in areas to which, to say the least of it, they have not been used, certain built-up areas where they are not alone among strangers but among people with whom they may not have very much in common.  In these cases compensation is something which might help.</P>
    <P>In nearly all Bills which come to this House, there is something of a vague general nature such as is in section 4 of this Bill, relating to the protracted negotiations between Dublin county and the ESB.  It is a sad commentary upon our semi-State bodies and our local authorities when they cannot reach agreement in matters which vitally affect the public interest without having the time of this House taken up with legislation to deal with them.  These are bodies who should be as much concerned as this House is about expediting matters for the good of the public.  While there may be technical difficulties, the Minister mentions protracted negotiations which would indicate to me an undesirable situation which should not have been allowed to continue and which should not in the end have been permitted to become a matter which <Col N="1072" /> would take up the time of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>We shall have the opportunity in Committee of examining and possibly improving this Bill by adding to it. The elimination of dangerous quarry holes brings to mind another important and related matter for which there is no specific provision in this Bill, and the dangers attendant upon bathing in the canals because of the dangerous condition of the canal banks also brings this matter to mind, that is, the need for swimming pools in Dublin city and county.  That is something about which we have done nothing and, with the closing of the quarry holes, it is something to which we should give attention.  It is not strictly in order on this Bill but I would ask the Minister to encourage local authorities to push ahead with the provision of these amenities.  The only other comment I have to make on this Bill is that we are glad to see it at long last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have been in the House this afternoon when this Bill was introduced by the Minister for Local Government.  For years we have been frustrated by the Law Agents of Dublin County Council, Dublin Corporation and others. We were told there was no power to deal with the quarries, although they were responsible for loss of life.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government took an active interest in this matter. He advised the local authority in Dublin county to try to deal with this problem in a reasonable way.  Legal argument went on for a long time between the Law Agent of the Dublin County Council and the Minister's Department.  Now the Minister has found it necessary to bring in this Bill which is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will be a great asset to the people of my constituency and to other people throughout the country who may have the same problem.  There was a very serious problem especially in the Walkinstown area of my constituency where there are five quarries. It was all right some years ago, but due to the prosperity of the nation, houses have been built right round the <Col N="1073" /> quarries and nobody could keep the children out of the quarries.  As the previous Deputy stated, if we were dealing with reasonable people, it would not be necessary for the Minister to take up the time of the House with a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister went more than ninety per cent of the way to have this matter settled amicably.  We went out to see these quarry owners, seeking agreement to have the quarries filled in, indicating we could go to town on the cost and so on.  We merely wanted to be allowed to fence them in.  They refused to let us do anything.  Now the Minister must introduce compulsory powers to deal with unreasonable people and to stop the loss of life.</P>
    <P>In regard to one quarry in Walkinstown where a child was drowned, I went to see the owner with a view to getting permission for having the quarry fenced in.  I used all the diplomacy of which I was capable, but in spite of all the plamás and diplomacy, he bluntly told me that the property was his and if there were more children drowned, it was the parents' fault.  Now that the sworn inquiry has been held and the Minister is introducing this Bill, they will meet any of us.  They want to know what compensation they will get; are we going to treat them reasonably.  They made no effort.  Even if they had fenced quarries themselves, it would have helped.</P>
    <P>While I like to see everybody fairly treated, I have very little sympathy with a number of these people.  I believe in trying diplomacy to the limit in dealing with these cases.  When a child was very nearly drowned about two years ago, I went to a meeting and I said I would put down the stakes myself.  I hoped the quarry-owner would take action against me to restrain me from doing so and so bring the matter before the public.  Then we were told by Dublin County Council that we had no legal power.  I haunted the Minister for Local Government. He received numerous deputations and I was on several of these, and I want to say that the officers of his Department who deal with quarries could not <Col N="1074" /> be more courteous or helpful.  I cannot speak too highly of them.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will not delay this Bill, which deals especially with quarries, pits, wells, reservoirs, ponds, streams or anything of that kind in a built-up area.  One can say something for an area which is a mile or a half-mile from a built-up district when it is on private property, but when it is in the centre of a built-up area, we have to do something.  I heartily congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill now, even though he had some very important housing legislation to introduce.  I had hoped that legislation would go through this term but, unfortunately, owing to pressure of legislation, it had to be postponed.  The Minister introduced this Bill, as he promised, and it is one that will be welcomed by every fairminded citizen.</P>
    <P>We have a problem in Dublin in regard to dangerous buildings which would not exist if the housing situation had been properly handled some 20 years ago.  When one or two houses fell and a few tragedies occurred, everybody woke up.  We had been leaving one or two people in old tenement houses.  We had no power to compel them to go if they did not wish to do so.  Dublin Corporation failed completely to deal with the position 20 years ago.  Although I have been a member of the Corporation for four years, they failed down the years to provide houses for old couples, one-or two-room flats.  For that reason, we have a problem now and the Minister again has come to our aid.  I hope we shall succeed in overcoming this problem in the very near future.  Dangerous buildings constitute one of our very big problems and anything that can be done to expedite the acquisition and demolition of them is long overdue.</P>
    <P>In Church Street and North King street, I think, nine years ago, we began to acquire and pull down dangerous buildings.  No progressive local authority would carry on like that.  Then we had a place at Butterfield Avenue going on to Rathfarnham about which I have been asking questions. I think it was seven years ago that an effort was made to acquire property there and it is dilly-dallying <Col N="1075" /> since.  We have a small road, a sort of prairie track, going out to 8,000 or 9,000 houses, a case where you have some crank or two holding up the community to ransom.  I do not want to take away the democratic rights of any citizen.  He has the right to appeal but he has no right, nor have any two or three people the right, to hold a whole community up to ransom as in the cases I have cited here.  The road leading from the main street out to Butterfield&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall be as brief as, or briefer than Deputy Burke. When one sees the Deputy exercising his powers of plámás on the Minister, one is tempted to inquire in what constituency the Minister resides.  I take it, having regard to the remark Deputy Burke made about the mishandling of the housing situation about 20 years ago, that the Tánaiste does not live in Deputy Burke's constituency. If my memory serves me aright, the Tánaiste presided over the fortunes of the Department of Local Government about that time which gave rise to Deputy Burke's complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the House generally will approve the principles set out in the Bill and referred to by the Minister in his opening remarks.  The only comment that can be made in regard to the question of dangerous quarries <Col N="1076" /> and matters of that kind now being dealt with by the Bill is that it seems a pity that if the doubt existed, as apparently it did, about the powers of the local authority to deal with this matter for many years past when the necessity for action was there, decisive legislation to clear up the point is only now being introduced.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that from the Minister's point of view and that of his officials, it was probably necessary to do a great deal of research work first, before the size of the problem was apparent to them and, secondly, to discover precisely what legislative measures were needed to remedy it.  It is a problem that has existed for a very long time and my only regret is that it was not dealt with much sooner.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill deals with the abstraction of water by sanitary authorities from ESB reservoirs.  I should like to put a case to the Minister.  It seems to me it is not covered by the Bill and I am not entirely confident that this Bill is the right Bill to cover it but I should like to bring it to the Minister's attention. Perhaps it would be convenient for him to consider extending the powers slightly to enable him to have some say in agreements between local sanitary authorities and Dublin Corporation in relation to the Vartry water supply.</P>
    <P>I asked a question of the Minister yesterday in connection with the Windgates area between Greystones and Bray where a severe water supply problem exists.  It is a twofold problem. A number of houses there have no water supply and those on the existing supply have an inadequate supply.  If those who have no supply operate a group scheme, it appears that the only source of water is the existing supply, which is already inadequate.  This is a problem that could be solved very easily by the Vartry supply if Dublin Corporation were prepared to give it.  It would not require any great extension.  It is due to Dublin Corporation to say that they have responded generously to applications made for the supply up to the present.  They have agreed to supply Kilquade, Three Trout Bridge, Redford <Col N="1077" /> and Kilcoole.  I understand they are not anxious for any other extension.</P>
    <P>The Minister might consider adopting the same scheme as he is adopting in this Bill in relation to the Poulaphouca reservoir.  In present circumstances where adequate sources of supply are becoming more and more essential, he should be in a position, if an application is made by a sanitary authority, at least to arrange with the owners of the source of supply that an agreement could be entered into.  If that were done in relation to the Windgates area, the problem would be solved quite inexpensively.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention is a local one in connection with the Valleymount and Ballyknockan districts in County Wicklow.  The Minister has referred to legislation which enabled that area to be flooded and he is probably not unaware of the fact that moves have been made, not directly to his Department, but to the Department of Transport and Power and to Dublin Corporation, to allow the question of compensation for residents in that area to be re-opened.  It seems to me that this Bill is one under which the Minister could consider that question.</P>
    <P>I do not want to transgress the rules of order but this is an appeal I should like to make to the Minister. Having considered the Bill, it seems to me that any amendment on Committee Stage, except by the Minister, would probably be ruled out of order because it would impose a charge.  It seems to me that the only opportunity of making this plea to the Minister is on the Second Stage, in the hope that he will bring in the amendment.</P>
    <P>A vast area of land was flooded to provide this reservoir and something like 58 families were evacuated.  They did get compensation, but what was overlooked, and I think honestly overlooked, was the effect that this flooding, this creation of an artificial lake, would have on the surrounding areas and, in particular, on the parish of Valleymount and the Ballyknockan district.  The church and parochial house, the schools and shopping centre <Col N="1078" /> have all been cut off from the surrounding area and the distance which people have to travel has been trebled. The result has been disastrous for the district and the Department of Transport and Power, when a deputation met them, conceded the point I am now making and they did give a token sum in order to assist the amenities of the area, but Dublin Corporation are not in a position to do anything by way of providing compensation for their activities.  They are precluded by legislation from doing anything.</P>
    <P>If the Minister would be good enough to inscribe in this Bill a short enabling section to enable the question of compensation to be reopened, he would be doing a very good day's work for that part of the country which has been very hard hit by legislation passed by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill interests me more than most Deputies because it deals largely with the city of Dublin. However, I am a little handicapped in dealing with it because I have not got my spectacles and I do not know what is in the Bill or the explanatory memorandum.  I will have to pick it up from what I hear but when we come to the Committee Stage, I will know what is in the sections.  There is one point on which I wish to get information from the Minister, and it is vital: will he tell me if he is providing in this Bill power to local authorities to go in and spend money on a dwelling that can be saved?  Up to now local authorities have not had that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that local authorities have had power to compel the owners of quarries either to fill them in or to put fences around them but I am also aware that they had no power to compel the owner of a quarry to do that where the quarry was situated away from the main road.  This Bill gives the local authorities power to control all quarries and sources of danger.  Deputy Jones did not appear to be certain of that but I am well aware that local authorities up to now, had this power only where a quarry was near a main road or in a built-up area.  This Bill gives power to take action in the case of all quarries, <Col N="1079" /> irrespective of whether they are near a main road or half a mile away.</P>
    <P>In relation to dangerous buildings, for the past eight years I have been agitating on the Dublin Housing Committee. I have brought dangerous building inspectors there many times and questioned them.  I have asked if some of these structures which were being demolished could not be saved because this wholesale demolition of dwellings was causing a crisis we could not meet.  Irrespective of whether or not we have some place to put the people, we have to put the people out as the law stands, once the inspector decides the building is dangerous.  It is not the sanitary inspector who makes application for a closing order.  All he makes is an order declaring the building unfit, but an unfit building is not a dangerous building.  Before any house fell, there were 600 unfit dwellings occupied in this city.  When people are removed from an unfit dwelling, the rooms cannot be reoccupied. The dwelling is not demolished. When it is a question of the demolition of a dwelling and removal by a police order, the application is made by the dangerous buildings inspector. I understand he is a qualified person.  There are two entirely different categories involved.</P>
    <P>Our problem was that a dangerous buildings inspector would enter a tenement and, although it was only partly dangerous, he could bring the owner to court and demand that the danger be corrected within a certain time.  If the danger were not corrected, he applied for a demolition order, either in respect of the whole premises or part of it.  If the local authority could go in and spend a couple of hundred pounds on these premises, they could very often be rendered fit for habitation for another five, ten, 15 or 20 years.  Invariably the owner says he has no money to repair.  The whole house may not be worth £100 and he could not spend £200 or £300 repairing it.  Repairing property is an expensive business and we are asking landlords to spend money on some houses that are over a hundred years old.  The landlord knows it would be money down the drain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" /> From the point of view of the local authority, however, it would be money well spent because it would save these houses for a few more years and give us some relief.  It is relief we are looking for.  If a chimney stack is a danger, surely the local authority could repair it.  If we had power to do that, the whole situation would be changed because hundreds of tenements which will be cleared and demolished within the next year or two would be saved for a further period. Only the worst need be demolished. The wholesale eviction of people would cease.  If we avail of the provisions of this Bill, the position will go back to normal inside six months.  The information I had was that we would be evicting people and demolishing houses for the next two years.  It is some satisfaction now to know we can go in and thereby ease the situation.</P>
    <P>A couple of people have been making politics out of this business of housing and so on.  It was not that the Dublin Corporation did not build enough houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> I should like to say now that I think it most unfair that people should have been thrown out of their dwelling without some sort of disturbance money being paid.  When a local authority removes people from an area wanted for road widening or building purposes, they always pay compensation. If a shopkeeper has to leave a street because of a road widening or a CPO scheme, he gets compensation to the extent of the full value of his property or business.  Private tenants likewise get disturbance money&mdash;£10, £15 or £20, as the case may be.  Those removed from dangerous buildings get nothing; 71 small shopkeepers closed up during the past 12 months got no compensation of any kind.  Not only were they thrown out but they lost their business.  Under the law they are not entitled to any compensation.  I think that is a shocking state of affairs. I had a letter from a woman this morning who lost her shop; she got no alternative accommodation because there were only two people involved. Her rates were paid up to date.  Now that is very hard luck on her.  Some compensation should be paid, something in the form of disturbance money.  If flood or earthquake hits, there is a great hullabaloo and legislation is rushed through so that the people can be helped.  Everybody gets something.  A good illustration of that is the flooding in the North Strand. This is an emergency and I think small shopkeepers and others should get some form of disturbance money.</P>

      <P>I was very pleased to hear the Minister for Housing without portfolio, Deputy P. J. Burke, speaking earlier this afternoon about the problem of these unfortunate people in dangerous houses because I had quite thought he had gone off to another sphere altogether.  I saw yesterday evening that he was reported as saying that he and his colleagues in the Government were very conscious of the housing problems.  He burst into this flight of fancy when opening a housing scheme in which the individual houses cost £7,975.  They are houses for those who have made it, who are successful.  It is quite obvious that the Government demonstrate by their lack <Col N="1082" /> of activity in relation to ordinary houses, and dangerous buildings in particular, that they have quite forgotten those who have not made it and who have not been successful.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been necessitated because of the fact that for 15 years&mdash; not just eight years, to which Deputy Sherwin has given testimony, but for 15 years&mdash;the Dublin Corporation did nothing about dangerous buildings. The Dublin Corporation were condemned by the special inquiry established by the Minister for Local Government last year in relation to what we are told was an accidental collapse but, I say, an inevitable collapse, of houses in Bolton Street and Fenian Street.  In the course of that inquiry, although it was not within his terms of reference, the inspector could not avoid the condemnation that for 15 years the Dublin Corporation had failed to discharge their statutory obligations to inspect the city and to keep a list of dangerous and potentially dangerous <Col N="1083" /> dwellings.  It was because of that we have our district courts crowded out with dangerous building inspectors and the whole process of the law being abused and ill-used by a Corporation who, because of these tragedies, had wakened up to their fundamental moral responsibility.</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation failed to take any remedial action where cases of dangerous buildings were brought to their notice, something in respect of which Deputy Sherwin has again and again given evidence here and elsewhere.  He gave sworn testimony before the special inquiry the Minister set up and the evidence in the course of that inquiry was that three months before the houses collapsed in Fenian Street, killing two children, a crack of an inch wide or thereabouts was seen at the top of a house going several inches <Col N="1084" /> down and then growing day after day after that and nothing was done about it in the hope that all would be well, that no collapse would take place. Four people had to die before any serious attention was given to the problem of dangerous buildings.</P>
      <P>Times out of number, several councillors of Dublin Corporation&mdash;and these must include Deputy Burke if the Deputy is doing his duty&mdash;must have received complaints from people that they were living in dangerous buildings.  If his reputation is to be a deserved one, as I believe it is, Deputy Burke must have conveyed these representations to the Dublin Corporation and must have experienced as several councillors, including myself, experienced, an indifference on the part of the Corporation and receipt of the official reply that people could not be rehoused as the house in which they lived was not condemned.</P>
      <P>It was not condemned officially in accordance with the 1890 Act and because it had not been condemned under an Act implemented and enacted under the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty with the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons, then it could not be regarded by Dublin Corporation as being a case in urgent need of rehousing, and so we now have a problem in which over the past year one thousand families have been evicted from dangerous buildings, in which it is forecast that another four thousand will be evicted, and over the next five years another five thousand will be evicted, all because for 15 years the problem was neglected.  If that is not a condemnation of the powers that be, I do not know what is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Act of 1890 could have been better used all over the years and this piece of legislation is being introduced to bolster up a pretence and a piece of propaganda that has been engaged in for the past year that the powers Dublin Corporation had were not sufficient.  Let me deal with that.  If the 1890 Act was sufficient for the past year to deal with one thousand families in dangerous buildings, it was equally efficient to deal with it over the past 15 years, and if it had been implemented with reason and not with <Col N="1085" /> panic over all the years, then we would not have the situation we now have.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin here asked the question whether or not the Bill could be used so as to allow Dublin Corporation to go in and do some work on a particular building so as to enable that building to be used in future.  Of course, the Bill allows that and the Act of 1890 allowed that also and it was all too seldom used.  That is the manner in which the Act has been abused and I stand over that here and anywhere else. The Act of 1890 did not stop the Corporation or anybody else from removing the cause of danger in any house without requiring the whole house to be demolished.  It was perfectly permissible to serve notice under the 1890 Act and to bring the matter into court relating to any portion of a house and requiring that that portion of the house be put right, but that has not been done, or was hardly ever done, over the past year.  What has been done is to use and abuse this Act so as to demolish complete structures, even where the whole structure is not dangerous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will use my influence to make Deputy Ryan legal adviser to the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again and again we have had cases of Dublin Corporation dangerous buildings inspectors giving evidence in court that only particular portions of a building were dangerous, such as the upper storeys, the back wall or the front wall, the gable wall, or something of that kind, but not the whole structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On every occasion these cases come before the court, Dublin Corporation insist upon getting an order condemning the complete structure but those orders read that there was an obligation on the owner or in default, on the occupier or in default of both of those, then on the Dublin Corporation, to remove the danger to the satisfaction of the Dublin Corporation but what has been happening is that the Dublin Corporation have been allowing neglectful landlords who fail to preserve their property to use these orders to <Col N="1086" /> remove all people from those buildings and to demolish the whole building without paying compensation to anybody, throwing on to the local authority an obligation which the landlord should have fulfilled of providing proper living accommodation for those living in it and throwing out on to the streets, without payment of compensation, the unfortunate small hucksters, small shopkeepers, who made a decent, honest and honourable living in those buildings for many years.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely satisfied that a right of compensation for these people does not arise, even under the 1890 Act, but what I am particularly conscious of is that although several people in Dublin, including most respected clergymen, have drawn the attention of public representatives to the fact that compensation has not been paid to the vast majority of small shopkeepers, of whom Deputy Sherwin has admitted there are 71 within the past year, although we ought as a Christian Parliament to be introducing legislation to provide them with compensation in case there is any doubt about it, instead, we are removing away from all notion of compensation the very people who have suffered without any compensation whatever over the past year.</P>
    <P>In the 1890 Act, which this Bill seeks to replace, in section 7 it is provided:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this section shall affect any premises not used or intended to be used for human habitation except so much as shall form the frontage line of any street or compel the owner or occupier thereof to rebuild the same so long as the same are securely fenced in so as not to be prejudicial to the inhabitants therein or of the neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>The effect of that saving clause is that if the courts are aware the shop is being used for human habitation, a dangerous building order requiring its demolition and removal cannot now be made.  The effect is that a landlord who wants to re-develop a property and who may be able to get all the private inhabitants out is forced to pay compensation to the shopkeeper, so <Col N="1087" /> long as the shop is not demolished. It has been held by the courts that the landlord must serve notice to quit, and if the shop is in existence at the time of the service of this notice, a right of compensation automatically arises. The 1890 Act and orders made under it are being handed to unscrupulous owners of buildings, who have frightened shopkeepers out of their properties.  Many of these have gone without realising they had a right to stop the order being made in respect of their shops.</P>
    <P>In the case of a substantial number, if not the majority, of these dangerous buildings over the past year, as far as I am aware the Corporation would have been perfectly satisfied to have had only the upper storeys removed, leaving the shop portion there.  That was not done.  The evidence in more than one case has been that there was no danger in the shop portion on the ground floor.  Perhaps in the long run it is better municipal development to demolish the old structure and have a clean site to be developed.  That is all right, but there are certain moral obligations on us as a society not to permit legislation of this House to destroy the rights of private property, particularly where those are the rights of relatively poor people who have spent many years serving their neighbours in small shops in the tenement districts of Dublin.</P>
    <P>We will certainly have to table some serious amendments to this Bill and see to it in relation to those shops that they are still saved from the full effect of the proposed legislation.  We must make clear that compensation must be paid to these shopkeepers and paid by the person who should pay it&mdash;the owner of the property who had been receiving rent from the shopkeeper and had not been properly maintaining the building.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones referred to a provision under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, which says that it shall be an implied condition that a house at commencement of a tenancy will be kept by the landlord during the tenancy in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation.  It seems to <Col N="1088" /> me we should be providing that landlords of all properties should have an obligation imposed on them to maintain their property.  If a landlord is of opinion that a property cannot be maintained in a safe condition in future years, then he should not be permitted to let it.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Corporation Housing Department and the Dangerous Buildings Section are only too well aware of the significance of the submissions I am making here today. They have heard them from me times out of number and it does not require me to waste my time in a manner I could not possibly justify to the Man above Who made me by attending hot air meetings which are only an excuse and an alibi for inactivity and neglect over the years.  If the Minister feels Dublin Corporation are to blame for the present housing difficulties&mdash;and he has said so more than once&mdash;I invite him here and now to remove the alibi and the excuses and abolish Dublin Corporation, if it means that the people of Dublin will have better housing and <Col N="1089" /> we will have a more effective organisation for running the houses afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the alibis and excuses people are trying to make for bringing in panic legislation are not justified.  The members of the Housing Committee can have another special emergency meeting if they want to consider my contribution.  It will not disturb me.  If justice is done, it is more important.</P>
      <P>We come to another problem&mdash;to find out why we have difficulty in relation to dangerous buildings.  The 1890 Act imposes on Dublin Corporation certain obligations in relation to dangerous buildings.  In large measure, they have failed to discharge these obligations.  Again and again, when the Dangerous Buildings Section were asked to specify what work they wanted or what particular portions of the house were dangerous, they failed to be specific.  Instead of encouraging and assisting the owners and occupiers to put the house right, the Corporation left things too late until the building had become so dilapidated that there was no alternative but to apply for a court order for demolition.</P>
      <P>Another reason why we have the present crisis is that Dublin Corporation are not even now taking a reasonable course, that is, the course of shoring up many of the buildings alleged to be dangerous.  I know it would be unsightly to have our city festooned with buildings being shored up, many of which would protrude out on to the street and adjoining properties. If anything could be done to provide temporary accommodation for some of these unfortunate people, it would be desirable to do it, no matter how unsightly the building might be in the meantime.  This might allow us to catch up on the housing lag allowed to develop.  In the meantime, I cannot see why, even under existing legislation, steps could not be taken to shore up these buildings and prevent a bad situation getting any worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One section of the new Bill is useful <Col N="1090" /> if the Corporation would use it.  As I said, I believe existing legislation would have permitted them to take like action but now it is being spelled out to put it beyond doubt that the Corporation may require the owner to repair, or in default, may themselves repair, any part of a structure.  As I said earlier, there are often cases where only portion of a building is dangerous but at the moment even a defective chimney-breast is sufficient to condemn the whole building.  I see that the Minister is providing in the future that orders made by the Dublin Corporation may refer to part of the structure and I hope that provision will be properly used and that we will not have the situation in which a blanket order is made requiring the demolition of the whole structure to the satisfaction of the Corporation, and the Corporation failing to explain what would meet their satisfaction and thereby allowing unscrupulous landlords to demolish the whole building.</P>
    <P>I notice that we are to have two definitions of ownership, if we pass this Bill as drafted.  Section 6 of the Dublin Corporation Act, 1890 provides that in the provisions relating to neglected or dangerous structures or party structures, the term owner means the person in possession or in receipt of the whole of or any part of the rents or profits and so on.  Under the Bill, we are proposing that an&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;owner&rdquo; means any person (other than a mortgagee not in possession) who is for the time being entitled to sell or otherwise dispose of the fee simple of the land in relation to which the said word is used or any term of years for the time being subsisting in respect of the land of which the unexpired residue exceeds one year.</P>
    <P>At present the Corporation can serve notice on any person in receipt of the profits; under the new Bill this will not be adequate notice and instead of simplifying the Corporation's difficulty, or expediting action which can be taken in the case of a genuine dangerous building, we are imposing an obligation on the Corporation to serve only the owner.  The fact that they serve notice on the person receiving <Col N="1091" /> the rents or profits is not sufficient but there are many places owned by absentee landlords or by those who do not want their identities as landlords known.</P>
    <P>I notice in section 15 power is given to the Corporation to compel certain persons, including those in receipt of the rents and profits, to give such information as they may have to the Corporation but there are plenty of escape clauses, and I understand in relation to one case that came to my notice that the person in receipt of the rents did not know on whose behalf he was collecting them.  If we pass this Bill as drafted, then in such a case there is no action which the Dublin Corporation can take.  If the owner cannot be found, if the Corporation are unable to establish ownership, no action can be taken by the Corporation. That seems to me to be a most undesirable situation to permit.</P>
    <P>Under the 1890 Act, as Deputy Jones pointed out, there was a provision that the Lord Mayor or the Justice could require that people evicted from housing accommodation would be received into the local workhouse. That section applied today means that there is an obligation on the health authority to receive people into the temporary night shelter in Griffith Barracks, but instead of continuing that provision, grossly inadequate as it is, it is being repealed <i>in toto</i>, so that in future there will be no obligation on the Dublin Health Authority to provide even a night shelter for homeless people evicted from dangerous buildings.  Instead, a section is being put in which does not need to be written in, that is, that the local authority may if it thinks fit provide housing accommodation for people being evicted from dangerous buildings.</P>
    <P>At the moment Dublin Corporation where they see fit is providing housing accommodation for people being evicted from dangerous buildings but where they do not see fit, as they have not seen fit in about 400 cases since this alleged emergency began last June, at least there is an obligation <Col N="1092" /> on the Dublin Health Authority to provide shelter for women and children.  Husbands, however, are expected to sleep elsewhere, in a ditch or somewhere like that, wherever they can find a place to lie down. At least there is some semblance of a recognition that society has an obligation to these unfortunate people, but now apparently we are to take a step which is really a backward step and remove any obligation on the local health authority or the local assistance board even to provide night shelter for these unfortunate people. That seems to me to be an unpardonable step to take.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to be an expert on all aspects of local government law.  Somebody has described this as a jungle and as I move in more civilised circles than a jungle, some of the time I am not sure why we impose an obligation on a local sanitary authority instead of a local authority, and I should also be glad if the Minister would explain how a sanitary authority is involved in the question of dangerous buildings.  The Minister in his statement said that section 3 of the Bill covers dwellinghouses as well as other buildings. Why he put it in the way he did, I do not know.  Existing legislation covers dwellinghouses and therefore it is not news to say that it covers dwellinghouses.  Existing legislation provides exemption in relation to business dwellings and I should like to know what good reason the Minister has for not providing some exemption in relation to business premises or else spelling out that compensation should be paid.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that as many landlords will avail of every opportunity to avoid their responsibility for paying compensation, the obligation to pay the compensation should rest on the Dubin Corporation, if at their behest a building is being evacuated and demolished, and that thereafter the Corporation would have the right to recover the compensation paid from the owner.  In most cases the Corporation will have no difficulty in recovering the compensation because many, if not most, of the sites which carry <Col N="1093" /> dangerous buildings would be valuable sites if they were completely cleared and in many cases they would be more valuable than if they had derelict buildings on them.  It would seem desirable that where small shopkeepers have won certain rights by reason of their long stay, compensation should be paid.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with quarries and other dangerous places is to be welcomed.  I understand the reason for it is to provide local authorities with power to deal with dangerous places which are not adjoining public roadways or places of public access. Up to now the legal excuse has been that people were trespassing in crossing private property where there was a quarry or an excavation away from the public road, but as unfortunate children suffered in most cases, it was undesirable that we should permit owners of these dangerous places to use the ass of the law, as it were, to ride away from their own responsibilities.</P>
    <P>It strikes me, however, the Minister is not going far enough.  I can see endless arguments in certain places as to what constitutes a dump.  The extent to which a place would be used for the deposit of rubbish might determine whether or not it was a dump.  One problem which arises in Dublin and, I am sure, elsewhere and of which the Minister must be aware, is the location of places surrounding cities and towns for depositing old motorcar bodies.  If ever there was a dangerous place, a place where old motorcars are deposited is certainly an invitation to danger for children. There have been several accidents with children suffering serious disfigurement or the amputation of limbs as a result of playing around old motorcars.</P>
    <P>In some cases there may only be one or two cars, say, on the side of the road or on some piece of ground adjoining the side of the road.  If the local authority endeavour to remove these structures from ground adjoining a road, they may well be faced with a notice and with an effort to stop them because it was not a dump within the meaning of the Act.  The Minister <Col N="1094" /> should try to spell out more clearly the kind of place he has in mind so that any place in which dangerous rubbish, including motorcars, is deposited will be regarded as a dump.</P>
    <P>Again in Dublin city there are many private laneways, laneways which give access to the rear of houses and which have not been taken in charge by Dublin Corporation because they are not regarded as being of general public utility but simply of private utility.  In some cases, these laneways may lead to as many as 50 or more houses.  Many of the laneways have become most objectionable depositories of domestic and other rubbish and, as Deputy Dunne has mentioned, are often infested by vermin of many types.  It is desirable that some provision should be inserted in the definition section which will allow Dublin Corporation or any other local authority to clear up such objectionable places.</P>
    <P>There are also many cases in which some private gardens, particularly gardens where the boundary walls or fences are broken down, are being used as dumps either by the inhabitants or the adjoining occupiers.  I am doubtful if the definition, as broad as the Minister has tried to make it, will cover private gardens in cities.  It may well be it does but it is not clear enough.</P>
    <P>There is reference to reservoirs, ponds and streams but there is no reference to a canal.  There are many cases, certainly in Dublin, where the canal is used as a dump more than any pond or stream.  It is desirable that the Minister would include a provision in this Bill to permit the local authority to take action in relation to a canal, if that should be necessary, because I do not think CIE, who are custodians of the Grand Canal in Dublin, are taking adequate steps to prevent the canal being a danger.</P>
    <P>Passing along by the canal yesterday between Rialto and James's Harbour, I counted, as I was passing within the speed limit of 30 miles per hour, some four derelict cars parked either in the canal or on the bank and several children from the adjoining Dublin Corporation flats were passing <Col N="1095" /> in and out of them.  The Bill as drafted would not allow the Dublin Corporation to take action to clear away these derelict cars from that or any other stretch of the Grand Canal, but if somebody happened to turf these cars half a mile down the road into the Camac stream, apparently Dublin Corporation would have the power to remove them.  It seems unnecessary and undesirable not to include canals in this general definition section and I should hope the Minister would have second thoughts on the matter during the debate on this Bill.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, there are a few sections of the Bill to which I would ask the Minister to give consideration. I have already mentioned the difficulty which may face him in relation to ownership of dangerous buildings because he is restricting the definition of ownership, or perhaps it is that section 6 of the 1890 Act will still apply in relation to dangerous structures.  If so, that is satisfactory enough in relation to dangerous structures, but he requires that the sanitary authority in relation to a dangerous place shall serve notice on the owner.  The difficulty may arise in relation to some of these dangerous sites or dangerous places that the owner may not be easily ascertainable Section 2 (3) reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Whenever a sanitary authority give a notice under this section to any person, the authority shall, within seven days after giving the notice to the person, post a copy of the notice at or near the place to which it relates.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to provide that where the ownership of the property cannot be ascertained by reasonable inquiry, to use his own phraseology from section 3, that notice shall be deemed to have been given by the insertion of a notice in the newspapers circulating in the locality or by posting it at or near the place to which it relates.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems faced by the local authorities arise by reason of the difficulty in ascertaining owners; sometimes indeed owners possibly are uncertain as to whether or not they own <Col N="1096" /> the property.  In order to avoid any further undue delay in regard to the problem of dangerous places, I suggest a section such as that should be put in.  If the question of compensation arises and the owner is unknown, there is ample machinery to allow payment of a suitable amount into court or into some other fund which would be reserved until ownership has been established.</P>
    <P>In section 3, I notice that Dublin Corporation are apparently endeavouring to run away from the obligation which now lies on them to serve notice on occupiers in relation to dangerous buildings.  I can see difficulties in serving notice on owners when they are not known, but I cannot see any undue difficulty in serving a notice in relation to dangerous buildings on occupiers.  The people are either there or they are not, and I should be very suspicious about the way in which the section would be used if a local authority could give as an excuse that they made reasonable inquiries but were unable to ascertain the occupiers.  There again, rather than allow the local authority to avoid responsibility by such an escape clause, it ought to be provided that where the name of the occupier was in doubt a notice be affixed to the premises in question or to any part of the premises.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (1) (a) gives belated recognition to the fact that it is possible to divide a building into parts, stating what parts are dangerous and what parts are not.  It is satisfactory to have this division of buildings spelled out in this Bill.  In relation to section 3 (3) which requires that Dublin Corporation may specify that the works should be commenced forthwith and that they should also be carried out in accordance with such conditions, if any, specified in the notice, that will work satisfactorily only if Dublin Corporation are a little more co-operative than they have been in the past and take the trouble to specify in detail what works they need done, and not leave owners, occupiers and others in doubt day after day about what needs to be done.  What has arisen in the past is that the work has been done and has been found not to be to <Col N="1097" /> the satisfaction of Dublin Corporation and it has to be done again.  If they would only give written, detailed notice of what was required in the first instance, many of the difficulties would not have arisen.</P>
    <P>Section 3, subsection 10, will have to impose mandatory obligations on the local authority to provide living accommodation.  I think it will also have to provide for compensation to be paid where living accommodation is not offered.  That compensation clause must also include compensation for owners of businesses who themselves have not been in default.</P>
    <P>Section 5 says that the decision of the district court under this section shall be final and unappealable.  That is most undesirable.  What we are providing is that Dublin Corporation may serve notice without testing its validity or fairness.  They can serve a notice requiring things to be done.  If a person is aggrieved by the notice, he may move to have it set aside in the district court.  I am aware of the manner in which district courts work and of the burden of business imposed on them at any time.  I am acutely aware of the particular burden and stress of business in relation to dangerous buildings imposed on them at present in the present atmosphere of crisis and alarm. I am not entirely satisfied that you will get an absolutely objective verdict in such an atmosphere.</P>
    <P>I do not think it desirable that we should say that matters should not be appealable from the district court.  I can certainly see that it might be desirable to impose limits on the time in which an appeal can be taken and that we might say it should be taken within seven days, but I think we should not allow the matter to be determined beyond yea or nea in the district courts.  That is no reflection on these courts or on the capacity of the justices trying to reach a fair verdict but we must be realistic about this, and we should not make it possible for a situation to arise in which the atmosphere of crisis and alarm makes an objective verdict difficult to get, particularly where there is a conflict of expert evidence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" /> If you have a dangerous building inspector from Dublin Corporation who may not be a qualified engineer or architect giving evidence and on the other side, a qualified engineer or architect and the justice finds in favour of the unqualified person, I think it not unreasonable to say there should be another tribunal to review the matter.  Therefore, I think it not unreasonable to suggest the Minister should take another look at this section.</P>
    <P>Section 15 does not go far enough. It does not allow the serving of notice on persons in receipt of rents or profits in substitution for the owner.  On that account I think the Minister should amend it.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with the abstraction of water from ESB reservoirs does not call for comment, except to say that it is a great tribute to the Fine Gael Party that we have so many such reservoirs arising out of the electrification scheme, because if other people had had their way, there would not be so many places for the benefit of the water or electricity consumers. We are only too glad to see the great national asset that has been built up by dams and reservoirs being used by the people in a way that might not have been contemplated at the time the Electricity Act was going through.</P>

      <P>I want to say a word in relation to the contribution by Deputy Ryan.  I had not intended to intervene but it is only right that I should say something regarding the attack that he has again made on the Corporation of Dublin.  He has suggested that the Corporation neglected the Dublin housing problem for 15 years.  I have been a member of the Corporation for longer than that period and I know that a section was specially set up there, known as the Dangerous Buildings Section.  It was staffed by responsible officers and every request made not alone from sanitary inspectors in various areas but by public representatives was always investigated and appropriate action taken where necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I resent this sniping, from the protection <Col N="1099" /> of the House, against those who cannot defend themselves.  Deputy Ryan sniped at his own colleagues some time ago in Dublin Corporation and it is typical of him that he should indulge in these tactics.  I do not think it a very responsible way of dealing with public matters.  An inquiry was set up by the Minister for Local Government following the unfortunate occurrence 12 months ago and that inquiry took several days to examine the issues.  I attended and heard evidence there.  I was struck by the honest, forthright manner in which Corporation officials tendered their evidence. The inquiry justified their whole administration.  Deputy Ryan is a member of the Corporation but he did not offer to give evidence.  He has been a member of the House for a number of years prior to this but he did not offer to give evidence and charge the Corporation with neglecting their duties.  Indeed, he was strangely silent about housing matters. I suppose this was because of his knowledge that a number of years ago when his Party formed the Government, they went out of office in a bewildering situation where housing was concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">

      <P>The housing programme then had to fold up for lack of proper administrative and financial provisions by the Government the Deputy supported.  He has attacked people and sniped from protected and privileged places at people who cannot defend themselves.  The Corporation have had a very persistent problem in dealing with the whole city.  The evidence today shows that most of the structures that were condemned as unfit or in dangerous condition are scheduled or earmarked for re-development.  At the time the Corporation had no option but to attack the dangerous buildings problem as they did.  The steps they have taken will ensure that no more dangerous structures will be permitted to stand in the city.  It is not correct to <Col N="1100" /> say that Corporation officials go into court and seek complete demolition of houses and premises.  I know from my own experience and observation that they do not insist on complete demolition.  In Parnell Street and other streets around the centre of the city that are mostly affected by dangerous buildings operations, you find numerous shops still doing business while the rest of the premises have been removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <P>I regard this measure as being helpful to local authorities and particularly to Dublin Corporation with regard to dangerous buildings.  The Minister says he regards section 3 as giving power to the local authorities pending the new Housing Bill and it is to be welcomed for that reason, but I think he might have made provision for the small traders who are put out of business overnight, due to their premises being found unsafe.  If it is not possible to make provision for compensation in this measure, I hope he will make some such provision in the new housing legislation.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the provision regarding quarries.  There has been a series of tragedies to many citizens down through the years, not only in outlying areas but also in built-up areas. The Bill gives power to local authorities to take control of the private interests involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that the time for this debate is limited and I will not detain the House any longer than is necessary.  We welcome this Bill for the reason that it proposes to give local authorities the necessary power to safeguard the lives of people from the dangers of such places as are specified in it.  At the same time, I am concerned as to whether local authorities <Col N="1101" /> will avail of the Bill or whether they may feel they have not enough money to implement its very desirable provisions.  We have all heard from time to time of the tragedies, the loss of life involved in these cases, quarries, ponds, reservoirs, streams and dumps all over the country.  We are perturbed about the unsightly and dangerous buildings in our cities and towns. These are a heritage that have come down to us and many parties and personalities must take responsibility for them.</P>
      <P>It was disconcerting to me to learn that once the resources of a quarry have been worked out, the quarry does not seem to be the responsibility of anybody.  In this respect local authorities would seem, in the main, to be the people who utilise these quarries, sand pits and gravel pits.  It is to the discredit of these authorities that so many of these places are left in such a dangerous condition.  It seems to me that having utilised the resources of these places, the local authorities were satisfied to honour their agreements with the owners and pull out without making such places safe.</P>
      <P>In this Bill vast powers are being conferred on local authorities to ensure that the ordinary citizen shall comply with the law but I want to pose the question to the Minister: what steps is he taking under this Bill to ensure that the local authorities themselves will honour their obligations and discharge their responsibilities in respect of the many things which are objected to and which we seek to remedy.  I contend that local authorities have themselves been guilty of dereliction of duty in regard to the manner in which they left these places.  We all know that county councils have left quarries open and dangerous to the lives of the sheep and cattle of the farmer on whose lands the quarry is situated and also to human life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the dangerous buildings and sites referred to in the measure, I am also concerned that again the local authorities are, in the main, responsible for the condition of these buildings.  We have in our towns and cities many State and local authority <Col N="1102" /> buildings which are in a dilapidated condition.  In most of our bigger towns and cities, we have old derelict barracks handed down from the British regime which are now in a dangerous state.  These buildings would seem to be in the ownership of certain State Departments, Defence, Finance or Local Government, as the case may be, and these Departments seem to be doing nothing to renovate or demolish these old and unsightly buildings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have many ancient buildings and monuments in our country and again the Board of Works or whichever body is responsible appears to be unwilling to take them over.  Many of them are in a state of disrepair and decay and are dangerous to people going near them, especially children, with their tendency to climb. Before we prescribe what the general public should do with regard to their property, it behoves this House to say to these State Departments that they should have a look at their property and satisfy themselves that they have no dangerous quarries, dumps, reservoirs, streams or buildings.  Then perhaps we would be giving a good example to owners of private property.</P>
      <P>The permission to be sought by the ESB under this Bill is another welcome provision.  Talking about the ESB, I would appeal to the Minister to do what he can to ensure that overhead transmission lines cease to be spreadeagled over the country.  These cables should be underground.  They are so unsightly they should be eliminated altogether from the landscape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulty of dealing with condemned dwellings.  One has to be virtually standing on the door-step when the last piece of furniture goes out in order to board up the building to prevent another tenant or a squatter going in.  Squatting is quite a common practice.  I appeal to the Minister to have a look at the legislation in regard to that and do what he can to assist local authorities in gaining possession of these condemned houses out of which they are rehousing people.  A <Col N="1103" /> more expeditious way of coping with the situation is required.</P>
    <P>Local authorities in many cases have not as yet carried out the housing survey, an obligation placed upon them by the Minister some years ago.  Many local authorities are themselves responsible for the shocking state of affairs in relation to condemned buildings and derelict sites.  They have been dealing with this problem in a haphazard manner, despite the admonitions of the Department of Local Government.  The position now is that there is a rotten core of derelict buildings and sites with tragic loss of life on occasions.  Had the Minister had the responsibility, I am sure he would long ago have rectified this sorry situation.</P>
    <P>Local authorities should have been assisted before now to carry out repairs. They have power under section 19 of the Housing Act but this was a cumbersome piece of legislation and very little availed of.  Problems of maintenance arose and most local authorities abandoned altogether the idea of invoking section 19 where landlords failed to keep houses in a habitable condition.  The repair grants have been helpful in preserving many houses.  Indeed, in the absence of these grants, I shudder to think what the situation might be.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that created by the removal of people out to the perimeter of cities and towns, leaving derelict sites in the heart of these towns and cities.  Business people complain bitterly about the loss of revenue.  Main streets and other streets have been allowed to fall into decay with unsightly buildings and derelict spaces a chronic eyesore.  The Minister must take cognisance of this quite serious problem.</P>
    <P>I trust local authorities will implement this measure as quickly as possible.  Pretty strict provisions make it possible to bring private citizens to book.  Local authorities must also be held responsible.  Where we make demands on people in regard to houses or quarries, or anything else, strict justice demands that compensation should be paid.  I have been <Col N="1104" /> perturbed hearing about so many people dispossessed of their property and their business without any compensation being paid.  That is a callous and patently unfair attitude.  People who are deprived of a means of livelihood should be compensated for that loss.  I and my Party welcome this Bill.  If it results in the saving of even one life, it will have been well worthwhile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be said that this Bill has certain shortcomings and defects, but, at the same time, it is only fair to say that it is a Bill that should be welcomed in so far as it is designed to remove the more serious dangers and hazards which exist and have existed for quite a number of years.  There are certain things I do not quite understand.  The Bill refers to the &ldquo;authority&rdquo; and to the &ldquo;sanitary authority&rdquo;.  I do not know what is meant.  In County Dublin, is the county council the sanitary authority? The health inspectors are under the health authority.  Sewerage and water are under the county council.  I am at a loss to know who is really responsible under this Bill.  I assume it is the county council because in every effort we made to remove the dangers, within the existing law, it was the county council which acted.  I assume that, while it is the sanitary authority that is specified in this Bill, it is the county council that is meant.</P>
      <P>In that regard, I should like the Minister to specify whether or not &ldquo;the authority&rdquo; means the members of the authority or the manager, in relation to the actions that must be taken and the decisions which must be made under this Bill because I think that is fairly important.  Very often the members of a local authority have a local knowledge regarding the dangers which may exist in a particular area that certainly is much more intimate than the knowledge the manager or his officials can have.  If the power lies in their hands, action will be taken.  They are the people who have to face the ratepayers and in such cases are prepared to face them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For years, there has been an extraordinary danger in County Dublin in regard to which I pressed the Minister <Col N="1105" /> some considerable time ago to introduce legislation to deal with it.  I refer to the danger involved in quarries, rivers and canals.  Incidentally, canals are not mentioned in the Bill.  Another Deputy has drawn attention to that matter.  My personal opinion is that town planning legislation with retrospective application would be more appropriate for dealing with these hazards.  I see no reason why this should not be made a planning responsibility because most of the dangers which exist at the present time are a result of the fact that the town planning authority permitted the development of communities around these dangerous places and while these places were not at all dangerous when they were part of the countryside they have now become serious hazards and we have had no power to deal with them.  It was considered that there was sufficient power under the Derelict Sites Act, which has proved to be completely erroneous.</P>
    <P>It was not to be expected that we would come up against people so unreasonable as to prevent the local authority from going in and filling, at enormous expense, quarries that have claimed the lives of a number of children.  It was inconceivable to me as a human being but it is quite obvious that there are extraordinary people in the world and that exceptional measures are needed when we meet such people in order to safeguard society.</P>
    <P>The existing law, as I know it, gave power only to fence adequately a quarry that bounded the roadside.  It was very difficult to know exactly where the application of that law began and ended because a quarry might be only a very short distance from the road while it could be said that it did not adjoin the road.</P>
    <P>If a community is allowed to develop in an area it is an impossibility to keep children from crossing fields and getting into dangerous places.  I am very pleased that this Bill seems to give fairly adequate powers to the local authority.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill falls short in this respect, that, as I read it, it does not give the local authority power to move <Col N="1106" /> in as an emergency measure and fence off the dangerous place.  A child may be lost in a quarry today.  The local authority should be empowered on that day or the following day without notice, without recourse to the law, to walk in and fence adequately such a hazard, at least at their own expense.</P>
    <P>I regret that it is a defect in the Bill that canals are not mentioned.  Neither are seaside cliffs mentioned.  A number of lives have been lost over seaside cliffs in the Dublin region and these should be included among the hazards covered in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Dumps are mentioned where they constitute a hazard.  It is very difficult to define where a dump may be a dangerous place.  What is meant in that respect?  Is it a danger to health?  Is it a danger to life and limb?  Somebody referred to objects such as old cars, tins, bottles and all the rest that may be in a dump.  Is that the type of danger that is envisaged or is it a health danger?  I have in mind a dump in a private developer's area which has given Dublin County Council considerable trouble for a number of years and with which we appear to have inadequate power to deal.  It is difficult to get a county medical officer to go out and to say that there is a real danger to health involved when everybody is convinced that it is a rat infested dump in which there are old motor cars and tins containing paint and other material.  All this material is allowed to mount up until the dump is a positive nuisance and an eyesore. Then, when all the pressure is brought to bear, the developer, feeling that he must move at that stage, makes some effort to clean it up but not a genuine effort; the dumping is allowed to continue and the hazard remains.</P>
    <P>I should like matters of that sort to be cleared up in the Bill.  I should like to see danger defined.  It is all right to put a phrase into the Bill but it is extremely difficult to get the officers of the local authority to say definitely and categorically, in the knowledge that they have the law behind them, that a danger exists and they have the power to insist that it is removed.</P>
    <P>That is probably all I have to say <Col N="1107" /> in relation to quarries and rivers and that type of danger.  Adequate protection should be provided.  I am concerned about the fact that the authority can move in and do this work and decide the amount of contribution they will require from the owner of the property.  That is a serious provision. How is that to be calculated?  There should be some specification about this because in many cases the owners of dangerous quarries might have become the owners through accident rather than design.  As Deputy Treacy has said, if one were to go back far enough, one might find that it was the local authorities who used the materials from these quarries to build houses and roads in the past and have been responsible for their existence.  It is not quite fair to leave it to the authority to decide the contribution to be made by the owner.</P>
    <P>Again, who is the authority?  Is it to be left to the manager to decide what will be expected as a fair contribution from the owner of the property or can the owner say to the local authority: &ldquo;If you want that much money from me, I consider that the game is not worth the candle and you can have the lot&rdquo;?  If that is the position, fair enough, that is all right, and the property owner is sufficiently safeguarded in this respect but I think it could result in a great deal of confusion and perhaps in hardship if there were an unreasonable approach to this question.</P>
    <P>Dangerous buildings do not concern me very much as a local representative, but I have heard the concern expressed in relation to the total demolition of certain houses.  I am entirely in favour of total demolition. I would hate to see the top taken off a house and the shop portion left. That could not be regarded as the proper way of using expensive city sites.  But, having said that, I say there should be no attempt to remove a small shopkeeper until adequate alternative accommodation is provided for him and until he is generously compensated. This is the cause of very great hardship and upset to many families in Dublin at present.  The <Col N="1108" /> same applies in the case of dwellings which have to be vacated because they are dangerous.  I know families who have been in dwellings for the best part of their lives, where it broke their hearts to have to break up the home.  They are removed, and I am afraid there is an effort being made to remove them without having reasonable accommodation to offer them. That is deplorable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan deplored the fact that this legislation appears to remove from health authorities the obligation of providing night shelter accommodation for those removed from dangerous buildings.  I have a very definite view about this.  I think it is completely wrong that a health authority, which has no housing function whatever and has no means of providing houses, should be obliged to provide night shelter accommodation on behalf of the housing authority that has failed in its obligations to its own people.  It is altogether wrong to throw the onus from the housing authority to the health authority, and then comment adversely on the adequacy of the temporary accommodation provided in such circumstances.  In that instance the health authority is being turned into a housing authority.  If temporary night shelter accommodation is needed, and it is not a question of sickness or the normal type of vagrant but merely a question of the occupants of these houses being thrown out on the street, it is an obligation which rightly belongs to the housing authority and should be left with it.</P>
    <P>This is a piece of legislation long overdue.  I have been disappointed for a long time that no adequate powers were sought to deal with these dangers and remove them.  It is unfortunate that we must first have a serious accident history before this type of legislation is introduced.  In so far as it deals with the dangers constituted by canals, quarries, dumps, seaside cliffs and so on, I should like to see it passed through the Oireachtas with all possible speed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Clinton is a bit optimistic if he thinks this Bill will measure up to all his requirements. <Col N="1109" /> All the important sections are permissive only; they are not mandatory at all.  Sections 2, 3, and 4 begin by saying the sanitary authority &ldquo;may&rdquo;. Deputy Treacy rightly asked if this Bill will be adopted by local authorities. Whom do we mean by local authorities: the county manager or the elected representatives?  Will this Bill be a reserved function of the county manager?  The Minister has not told us exactly where this power will lie.</P>
      <P>The local authority or the sanitary authority may serve notice.  Does that mean they can select various properties and ignore others in the same council area?  We know that the Corporations in Dublin, Limerick and Cork are very substantial landlords themselves.  I know well that all their property is not as fit as it might be. Are they going to take action against themselves?  This Bill does not say any such thing.  It says they may if they think fit.</P>
      <P>On the question of dangerous quarries, everybody agrees that protection for youngsters is absolutely essential.  It is a terrible outrage that houses should be allowed to exist in such a condition that they fell down and caused the deaths of innocent people.  Again, we are not told if they were the property of landlords and, if so, what action was taken.  The whole question is bristling with difficulty. Can we not admit that the dereliction of many houses in Dublin was due to the fact that the landlords were looked on as public enemy No. 1? Any man who was a landlord was regarded almost as being a public enemy.  When Deputy Ryan referred to rents and profits, he could have stopped at the word &ldquo;rents&rdquo; because the profits were not of a very substantial nature in a great number of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I am not at all happy about the whole situation, nor do I consider that this Bill will meet the requirements of the various authorities or of the people.  I am also disturbed about the question of compensation. It does appear that a dangerous building may be declared derelict or it may be declared necessary <Col N="1110" /> for street widening purposes and then compensation is paid, but if the local authority sees fit, it may declare the building although it is required for street widening, to be a dangerous building and say that it must come down and then no compensation will be paid.  I want to know where we are going to go with this type of administration.</P>
    <P>I know of a person who came to this city from the country, a person who rendered valuable service to the country in 1920-21 and who then opposed the new State when it was established and has a service certificate for 1922, 1923 and 1924 as well as for the years from 1917, 1918, 1919 and 1920.  This person, a lady, bought a house which the Corporation took over and agreed to pay £800 compensation but then the lady got a bill for £1,100 for demolition and she owed the Corporation £300 instead of having a house.  I do not know how that type of equity can be justified.  I hold no brief for this person but I was shocked to learn that a person can legitimately own property today and then find the next day that instead of having property worth £800&mdash;that was the Corporation's figure which I do not accept as reasonable&mdash;he owes the Corporation £300.  That seems to be unreasonable on the face of it and I cannot understand it.  The Minister is aware of the case and I am mentioning it because of the dangers that are apparently inherent in administration such as this.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Treacy was speaking I interjected the words &ldquo;public monuments&rdquo;. I do not want to develop that point but there are Departments such as the Board of Works, Defence and others who have dangerous buildings. Apparently they can have these unsightly buildings as long as they want to and I suppose the best we can do is have them as monuments.  I will leave it at that.  In my opinion, this Bill will not serve the purpose for which it is alleged it is intended.  The Government can say: &ldquo;We have done something about this; we have passed this Bill&rdquo;, and then the inference is that everything will be all right.  I hope it will but I am not too happy about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a wide variety of views on this Bill, ranging from those who really welcome it and think it will do more than I expect it to do down to the extreme view of the last speaker who thinks it will not do very much at all.  I shall deal first with the points raised by Deputy Jones.  He wanted to know why the sanitary authority is named rather than the local authority.  The primary reason, without going into any other reason, is that the sanitary authority is used to keep in line with the Public Health (Sanitary Services) Acts of which this Bill is really an extension. In that context I would refer the House to Section 23 of this Bill which indicates that this is really an extension of existing laws running over a number of years and is not and should not be regarded as an entity in itself.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jones also referred to the Public Health Act, 1907 and other speakers also mentioned matters related to this as well.  Some speakers held that the 1907 Act and other Acts were capable of doing all that is proposed to be done here and asked why did we need this Bill at all.  The first and really worthwhile difference is that in dealing with dangerous places, power existed only in so far as they were dangerous places along the public way or abutting on the public way.  Dangerous buildings inside private property could not be dealt with, as we found out very recently in very definite terms.</P>
      <P>So far as the terms of this Bill are concerned, there is that material difference, that it sets out to remedy a situation which we know exists in so far as dangerous places on private property are concerned which were not covered by existing law, whether the 1907 Health Act or any other law.  If the introductory remarks I made are adverted to, it will be even clearer what is intended in this Bill additional to what exists at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jones also expressed the fear, which was almost taken up by a chorus of others, that the proposed power in this Bill may be availed of <Col N="1112" /> by landlords to get rid of their tenants. That, to my mind, immediately brings into play the belief that there would be connivance between the local authority and these unscrupulous landlords, that the landlord would deliberately allow his property to become run down and then approach his local authority who, willy-nilly, would condemn the property so that he could clear the tenants out and then exploit as he wished what might be a very valuable and well-located site.  I do not go along with that type of reasoning.</P>
    <P>If we are to have any regard for the local authority, any regard for them as reasonable people&mdash;and surely we must have in view of all the powers vested in them&mdash;we cannot reasonably take this view that they will deliberately let themselves be used by unscrupulous people who would wish to use the provisions of this Bill to suit their own purposes.  That is something we should not countenance.</P>
    <P>However, that is certainly not my outlook and if it were, I would not propose to give these powers to any local authority but would proceed forthwith to abolish, one by one, all local authorities.  There may be reasons why in certain cases members of local authorities may not be all we would wish them to be but no group of people in any walk of life is perfect in this or any other country.  There might not be much in them as individuals but collectively a local authority has, I believe, great worth and a capacity to get to the centre of its problems in a way that can surprise one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, if something happens of which he can avail, he will take advantage.  He will do that anyway.  We cannot possibly legislate for the wide boys.  There is an odd one who will get away with it but, generally speaking, they do not get away with it for very long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> Deputy Jones also mentioned section 29 and other sections of the 1931 Housing Act.  These sections are not being interfered with and we are not taking away any powers in this Bill that existed under that Act.  Therefore, the Deputy need not worry that anything is being done in this Bill to weaken the resolve of local authorities to get rid of slums.  It is not the intention there should be any lessening of effort on the part of local authorities to wipe out the last slum, of which unfortunately there are far too many both in the large and small towns throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne was anxious to know what the definition of a dangerous place was and whether &ldquo;a dump&rdquo;, as we commonly call it, which may be a danger to health comes within the powers proposed in this measure. Dangers to health do not come within this enactment.  Rather should they be dealt with under the existing legislation in the general public health code.  It could well be that a dump might be a physical danger.  If that is so, there is no reason why the provisions of this Bill should not be applied to it. If a dangerous quarry can be fenced off, a dump which can be said to be a physical danger can also be fenced off.</P>
    <P>What we should remember about dumps is that 99 times out of 100 they are located in particular places for the convenience of the public, and are usually in the ownership of the local authority, who, as has been said here earlier, should be very diligent about ensuring that their property, under this enactment or any other enactment, is dealt with in an exemplary way and that they should not seek to have private persons do in respect of their property what the local authority is not prepared to do in respect of public property.  That is something to which I fully subscribe and where it can be pointed out to me that a local authority is not doing its duty.  I should certainly take issue with it immediately on this or any other matter within its jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne and others mentioned the canal and inquired whether or not it could be dealt with under this enactment <Col N="1114" /> as a dangerous place.  If any part of the canal were considered to be a danger, there is no reason why it should not be protected, certainly its most dangerous parts where a number of lives have been lost one year after another.  The fact that it happens to be the canal does not prevent the Dublin Corporation or any other local authority from dealing with it in the same way as they would deal with my property or that of any other Deputy. In so far as it is dangerous to life and limb, it can be dealt with, the most dangerous parts of it, particularly, can be dealt with under this enactment. However, whether the whole length of the canal could be so regarded and fenced off on both sides for its entire length is a different matter altogether and one about which we should like to hear a little more.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin was anxious to know whether or not any of the proposed powers in this measure would enable the sanitary authority to require the owner to carry out works to prevent a building from being in a dangerous condition or being a dangerous structure.  This may be done and if the owner does not comply, the local sanitary authority may, on application to the court, be authorised to do these works.  The Deputy mentioned &ldquo;habitable condition&rdquo;.  While &ldquo;habitable&rdquo; has not been used in the context of the measure before us, it is only fair to say that where a dwelling is regarded as dangerous, and suitable action is taken to leave it in a non-dangerous condition, then I take it it could be regarded as habitable, more so than it was before the repair was carried out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the procedure in regard to finding the owner, stating that in some cases it would be difficult, if not impossible, to find him. I would be with him there but for the fact that under section 18, subsection (1) (b), I think we deal with it fairly satisfactorily.  There is also subsection (2) of that section which provides that notice may be served by affixing to the dangerous structure a notice.  Where an owner cannot be ascertained by reasonable inquiry, the <Col N="1115" /> notice may be given by posting it at or near the place or structure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy mentioned the problem of re-occupation of condemned houses.  That is a problem to which a solution is proposed in this Bill by which the local authority generally will be enabled to prevent re-occupation. That is something which was long needed, and I should like to see it in operation, because I believe that if we had this power vested in local authorities over the years, we would not have reached the point recently of having so many people in so many extremely bad buildings which were dangerous to the point of falling down. It is probably true that if the history of all our dangerous buildings were examined so far as their function as dwellings is concerned, in the great majority of cases, it would be found that subsidies have been paid for the clearance of those same buildings in some year or another in the past 20 or 30 years.  But in one way or another tenants have crept back into them and are now creating the problem which has arisen because of their present condition.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin mentioned particularly the lack of obligation on the local authority to do anything in respect of their own property under this Bill.  I feel they will do what is necessary themselves, but if they are loth to do it and at the same time, require others to do it, I should be glad to be made aware of such local authorities so that we might investigate the complaint further.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton thought that owners of dangerous quarries and such places should not be left, as it were, to the mercy of the local county manager to determine on his own the amount of contribution that might be demanded from an owner in respect of any work carried out on his property. I do not think that fear will have much reality or that there is any great danger of widespread abuse through managers making undue demands on quarry-owners, particularly as each manager usually has a number of local elected representatives who have no inhibitions about <Col N="1116" /> letting him know what they think of his decisions and of himself.  If back-scratching in local authorities has succeeded to the point where managers can do what they want to do without criticism then we would certainly need to change the whole local administration code.  I do not believe back-scratching has become such a national pastime with our local authorities and certainly if it did, or appeared to be reaching that point, I as Minister would be very quick to take action to ensure that would no longer be an occupation that was attractive either to officials or elected members.</P>
    <P>Several members mentioned small shopkeepers and I have an amendment which will probably go down in the rough form in which I have it.  I have been in consultation with a number of local authorities, particularly Dublin Corporation, to get their views on it, with the result that I have not had it in time to insert it in the Bill, but in all probability, I shall have it down for Committee Stage.  If the House are prepared to give me the Committee Stage today, I shall be prepared to undertake to have the section to which the amendment relates recommitted on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the problem created by these people.  I see it clearly and I should like to ensure that something could be done for them.  One thing that I think is overlooked to a large extent, is that where there has been an evacuation of population, as often happens&mdash;because if you have one house falling down, it is probable that the whole street is in somewhat the same condition&mdash;taking down the building to the ground floor and leaving the shop might seem to be in most cases quite satisfactory, but if you have taken away all the people under this or some other enactment, you have removed from that area the source of livelihood for the shopkeeper, even though you have left him the shop.</P>
    <P>The amendment sought by Deputies and which I shall probably produce takes cognisance only of shopkeepers who have been removed entirely and I am still rather puzzled as to what the situation should be in regard to the shopkeeper who is left in the first <Col N="1117" /> storey of his premises, which is safe enough, but everybody else is gone. It will not do him much good, even if he is left in possession of the last storey.  That is a problem on which members of the House might have some helpful suggestions to make and it is as much of a problem as is the removal of the premises in which the small shop exists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan, among other things, mentioned panic legislation.  I would not agree with him.  I agree this is legislation that was needed for some time but that does not put it into the panic category, nor do I agree that it should be put there.  Deputy Ryan was also concerned about the 1931 Housing Act and I gathered from what he said he feared we may be tampering with some of the powers contained therein.  That is not the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was suggesting we might incorporate in this Bill the legal presumption that a house is in tenantable condition or that there is an obligation on the landlord to keep it in that way.</P>

      <P>If there are views on this held by members who have had particular experience, particularly legal people who have been dealing with such matters over the years, I should be glad to hear from them, not necessarily in this debate but privately or otherwise, so that I might remedy any defects that may now exist under the new Housing Bill.  There is still time to do that without upsetting it in any way and I invite members who may hold views on that aspect of the matter to let me have these views as soon as convenient to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins raised a matter rather far removed from the immediate terms of this Bill but it was so <Col N="1118" /> smoothly brought in that I do not think anyone could have ruled it out of order.  It was the question of re-opening the matter of the compensation paid by the ESB to the families removed from the valley at Valleymount now covered by water.  He said that while the people who were removed did get compensation, there were many asides overlooked and that people who formerly could walk across the valley now have to go around to get to the Churches and schools and are so put to extra inconvenience and cost.</P>
    <P>I have heard something about this but I think it is being pursued with another Department at the moment so there is nothing I wish to say about it, except that the suggestion that I should consider extending section 4 to cover this and other such matters is one that I am not inclined to accept.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne says that law advisers differ greatly in their interpretations. If they did not do that, there would not be so many of them.  They do give different interpretations and nobody knows that better than the lawyers who are members of this House.  One of our difficulties is that the legal advisers who seem to be the exception in certain interpretations would appear to recur all the time.  If any of them happens to take an exceptional interpretation from one Act, you will find the same people making exceptions of themselves in interpretations of other measures also.</P>
    <P>All I can say about this is that the legal advisers of local authorities are there to interpret the law.  They are employed by the local authorities and surely they should have regard to the wishes of the local authorities and to the spirit of the law they are interpreting. They should first and foremost have allegiance to the local authority, and instead of standing up and pointing out the pitfalls in the way of doing certain things, they should set about finding out the way in which these things can be done.  They should do that instead of standing up at the council meetings and saying: &ldquo;You cannot do this&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the reason why the various differences arise that give so much <Col N="1119" /> trouble to our local authorities and put them out of line with each other so that while ten of them will do a thing in a certain way without any upheaval, the legal adviser of the eleventh body will tell them that they cannot do it in that way.  If they spent themselves a little bit more in the direction of those who employ them, a great lot of the difficulties caused by different interpretations would disappear. I hope this will be so and I merely put it on record as my own view as to how some of these difficulties might be got over without breaking the law.</P>
    <P>That is about all I have to say on the Bill except that in so far as the small shopkeepers are concerned, we have an amendment which we are bringing forward on a later stage.  In case I might have any change of mind about that, it would be as well for me to indicate to Deputies that it would be well for them to put something in. At the moment my intention is that an amendment in that regard should be brought to the House and that it will deal, as far as is reasonable, with the cases of these people.</P>
    <P>The three matters dealt with in the Bill are fairly urgent.  They are all necessary and have been sought, desired and asked for by members of this House and of local authorities.  If there are any parts of the Bill that are not clear and if members think they could be improved by amendments, I will be glad to hear from them.  So far as I am concerned, this Bill has been gone through carefully and we are satisfied that the three main points we wish to cover are covered in it.  I hope the House will deal with the Bill as expeditiously as possible.</P>

Is méadú £250 é sin ar an soláthar a bhí ann don bhliain 1963-64 agus is é is mó is cúis leis sin ná cránacha de chaighdeán níos áirde bheith á soláthar.

Ó cuireadh tús leis an scéim sa bhliain 1958 tógadh nó leathnaíodh 8 meánscoileanna sna limistéirí Gaeltachta le cabhair ón Roinn.  Cuireadh deontais os cionn £42,000 san íomlán ar fáil mar chabhair do na meánscoileanna sin.</P>
    <P>Tá soláthar £7,500 á dhéanamh i bhFo-Mhírcheann E (8) i mbliana le haghaidh hallaí siamsa.  Faoin scéim seo tugtar deontas de 80% den chostas nó £5,000, pé acu is lú, mar chabhair chun halla siamsa a thógáil, a fheabhsú, a leathnú nó a fheistiú. Íocadh deontais arbh fhiú tuairim £21,000 iad san iomlán faoin scéim ó cuireadh tús léi sa bhliain 1960-61 agus fuair 12 hallaí tairbhe na ndeontas sin.  Tógadh 3 hallaí nua faoin Scéim agus tá dhá cheann eile á dtógáil faoi láthair.  Deisíodh dhá halla agus tugadh cabhair i 5 cásanna eile chun fearaistí éagsúla a cheannach. Cúis áthais dom a fheiscint go bhfuil úsáid á bhaint as an scéim seo ag cuid de na háiteanna is mó tábhacht ó thaobh na Gaeilge, mar shampla, Inis Meán, Inis Thiar, an Cheathrú Rua, an Tulach agus Oileán Toraí.  Tá súil agam go mbainfidh muintir na Gaeltachta <Col N="1124" /> tuilleadh feidhme as an scéim seo sna blianta atá romhainn.</P>
    <P>Déantar soláthar faoi Fho-Mhírcheann F den Mheastachán le haghaidh deontas d'imeachtaí cultúrtha agus sóisialacha&mdash;mar shampla, deontais le haghaidh feiseanna, féilte drámaíochta nó d'fhonn scoláireachtaí Gaeltachta a bhronnadh ag feiseanna agus cabhair a thabhairt do choistí áitiúla sa Ghaeltacht chun oirnéisí ceoil, téipthaifeadáin nó a leithéid a cheannach.</P>
    <P>D'fhonn cabhrú le daltaí meánscoile sna limistéirí Gaeltachta a mbíonn turasanna fada le déanamh acu i ndáil lena gcuid scolaíochta ceapadh scéim sa bhliain 1961 faoina dtugtar deontais bhliantúla, suas go dtí £500 in aghaidh na scoile, chun cabhrú le húdaráis meánscoile sna limistéirí sin seirbhís iompair a chur ar fáil do dhaltaí lae.  Leasaíodh an scéim anuraidh le go bhféadfaí buntáistí na scéime a thabhairt do dhaltaí Gaeltachta a dhéanann freastal ar chúrsaí lae sna gairmscoileanna.  Tá soláthar sa scéim freisin faoina bhféadfar teacht i gcabhair i gcásanna áirithe ar dhaltaí ó na limistéirí Gaeltachta a mbíonn orthu freastal ar mheánscoil nó ar ghairmscoil atá gairid dóibh ach nach bhfuil suite sna limistéirí Gaeltachta ar choinníoll, ámh, nach mbeidh scoil oiriúnach ar fáil dóibh sa Ghaeltacht féin.  Soláthar £10,000 atá á dhéanamh i bhFo-Mhírcheann G don ghnó seo i mbliana, sé sin, méadú de £1,000 ar an soláthar a rinneadh don bhliain 1963-64.</P>
    <P>Cúis sásaimh dom a fheiscint go bhfuil 26 scoileanna ag baint tairbhe as an scéim seo sa scoilbhliain reatha i gcomparáid le 11 sa bhliain roimhe sin.  Tá suim £1,250 á sholáthar faoin bhFo-Mhírcheann seo chomh maith i leith seirbhísí tarchuir idir Oileán Cléire agus Dún na Séad.  Is le haghaidh chothabháil an bháid tarchuir atá an t-airgead sin ag teastáil.</P>
    <P>Níl aon athrú ó anuraidh ar an soláthar £48,000 sa Deontas £5 agus ní dóigh liom gur gá éinní speisialta a rá ina thaobh.</P>
    <P>Tá suim £100,000 á cur ar fáil mar dheontas-i-gcabhair do Ghaeltarra Éireann arís le haghaidh na bliana 1964-65.  Cuirtear an t-airgead seo ar fáil chun caiteachas reatha an Bhoird a shlánú; caitear é chun riaradh ar <Col N="1125" /> ghnóthaí de shaghas scéimeanna printíseachta agus tréineála agus forbartha chomh maith le freastal ar aon uireasa a tharlaíonn sna gnáth-chúrsaí trádála.</P>
    <P>Mar a foráltar san Acht faoinar bunaíodh Gaeltarra Éireann is féidir airgead a chur ar fáil don Bhord ón bPríomh-Chiste le haghaidh cuspóirí caipitil, agus sa bhliain seo caite cuireadh iomlán de £75,000 ar fáil chuige sin.  Aisíocann an Bord an t-airgead sin agus ús air.  Ón uair a bunaíodh an Bord tá iomlán de £290,000 tugtha ar airleacan dó, agus tá an t-iomlán a bhí dlite go dtí deireadh Márta seo caite aisíoctha cheana, sé sin, £43,026 idir bhunairgead agus ús.</P>
    <P>I mí Lúnasa seo caite do leagadh Tuarascáil agus Cuntais an Bhoird don bhliain 1962-63 faoi bhráid gach Tí den Oireachtas.  Do thaispeáin siad go raibh méadú de thimpeall £53,500 sna díolacháin thar mar a bhí sa bhliain roimhe sin agus go raibh méadú de thimpeall £21,500 sa phá a híocadh leis na hoibrithe sna hionaid táirgthe. Tá ráite sa Tuarascáil gur tosaíodh sa bhliain ar theach coirí nua a thógáil leis an muileann sníomhacháin i gCill Chárthaigh agus ar ghléasra galghinte nua a sholáthar ann.  Tá na hoibreacha sin ar siúl go fóill agus is orthu sin agus ar oibreacha eile san ionad céanna a caitheadh timpeall £42,000 den £75,000 a heisíodh sa bhliain seo caite mar airleachain inaisíoctha.  Faoi láthair, tá dhá ionad cniotála nua á dtógáil; ceann acu i gCloch na Rón agus an ceann eile i dTuar Mhic Éadaigh.  Leagfar an Tuarascáil agus na Cuntais don bhliain seo caite faoi bhráid gach Tí den Oireachtas chomh luath agus is féidir é tar éis na cuntais a bheith iniúchta.  Tuigim, áfach, ón mBord go bhfuil na díolacháin i gcoitinne imithe i méid arís ó anuraidh agus go bhfuil méadú fiúntach ar na díolacháin thar lear.</P>
    <P>Tá soláthar £6,000 á dhéanamh faoi Fho-Mhírcheann I le go bhféadfar cabhair a thabhairt chun foirgintí a thógáil, a shealbhú, a oiriúnú nó a fheistiú mar Choláistí Gaeilge.  Rinneadh soláthar £10,000 chuige sin anuraidh ach ní dhearnadh éileamh ar aon chuid den tsoláthar sin.  Ag féachaint don mhéadú mór atá ag teacht le tamall anuas ar líon na daltaí atá <Col N="1126" /> ag lorg cúrsaí Samhraidh sa Ghaeltacht is ionadh liom nach bhfuil tairbhe níos mó á bhaint as an scéim seo, go háirithe san Iarthar.  Níl ach cúig cinn de choláistí aitheanta Gaeilge i gCúige Chonnacht i gcomparáid le dhá cheann déag i gContae Dhún na nGall agus seacht gcinn sa Deisceart.</P>
    <P>Tá soláthar á dhéanamh faoi Fho-Mhírcheann M chun cabhrú le taispeántais drámaíochta Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus le Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe.  Tá an soláthar méadaithe i mbliana ó £5,000 go dtí £6,500 d'fhonn go bhféadfar deontas speisialta a chur ar fáil do Thaibhdhearc na Gaillimhe i dteannta an ghnáthdheontais mar chabhair chun maisiúcháin agus deisiúcháin áirithe a dhéanamh ar an Taibhdhearc.  Tugtar deontas reachtála £2,500 don Taibhdhearc agus £1,500 d'Amharclann Ghaoth Dóbhair faoin bhFo-Mhírcheann seo.  Tugtar cúnamh freisin do chumainn bheaga drámaíochta sna limistéirí Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Baineann tuairim £33,000 den soláthar £40,000 faoi Fho-Mhírcheann N leis an scéim faoina dtugtar cúnamh do choistí áitiúla chun scoláireachtaí saoire sa Ghaeltacht a thabhairt do pháistí ó áiteanna lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht. Leasaíodh an scéim roinnt anuraidh d'fhonn an pobal a ghríosadh chun tuilleadh de na coistí áitiúla a bhunú agus is cúis sásaimh dom a fheiscint gur méadaíodh líon na gcoistí sin ó 96 sa bhliain 1962-63 go dtí 134 sa bhliain 1963-64.  Meastar, mar adúirt mé anuraidh, go bhfuil bua ar leith leis na coistí áitiúla sa mhéid go bhfuilid in ann súil a choimeád ar feadh na bliana uile ar na páistí a bheidh le cur chun na Gaeltachta nó a bheidh tar éis tréimhse a chaitheamh ansin.  Tugann sé sin deis do na coistí léachtaí, coirmeacha ceoil, agus a leithéid a shocrú do na daltaí ó thráth go chéile i rith na bliana i dtreo go mbainfidh na páistí an fheidhm is mó is féidir as an gcuairt ar an Ghaeltacht agus nach gcaillfidh siad tairbhe pé tréimhsí a bheidh caite acu ann.  Táim ar an tuairim nach mbeidh gluaiseacht seo na scoláireachtaí Gaeltachta socair ar an bhforas ceart go dtí go mbeidh coistí iontaofa áitiúla bunaithe ar fud na tíre uile lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht. <Col N="1127" /> Is é beartas na Roinne bunú agus neartú na gcoistí sin a chur chun cinn ar gach bealach is féidir.</P>
    <P>Cúis sásaimh dom freisin an méadú atá tagtha ar líon na bpáistí a bhain tairbhe as an gcúnamh a cuirtear ar fáil faoin scéim seo le roinnt bhlianta anuas.  Cuireadh suas le 5,700 páistí ó 134 coistí chun na Gaeltachta sa bhliain 1963-64 i gcomparáid le 333 páistí ó cheithre coistí sa bhliain 1957.</P>
    <P>Tá san áireamh faoin bhFo-Mhírcheann seo freisin soláthar le haghaidh scéime faoina gcuirtear páistí chuig scoileanna Gaeltachta&mdash;gach páiste ar feadh téarma scoile amháin.  Tá an scéim seo á reachtáil ag an Roinn i gcomhar le Gael-Linn agus is cúis sásaimh dom i gcónaí an comhoibriú seo a bheith idir eagras deontach agus an Stát ar mhaithe le athbheochan na Gaeilge.  Isé bua na Scéime seo go dtugann sí líofacht Ghaeilge d'fhoghlaimeoirí óga in imeacht gearrthréimhse aimsire.  Dá bhrí sin, molaim go láidir don phobal í agus tá súil agam go mbainfidh siad tuilleadh feidhme aisti sna blianta atá romhainn.</P>
    <P>Tá soláthar á dhéanamh faoi Fho-Mhírcheann O i ndáil le scéim nua trína gcuirfear cúnamh airgid ar fáil do bhuachaillí as na limistéirí Gaeltachta a bheidh ag freastal ar chúrsaí printíseachta tamall ó bhaile.  Tá ganntanas mór ceardaithe oilte de bhunadh na Gaeltachta féin ar fud na limistéirí Gaeltachta.  Féadfar a locht sin a chur ar a dheacra atá sé don ghnáthbhuachaill sa Ghaeltacht deis a fháil cois baile chun cúrsa printíseachta a dhéanamh agus ar a chostasaí a bheadh sé air cúrsa a dhéanamh in aon áit eile.  Ar an ábhar sin socraíodh go gcuirfí liúntaisí cothaithe ar fáil ar choinníollacha áirithe d'fhonn cabhrú le buachaillí Gaeltachta a mbeidh orthu cónaí as baile i ndáil le cúrsa printíseachta.  Liúntas £100 ar a mhéid a bheidh i gceist don chéad bhliain phrintíseachta agus £50, ar a mhéid, don dara bliain.  Tá an scéim seo á riaradh ag an Roinn i gcomhar leis na coistí gairmoideachais contae agus is ar mholadh na gCoistí sin a cheadaítear liúntas faoin scéim.  Ocht liúntais a cheadaíodh go dtí seo ach tá súil <Col N="1128" /> agam go rachaidh an uimhir sin i méid go mór sna blianta atá romhainn.</P>
    <P>Tá soláthar á dhéanamh faoin bhFo-Mhírcheann seo freisin d'fhonn cúnamh airgid a chur ar fáil do Choiste Gairmoideachais Chontae na Gaillimhe i leith scéime atá acu d'fhonn liúntais chothaithe a chur ar fáil do dhaltaí as Inis Thiar agus Inis Meán lena chumasú dóibh cur fúthu ar Inis Mór faid a bhíonn siad ag freastal ar an ngairmscoil ansin.  Tá soláthar ann freisin le haghaidh Scéime den tsort céanna atá á hoibriú ag Coiste Gairmoideachais Chontae Dhún na nGall ar mhaithe le daltaí as na hOileáin Ghaeltachta atá ag freastal ar ghairmscoileanna ar an mórthír.  Punt de chuid na Roinne atá á íoc in aghaidh gach puint de chuid na gcoistí.</P>
    <P>Ní cóir dom críoch a chur leis an ráiteas seo gan tagairt a dhéanamh do Thuarascáil an Choimisiúin um Athbheochan na Gaeilge.  Fé mar is eol don Dáil, tá an Tuarascáil á scrúdú i mo Roinnse agus sna Ranna eile Rialtais, agus tá ar intinn ag an Rialtas Páipéar Bán a leagan faoi bhráid na Dála ar ball ag léiriú beartais an Rialtais i dtaobh moltaí an Choimisiúin. Tá dóchas agam go dtiocfaidh d'fheidhmiú an bheartais sin go n-éireoidh le Roinn na Gaeltachta cúnamh nach beag a thabhairt ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht agus leis an nGaeilge.</P>

      <P>Tuairim agus deich mbliana ó shoin, do cuireadh Roinn na Gaeltachta ar bun agus tá an t-am ann anois go gcaithfidh an tAire innsint dúinn cad é mar tá an Ghaeltacht ag dul ar aghaidh.  An bhfuil sí ag éirí níos leithne nó an bhfuil sí ag cúngú?  An bhfuil an líon daoine atá ann níos mó nó níos lua?  Níl a fhios againn, agus níor innis an tAire dhúinn é.</P>
      <P>Tchím sa Mheastachán nach bhfuil ach an méid céanna airgid i mbliana a bhí anuraidh le haghaidh an deontas £5 dona páistí scoile.  Níl sa Ghaeltacht ach an líon céanna páistí a bhí ann trí nó ceithre bliana ó shoin agus ar an ábhar sin, sé mo bharúil nach bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag fás ar chor ar bith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tchím fosta nach bhfuil an méid céanna airgid ag an Aire i mbliana a <Col N="1129" /> bhí aige anuraidh agus is mór an náire é.  Tá laghdú £10,000 sa Mheastachán.</P>
    <P>Sul ar imigh mé maidin inniu, chonaic mé trí bus lódanna de mhuintir na Gaeltachta ag imeacht leo go hAlban, díreach mar a rinne siad fadó nuair a bhí Peadar Ó Domhnaill agus Pádraig Mac an Ghoill ag scríobhadh.</P>
    <P>As I have just said, it is ten years since the Department of the Gaeltacht was first set up.  It is a pity the Minister could not give us a review of the conditions which exist in the Gaeltacht generally, whether it is increasing or decreasing, whether the number of people there is decreasing or increasing.  This morning, as I left the Fíor-Ghaeltacht in Tírconaill, I saw four bus loads of young people migrating from that Gaeltacht to what Peadar Ó Donnell or McGill long ago described as &ldquo;tatie hoking&rdquo; to the potato fields in Scotland.  After having a Minister for the Gaeltacht for ten years, that is all the young people of the Tírconaill Gaeltacht can look forward to&mdash;the old familiar story in the month of June, the &ldquo;tatie hoking&rdquo;. Children of school-leaving age were going off this morning to the potato fields of Scotland, from which they will not return until next October. It is a sad story indeed.</P>
    <P>The inter-Party Government thought so much of the Gaeltacht that they set up a special Ministry to look after it and to endeavour to give employment there which would retain those young people in that Gaeltacht area. The first thing we note from the Minister's speech is that the money to be spent in the Gaeltacht this year is approximately £10,000 less than it was last year.  The next thing we note is that there is no additional sum provided for housing or for the repair of existing houses in the Gaeltacht. Does that mean that no new families are setting up in the Gaeltacht and remaining there?  Does it mean we have now put into a proper state of repair all the houses in which Gaelic speakers reside in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. I do not think that is true.  I think more money could be spent on housing in the Gaeltacht than is being spent.  It is indicative of the position <Col N="1130" /> as far as the Gaeltacht is concerned.</P>
    <P>There is one very sad note in this Estimate, that is, that no provision is made for additional schoolchildren to receive the £5 Gaeltacht deontas.  That is very sad indeed.  This £5 is paid to any schoolgoing children whose parents speak Irish in the home.  Naturally, we expected an increase in the number of schoolgoing children in the Gaeltacht areas.  We expected that this increase would come about as a result of the establishment of this Department and as a result of the Minister's activities in providing employment there.  We expected to find more people setting up house there and remaining there and more children reaching schoolgoing age.  But the Minister says &ldquo;There is no change since last year in the provision of £48,000 in this case, and I do not think it necessary to say anything in particular about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is one of the things about which he should have spoken.  If that £48,000 is being distributed to children in the Gaeltacht who come from Irish speaking homes, why has there been no increase?  Has there been a decrease? That is something the Minister should tell us about and it is something about which we are all very anxious to know.  It is a sad state of affairs that we do not know, from the Minister's statement, whether there has been a decrease in the Gaeltacht population, but we do know that there are no additional schoolgoing children in the area.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing to see the Minister giving the same amount as last year for the improvement of roads in the Gaeltacht areas.  It is something the Minister should keep up because not only is the Gaeltacht area a place to which we send students to learn Irish but it is also becoming a very attractive tourist centre.  I notice a reduction of £5,000 for water and sewerage schemes.  That is also a pity. I know that in the Donegal Gaeltacht there are many areas in which there are neither water nor sewerage schemes.  I know that in regard to Arranmore Island, the Donegal County Council are endeavouring to formulate a scheme and as far as I know Rannafast has no public sewerage scheme; <Col N="1131" /> Gweedore at the moment is in the process of having one formulated.  The same applies to Gortahork.  As far as I know, Kilcar in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht has no sewerage scheme and it is a pity to see the Estimate being reduced by £5,000 until all these Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas are provided with sewerage facilities.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that £20,000 is to be spent on minor marine works in 1964-65.  I wonder will it be spent? Some ten years ago, I was in charge of the Department which preceded the present Department and I remember sanctioning a grant for the erection of a jetty at a place called Stackamore on Arranmore and each year I have put down questions asking when the money will be spent on Stackamore and each year I have been told &ldquo;We are about to commence.&rdquo;  Last year I was told that the Donegal County Council were holding up the erection of the marine works by their failure to secure title to certain necessary sites.  Some three months ago, the county council informed me that the title had been procured and work would commence within a week.  Now we are in the month of June and nothing has been done to provide landing facilities at Stackamore and the students who will be ferried across will have to get out of their motorboats and risk their lives completing the journey in flatbottomed boats going to the island.  The Minister should give a prod to the Board of Works and his Department should become more of a prodding Department and see that moneys which have been allocated are spent expeditiously.  That would be in the interests not alone of the Department but of the Gaeltacht generally.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the glasshouse scheme has been the success that it is.  I always said that it would be a success but not until heat had been installed in the houses.  I am glad the Minister has agreed with that and that heat is now provided in a great majority of glasshouses in the Gaeltacht areas.  I should like to see other portions of the Gaeltacht benefiting under the scheme.  It might be possible for the Minister to <Col N="1132" /> have economic units of, say 100 glasshouses sited in other parts of the Gaeltacht area.</P>
    <P>I note in regard to secondary education that there is a decrease of £6,000 in the amount to be spent this year.  The Minister does not say why but he does explain that eight secondary schools are being built in the Gaeltacht area.  The Minister is to be congratulated on that and it is good to see these secondary schools being established in various areas.  I want to thank him publicly for acceding to representations made by me for a grant to the secondary school in Dungloe.  This is on the fringe of the Gaeltacht but when it was explained&mdash; I do not know whether it was to the Minister or his predecessor, Deputy Bartley&mdash;that it would be impossible to find board and lodgings for students in the actual Fíor-Ghaeltacht and that Dungloe was on the fringe, he acceded to the representations.</P>
    <P>I am not too familiar with these entertainment halls to which the Minister refers.  I note that one has been erected on Tory Island.  It is the only one in the Donegal Gaeltacht.  I am sure that Tory Island needs entertainment because it is a very neglected spot.  We only hear about it periodically and the people who live on it eke out a miserable existence.  It is very seldom that Governments do very much for those people, but if they want to take a defaulter off the island, it is no trouble to send in one of the few battleships attached to our Navy, as they did last week.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister for the Gaeltacht would have any responsibility for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>He would, because it is diminishing the strength of the Gaeltacht by taking away an Irish speaker.  I think I am relevant in that way.  He should ensure that as many Irish speakers live in the locality as possible and not have their numbers dwindle away by the process employed by his colleague, the Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to note under the heading of cultural activities we have now, as <Col N="1133" /> the Minister pointed out, a new word. We have the Irish for tape-recorder. I wonder if the Minister went down to the Gaeltacht and said to some Irish speakers there that he had a téipthaifeadán what would they say? They would possibly look at themselves to see where it was.</P>
    <P>It is a very good thing the Minister is providing these transport services for Gaeltacht areas.  I would appeal to him also to provide transport services between the islands and the Donegal coast for pupils who wish to attend secondary schools in Gweedore and Dungloe.  I do not think there is any provision made for it but if the Minister tells me there is I shall be quite satisfied.  On Arranmore Island, Tory Island and the other islands I am sure there would be students very anxious to take advantage of secondary school education but unless they become boarders it is impossible for them to avail of it.  The Minister should subsidise transport from the island to the secondary school or, alternatively, subsidise a lodging allowance, if there is such a thing and, if there is not, create such a thing as a lodging allowance for students who wish to attend secondary schools.</P>
    <P>I have already commented on the Gaeltacht deontas and I do not propose to say anything further about it.  I note we are providing a sum of £100,000 as a grant-in-aid for Gaeltarra Éireann.  Some of my colleagues may criticise that.  I am afraid I cannot. I always look upon Gaeltarra Éireann as a social service for the people of the Gaeltacht.  I am never too concerned if it loses money, provided it is rendering a social service to the people of the locality and provided the money is not squandered.  However, I am surprised to note that it has cost £42,000 for the installation of heat in and the erection of a small addition to the Kilcar factory.  That is a very big sum and I sincerely hope the change from oil to turf or turf to oil&mdash;I am not too certain &mdash;will be beneficial to the area.</P>
    <P>I note that a sum of £6,000 is provided for the construction, acquisition, adaptation and equipping of Irish colleges but more surprised to note that a sum of £10,000 was <Col N="1134" /> allocated last year and not one penny of it was spent.  I am certain that if the people of Arranmore Island&mdash;a college was established there in the past two years&mdash;were aware that £10,000 was going abegging there, application would have been made.  I sincerely hope that some of this £6,000 will now be provided during the coming season towards the equipping of a college or whatever buildings are on the island.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to the Irish theatre in Gweedore.  That is doing magnificent work.  I remember when money was made available to it, it was hoped that the other colleges would follow the example set by Áine Nic Ghiolla Bríde and her fellow workers in Gweedore.  I am sorry to say that no other theatre in the Gaeltacht, with the exception of the one which is in Galway for some years, has been established since then.  We cannot over-emphasise the amount of good towards the Irish language and Irish culture generally which is being done by this theatre in the Gweedore area.</P>
    <P>The only other thing I would criticise is the lack of information in the Minister's brief.  I note he does say that a White Paper will soon be published by the Government as a result of the report of the Commission on the revival of the Irish language.  I presume the Minister will be responsible for any legislation which will be necessary and I shall refrain from comment beyond saying it is a tragedy to see we intend to spend £10,000 less this year in that small, fast dwindling area, the fíor-Ghaeltacht. I can assure the Minister that £10,000 would keep the three busloads which I saw this morning setting off for the potato fields of Scotland in employment in the fíor-Ghaeltacht for the entire summer not only this year but next year.</P>

      <P>Is cosúil go gceapann an Teachta Ó Donnell go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ar fad i nDún na nGall ag imeacht.  Más amhlaidh atá, ní mar sin atá an scéal i gConamara. Tá an Ghaeltacht ansin ag dul ar aghaidh chomh maith agus níos fearr ná mar a bhí sí riamh.  Tá deontas <Col N="1135" /> tithíochta le fáil ag na daoine atá ag iarraidh tithe nua.  Tá go leor dena tithe seo ag dul suas i mo cheantar féin le cabhair dheontas Aire na Gaeltachta agus deontas na Comhairle Contae.</P>
      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuiltear ag deisiú na tithe trátaí agus tá súil agam go ndéanfar an chuid eile do dheisiú gan mórán moille.</P>
      <P>Mar gheall ar an deontas bóthair, tá obair an-mhaith á déanamh.  Níl ach clamhsán amháin agam i leith na hoibre seo ar na bóithre&mdash;sé sin gur deisíodh cuid de sna bóithre cúpla bliain ach nár críochnaíodh iad ó shoin.  Tá bóthar amháin in mo cheantar féin ar intinn agam.  Tá tuairim is míle den bhóthar sin go bhfuil deisiú de dhith air agus nach féidir le daoine siúl air fé láthair.</P>
      <P>Tá a fhios agam nach raibh mórán úsáid á dhéanamh de chuid de sna caladhphoirt agus poirt le cúpla scór bliain anuas.  Anois, pé scéal é, tá muintir na Gaeltachta ag obair ar fheamainn a bhailiú agus is mian leo í do chur chuig na monarchain.  Dá bhrí sin, iarraim ar an Aire airgead do chur ar fáil chun na poirt seo a dheisiú ionas go mbeidh sé níos fusa dona daoine seo a slí bheatha a bhaint amach.</P>
      <P>Rud maith is ea é daoine óga do chur go dtí an Ghaeltacht.  Tagann morán daoine óga ó áiteacha eile agus bíonn siad ag freastal ar scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht ar feadh trí mí agus iad ag foghlaim na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>B'fhéidir go mbeidh sé ar chumas an Aire níos mó tionscal cniotála do chur ar bun sa Ghaeltacht.  Bhí ceann amháin ann timpeall trí scór bliain ó shoin ag Leitir Mealláin ach dúnadh é agus níor osclaíodh é go dtí seo.  Dá mbeadh níos mó monarchan den tsórt sin scaipithe ar fud na Gaeltachta, ba chomhartha dóchais é dona daoine. B'fhearr leo bheith ag obair sa bhaile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Molaim an tAire agus na daoine atá ag plé le ceist na Gaeltachta as ucht an fheabhais mhóir atá tagtha ann. Beidh breis feabhais ar a n-iarrachtaí nuair a bheidh sé críochnaithe.  Fé mar adúras, tá an teanga chomh tréan i <Col N="1136" /> gConamara is a bhí sí riamh agus bfhéidir níos treise.  Tá na daoine ann. Dúirt an Teachta O'Donnell go raibh na daoine ag imeacht agus nach raibh fágtha ach beagán gasúirí agus cailíní óga.  Ní mar sin atá an scéal i gConamara.  Tá scoileanna nua á dtógáil agus táthar ag cur seomraí breise le scoileanna eile.  Sin mar atá an scéal i gConamara.</P>

      <P>Fé mar is eol do gach duine, ní Teachta ón Ghaeltacht mise. Tagaim ó Chontae Chábháin i gceartlár na tíre.  Is contae í nach labhartar an Ghaeilge ann.  Níl de Ghaeilge inti ach an méid a fhoghlamaíonn na daoine ar scoil.  Ní hionann sin is a rá nach bhfuil spéis mhór agam sa Mheastachán seo agus sa Ghaeltacht ar fad. Ní maith an rud do dhuine mar mise bheith ag éisteacht leis an saghas óráide a thug an Teachta O'Donnell. Ní dóigh liom go ndeineann óráid den tsaghas maitheas do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ná do mhuintir na tíre ach oiread.  Ní deirim nach bhfuil sé de cheart aige pé rud atá in a intinn aige do rá, ach mar sin féin, níl an scéal chomh h-olc agus atá sé ag iarraidh a chur ina luí orainn.</P>
      <P>Do bhíos féin sa Ghaeltacht&mdash;i nDún na nGall a bhíos&mdash;agus chonaic mé na tithe atá ag na daoine ansin.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfaca mé in áit ar bith eile in Éirinn tithe ní b'fhearr.  Is fíor go bhfuilid níos fearr ná na tithe atá againn i gContae an Chabháin.  Bhí uisce reatha san gcuid is mó acu agus maidir leis na bóithre bhíodar go breá ar fad.  Bhí na daoine gléasta go deas agus bhíodar an-cháirdiúil.  Do chuirfeadh sé áthas ar éinne dul ansin ar laethe saoire agus cuairt a thúirt ar na scoileanna, na coláistí nó halla rince ar bith.  Sin é an pictiúir de mhuintir na Gaeltachta ba chóir a bheith ag muintir na hÉireann in ionad an phictiúir a dhathaigh an Teachta O'Donnell.  Ní maith le h-éinne cuairt a thúirt ar áit ina mbíonn brón agus caoineadh ach sa Ghaeltacht tá na daoine cáirdiúil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá tithe na Gaeltachta go breá ar fad.  B'fhéidir nár tógadh oiread tigh i mbliana agus a tógadh anuraidh ach tá fáth amháin ar a laghad leis sin. Nuair a tógtar teach seasann sé 20, 30 <Col N="1137" /> nó 50 bliain.  Chím i ráiteas an Aire gur tógadh 883 tithe, gur cuireadh feabhas ar 700 tithe agus gur cuireadh uisce i 305 tithe eile.  Ní beag sin.  Tá na tithe ar fad beagnach go han-mhaith ar fad.</P>
    <P>Sa ráiteas a chuir an tAire ar fáil tá tagairt dona meánscoileanna.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil scoileanna náisiúnta na Gaeltachta go breá fé mar adúirt an Teachta Geoghegan ó Ghaillimh.  Tá freastal na ndaltaí orthu ag méadú agus is minic go gcaithtear seomra breise a chur le cuid dena scoileanna.  Chomh maith leis sin do tógadh a lán scoileanna nua sa Ghaeltacht le cúpla bliain anuas.  Is féidir le muintir na Gaeltachta a gcuid daltaí do chur go dtí na meánscoileanna anois.  Sin buntáiste atá acu sa Ghaeltacht nach bhfuil againne i gContae an Chabháin.  Nílim ag fáil locht orthu mar gheall air sin.  Tá an deis sin acu.  Ní ceart a rá nach bhfuil an Rialtas ag déanamh aon rud ar son muintir na Gaeltachta ó thaobh cúrsaí oideachais de.  Tá obair mhór ar siúl acu.  Tá an Rialtas ag féachaint chuige go mbeidh oideachas le fáil ag páistí mhuintir na Gaeltachta nuair a fhágann siad na bunscoileanna.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh tagairt don deontas £5. Tuigim go bhfuil an deontas so le fáil sa Ghaeltacht ag páistí a bhfuil ar a gcumas cruthú don chigire gur ab í an Ghaeilge gná-theanga an bhaile.  Níl a fhios againn an bhféadfaí an scéim sin a leathnú ar fud áiteanna eile taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  B'fhéidir go mbeadh sé an-chostasúil ach tá a fhios agam go bhfuil mórán clanna agus deineann siad iarracht ar an nGaeilge a úsáid sa bhaile.  Ní deirim go bhfuil an £5 ag teastáil uathu ach ní h-í sin an cheist.  Sílím go mbeidh na páistí agus na tuismitheoirí toilteanach glacadh leis.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an scéim chun páistí do chur go dtí an Ghaeltacht, is maith an scéim í.  Is maith iad na scoláireachtaí leis.  Na daoine óga a théann ón nGalltacht go dtí an Ghaeltacht chíonn siad gur mar a chéile iad muintir na Gaeltacha agus iad féin.  Ní daoine dubha iad ach daoine breátha, cneasta, cáirdiúla iad a bhfuil idir cheol, rince agus an teanga acu. <Col N="1138" /> Deineann sé maitheas do mhuintir na Galltachta cuairt do thúirt ar an nGaeltacht.  Cloiseann siad an teanga bheo&mdash;teanga ar dearnadh iarracht ar í do scriosadh ar fead na céadta blian.  Ní mór dúinn bheith buíoch dena daoine a choimheád an teanga beo i rith na tréimhse fada sin, gidh gur ropadh isteach iad imeasc na sléibhte.  D'fhanadar dílis dá ndúchas agus níor scar siad le teanga na nGaedheal.  Tá an náisiún buíoch díobh; tá Gaeil na hÉireann agus Gaeil an domhain buíoch díobh.  Is maith an rud é go bhfuil deis ag na daoine dul isteach sna hallaí agus na scoileanna chun labhairt le muintir na Gaeltachta.  Nuair a théann páistí na Galltachta chun an Ghaeltacht labhrann siad an Ghaeilge sna tithe. Is é an t-aon áit amháin nár chuala mé an Ghaeilge dhá labhairt ná sa tséipéal.  Níl a fhios agam ach b'fhéidir nach raibh mé ann ar an Domhnach &ldquo;ceart&rdquo;, ach sin mar a bhí sé.</P>
    <P>Do dhéanfadh sé maitheas don Ghaeilge dá ndéanfaí páistí na Gaeltachta a chur chuig na scoileanna náisiúnta sa Ghalltacht&mdash;beirt, triúr nó ceathrar ó Dhún na nGall agus áiteacha eile.  D'fhásfadh cáirdiúlacht de thairbhe scéim den tsórt sin agus do chuirfeadh an dá mhuintir aithne níos fearr ar a chéile.</P>
    <P>Tá moladh mór ag dul do na daoine atá i bhfeighil na gcoláistí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Deineann siad obair mhór i rith an tsamhraidh&mdash;na múinteoirí, na sagairt agus na tuismitheoirí.  Tá moladh mór tuile ag Comhaltas Uladh, Gael Linn agus dreamanna mar iad atá ag cabhrú leis na scéimeanna seo.</P>
    <P>Níor mhaith liom deireadh do chur lem chuid cainte gan tagairt do dhéanamh don obair mhór a rinneadh i nGaoth Dóbhair áit ar tógadh halla breá le h-aghaidh drámaí i nGaeilge. Tá creidiúint mhór ag dul do gach duine go raibh baint aige leis an obair sin.  Is mór an trua nach féidir le h-aisteoirí Ghaoth Dóbhair dul timpeall na tíre ag túirt cuairteanna ar scoileanna agus coláistí.  B'fhéidir gur mhaith an rud é airgead a chur ar fáil chun na drámaí seo do scannánú agus iad do theaspáint dóibh siúd nach bhfuil deis acu iad d'fheiscint i <Col N="1139" /> nGaoth Dóbhair.  Is í an drámaíocht an áis is fearr chun daoine do chur ag labhairt na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Mar focal scoir, do thug mé cuairt ar Roinn na Gaeltachta cúpla babhta agus bhí na daoine a casadh orm go deas, béasach liom.  Cabhraíonn siad le gach duine go bhfuil fadhb ar bith le réiteach aige.  Tá obair thábhachtach idir lámhaibh acu&mdash;sábháilt na Gaeltachta&mdash;agus má theipeann ar an iarracht&mdash;agus tá súil agam nach dteipfidh&mdash;teipfidh ar an náisiún.  Is fiú go mór an Ghaeltacht do shábháil agus tá dualgas ar gach duine cabhrú le cúis na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá a lán daoine dúthrachtachta ag obair ar son na teanga.  Níl siad go léir ar an dtaobh seo den Teach.  Tá siad le fáil imeasc Fine Gael agus Dream an Lucht Oibre.  Tá meas acu ar an dteanga agus tá spéis acu inti.</P>
    <P>D'iarr mé féin uair amháin ar an dTeachta Ua Maolchatha teacht go Contae an Chabháin chun óráid fheise a thúirt.  Do rinne sé rud orm.  Níor labhair sé focal amháin i mBéarla ón árdán.  Is oth liom a rá nár thug na nuachtáin líne amháin dó.  Tá súil agam nach fada uainn an lá nuair a bheidh coiste sa Teach seo againn agus daoine ó gach Páirtí air a dhéanfaidh a ndícheall cabhair a thúirt don Ghaeltacht agus don Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ní h-áil liomsa an Ghaeilge a ropadh siar scórnaigh mhuintir na tíre ach tá a fhios agam go mbíonn bród ar dhaoine cúpla focal Frainncise nó Gearmáinis do labhairt agus b'fhéidir ag maoímh go raibh ar a gcumas cúpla teanga do labhairt.  Níl mé sásta go bhfuil an meas ceart ar an nGaeilge. Níl a fhios agam cá bhfuil an locht. B'fhéidir go bhfuil cuid den locht orainn féin agus cuid de ar na tuismitheoirí, ar na meánscoileanna agus ar na h-iolscoileanna.  Ba chóir na lochtanna seo do leigheas.  Ba chóir dúinn ár ndícheall a dhéanamh féachaint chuige an Ghaeilge do chur dhá labhairt sna scoileanna, ar na sráideacha, sna comhairlí contae, agus ar na páirceanna imeartha.  Tá cuid dena tuismitheoirí nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu mar nár múineadh an Ghaeilge dóibh nuair a bhíodar ar scoil ach tá cuid eile fós ann&mdash;na tuismitheoirí óga <Col N="1140" /> a bhfuil roinnt mhaith focal Gaeilge acu.  Ba chóir dóibh sin na páistí do spreagadh chun Gaeilge dó labhairt.</P>
    <P>Deir a lán daoine gur theip ar na páistí sna scrúducháin de dheascaibh na Gaeilge ach cad mar gheall ar na páistí a theip sa mhatamaitic, i dtír eolas agus i mBéarla?  Ní h-í an Ghaeilge cúis na tubaiste.  Anuraidh níor theip ach ar 2 faoin gcéad sa Ghaeilge gidh gur theip ar 6 faoin gcéad sa Bhéarla agus ar níos mó ná sin sna h-ábhair eile.  Ciallaíonn sin nach í an Ghaeilge an chúis gur theip siad.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an tAire ag déanamh a dhíchill.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé dáiríre.  Labhrann sé an teanga agus tuigeann sé na fadhbanna go léir a bhaineas leis an Roinn.  Guím rath Dé air agus ar a chuid oibre agus tá súil agam gur seacht bhfearr a bheimíd an bhliain seo chugainn.</P>

      <P>Ní dóigh liom gur thuig an Teachta Dolan an méid adúirt an Teachta O'Donnell.  Ní ag cáineadh na Gaeltachta a bhí sé ach a mhalairt.  Is é an gearán a bhí ag an Teachta O'Donnell go raibh an Ghaeltacht ag dul i laghad.  Dúirt an Teachta Geoghegan nach mar sin a bhí an scéal acu i gConamara.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil líon na ndaoine níos mó i gConamara ná mar atá sé in áiteacha eile.</P>
      <P>Tá cúram ar an Aire an líon daoine is mó is féidir do choimeád sa Ghaeltacht. Is cás linne nach bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag leathnú.  Mar adúirt an Teachta O'Donnell, caithfidh na daoine óga imeacht as an Ghaeltacht chun slí bheatha do bhaint amach dóibh féin thar sáile.  Ba chóir dúinn na daoine do choimeád sa Ghaeltacht ag obair go lán-aimsearach.  Dá ndéanfaí sin do bheadh flúirse Gaeilge le fáil agus líofacht lena chois.  Tá líofacht cainte ag na sean-daoine a chaitheann a saol sa Ghaeltacht ach ní dhéanann sé aon mhaitheas do chúis na Gaeilge go gcaithfidh na daoine óga imeacht leo.  Cad é an leigheas atá againn ar an scéal nó an bhfuil aon leigheas air?  Nílim ag trácht ar chúis na Gaeilge.  Tá mé ag caint faoi shaol na ndaoine sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1141" /> An féidir linn le cabhair ón Oireachtas líon na Gaeltachta do leathnú?  Má thig linn na daoine do choimeád ann agus féachaint chuige go mbeidh slí bheatha le fáil acu ann, leathanófar an Ghaeltacht.  Tá scéimeanna ag Gaeltarra Éireann le h-aghaidh na Gaeltachta.  Ba mhaith liom a chloisint ón Aire conas mar atá na scéimeanna sin ag dul ar aghaidh.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil méadú tagtha ar na h-earraí a díoltar.  Cad mar gheall ar an méid daoine atá ag obair faoi scéimeanna Ghaeltarra Éireann?</P>
    <P>An bhfuil an líon daoine atá ag obair ann ag dul i méid?  An bhfuil níos mó daoine ag obair leo i mbliana ná mar a bhí anuraidh?  An bhfuil scéal ag an Aire go mbeidh níos mó daoine ag obair sa bhlian seo chugainn ná atá ann i mbliana?  Sin é an rud.</P>
    <P>Bfhéidir, mar adeireann an Teachta O'Donnell, nach aon dochair é má chailleann Gaeltarra Éireann roinnt airgid má sholáthraítear obair dona daoine sa Ghaeltacht.  Ní dóigh liom go ndeineann sé dochair ar bith do mhuintir na tíre má tá níos mó daoine ag obair ann a labhrann Gaeilge, daoine óga i ndéantúsaí beaga mar sin, agus saol fónta acu.</P>
    <P>Conas tá ag éirí leis an déantús bréide?  Conas tá ag éirí leis an déantús cniotála?  Conas tá ag éirí leis an déantús bréagán ann agus conas tá ag éirí leis na scéimeanna eile maidir le h-iascaireacht, feamainn, agus mar sin de?  An bhfuil siad sin ag dul chun cinn?  Má tá, tá rud éigin fónta á dhéanamh againn chun leas na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá difríocht mhór idir cheist na Gaeilge agus ceist na Gaeltachta. Conas mar atá staid na Gaeilge agus conas mar atá staid na Gaeltachta. Ba mhaith an rud é dá dtuigimís an difríocht atá eatarthu.  Más rud é gur ceist leathnú labhairt na Gaeilge atá ann, ní dóigh liom go mbeidh sé ar chumas gach éinne ar fud na tíre an saghas Gaeilge a labhartar i limistéirí na Gaeltachta a labhairt.  Bhéinn sásta dá mbeadh Gaeilge á labhairt ar fud na tíre, cé acu Gaeilge Bhaile Átha Cliath nó Gaeilge Chorcaí í.</P>
    <P>Tá a mhalairt de scéal ann nuair thagraimíd do staid na Gaeltachta agus <Col N="1142" /> na daoine a chónaíonn sa Ghaeltacht. Tuigeann gach éinne gur cuid den tír í nach bhfuil saibhir agus go bhfuil dualgas ar an Aire, ar an Rialtas agus ar gach éinne cabhrú léi.  Dá mb'fhéidir leis an Aire a rá leis an Tí go bhfuil déantúsaí na Gaeltachta ag dul ar aghaidh agus scéimeanna fé leith maidir le saothrú talún agus Scéim na Muc, tithe gloine, agus mar sin de, ag dul ar aghaidh, agus go bhfuil níos mó daoine ag fanúint ann agus ag baint tairbhe asta, bheadh gach éinne sásta.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na tithe gloine, deireann an tAire go ndearnadh damáiste mór stoirme do 20 tithe agus go bhfuil conradh déanta chun 10 dtithe díobh a athógáil, nach raibh na fásóirí eile sásta bheith páirteach a thuilleadh sa scéim.  Cén fáth nach bhfuil siad sásta tithe glóine a athógáil?</P>

Cén fáth nach bhfuil siad sásta na tithe gloine a thógáil arís?  An bhfuil an méid céanna tairbhe le fáil astu?  An gceapann siad anois nach fiú an méid atá le fáil astu?  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil téamh le fáil iontu anois. N'fheadar cad a chur isteach orthu. Ba mhaith liom a fháil amach ón Aire cad a chuir isteach orthu.</P>
      <P>Ba mhian liom eolas fháil ón Aire maidir le meánscolaíocht.  Tá súil agam gurab é an scéal atá ann nach bhfuil gá le níos mó scoile fé láthair.  B'oth liom a chloisint go mbeadh laghdú ar an soláthar a rinneadh anuraidh.  Tá súil agam nach bhfuil laghdú ar líon na bpáistí atá ag dul ar meánscoil.  Má tá na scoileanna ann, ba mhaith an rud é go mbainfeadh na páistí níos mó tairbhe as an oideachas fónta a gheibheann siad iontu.  Deireann an tAire go bhfuil laghdú ar an méid airgid atá á sholáthair i mbliana.  An í ceist na scol nó ceist na ndaltaí atá ann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is maith an rud é na scoláireachtaí saoire sa Ghaeltacht.  Nílim ar aon <Col N="1143" /> intinn leis an Aire agus le daoine eile maidir le cad is Gaeltacht ann.  Tá a fhios agam gur ceist gheograif í.  Ba mhaith an rud é dá mbeadh Gaeltacht bheag i ngach aon áit sa tír chun ceist na teangan a chur chun cinn.  Tá a leithéid in áiteanna taobh amú den Ghaeltacht.  Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil spéis á chur sa Ghaeltacht taobh amú den Ghaeilge.  Ní hí ceist na teangan atá i dtreis.  Ceist na Gaeltachta atá i gceist agus conas a chaitheann muintir na Gaeltachta a saol agus conas a éiríonn leo maireachtaint, agus uile.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith an rud é dá mbeadh coiste sa Ghaeltacht go mbeadh suim acu, ní amháin i gceist na teangan, ach i gceist limistéirí na Gaeltachta.  Tá an rud céanna ann maidir le cultúr. N'fheadar cén fáth nach bhfuil ar chumas coiste éigin sa Ghaeltacht flea ceoil a chur ar bun ann.  Is féidir flea ceoil a chur ar bun sa Ghalltacht.  Cén fáth nach bhfuil sé ar a chumas flea ceoil mór a chur ar siúl sa Ghaeltacht? Nach é cultúr na Gaeltachta atá i gceist?  Cén fáth nach ndeineann na daoine sa Ghaeltacht iarracht ar fhlea ceoil mór do chur ar siúl chun daoine a mhealladh isteach sa Ghaeltacht? Dá bhféadfaí é sin a dhéanamh, dfheádfadh níos mo daoine maireachtáil ann.  Sin é an fáth go bhfuil seallaí á dtógáil ann chun daoine a mhealladh isteach ann chun a laetheannta saoire do chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht.  Ba mhaith an rud é dá n-imeodh níos mó daoine isteach ann.  Da gcaithfeadh níos mó daoine aimsir ann agus dá gcaithfidís airgead ann, ní bheadh an gá céanna le soláthar ón Roinn dona scéimeanna sin.  Gach obair a bhíonn ar siúl, idir bhóithre agus mar sin de, is iarracht í obair a sholáthar dona daoine atá ann.</P>
    <P>Is maith an rud é go bhfuil tithe breátha sa Ghaeltacht.  Níl éinne ag gearán maidir leis sin.  Is maith liom a chloisint go bhfuil an méid sin tithe á dtógáil ann.  Cén fáth nach bhfuil siad níos fearr ná in aon áit eile mar tá deontaisí le fáil acu.  Nach bhfuil deontaisí le fáil ón Roinn Rialtas Áitiúil?</P>

      <P>Ón taobh seo den Teach ba mhian liom a chur in iúl don Aire go bhfuil suim mhór againn i nGaeltachtaí na hÉireann.  Ba mhian le gach éinne go leathanófaí ar an nGaeltacht.  Cuirim seo os comhair an Aire.  An féidir linn mar atáimid fé láthair an Ghaeltacht a leathnú ar fud na tíre leis na scéimeanna atá ar siúl againn fé láthair? An bhfuil níos mó le déanamh againn chun an aidhm sin a bhaint amach?  An féidir linn feirmeacha beaga a thúirt d'fhormhór na ndaoine sin ionas go mbeidh saol níos fearr le caitheamh acu?  An féidir na déantúisí atá fé chúram Gaeltarra Éireann a leathnú agus níos mó daoine a choimeád ag obair go lán aimsireach ins na monarchain agus níos mó daoine a choimeád ag obair i mbun obair láimhe ins na tithe?  Más féidir linn é sin a dhéanamh leathanófar ar líon na Gaeltachta.  Más féidir linn clanna nua a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht, leathanófar ar an méid daltaí sa Ghaeltacht.  Is tré leathnú óna h-áiteanna ina bhfuil an Ghaeltacht anois a leathanófar an Ghaeilge mar ghnáth theanga na tíre. Ní dóigh liom gur féidir an Ghaeltacht a leathnú tré dhaoine ón Ghaeltacht a thógaint as an áit in a bhfuil siad fé láthair agus iad do chur go h-áiteanna eile.  Sílím go dtarlódh dóibh sin mar a tharla fadó nuair a tháinig an Gall anso.  They became more Irish than the Irish themselves.  Ní fheadar an mar sin a bheidh an scéil ag na Gaeil, that they will be more English than the English themselves.</P>

      <P>Sé an clamhsán a bhí ag an Teachta O'Donnell go bhfuil isliú £10,000 sa Mheastachán seo. Dúirt sé gur uafásach an rud é an ísliú sin a bheith ann.  Caithfimíd a thuiscint gur ísliú é sin ar chaiteachas £500,000, agus ní fiú bheith ag caint ar an méid sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí faitíos ar an Teachta O'Donnell agus ar an Teachta Jones freisin go raibh contúirt don Ghaeltacht toisc mar dubhradar go raibh ísliú ar an líon daoine a bhí ag fáil <Col N="1145" /> an deontas £5.  Sílim nach bhfuil mórán ísliú ann ach caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil imirce ón Ghaeltacht chomh maith leis an imirce óna ceantracha cúnga.  Níl an aos óg sa Ghaeltacht toilteanach glacadh leis an caighdeán slí bheatha a bhí ag na sean daoine ní nach íonadh.</P>
    <P>Tá feabhas ar na h-oibreacha atá fé chúram Ghaeltarra Éireann.  Tá na figiúirí le fáil ón gcúntas a thagann fé bhráid an Tí seo ó bhliain go chéile.</P>
    <P>Tá mé buíoch de na Teachtaí as ucht an méid adúradar i dtaobh na hoibre atá ar siúl ag Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Ní ceist pholaitíochta caomhnadh na Gaeltachta agus táimid go léir ar aon intinn go mba cheart gach rud is féidir a dhéanamh ar mhaithe leis na daoine sa chuid sin den tír.  Is mór an trua gur sa Ghaeltacht atá an talamh is boichte sa tír agus go mbaineann deacrachtaí móra dá réir le feabhsú cúrsaí eacnamaíochta na ndaoine sna limistéirí sin.</P>
    <P>Nílim, agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil éinne eile, sásta leis an méid atá ar siúl againn agus ba mhaith liom go mór dá bhféadfaimis i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh chun saol mhuintir na Gaeltachta a fheabhsú go buan.  Ach tá iarracht nach beag á déanamh againn agus tig liom a gheallúint go leanfar den iarracht sin agus d'iarrachtaí ar bith eile a mheasfaimid a thabharfaidh a cuspóir chun críche go sásúil agus go luath.</P>
    <P>Taobh amuigh den tábhacht atá sa Ghaeltacht ó thaobh na ndaoine féin de, tá tábhacht ar leith ann mar gheall ar mbun-sholáthar Gaeilge atá ann as a dtiocfaidh taca agus cúnamh do ghluaiseacht aithbheochaint na teangan. Is minic a cheapas gur mór an trua é go bhfuil deacrachtaí na haithbheochana ceangailte in intinn a lán daoine le deacrachtaí eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta féin.  Dá mbeadh cúrsaí eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta go sásúil, agus í chun tosaigh ar an gcuid eile den tír, sílim go mbeadh misneach agus dóchas níos fearr ag na daoine atá ag iarraidh an teanga a aithbheochaint, agus gur fearr dá réir a rachfadh gluaiseacht na haithbheochana chun cinn.  Faoi mar atá an scéal, caithfear an Ghaeltacht agus an Ghaeilge a shlánú le chéile, agus tá ar intinn agam go mbeidh cúnamh agus comhairle <Col N="1146" /> chuige sin le tabhairt ag Roinn na Gaeltachta sna blianta atá romhainn.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to anticipate what may be done by the Government or what may be published in the White Paper in connection with the Report of the Commission on the restoration of the language, I feel I should try to make clear my personal view as to what the people of Limistéirí na Gaeltachta will stand for in this day and age.  There has been a tremendous amount of muddled thinking on this issue of the Gaeltachta which are left in the country.  As I have said, those who believe we can put a wall around the Gaeltacht areas and treat them as Indian reservations do not know what they are talking about.</P>
    <P>The people in the Gaeltacht areas are, economically speaking, in very similar circumstances to those of their neighbours in the congested areas. They were driven there for the same historical reasons as the people were originally driven during the famine and Cromwellian times to these isolated areas, mainly on the western seaboard.  To think that they are prepared to accept the standard of living of their grandfathers or of the Famine times is not being realistic.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, emigration from the Gaeltacht areas because these people are located in the poorest parts of our country.  They are living on the poorest land, generally speaking, and indeed the surprise is that there was not more intensive emigration from the Gaeltacht areas.  It was refreshing to see schools being extended within our largest Gaeltacht, in some of the islands like Inishmaan off the Connemara coast, and to recognise that the State assistance being provided for them in the various schemes is still enabling the population to survive and thrive there.  However, people who think they can save the language by simply putting a wall round the Gaeltacht are fooling themselves.</P>
    <P>It is too true to say that where we have had some slight industrialisation in some of the Gaeltacht areas, the state of the language would appear to decline.  To believe that by improving <Col N="1147" /> the economic circumstances of the people in the Gaeltacht, the state of the language is strengthened is just woolly thinking.  Unless our people as a whole make up their minds to save their language, we shall not do it. To think that we will preserve our language for all time by that simple manipulation and by providing economic assistance for the people of the Gaeltacht is faulty thinking.  I have made it quite clear that any schemes that are workable and that would raise the economic standard of living of the people in the Gaeltacht will be welcomed by me, but I have never believed, and I have never given the impression, that by doing that, we are going to spread the revival of the language across the whole country.</P>
    <P>It is most important that we should preserve the Gaeltacht, where the language is a spoken language, particularly for the benefit of people who go there to acquire fluency and to develop the blas and extend their vocabulary. That is one matter, but, in my view, it is wishful thinking for those who are interested in this question to feel in any way that if we succeed in preserving the present Gaeltacht areas as defined by law, we are either going to extend the speaking of our national language or ultimately preserve it for our children.</P>
    <P>Some interesting suggestions have been made regarding the provision of scholarships for children resident in the Gaeltacht to attend schools outside the Gaeltacht.  That is the first time that proposition has been made to me.  Possibly as time goes on, we might, with benefit to the nation, revert to the old system of fosterage which we had many years ago, the system of children moving from one area to another and bringing to their foster parents the language of the homes from which they came and of bringing back the techniques and skills of their foster parents when they return to their own homes.  When all these suggestions have been examined, other schemes of that kind for the benefit of the children of the Gaeltacht may emerge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> Taking the complaints that were made here about the reduction, which is really a book-keeping figure, of £10,000 in the Estimate, let me say again that there is no workable scheme that has been brought to me as Minister for the Gaeltacht that I am not prepared to examine fully.  As far as the overall Estimate for the Department is concerned, I have always found, since I entered Government, that my colleagues in Government are more than willing to provide the necessary sinews of war with which to proceed with any scheme I thought fit to help the people of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones asked what progress was being made under some of the schemes organised by Gaeltarra Éireann.  It may be of some interest to him to give briefly some of the figures I have before me.  These are the direct and indirect earnings for the year ended 31st March, 1964, as compared with the year ended 31st March, 1959.  The direct earnings under schemes organised by Gaeltarra Éireann in 1959 were £159,780 and the indirect earnings were £73,764, making a total of £233,544.  In 1956, the direct earnings under the same body amounted to £247,640 and the indirect earnings were £74,705, making a total of £322,345.</P>
    <P>The number of people employed would appear to be 1,344 in 1959 and about 1,700 presently.  The stocks of the organisation are higher now by about £50,000 worth than in the year I have referred to and generally the sales and operation of the organisation have been improved.  I was much surprised to hear Deputy P. O'Donnell complain about the expenditure in Kilcar.  That figure covers buildings, boilers, pipes and other matters and the cost does not so much arise through changes from oil to turf as through replacing boiler plant which was time-expired and providing new plant.  It is anticipated that the savings from the new plant will fully offset the cost.</P>
    <P>The plant now supplied at Kilcar will work on local hand-machined turf instead of working on imported oil. Taking the development cost at £41,000, it is, in my view, well worth <Col N="1149" /> while, and I was glad to see that the Board got around to doing it and that they are now making use of the local raw material which must give more local employment and provide a further market for turf.  The Board anticipate that they will be fully recouped because of the improvement which will be created by the installation covered by that figure.</P>
    <P>The figures provided in this Estimate under different headings may not have been all spent from time to time and that has been the subject of some uninformed criticism.  I should like Deputies to realise the reason for that. Many of the schemes organised by Roinn na Gaeltacha depend on a number of outside bodies, such as county councils, the Board of Works and others, for their fulfilment.  Roinn na Gaeltachta have to rely on other bodies, including local authorities, and quite frequently there is a long time-lag and that is why there is sometimes underspending of the amounts provided under different headings.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening statement, any scheme that is not carried out in one year for one reason or another will not fail to be carried out by reason of lack of funds.  Whenever these local authorities are able to go ahead with the work, the money will be there for them.  It is mostly for these reasons that we have, under some headings, underspending of the amount provided or estimated for, because of these outside factors to which I have referred.  Up to about 1960, the provision for Sceim na gCúig bPunt was £51,000 and there was never much more than £48,000 actually spent in the implementation of that scheme because the numbers participating did not warrant it.  This provision of £48,000 has been in operation since 1960 and the figure for all the years since 1960 has been approximately the same, so there is no great variation in the number of children availing of the provisions.</P>
    <P>There is disagreement from time to time about the standard of children qualifying under Sceim na gCúig bPunt and I have directed, where there was disagreement, and because of the fact that inspectors under the Department <Col N="1150" /> of Education examine for the scheme, that there should be a second examination.  Occasionally we get complaints that children were wrongfully deprived of this grant until their standard was high enough to qualify for it.  We have found that most of these complaints are unfounded and the inspectors well know, when examining the children, whether Irish is the spoken language of the home.  If it is not, they do not qualify under the scheme.  The fact remains that since 1960 there has been no great variation or fluctuation in the numbers applying for and qualifying for this scheme, which is an indication in another way that the population of the Gaeltacht is being maintained and that there is nothing alarming in the figure to which I have referred.  Needless to say, I should be much happier if there were an increase in the amount being spent under this heading, but naturally we can only give the deontas to those who are entitled to it under the regulations.</P>
    <P>The disastrous storm damage caused by &ldquo;Debbie&rdquo;&mdash;I think that is what it was called&mdash;to the glasshouses was regrettable.  It is also regrettable that a small number of growers were not prepared to go ahead with the new houses that were being built after the storm damage.  This is understandable in one Gaeltacht area in which they had no experience of this particular scheme.  It is more difficult to understand it in another Gaeltacht area where they had.  In some of these Gaeltacht areas, there are unfortunately some people&mdash;I do not say that this is the explanation of the few people involved here&mdash;who are fond of what we call airgead bog.  That militates against them possibly from fully utilising what they could utilise in the fear of being penalised in their unemployment assistance when the time comes.  I am hoping, however, that those people who are not yet prepared to come into the scheme will change their minds and perhaps it would be as well if I left it at that at the moment.  When they see their neighbours getting on so well with the new heated glasshouses, it may have the desired effect.  When they see the amount of money being earned by <Col N="1151" /> their neighbours under the glasshouse scheme, we will probably have a change of front again on this matter.</P>
    <P>People in the Gaeltacht area&mdash; indeed, it is true of all rural areas&mdash;are very much inclined to look to their neighbours, and if they happen to have a bit of bad luck under any of these schemes, it takes time to restore the necessary confidence.  I am glad to say, however, that with the people in the Gaeltacht areas taking more and more advantage of these schemes provided under Roinn na Gaeltachta and more and more advantage of the advisory services, we are getting a new outlook in the Gaeltacht area, just as we are in many of the congested areas. There appears to me to be a new spirit generally in these areas, a new feeling that they can make more out of the modest pieces of land they have been provided with and they are taking more advantage of these schemes.  I hope from the increased interest that they are now taking, particularly in schemes for the improvement of the land, that we will see a further spreading of that new spirit of confidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>A question of mine on yesterday's Order Paper made certain inquiries in relation to the dispute and strike which is at present going on in the Dublin District Milk Board.  I had hoped the Minister's reply would explain why this strike should ever have taken place and that it would also indicate that the Minister had in mind to take certain measures, as a matter of urgency, calculated to lead to an early settlement of the dispute and to an early resumption of the <Col N="1152" /> normal functions and services provided by the Board.  The reply by the Minister gave, I would say, a reasonably accurate but nevertheless full report of what has led up to the present position.</P>
      <P>At this stage it might, perhaps, be no harm to refresh our memories in regard to the question asked and the reply given by the Minister.  The question was:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Agriculture if he will give the history of events leading to the present dispute and strike in the Dublin District Milk Board; and if he will outline the steps to prevent this strike occuring.</P>
      <P>The reply was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so very long. The substance of the reply is the history given by the Minister back to 1961 when opportunities were last granted to the staff of the Dublin District Milk Board to have the machinery of arbitration come into play on their application for an increase in salary.  At that time a substantial increase was granted.  Two years later, the same staff came along again with a fresh application and, for some reason, the Minister considered this an abnormal happening.  It was exactly two years after the 1961 increase that the second application was made.  It was made in December, 1963.  I wanted to be absolutely accurate and that is why I wanted to give the Minister's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time the arbitrator's award was given in 1961, it was a substantial award.  That indicates to me, at least, that the arbitrator investigating the case was satisfied that the staff of the Dublin District Milk Board had been very much underpaid up to that date.  He made his award, bringing the salaries of the people employed up to the salaries in most of the semi-State bodies.  Between that date and December, 1963, a further substantial increase was secured by the semi-State bodies to which I referred and that <Col N="1153" /> made the staff of the Dublin District Milk Board feel, I believe, entitled to make a further application.</P>
    <P>While they were quite satisfied with the award they got in 1961, they felt that, if other semi-State bodies got this additional award, they were entitled to look for another increase.  Consequently, they lodged the application in December, 1963.  They were brought into the Department.  They hoped the invitation meant they would have an opportunity of discussing their claim and having it considered. Apparently, when they reached the Department, it was made quite clear by the officers that they were there merely to listen to the case these people had to make but neither to discuss nor consider the claim.  This was looked upon as discourtesy more or less in the circumstances.  It certainly did not improve relations.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that this claim was lodged prior to the ninth round and certainly a considerable time before the 12 per cent had been decided upon.  I think I am right in saying that the staff of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara were in a similar position. Around the same period, and before the ninth round, they had lodged a claim.  Now, they got the ninth round, but they still pursued their claim, and eventually they were granted the facilities of arbitration. When arbitration failed to bring about a result, the Labour Court was brought in.</P>
    <P>All the staff of the Dublin District Milk Board are asking for is that their case be considered in a reasonable way and that the machinery available be used to decide whether or not their claim is just.  As far as I know, they are quite prepared to accept, without question, the result of any such arbitration.  In the course of supplementaries, I said the Taoiseach had stated in this House that there was no reason at the present time why a strike should occur in this country, that we have adequate machinery and that that machinery should be fully utilised before any dispute arose. In this case, the machinery has not been used and I assert the worst possible staff relationship exists at the moment.  It is altogether wrong and <Col N="1154" /> very irresponsible for a Minister of State to say, as the Minister said yesterday, that he would never allow arbitration in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will repeat what he said when he replies.  I looked for the Minister this morning to discuss this matter seriously with him.  My only anxiety is to have a settlement, and I want to have an early settlement.  I looked for the Minister this morning to see if, even at this stage, I could intervene to the extent of persuading the people concerned, and that includes the inseminators in the Leinster cattle breeding station, to return to work. Would the Minister consider, if that happens, offering to put the machinery of arbitration in motion immediately? That is all that is being asked.  I think it is a reasonable request and I am hopeful that the Minister will consider that it is a reasonable way to approach the matter and that it can be settled on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need hardly draw attention to the losses which are occurring.  At the station, we have about 40 inseminators. These men are all out.  At this time of the year, the normal number of inseminations would be 500 to 600 per day.  Perhaps a couple of hundred would be repeat inseminations, but there is still a loss of about 400.  Let us take the figure of 400 for the purpose of calculating the loss.  If we put three gallons per cow per day in the spring of next year, we can see what a very considerable amount of milk will <Col N="1155" /> be lost and the loss of income that will mean to the farmers concerned.  It is a loss of income to the State, a considerable loss.</P>
    <P>I know expenditure must be placed against that, but there is a loss and, worse still, I am aware that at least three of the inseminators have gone to England already.  The book-keeper has taken up another job and I fear if this is allowed to go on indefinitely, we shall have no staff.  Many of these people, who are not wealthy people, incidentally, have built their own houses with the aid of loans and grants and they cannot afford to be idle, but they will not pass a picket.  That is something we have in this country, whether right or wrong, and the Minister knows it.  It is altogether wrong to insist in an unreasonable way that this should happen.  These men will have to go out of the country to get employment and they will not be available when we want them.  These are losses and considerable losses, that should not be lost sight of,</P>
    <P>There is a loss of income, a loss of trained staff and a loss of confidence in the service.  This happened once before. I know what happened and I know what is about to happen at this moment.  Many farmers are making up their minds to buy bulls.  Many of them will not be too particular about the quality of the bulls.  That is very unfortunate.  When they buy a bull, they will not go back for the service for a considerable time at least.  I think an amount of good work was being done under the AI service available and the standard of the bulls was improving all the time.  We have evidence that better bulls are coming into the station.  Allowing this situation to continue will only create illwill and a sense of grievance on the part of the staff and, generally speaking, it is altogether undesirable and unnecessary. It should never have taken place.</P>

      <P>Nothwithstanding that pose, he comes into this House to advocate not only the ninth round and its provisions for those for whom it was intended, but red-hot on the receipt of the ninth round, he wants me to concede arbitration.  I made it clear here at Question Time yesterday that the claim of the staff of the Dublin Milk Board had been arbitrated on generously&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I gave figures showing that by comparison with similar grades in my Department, that award was about £117, at the maximum, greater than that given to my own staff.  It is true that employees of the Dublin Milk Board made a claim which they were entitled to make, but at that time there was a national agreement reached&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose I were to take the line, which I could have taken, although it would appear to be a bit unreasonable for a member of the Government to do so, of saying: This claim was received prior to the national agreement and, therefore, I will not concede to this staff the benefit of the national agreement, but let them go to arbitration.  I could have met the case that way, but, having taken the course I took, which was the normal one, seeing that the Government accepted the agreement and implemented it, it would be strange if, in relation to this staff, because their claim was made prior to the agreement, I should say: &ldquo;The agreement will not operate but you will get arbitration.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>How does the Minister explain Bord Iascaigh Mhara?</P>

    <Col N="1158" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to explain my own case and I know it very well. I know on what side I am, the side of fair play and justice.  My conception of fair play and justice is that I should not just use this House for the purpose of blowing hot and cold.  I know the inconvenience the farmers suffer and I know what this service means.  First, I would wish it had never arisen and, naturally, I should like to see it settled in half-a-second.  I do not think Deputy Clinton's remarks will contribute in any way towards that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister does not wish it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a responsibility; I discharge it and I know what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In your own way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In the proper way.  I know the inconvenience that farmers suffer and the loss that will be sustained, but in a service such as this which is so sensitive to irresponsible action, am I to allow such irresponsible action to force me into conceding something I know is not just?  My refusal of arbitration in this instance is not comparable with the ordinary application at a normal time for arbitration on a legitimate claim and it is entirely fruitless for any Deputy to attempt to represent it as such.</P>
      <P>I should like the inseminators and the staff of the Milk Board to realise that in the Dublin milk area there are 3,500 licensed bulls, apart altogether from the service that is provided by the insemination stations: that only 40 or 50 per cent of the cows in the country are inseminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a big percentage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but it would not be a useless exercise if the inseminators would give a thought to these figures that I have just cited and also give a thought to the point that Deputy Clinton himself has made, that the farmers may say to themselves, &ldquo;Are we going to be held up from year to year by 19 or 20 people who, by their action can&mdash;I would not say force&mdash; but entice 50 other more important people to, as they say, refuse to pass <Col N="1159" /> the picket?&rdquo;  Then the farmers will take the further step Deputy Clinton has mentioned and, instead of there being 3,500 bulls for service in the Dublin milk area, there may be 6,000. That is something that will have to be faced by farmers and stock owners if this service is going to be held up in this fashion, notwithstanding the treatment being meted out to them, which is the same as the treatment being meted out to staffs of other organisations and other employers.</P>
      <P>There are many employees who have been fighting to get the 12 per cent. It was given willingly.  What is wrong with them?  Do they think they can walk out and hold a gun to the head of the farmers of the country who, from the milk they produce and all the rest of it, are paying their salaries? If they think that, I can tell Deputy Clinton and everybody else that I will be right here four square where I am, on my feet, to resist that by every means at my disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know how people can be canvassed, even the secretaries and the chairman of farming organisations&mdash; the NFA.  I got two wires yesterday. How do I know these wires were not canvassed wires?  I remember on another occasion there was a creamery strike threatened in the south.  It was in the Dairy Disposal Company area. It was in a number of their creameries. Of course, I received wires from members of my own organisation, who had no association with creameries at all, warning me of what would happen to the milk and all the rest of it.  These wires, of course, were intended to intimidate me and it was thought I would stuff them into my pocket and say nothing about them.  I replied to them.  I just told them that while a Minister should listen to what is reasonable there is no use trying on <Col N="1160" /> this pressurisation simply because some inconvenience may be caused.</P>
    <P>I know Deputy Clinton since he came into this House.  He is a mild and modest man.  He is a Deputy who can go a bit with everybody.  I have no doubt that I will have questions from him on the Order Paper asking me about all the farmers' problems all over the country and, of course, when there is a trade union dispute of some kind or another, Deputy Clinton will be on the band wagon, too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a bandwagon man, and the Minister knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Clinton wanted to do something that would be advantageous to the staff who have foolishly taken this course, the proper thing to tell them, as I tried to tell them yesterday, was to have a bit of common sense and wit, in their own interest, and to go back to their jobs. There are plenty of people who would be glad to have them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>If that worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see.  I can give the House the assurance that there will be other claims and other demands in the course of time, but, as far as this claim is concerned, following hotfoot on the concession of the 12 per cent, they are just up against a stone wall.</P>
