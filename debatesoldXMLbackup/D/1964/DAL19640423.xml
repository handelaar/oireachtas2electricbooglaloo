      <P>I should like, Sir, to raise a matter now.  Yesterday, when the motion for the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor General had been put to the House, and agreed, the Minister for Social Welfare was heard to make a remark, and was reported in the newspapers and also in the Official Report, as having said&mdash;I quote&mdash;&ldquo;The Labour Party are professional liars&rdquo;.  I am asking you now, a Cheann Comhairle, to call upon the Minister to withdraw that remark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking yesterday evening, I referred to the four per cent increase in national productivity to which the Minister had adverted in his Budget speech.  He made a certain amount of play with this four per cent national increase and I was making the point that I assumed that the four per cent increase was correct and, that being so, nothing had been done in this Budget to further any increase in that productivity as, indeed, nothing had been done in the last Budget to increase it.</P>
      <P>The increase which have come about in national productivity have been very largely in spite of Government intervention and not because of it.  I was linking up the effect of the 2½ per cent sales tax, or turnover tax, introduced by the Government in November last, in relation to which the Government spoke with two voices&mdash;we were told it was a very small tax, on the one hand, and that it would be anti-inflationary, on the other-and, as I said last night, these two things do not make sense. If it were a small tax, it would not have an inflationary or anti-inflationary effect.  In point of fact, it was a very large tax which was to yield something like £11,000,000.  The yield which has taken place since November has been well up to expectations and the Minister made no case that that tax had failed in its purpose of producing the expected revenue.  It has produced more than was expected; in other words, it is buoyant as, indeed, we all expected it would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This tax has placed a considerable burden on the business community.  I do not intend to go into that question in this Budget speech but, as the House will remember, there was a by-election very shortly before the tax came into effect and it showed overwhelmingly <Col N="313" /> the public reaction of anger at this tax. At the same time we were being told by the Taoiseach we must be careful not to increase wages, we must be careful to increase productivity without increasing wages, that otherwise we would interfere with exports, and so on.</P>
    <P>That was what we were hearing in the autumn of last year.  Yet suddenly, in February, the ninth round was granted.  We were told in the Budget that it was to prevent a free-for-all. As I said, it was not a free-for-all, it was all for free.  There was no increase in productivity, no increase in the volume of goods produced.  It was bound to have not an inflationary tendency but, as it did have, an immediate inflationary effect.  It appeared to be very nice for everyone who got the 12 per cent increase; of course, certain classes of the community did not participate in that.</P>
    <P>The cost of living has shot up since then and will continue to shoot up. There is no way the farming community, the business community or the industrial community can carry the effects of these two tremendous increases that have taken place.  There is the absurd situation that a tax is imposed in November; wage increases are given in February to help meet that; then taxation is finally imposed in April to meet the costs of the February increases.</P>
    <P>Is there not something crazy about that type of finance?  What sort of economics is it, that creates a situation in which a Government has to do that? We used to expect that the Budget would be a help to industry and to people generally.  This Budget has failed miserably in that respect.  Where it has given anything it has given with a very small hand and, indeed, it has not given it yet; the old age pensioners, the widows, and so on who are getting the 2/6 a week extra will not get it till next August.  It is a case of live horse and you will get grass.  There is not very much increase for them in this Budget.</P>
    <P>I am primarily interested in the <Col N="314" /> business and the urban community, representing as I do a city constituency; there are others who are better able to put the case for the farmers.  There was an idea that the ship of State should be trimmed, if necessary, for heavy weather.  I do not see any trimming here except political trimming and that is what has landed us in the difficulty we are in.  This is a political Budget, not an economic Budget.  There is practically nothing in it for the poorer sections of the community and it does not help the business community.  A little is done for the farming community but my farming friends and Deputies here have said that what is being done is not very practical.  The idea that a budget is an instrument for furthering generally the economy and the economic wealth of the State is not recognised in this Budget.</P>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance was speaking yesterday on the Budget he referred to a speech by Deputy John A. Costello.  He said we did not speak as one voice.  Of course, we do not speak as one voice.  This Party has never been a regimented Party.  We all have different viewpoints on certain matters but when joint action is necessary and desirable we act jointly.  In fact it might be said that our motto is diversity in unity.  We are a united Party and we hold diverse views on certain things.  However, when one examines what Deputy Costello said yesterday about the Budget one begins to realise it is such an extraordinary Budget, it is such a patchwork of different ideas and different shades of economic thought that an Opposition who were doing their duty and were speaking sincerely could approach it only from different points of view.</P>
    <P>I can perfectly well understand that Deputy Costello considered this to be a conservative Budget.  It is conservative in the sense that it does not go forward and do the things which, in the 20th century, we expect the Budget to do for the state of the nation, and the well-being of the country as a whole.  It is like a Budget which would <Col N="315" /> have been produced many years ago when a <i>laissez faire</i> policy held sway and little was done for the people. That is not how we should approach the Budget, in my view.  It fails completely because it is not cohesive. It cannot be said that it gives anything to the really poor sections of the community, because what they are getting is long delayed, and is not very much anyway.  An increase of 2/6 is not very much.  It certainly cannot be said that it helps the business man, because it does not.  It cannot be said that it does a whole lot for the farmers either.  It does, probably, a little more for the farmers than for other sections of the community, but that is mighty little.</P>
    <P>The price of milk is going up by 2d. a gallon.  I am glad to see the producers of milk getting what they require to remunerate them properly. Some time ago we saw dairy herds being sold because they were uneconomic. I believe 2d. on the gallon of milk means something like 5d. or 6d. on the pound of butter and, in my constituency and all over the country, the purchasers of butter will very soon find that their costs are going up very considerably.  In spite of the very big taxation imposed last November&mdash;and the purchase tax is a big tax&mdash;we were reduced to the three classics as well: 1d. on the pint, so much on spirits, and so much on cigarettes.  Those three old classics were taken out of the stable and given a run.  That practice was probably started in Gladstone's day or before it.  With the already high taxation, we thought we would not have to face an increase on those three items.  I wonder how far beer, spirits and cigarettes can be taxed before the point is reached at which their sales are affected to the extent which would make them unremunerative.  I imagine we are getting very close to that point now.</P>
    <P>The price of petrol is up, too.  That will not be a help to industry generally, or to CIE.  I think the Minister said CIE were partly exempted, but I believe it will have the effect of increasing <Col N="316" /> fares, and increasing the difficulties of that company.</P>
    <P>I come now to the increases in the Post Office charges.  They properly belong to this Budget and should have been brought in with it, but they were brought in afterwards so that they would not have the same political effect as they would have if they were introduced in the Budget.  If they were, the Budget would be an even gloomier document than it is.  A charge of 5d for a letter will be a very great burden on the business community.  Many firms do a tremendous mail order business.  They will be very heavily hit. Travel agencies and other businesses that send out a great number of circulars will be heavily hit.  Indeed, there is an increasing use of circulars.  With the very good, efficient and quick methods of printing, and the copying machines that are available, firms are making more and more use of mail order business, sending out advertising literature.  They will be appallingly expensive now at 5d a letter.</P>
    <P>The cost of telephones is increased. That will hit grocers very heavily. Many private grocers, butchers, and such people, ring up their customers in the morning to ask them what they want.  This Budget puts up their costs, and it will be another nail in the coffin of the personal businesses as opposed to the big market places from which you carry your stuff away.  I do not think the Government realise the effect it will have on a number of grocery businesses and purveyors generally.</P>
    <P>Telegrams will now be very expensive. I think a minimum of 5/- was the figure mentioned.  That will lead to a decreasing use of telegrams.  Telegrams are very useful for business people, and it is very important to keep them as cheap as possible.  By doing so, you get a great usage of them.  If you put the price up, people will use telegrams only as they were used formerly to announce tragedies or, perhaps, some unexpected pleasant occurrences in families.  Of late with cheap telegrams, people used them a great deal, and so did business generally.  Now there will be an increase in their overheads.</P>
    <P>All thinking people must be very <Col N="317" /> disappointed with the Budget.  The country is now going through a period of inflation which is a direct result of the Government's action.  It is ironical that were it not for the three by-elections, we might not have had the 2½ per cent tax, and the 12 per cent increase. We certainly would not have had the 12 per cent increase, and we would have had an entirely different type of Budget.  All this shows that we are dealing with a form of political opportunism and not primarily with something designed really to help the country generally. That is why I and many other people are very disappointed with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully submit that this is a good sound solid Budget. It is typically straightforward, level-headed and sane.  It is designed to stimulate progress and to raise the standard of living of the individual and of the nation.  One of the things that strike me since this debate started is the dead, lethargic wet-blanket approach of the Opposition.  Somehow or other, they do not seem to have been able, despite their reconnoitring, to put forward any sound constructive criticisms but have wandered aimlessly around in their political desert, suggesting that certain benefits could be given without providing the necessary finance to pay for them and so on.  It again clearly shows the irresponsible attitude which they have always adopted towards this very serious matter of providing necessary funds to run the services of our country for a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is because they have been more or less stunned and hypnotised by the results of the by-elections but whatever it is, they seem more or less to have gone dead completely in recent months.  I know that it is the duty of an Opposition, if at all possible, to put forward constructive criticism.  I submit that they have failed completely in that respect.  One of the first and most essential parts of a good Budget is that it is balanced and that it more or less fits in with a co-ordinated plan.  This Government in 1958, put forward the new <Col N="318" /> plans for economic expansion and each year since then they have designed the Budgets more or less to fit into that programme.  This Budget is also designed to fit in with the <i>Second Plan for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will soon burst with expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we contrast the approach of this Government with that of the Opposition, we will not have to travel back very far into past history.  It will suffice to glance at their two records when they formed the two disastrous Coalition Governments. They left us a deficit in 1951 and again in 1956/57.  In that year, the deficit showed £7.9 million, there were 94,000 unemployed and the national income was down by three per cent.  Buildings and national development programmes of all kinds had come to a standstill.  The worst part of all was that public confidence had been frittered away by their dismal, feeble approach to stem the tides of unemployment and emigration.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> gave a new sense of purpose and direction to economic expansion.  Each year since then, we have provided the stimulus necessary to ensure that these targets will be attained, if at all possible.  To cut down on expenditure at the expense of the vital services has never been our policy.  We believe that if the nation is to go ahead, it is the duty of a Government to move in and to direct by the Budget certain trends so as to ensure that the nation and the individual will progress from year to year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Budget has been criticised because it provides assistance for farmers.  I do not think that the Government's attitude needs any defence.  The farming community, like all the other sections, are entitled to their share of the ninth round 12 per cent increase.  They are in a rather awkward position by virtue of the fact that they have to sell their goods on markets that are not at all to their advantage.  As a matter of fact, world competition in agriculture has brought prices down so low that it is necessary for the Government to subsidise on the <Col N="319" /> export market much of the agricultural goods leaving our country.  Surely it could not be argued that the farmer should be expected to sell, say, his butter on a foreign market without a subsidy.  He could not do this and survive.  If the Government allowed such a situation to develop, it would eventually affect all our dairy industry, our store cattle trade and indeed the whole agricultural industry which is of itself a very important branch of our economy and no Government would be justified in allowing that to happen.</P>
    <P>The important point about the aid which the Government are giving farmers is that it is more or less designed so that the farmers themselves can influence the amount given by their own industry; in other words, it has been given on fertilisers, and so on, which help the farmer to increase his production and that is exactly what is happening.  There are also farm loans and grants for farm buildings available this year.  Surely nobody would suggest that we cut down on these so as to avoid any unpleasant taxes.</P>
    <P>I think that one of the greatest tragedies since the Famine that ever hit agriculture in this country and the rural people as a whole was the advent of the Leader of the Opposition as a Minister for Agriculture.  When one realises that away back in 1948-49 he said, as reported in the Official Report, Volume 129, No. 14:</P>
    <P>Do Deputies of this House know what our principal problem was in the years of the Marshall Aid&mdash;to get dollars spent?  We spent dollars on maize.  I spent five million dollars on wheat in one afternoon.</P>
    <P>That was the boast made by a Minister because he spent money that was lent to this country by the American Government&mdash;money that has to be paid back.  He spent that by buying commodities which could have been produced by the Irish farmer.</P>
    <P>That was his approach towards the wheat problem and towards agriculture in general.  Indeed, his record in <Col N="320" /> dealing with the dairying industry was nothing better than his attitude towards wheat or beet.  That was at a time when our farmers should have been receiving the encouragement and the assistance which would help them to modernise their methods of working and to give them some hope of surviving on the export market.  When he was approached regarding an increase in the price of milk, he refused even to meet these people about whom he now pontificates and waves their journal across the House in a defiant manner at Deputies on this side.  He said he had not the slighest intention of asking the Government to increase the price of milk.  That was at a meeting at Rathluirc in the Cork constituency on November 1st 1948.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government did the right thing in providing this extra money to give the farmers an increase of 2d. per gallon on their milk.  I heard a Deputy opposite say it would be disastrous so far as the cities are concerned, but I think the Minister said it would not mean an increase in the price of butter. It shows you how much a city Deputy often knows about the problems of the rural constituencies. I do not think the Government could have neglected to provide the extra money needed by the farming community.</P>
    <P>In respect of any of the other headings in the Budget, I have not heard anybody say where any pruning could take place.  This year the capital expenditure on housing is £16.6 millions.  Surely it is necessary for the Government to provide the finances to enable the less fortunate members of the community to provide themselves with decent homes?  If the Government cut down on that, it would eventually reflect on the local authorities and it would have the disastrous effect, as in 1956 and 1957, of stopping the housing drive all over the country.  I would never like to get back to those drab years.  In my own constituency, the housing grants were cut out overnight in a last ditch stand by the Coalition to try to overcome their misfortunes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="321" /> It is now conceded by most people that in those days the then Minister for Finance called a conference in Dublin to which he invited all the county managers.  The then Minister for Local Government was present. They were told to cut down immediately on all housing expenditure. There were to be no further grants and they were to delay in every possible way, because there was no money available in the Local Loans Fund. Although certain people may not like to hear these things said, it is only right that we should remind the country of the difference between a solid, united, one-Party Government and the disastrous effects of a Coalition.</P>
    <P>No houses were built in my constituency. Private housing stopped completely because the small farmers found out that no Government grants were available and that the county council had not the money to provide them with a supplementary grant.  It was, in particular, the stopping of the supplementary grants which caused this disaster.  I am glad we have got away from that approach to the housing problem and that now, all over the country, new houses are being built. Indeed, never was there a greater boom in the building industry.

      <P>I shall be delighted to listen to your feeble efforts.  I know it is not easy for these people to hear this being told to them.  When they are out of office, they are great people for suggesting various schemes, but when in office, they seem to forget all these things and, in particular, they seem to forget to provide the necessary finances. It is time for them to review their whole programme and educate themselves to the fact that the ordinary people are much more educated than the Opposition, particularly Fine Gael, seem to think.  The people are shrewd, <Col N="322" /> keen judges as to the Government under whom they will be better off. They have shown that very emphatically in recent times.</P>
      <P>This year we are also providing £4.10 millions for sanitary services and water supplies, particularly in rural areas.  Do the Opposition feel that these services are not necessary?  Is their approach that we should leave the people in rural Ireland without sanitation and water?  If so, they should say so; if not, they should not grumble if the money for these services is being provided.  It is high time the people in rural Ireland had these amenities.  We have provided them with rural electrification and we are doing everything within our power to provide them with sanitary and water services.  Very often in local councils it has been very difficult to push these services through because of the organised opposition, particularly from Fine Gael.  They are all things to all men when they are out of office, but when they are in office, they are very reluctant to do anything for the betterment of the ordinary individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently, the Government announced a further plan to help bring better facilities for education within the grasp of the ordinary people.  In 1961, they introduced the scholarship scheme, and now £69,000 is being provided for it.  They also increased by about 670 the number of teachers in national schools.  In recent years, they have reduced the number of pupils per class, thus giving teachers in larger schools a better opportunity of giving more individual attention to the pupils.  To build 412 new schools in the past five years was no mean accomplishment for this Government. Indeed, when one thinks of the record of the Opposition in this respect, one realises how deplorable it is.  Not a single school was built in my constituency during their term of office. The Government also have had in mind the question of raising the school-leaving age.  They are planning for that by providing better schools <Col N="323" /> and more teachers.  Eventually, when the time is ripe this is our aim.</P>
      <P>A new training college has also been built in recent years as a further proof of our helpful approach to education. We believe that the national school is the foundation on which all other schools are founded and we believe in providing good national schools.  We have increased the heating and cleaning grants, provided more money each year for new schools and the reconstruction of old ones and have introduced a system under which they will be painted periodically and repaired, if necessary.  I think that approach is one that every Deputy should welcome, irrespective of his allegiance.  Surely Fine Gael Deputies do not expect us to go back to the time when 60, 70 or 80 children were herded together in deep litter hovels with terrible sanitary conditions.  Our idea is that the schools should be more or less showplaces in which children would have nice bright surroundings, proper sanitation and water supplies.  Unless the rural water schemes of Fianna Fáil are pushed ahead, how can we get running water into the schools?  Not alone is it good to have these facilities for the health as a whole but it is good for the health of the children and makes life brighter for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has also informed the Government that he is going to provide comprehensive schools.  More money is being allocated in this Budget for vocational education too.  Some Opposition Deputy said the other day that it is well for a Deputy to examine progress by reference to his own constituency.  In my constituency now at least three new vocational schools are in course of erection and a school of technology, we hope, will also be provided.  At least we are promised a 17-room vocational school in our capital town.  During the Coalition term of office, there were none of these educational advances.  Their dismal record was to cut grants to secondary schools by ten per cent.  This Government have increased capitation grants which give a tremendous help to the development of post-primary education <Col N="324" /> and the provision of secondary school facilities that we know are needed. The only way to do this is to provide for it in the Budget.</P>
    <P>It may also be necessary to refer to our record in social services.  Every worthwhile service for the benefit of the people came from this side of the House.  The Fianna Fáil Government provided the widows' pensions and children's allowances.  They provided by their programme so far better working facilities, better working hours, a half-day during the week and so on.  These came by Fianna Fáil legislation at a time when we had an overall majority.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to provide the money, to keep the services going, to improve them, and to give better facilities to the less fortunate, especially to those who are sick and need hospital treatment; to maintain health services, provide for disabled people and mentally handicapped children and provide also for ordinary people who want better houses, schools and roads. If we wished this year, we could have stayed as we were and put on no increases but that would not fit in with our plan for economic expansion and consequently some small increases were necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody should grumble about the tax that has gone on spirits.  It was high time that the Minister adverted to the fact that there are many people lately, who probably through snobbery or otherwise develop a preference for imported spirits.  We have had a tradition for many years of making the best whiskey in the world and it is deplorable to find many people standing in bars bemoaning and lamenting emigration and unemployment, criticising the failure to widen certain roads or build new bridges and otherwise complaining, while at the same time drinking foreign whiskey and so depriving farmers of a better barley price and depriving those engaged in the distillery industry of a livelihood.  If people feel like drinking these imported spirits, that is their own business. We do not want to marshal them into the type of State in which we would tell them what to eat and <Col N="325" /> drink but it is only fair to bring home to them that if they want these drinks, they must pay a little extra for them.</P>
    <P>I submit this is a good Budget.  The Opposition, and, particularly, Fine Gael remind me of the Bourbons, who over all the years learned nothing and forgot nothing.  Certainly they do not seem to have learned a lot with regard to framing a budget designed to improve the lot of the people.  I compliment the Minister on the way he has framed this Budget.  I am quite sure it is for the benefit of the nation.  It will provide greater facilities for employment and is an attempt to cure many of the ills that have beset us in the past and prepare us for a better life, a higher standard of living and better facilities all round in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely pathetic to have to sit here and listen to Deputy Dolan pretending to the House and the nation that the Government Party are a great Party and constitute a glorious regime and telling us what a wonderful state of affairs obtains in the land today.  It is still more pathetic to hear the Deputy harking back to the periods of Coalition Government and seeking to blame these Governments for the conditions that exist in Ireland now.  That was all right a number of years ago but the allegations that the Coalition Governments were responsible for destroying the hopes for a better future for this country are now threadbare and people do not accept that kind of argument any longer.  The people are not so gullible as not to realise that since this State was founded in 1922 for by far the greatest period of time Fianna Fáil have been the dominant Party in this country and have in fact governed for 25 years out of those 40 years. For that period of time they have been charged by the people with the responsibility of ordering the affairs of this nation.  During that long period, they have had unbridled liberty to control the destinies of the nation. Since 1957 to this day, they have been in office.  They have been afforded every conceivable opportunity of implementing the ideals and aspirations <Col N="326" /> for which so many great men on all sides died.</P>
      <P>They must therefore accept the full responsibility for the shocking state of affairs which obtains in Ireland today. Government Deputies must realise that this country has become a virtual byword for a degenerating nation amongst great and progressive nations and we have got the name of a vanishing race because of the permitted exodus and flight of our youth, a rising tide of emigration, with our people flying to the four corners of the world because they are denied a living in their own land.  We have the highest unemployment rate in Europe; we have the worst social welfare benefits; and we have a rotten health system. Moreover, we have not as yet conceded to our children equal rights and equal opportunities in respect of education. We are the only country in Europe which has not yet conferred on the children an opportunity to go on for further education in accordance with their abilities.  The odious means test applies in this fundamental issue of health and education and money is the criterion not the ability of the child to learn, and not the need for hospitalisation.</P>
      <P>This is the kind of sorry situation for which the Government Party have been responsible.  It is not good enough to try to blame the other fellow any longer.  That cuts no ice and the people are not swayed by that type of propaganda any longer.  The fact is that this Government have failed miserably to solve our economic problems.  We have had very many proposals in regard to economic plans.  We have had one economic plan which allegedly has been implemented and we have now embarked on another.  Before I come to that plan, I want to say that this Budget has caused shock and disappointment amongst all sections of the community, and not least amongst the supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party. One cannot discuss this Budget except in the context of the Budget of 1963 because we must not forget that the inherent directives of that Budget were only implemented last November through the turnover tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> It amused me this time 12 months ago when the Minister for Finance announced his Budget because so many people were clapping their hands and saying what a wonderful Budget it was. They did not realise the sting in its tail, the implementing of a turnover tax which would increase the price of all commodities, send the cost of living spiralling upwards, drag down the standard of living, as well as precipitate a ninth round wage increase.  This wage increase has caused a vicious spiralling of prices and the 12 per cent, with the floor of £1, has been very largely invalidated, very largely absorbed altogether by the rising costs which the Government are allowing to continue without taking the necessary precaution of bringing in any kind of price control or restraint whatsoever.</P>
    <P>It would seem to us in the Labour Party that the Fianna Fáil Party seem to have a vested interest in allowing prices to spiral.  Admittedly, the higher prices go, the more they will rake in through the turnover tax, but I must allege further that the Party seem to have allowed themselves to become a pawn of the vested interests of this country, and are deliberately allowing our people to be exploited by all the profiteers, the usurers and the extortioners.  Profiteering is rampant throughout the land.  We have a pretence of investigation but we all know that the prices of bread, flour, sugar, clothes, shoes, medicines, cigarettes, beers, spirits, bus fares, electricity and every essential commodity and service have increased out of all proportion and that that came about as a direct result of the Government's action in introducing this turnover tax.</P>
    <P>By set purpose and by their own deliberate action, they precipitated this kind of economic situation which is fraught with very grave danger for the future.  We are in a period of serious inflation.  The Minister by the implementation of this Budget sought to do something about that serious inflationary trend.  I have referred to the shock and disappointment caused by this Budget.  Let us not forget that the only hope the Government and <Col N="328" /> their spokesmen had of selling the turnover tax to the people was on the basis that the ordinary methods of raising revenue would no longer operate or bring in the required amount of tax, that saturation point had been reached in regard to such things as cigarettes, beer, spirits, etc.</P>
    <P>They told their followers and this House that the turnover tax would bring in a colossal revenue, and it was expected that out of that revenue the standard of living of our people would be improved out of all proportion. It was realised that in any one year there would be not less than £14 million extra revenue and it was expected that £14 million extra would be devoted to improving social welfare benefits out of all proportion.  The aged, the sick, the unemployed, the disabled were hoping enthusiastically that following the implementation of the Budget and the amount of money the Minister for Finance was handling as a result of the turnover tax, they would all be in the lap of luxury.  The farmers were hoping for great things. So also were the workers, the industrialists, the shopkeepers and, in particular, those against whom the winds of adversity blow hardest.</P>
    <P>What has been the outcome?  I must suggest that the people have been absolutely betrayed.  This Budget is a betrayal of promises made, of hopes held out to our people.  Not only have the Government betrayed the promises made and held out to our people in respect of better services all round but they have had the brazen audacity to go back on their word and to impose additional taxation to the extent of £7 million on beer, spirits, cigarettes and petrol.</P>
    <P>These are commodities which this time 12 months ago were untouchable, which could not be relied upon to raise any worthwhile increase in revenue and, therefore, we had to have a turnover tax.  It is a particularly scandalous performance on the part of any Government that they should have the audacity to go back on their word and to impose additional taxation of this kind.  Clearly, they have not the courage to carry out the intention <Col N="329" /> behind the principle of turnover tax, that future revenue would be garnered by increasing the turnover tax percentage by the amount required.  If two and a half per cent was not enough this year, they should have had the courage to make it three per cent or five per cent but too many of us had forecast that this little baby, the two and a half per cent, might yet turn out to be a monster and, rather than reveal the monster at this early stage, it was decided to go back on the promises that were made and to have another bash at cigarettes, beer and spirits and to drag in petrol as well.</P>
    <P>As a Labour member of this House, I must ask myself what benefit does this Budget confer on the people to whom I have a particular responsibility. We have had vain boasting in recent times about what would be done in respect of education.  We have had statements about revolutionary changes to take place in respect of education, housing and many other facets of our economy.  Being actively interested in education, I must express my deep and profound regret that there is nothing in the Budget to improve the educational system. The increase in the Estimate for Education is barely sufficient to provide chalk for the blackboards, never mind to implement the revolutionary changes of which the Taoiseach and many of his Ministers have talked in past months.</P>
    <P>What, now, of the schools of technology which we all cry out for? what, now, of the increased grants for the attainment of the ideal for which we stand of free education for our children?  What, now, about breaking down the class barriers?  What, now, of the erection of the comprehensive schools?  What, now, of the erection of the many new schools that are required and the repair of the many dilapidated and insanitary hovels in which our children are compelled to receive education in these times?  There is nothing in the Estimate which will transform that sorry picture which I have illustrated.</P>
    <P>When I came into this House, in <Col N="330" /> 1961, one of the burning topics which agitated our minds was the complete withdrawal of the Health Act or, at least, its radical alteration.  The Opposition in this House were able to force the Minister for Health to set up a Select Committee of this House to examine the Health Act and to bring in the necessary amendments.  Three years have elapsed.  Admittedly, the Committee were given leave to continue their deliberations but I want to express my personal impatience with that Committee.  It was felt that the Minister for Health would have availed of the opportunity provided by the Budget to introduce, at least as a temporary measure, some of the changes which we deem to be essential in the Health Act.  The essential changes we require are that the odious and vicious means test for medical cards would be liberalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good, but I must at least refer to the absence of any worthwhile figure in the Estimate in respect of essential health services, which affect so many of our people. There are thousands of our people affected by this odious measure and who are looking to the Government and to the Dáil for speedy amendment of the Health Act and the introduction of a measure which will guarantee all of the people the right to hospitalisation, to free choice of doctor, to drugs and medicines as required, that money will not be the criterion.</P>

      <P>Again, with regard to social welfare, we have had the vain boasting as to what a great Party the Government Party have been.  Any of us close to the wants and sufferings of the aged must have felt a sense of outrage at the miserable 2/6d. offered in the Budget.  In the context of the circumstances in which we now live and <Col N="331" /> having regard to the vast amount of money at the disposal of the Minister for Finance, it was expected that social welfare beneficiaries would get a very liberal increase, certainly not less than 7/6 and many felt that it would be 10/-, not so much because the Government could afford it, as they could, but that because of the increase in the cost of living, such increase in benefit was justified.</P>
      <P>It is galling in the extreme that for workers and salary earners a 12 per cent increase has been approved while little or no regard has been had for the most destitute and helpless section of our community.  It was a disgraceful performance on the part of the Minister for Social Welfare to allow this Budget to come before the House with nothing whatsoever in it for social welfare contributors and with only a miserly halfcrown for social welfare assistance.  It was, as has been said, a deliberate insult to those people to offer them that miserable halfcrown which, in terms of pre-war values, is worth about sixpence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not concede the 3½d.  Some people estimated it at 8½d. but we shall not fall out over the penny.  They have been conceded eightpence or ninepence.  I wish to disabuse Deputy Dolan, and other Fianna Fáil Deputies, of the idea or the pretence that all is well in this country.  My experience is that poverty, want, suffering and great humiliation are the lot of a goodly number of our people, particularly those of whom I have been speaking&mdash;the aged, the infirm and the sick poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know there are many living in destitution.  We know it is impossible for any old age pensioner living alone to exist on 35/- or 37/6 a week in these times.  Anyone can calculate the cost of food, services and comforts and how much of these one can purchase for 30/- in these times.  There is abject poverty in the homes of these aged people.  Were it not for the help of good neighbours or relatives, were <Col N="332" /> it not in the main for the support of home assistance officers in all areas, these people would die of virtual starvation.</P>
    <P>I assert that many aged people living alone are starving during the last two days of each week.  The money is spun out and they wait again for Friday to stagger down to the post office for the pension.  There is hardship, suffering and poverty in this country, despite the fact that the barefoot children have disappeared.  If the Minister for Social Welfare wants to look at it, we shall be only too delighted to show it to him.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have always suggested that the imposition of taxation should be apportioned in accordance with the ability to pay and that the revenue should be expended in accordance with the needs of the people.  We have suggested that those who are most in need, the weakest, poorest sections of our people, should be helped first. What we deplore about this Budget is its unfairness, its inequality, its injustice, because of the manner in which the taxation is collected and the revenue apportioned to the various sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare can deny that, if he thinks that in recent Budgets, in the allocation of revenue, the amounts apportioned for social welfare are not in fact decreasing rather than increasing.  Was the Taoiseach sincere in his assertion some time ago in reply to a query by Deputy McQuillan as to what was being done about reuniting this country and bringing into the fold our brethren in North-East Ulster?  The Taoiseach said that if those people came into a 32-county Republic, he would guarantee them the same social welfare benefits as they enjoy in that part of Ireland today.</P>
    <P>I know of no better way of reuniting this country than by bringing up the standard of living of our people in this part to the level of those in the North. There need not be a shot fired; there need not be any more antagonism or distrust.  All that is needed is that the Government have the courage to raise the standard of living of our people <Col N="333" /> to the level of our brothers and sisters in Ulster.  If that were done, we would have a reunited Ireland in the morning.</P>
    <P>Since we expect shortly a second Budget from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to cover increased charges for stamps, telephones, telegrams and, probably, television and radio licences, is it too much to hope that the Minister for Social Welfare would have the courage, before the Budget becomes law, to realise the injustice perpetrated on the social welfare section of the community and increase that miserly half-crown to at least 7/6, and to indicate clearly what he intends to provide for all the other beneficiaries, both contributory and non-contributory?  The allocation of 2/6 in these days of high prices is nothing less than making a mockery of the sufferings of those unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>We have heard quite a lot about the Government's <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> The Labour Party believe in economic planning: we believe in the organised planned development of our economy.  We believe the State has a fundamental responsibility to see that planning is so carried out as to bring about full employment, rising standards of living and to give us the essential services to which we feel our people are entitled. It is true to say that the Government's partial acceptance of the principle of planning is a tribute to the labour and trade union movements, because the labour and trade union movements have consistently advocated the necessity for organised planned development of the economy. It is an integral part of Labour policy and philosophy and we are proud of it.  We shall support this Government in every measure they take to implement planning of this kind.</P>
    <P>However, where the private enterprise section of our economy is unable or unwilling to do the job, as is clearly evident from the fact that we have 60,000 unemployed and many hundreds of thousands fleeing the country, we believe the State has a bounden duty to intervene to direct and control the destinies of the nation.  This type <Col N="334" /> of planning is something we shall always support.  Our fundamental objection to this so-called plan is that if one examines it in detail, it transpires that it is nothing but a forecast, a listing of objectives.  No action whatsoever is taken to ensure that the plan is implemented in anything like its entirety.  The so-called plan must be changed and the Government must take the necessary steps to ensure that the targets set are realised.</P>
    <P>The <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> had as its fundamental principle the provision of 100,000 jobs. That plan operated from 1958 to 1963 and had as its aim, as I said, the attainment of 100,000 jobs or near full employment in this country.  The facts are that over the period of the implementation of the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> under the Fianna Fáil Government, far from attaining anything like the figure of 100,000 jobs, statistics prove that 170,000 of our people emigrated&mdash;170,000 emigrated over the period of the first plan.  As has been said so many times, work was provided all right under that plan. It was provided in Birmingham Coventry, London, Glasgow and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>That first plan, in respect of the target set out, was an abject failure in attaining the first essential, full employment. The effort of the Government to put people into productive employment was a dismal failure. Even today unemployment is some thousands higher than it was in recent years and there are fewer people at work here at present.  Statistics will prove that there are fewer in employment than there were when the first plan was implemented in 1958.  One must conclude, as far as planning of this kind is concerned, it is worthless.</P>
    <P>We now have the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> which was launched with a flourish of trumpets. We are told it is intended under this plan that 78,000 jobs will be provided by 1970.  I read speeches by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and they were all loud <Col N="335" /> in their praises of what was to be achieved for this nation by the second plan.  If we examine the second plan, it will be seen that even if this targets are attained, even assuming 78,000 jobs are provided by 1970, seven years hence, that amounts to nearly 8,000 jobs per year and is less than half the number of jobs required for full employment. Even if this plan goes according to plan, without making a pun of it, the Fianna Fáil Government will be satisfied at the end of 1970 with at least a 3½ per cent unemployment figure and an emigration rate of at least 10,000 persons per year.  If all goes well and all the details of the plan are implemented, that will be the situation in 1970.  That is the plan.</P>
    <P>When the first plan was implemented, the labour and trade union movements advocated that the growth rate of 2 per cent set out at that time should be increased and that it was inadequate to bring about the happy situation intended.  The Government told the labour and trade union movements that they were being unrealistic in seeking to increase the growth rate by anything over 2 per cent, but in the period 1958 to 1963 the actual growth rate attained was not 2 per cent, but 4½ per cent.  By accident rather than by design of the Government, the growth rate attained was 4½ per cent, though the target set out was only 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>Again, at the expense of being called unrealistic, we suggest that the present growth rate set out in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> of 4 per cent be increased to at least 6 per cent.  I realise in saying that that some changes must be made but we are prepared to see radical changes made in the systems we operate in this country in order to attain full employment, the standard of living we desire and the happiness and prosperity of our people.</P>
    <P>Again, the growth rate set out in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> will not even bridge the gap between our living standards and the living standards of those in Great Britain and the countries of the Common Market.  A revealing table in <Col N="336" /> the document outlining the Government's plan clearly shows that the the gross national product in Britain in population in Ireland in 1970 will be £360.  This very same table indicates clearly that the gross national product for Great Britain in 1961, three years ago, was £510 per head of the population. The gross national product in Ireland in 1970 will be £360, while gross national product per head of the 1961 was £510.  It is clearly evident. at a growth rate of 4 per cent, that, while our relative standards will have improved, we will be far, far behind the standards of Britain or the countries of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> all sections of the community, industry, agriculture, etc., are given targets to attain.  We are all expected to work enthusiastically towards the attainment of these targets but we feel that without the determination of the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that these targets are, in fact, attained this is a planless plan in every sense.  It will achieve nothing.  We deny the contention of the Government as laid down in this so-called plan.  The Government can only persude, guide and exhort people to attain these objectives.  We maintain, in order to ensure that this plan becomes a reality, that the Government have an obligation to intervene directly in the management of the economic affairs of this country.  If they do not do that, this plan is nothing more than a hope for the economic salvation of this country.  Without taking the necessary steps to achieve it, it will produce nothing.</P>
    <P>There are inherent dangers in the Government's plan.  There is the lowering of tariffs at a time when we are denied the benefits and the advantages of the Common Market.  We regard this as the height of folly.  It is being done deliberately by the Government in order to spur on lazy employers, force them to modernise and re-equip their premises.  All that is being done at the expense of labour. The modernisation of industry through the medium of the grants, aids and <Col N="337" /> stimulants being poured into industry today means, in essence, the introduction of labour-saving devices of all kinds.</P>
    <P>We have, as the CIO reports have revealed in relation to the industries they have been examining, a colossal redundancy problem to contend with, not tomorrow but today.  Redundancy is rearing its ugly head in many industries here.  It is particularly regrettable that the protection these industries have enjoyed is being stripped away by deliberate Government policy in reducing tariffs and quotas.  Workers and management are advised to engage in productivity schemes, introduce all the most modern techniques and devices available in order to increase production.  In most cases all that is being done at the expense of men.  More and more are becoming unemployed according as these new ideas are foisted on industry.  There is no appreciable increase in production and no realistic attempt being made to increase production. Too many firms are satisfied to introduce all kinds of labour-saving gimmicks and economise at the expense of the worker rather than go out and seek new markets, increase production to meet the demands of these, and re-absorb redundant operatives.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have included in his Budget something to meet the colossal problem of redundancy, a redundancy which is likely to increase over the next few years.  Clearly, industry is either unable or unwilling to compensate those whom they are obliged to lay off.  In these circumstances, we contend the State has a bounden duty to see to it that men who are thrown on the unemployment scrapheap after 25 or 30 years' service with their employers are compensated, adequately compensated, for the services they have rendered their employers almost over a working lifetime. It is patently unjust that any man should be dismissed ignominiously without any regard being had to the social responsibility for the maintenance of his wife and family.  Not alone should these men be compensated but <Col N="338" /> there should be a training scheme implemented immediately to retrain these operatives and absorb them in some other productive work.  It is perhaps futile to be talking about retraining in present circumstances when we already have 60,000 unemployed seeking work.  The situation is farcical.  I do not know what the outcome will be but the Government should be alive to the situation and not allow it to get out of hand altogether.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the farming community were considered and have received benefits under this Budget.  With regard to the cushioning in respect of rates, I want to make an appeal for ratepayers other than farmers.  There is no relief and no redress apparently for urban ratepayers.  We welcome the concessions for the farmers but it is our duty to bring to the notice of the Government the problem of the spiralling of rates and the hardship and suffering it is causing so many shopkeepers, householders and cottiers all over the country.  It is gratifying that the Taoiseach should have indicated an interest in this matter but it is sad to think it may be as many years as he intimated before there will be any relief for those other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Clearly, it was not very difficult for the Minister for Finance to devise ways and means of helping the farmer to meet the impact of rates.  If the Government are sincere in their desire to assist the other categories to whom I have referred, it should be a simple matter to bring in proposals here for cushioning the impact of rates on other sections of the community.  The burden of rates is a tremendous worry and anxiety to many people.  I invite the Minister to say what he has in mind for helping the other categories to whom I have referred and when it is hoped the investigations will be completed.  Above all, when may local authorities hope for some good news in regard to the easing of the burden of rates?</P>
    <P>I know that many shopkeepers are feeling completely frustrated because of ever-increasing rates.  State grants given for the repair and improvement <Col N="339" /> of dwellings are being used now for the purpose of increasing rates. Grants for the reconstruction of houses have increased only slightly but these grants give the valuation authorities an opportunity of going in and revaluing. There have been instances in which the valuations have increased out of all proportion to the value of the reconstruction and repair carried out.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have never squirmed at increasing taxation provided that taxation was utilised to benefit all sections of our community, particularly those most in need.  In this Budget that is not being done.  When replying the Minister might tell the House <Col N="340" /> when the social welfare contributory section will get their increase.  He might tell us what relief of rates he will concede to the urban dweller.  He might indicate clearly to the House and to the nation, in respect of further revenue required, whether it will be his policy to pick out specific items such as cigarettes, petrol, beer and spirits rather than act upon the principle of increasing the turnover tax.  Either we have a turnover tax which is designed to garner in all the essential revenue or there will be this complete mix-up, this complete abandonment of the principle which the Government enunciated in relation to the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>I could deal with some other matters dear to my heart, housing, etc., but I feel sufficient has been said on this Budget.  I do not want to repeat myself or to repeat what has been said by other Deputies.  From my point of view, the Budget has been a great shock, a great disappointment, and an abject failure.  It brings no solace or hope to our people and the sections most betrayed and most disappointed are the ardent supporters of the present regime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it would be too much to expect that the Budget would be criticised in a logical way, that the Opposition would make the case that there had been either too much or too little expenditure provided for, because it is the expenditure which is provided for which decides the amount of taxation to be levied.  The Opposition, however, appear to be confirmed in the belief that it is good tactics to argue that the amount provided for all the services administered by the Government is too small and that, at the same time, the amount collected by way of taxation is too large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have thought that the results of the two recent by-elections in Cork and Kildare would have made it clear that the public are by now sufficiently mature to see through this kind of double talk, and that on this occasion the Opposition would have made up their minds to take a stand one way or the other, either to suggest <Col N="341" /> alternative ways of raising the necessary money being spent on the various services or else to say precisely where expenditure that is provided for in the Budget should be cut down, to say, for instance, that we should not have applied the ninth round of wage increases to State employees or to suggest that we should not have taken action to see that farmers' incomes did not lag too much behind other sectors and to relieve the position of social assistance recipients.  Instead of that lesson being learned from the recent by-elections, we have the same illogical and irreconcilable speeches being made this year.</P>
    <P>The Budget has been described as a farmers' Budget and I suppose that is not an unreasonable description in a year when direct arrangements are being made in the Budget for an increase of £5 million in farmers' incomes. However, it is unfair to say that the Government imposed this taxation specially for farmers or for social assistance recipients, simply because others got there first and the buoyancy of the revenue had already been swallowed up in wage increases for State employees.  It is, at least, as justifiable to say that the extra taxation was necessary for the payment of ninth round wage increases and status increases which have been granted to State employees as to say it was needed to raise farmers' incomes.  If this swallowing up of revenue buoyancy is to be a continuing feature, then extra taxation, in order to ensure that those sections of the community that have to depend on Government action to secure their share of increasing prosperity do not lag behind, is also likely to be a continuing feature.</P>
    <P>It is largely due to international conditions outside our control that Government action is necessary to ensure that farmers' incomes do not lag behind improvements in other sectors but, in the circumstances that exist, farmers had every right to expect their share of the increase in national income.  If they were not able to get it as speedily as others, it is unfair and it is not correct to say this extra <Col N="342" /> taxation was levied specially for the farmers.</P>
    <P>I have never said I am satisfied with the rates of social welfare payments in general and I do not think anybody else on either side of the House has said so.  However, our social welfare services are not as bad as Deputies make out.  It is not correct, as Deputy Tracey has said, to say they are the worst in Europe.  They are not.  They can stand comparison with those of many other countries.  The rates of insurance benefits compare favourably in lower paid employment in this country in the case of a man with a family, but in other cases there is scope for improvement.  I regard it as my function to bring about an improvement in the position of social welfare recipients generally relative to the cost of living.  It has been demonstrated time and time again that since this Government took office in 1957 this process of improving the position of social welfare recipients relative to the cost of living has been continuous.</P>
    <P>Since the imposition of the turnover tax, workers have obtained a 12 per cent increase in wages and, notwith-standing the fact that there have been some price increases, it is beyond all doubt that that increase represents a real improvement in incomes.  Taking into account the increases that are being given to social assistance recipients in the Budget, it can be shown that the position of practically every single recipient of social welfare payments has been improved by more than 12 per cent since imposition of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>In the case of non-contributory old age pensions, the increase has been from 32/6d. to 37/6d. which is an increase of 15.4 per cent.  In the case of the non-contributory widow with no children, the increase has been from 31/- to 36/-, which is an increase of 16.2 per cent.  In the case of a non-contributory widow with four children, taking children's allowances into account, the increase has been 12.8 per cent.  In the case of a man with an adult dependant drawing unemployment assistance, the increase has been from 42/6 to 52/6, or 23.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> There are no increases in insurance benefits in the Budget this year, but the increases granted last year were in every instance, except one, greater than the 12 per cent increase obtained by the workers.  With regard to unemployment benefits and disablement benefits, the increase for a single person is 13? per cent.  For the married man, the increase is 16 per cent.  For the married man with four children, taking children's allowances into account, the increase is 14 per cent.  The increase for a widow drawing a contributory widow's pension is 13? per cent.  The only case in which 12 per cent has not been reached is the case of the contributory old age pension where the increase works out at 11 per cent, which is marginally less than the increase obtained by workers, but still considerably greater than the increase in the cost of living.</P>

      <P>People who are drawing insurance benefits do not pay contributions. They are paid by workers who are not drawing benefits.  Unlike the agreement associated with the ninth round of wage increases, there is no stipulation in regard to the increases given to social welfare recipients that they should suffice for a period of two years.  The Government will be watching the progress of the national income with a view to continuing their policy of improving the social welfare services in accordance with increasing prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Labour Deputies in particular have been making great play with the fact that Exchequer expenditure on social welfare, expressed as a percentage of total tax revenue, has been dropping slowly.  That is true, but it is not of any particular significance.  The important thing is that the rates of social welfare services have been substantially increased in practically every year by this Government.  Obviously, if the number of unemployed had remained at the record high level it reached during the <Col N="344" /> Coalition period, then this percentage figure would be higher than it is.  I can see no reason why it should be the aim of Government policy to keep that particular statistic constant.  If the Coalition Government paid a bigger proportion of their total revenue on social services at the much lower rates that obtained at that time, it was obviously because more people had to depend on social welfare, due to the depressed state of the economy at that time.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the Government should fix the rates of benefit at a level the community can afford, and then the total amount paid, expressed as a percentage of total tax revenue, will be high or low, according to the number of people who have to avail of the different social welfare services. Our object should be to increase the level of payments and, at the same time, to reduce the percentage of the total revenue paid on social services by expanding the economy of the country, providing more employment for the people, and spending more of the revenue for productive purposes.  That is what we have been doing.</P>
    <P>If you take the gross amount spent on social welfare, that is, including the amount spent from the social insurance fund&mdash;as a percentage of total tax revenue, the figure has, in fact, remained practically constant over the years.  This means, of course, that although the number drawing unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit has declined&mdash;in spite of the fact that the means test for qualification for unemployment assistance has been considerably relaxed in the past few years&mdash;the increases given in the rates of benefit have had the effect of keeping the gross amount spent on social welfare constant as a proportion of total revenue.  The fact that now a greater proportion of social welfare recipients qualify for contributory benefits is an inevitable consequence of the expansion in the economy which followed on the change of Government in 1957, with the greater availability of work that now exists.</P>
    <P>In the number of people registered as drawing unemployment assistance, there is a hard core of over 10,000 <Col N="345" /> uneconomic farmers in whose case assistance payments are really income supplements of a permanent nature, rather than payments during periods of unemployment. The total number of unemployment assistance recipients has dropped by a greater percentage than in the case of unemployment benefit, and if you allow for the fact that there is this hard core of uneconomic smallholders in that total, then the percentage decrease in the case of unemployment assistance has been very much greater indeed than in the case of unemployment benefit. That shows that a greater proportion of the unemployment that exists now is of a transitory nature, that in general it does not last longer than the period of entitlement to unemployment benefit. In other words, people who lose their jobs now find it easier to get new jobs.</P>
    <P>One of the consequences of the fact that more people are now eligible for insurance benefits is that the proportion of total social welfare disbursements made out of actual tax revenue is somewhat less than during the Coalition period when a smaller number of people were able to keep their jobs long enough to fulfil the contribution conditions to qualify for unemployment benefit, and a greater number of people who lost their jobs were unable to get new ones before the 26 weeks period entitling them to unemployment benefit expired. Those two factors operate to reduce this percentage figure which Deputy Corish thinks should remain sacrosanct. First, there is the reduction in unemployment and secondly, there is the fact that more people now qualify for insurance benefits. Both of those factors arise from the improvement in the economy that has taken place since 1957.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous to suggest that there is some sinister move by the Government to have more of the total social welfare payments paid out of the social insurance fund.  All this money both on the assistance side, and the insurance side, is paid by the Department of Social Welfare, and it is all collected from the community under <Col N="346" /> compulsory arrangements made by the Government.  The only difference is that all the money paid on the assistance side is collected by way of general taxation, while, in regard to the insurance services, approximately only one-third is collected in that way. The remainder is collected by means of a levy of equal amount in respect of each worker on employers and employees.  It is a superficial view to say that because of these arrangements, employers and workers contribute two-thirds of the cost of the social insurance benefits because, of course, wage and price adjustments eventually spread the cost over the community as a whole, just as efficiently as the Minister for Finance could do it, so it is pointless to say that some of that expenditure is paid by the State, some by the worker and some by the employer.  The total amount paid out on social welfare, both assistance and insurance, is in fact paid by the consumer.  It represents a re-distribution by the Government of portion of the national income to those who have to depend on social welfare.</P>
    <P>It is true that under the Coalition Government more people had to depend on social assistance.  The fact that a greater number are now qualifying for the contributory schemes is a desirable trend which reflects an expanding economy.  While, then, it is true that the percentage of tax revenue as paid out in social welfare has dropped slightly it is also true that the provision for social welfare has been increased greatly by the Government. We have by no means reached the end of the road with regard to social welfare.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have been associated with some improvements both in the level of payments and in regard to the scope of the different social welfare services.  Just the same as other Deputies, I can see much more that remains to be done.  I admit that I should like to move faster than we have found it possible to do but I realise that we must develop our economy if we are to develop our social welfare services to what we would all consider a satisfactory state.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> I realise that it would be foolish to levy taxation for this purpose, desirable as it is, at a rate that would strangle economic expansion either by imposing excessive overheads on it or by withholding money that is necessary for productive investment.  I agree that the step forward is not as big a one as was taken last year or the year before but it is still impressive by Coalition Government standards and there are more Fianna Fáil Budgets to come and further improvements to be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the usual notes here which Deputies who speak on a Finance Bill always have and I want to keep what I say inside the compass of those notes but, before I do so, I want to refer as quietly as possible to the second last speech made in this House, by Deputy Dolan of Cavan. There are 144 points of view in this House about most things.  Even within the Parties, there is a variation of view-point. Exaggeration of the Party role is understandable.  A gloss on the Party achievement is understandable. A suppression of the Party's failure is understandable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dolan's reference to housing this morning was, I think, rather frightening.  It would be understandable only if it could be attributed to illiteracy or ignorance.  I must assume that in Deputy Dolan's case neither of these reasons can be attributed to the distortion that occurred in his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dolan invited comparison between the housing records of the present Government and what he called the Coalition Governments.  The figures, of course, are there for all of us.  The fact is that the Fianna Fáil Government have never equalled the inter-Party's achievements in housing. Now, the present Government may have been better than the Coalition Governments in other regards but in this particular one, they have not yet got near the figures achieved by the inter-Party Governments.  These figures are printed and are available for all of us to see.  I think that is why the case Deputy Dolan made is rather frightening.  After all, truth should be <Col N="348" /> a sacrosanct thing.  This shows a sort of frightening disregard for the truth. It would be far better if Deputy Dolan did not refer to this.</P>
    <P>Now, as quietly as possible, I shall come to the points I want to make about the Budget.  I want to begin by congratulating the Minister who, I understand, is being honoured today by the National University.  I want to be the first in this House to congratulate him.  Given the existing circumstances and the recent developments, it is very difficult to say what else the Minister could do other than what he did in this Budget.  The moneys must be got to carry on the work of the nation but certainly the camel's back does begin to sag in the middle.  In ten years we have exactly doubled the bill, that is, in terms of money but of course not in real terms because the unpleasant spectre of inflation has haunted those ten years.  We have money, but what kind of money and how much less is the Minister's £ compared with the £ of the Minister for Finance in 1954?  That is reflected in every page of the Budget Statement and in every page of the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Minister is properly worried about the dangers of inflation and I share his worry.  Indeed, counting chickens which return to roost is a depressing activity but the Minister was warned about the dangers of some of his proposals, particularly his proposal last year.  The action the Minister took last year was not in itself a cause of devaluation; It was not a cause of inflation.  In fact, in theory, it should have helped to cream off excess spending.  But what flowed from the turnover tax had the most serious consequences.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has switched on the green light once again.  Indeed, he spoke last week in the House as a prophet returning from the mountain would speak with the Tables of the Lord under his arm.  He blandly lectured the House, and those of us who had warned previously of the dangers that were before us, and he warned us again about those dangers.  He did say that it was not possible to make ourselves  <Col N="349" /> better off than we are.  Now, of course, that is only a three-quarter truth.  There is a time lag between increased incomes and increased prices and in that euphoric period, the pay is and was better&mdash;and that was the period in which the voters of Cork and Kildare reacted so favourably to the Government.  I do not think their hands would stretch out as eagerly now to the ballot box.  I think this Budget will reduce that operation to a very slow motion.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister and the Taoiseach know the real situation.  I would have much more respect for the Taoiseach if he did not pronounce the truth as some kind of a pearl of wisdom.  We said these things before the elections and the Taoiseach is saying them now.  He knew they were true when we said them, but a closed mouth catches gullible voters.</P>
    <P>We all know increased income is an illusion if production does not grow. This Budget sets out to take back what was given on the hustings.  All this inevitably followed the imposition of the turnover tax.  Its effect could not be limited to 2½ per cent, because it was a primer for income demands. How much less those income demands would have been without the turnover tax is an exercise in speculation in which we can all indulge.  Certainly, the demands would be much less than 12 per cent.  If the Government could unwind the clock now and get back to April, 1963, there would not be any turnover tax and we would all be better off.  The Minister would be better off.  This bill would be less and the £ would be a far healthier article. Of course, it is a profitable occupation to cry afterwards &ldquo;Spilt milk&rdquo;.  I wonder how the cynical and the knowledgeable will react to the Taoiseach's rather pious lecture last week&mdash;the lecture he was too shy to deliver before the elections?</P>
    <P>I do not have much criticism of the sources to which the Minister went for the moneys he required.  If we smoke and drink we pay.  These are traditional sources.  Really, we are taking back with the other hand, as I said before. But the increase in the cost of communication <Col N="350" /> is serious and could be very inhibitive to the progress of industry and of the economy.  It was always traditional that postal charges should be included with the other charges in the Budget proposals.  That was the way for 35 or 40 years.  I do not see the reason for the change, for a second Budget by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  It is a doubtful practice.  We want to get the whole bill together at Budget time.  I hope, regarding these postal and telegraphic charges, that the law of diminishing returns will not operate and that there will not be fewer letters, fewer phones and fewer parcels.  Of course, the telegram will become a museum exhibit.</P>
    <P>There can be no grumble at the assistance being given to agriculture in the Budget.  All townsmen should realise that the real basis of the prosperity of our towns is agriculture.  Our failure to realise that in the past has resulted in a great reduction of employment on the land.  That would seem to disprove the average ignorant, indeed hasty, urban opinion that the farmers are getting too much&mdash;that those who work the land are getting too much of the national cake.  If the living on the land was good, the people would stay on the land.  They have not stayed there.  Obviously, they are not getting a reasonable slice of the national cake.  Therefore, they leave the land.  This Budget is a belated recognition of the neglect of agriculture which has characterised Fianna Fáil policy for 30 years.</P>
    <P>The change is a very welcome one. All changes in Party point of view are welcome, because they show an evolvement, a growing up.  In the case of Fianna Fáil, the old shibboleths and prejudices are being discarded. They are being pushed into the cupboard with other Party skeletons.  I welcome it, although I believe in one regard&mdash;the reduction of tariffs&mdash;that the protection policy of Fianna Fáil has been pushed into reverse too rapidly.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us to what extent he has really got considered advice from the very influential and important officers of his <Col N="351" /> Department, from those engaged in industry and from the economists in the universities about what has been the experience abroad.  What happens when there is a grave and deep slashing of the protection wall?  It must, on the face of it, seem to result, even from the Minister's point of view as head of our financial system, in an increase in imports.  Surely the Minister is not without worry about the disimprovement in our balance of payments position?</P>
    <P>Apart from that, if we did feather-bed the manufacturers too well in the 30s, our very doing so had made them less hardy and resilient and less able to take the shock we are now trying to administer.  Like people hypnotised, we are walking towards this ten per cent every January.  That is too severe. The inevitability of it seems to be unnecessary. We had the Parliamentary Secretary yesterday saying that the lazy and incompetent manufacturers here required to get a jolt.  That kind of talk is too easy.  I hope the most exhaustive consideration has been given to the effect this will have on industry and industrial employment.</P>
    <P>I wonder, if there had been a change of Government and the Minister were sitting over here, how would the Fianna Fáil Front Bench react if Fine Gael were in office and raided the Road Fund?  I could imagine the cries of rage that would come from this side of the House.  It is being done at a time when, by State policy, we are putting a great deal more traffic on the roads.  Apart from the natural growth of mechanical transport, the closing down of the railways has diverted a great deal more traffic to the roads.  The Road Fund should be regarded as something which the Minister and his Department should keep hands off.  It would be interesting to imagine the kind of speech that would be made, had this decision been made by a Fine Gael Minister over there.</P>
    <P>Of course, that does not give us any opportunity of escaping responsibility for what has been done in the House. We all have to accept responsibility for that.  I had an unhappy experience of that driving from Kingsbridge <Col N="352" /> station to the Dáil last week before the Minister read his Budget speech. I told the taximan I wanted to be driven to Dáil Éireann.  He did not seem pleased at that.  He said: &ldquo;Why are you coming up from the country to the Dáil?  You are not doing any good for us.  We are paying through the nose for your activities in Leinster House.  I do not get any increased income but my wife and children have had to pay more for everything they bought in the past few months.  I do not know what kind of muddling you are doing in there.&rdquo; That was a taxpayer's point of view.  At that time he did not know about the increase in the cost of petrol.  I hoped to avoid him yesterday and I succeeded.</P>

    <P>I now come to a subject that politicians generally shy off.  The cost of the service of our debt is alarming. We must start wondering what will be the position in five or ten years time when we look at the present grants for the service of debt over the past two years.  If they are to continue in that direction, how are they to be borne? Has there been no examination of the kind of control we exercise, or might exercise, over the issue of credit? Nearly ten years ago, I said here that we might have to look over our credit structure and see if it could be more skilfully adapted to our needs.  We have an instrument that could be used, the Central Bank.  Surely the control of the volume of credit available should be closer to hand than it <Col N="353" /> is under the present haphazard system. Are excessive profits being taken by the commercial banks?  Is the control we exercise delicate enough for our needs because the regulation of this matter is a very vital factor?  It seems to me essential in any real planning for the future.  I do not want the Minister to go to extremes but I want some evidence of planning or consideration of how efficient this instrument is, or could be, if used by the Minister for Finance in the execution of his policy and whether we have made it as efficient as possible.  There is disquiet and uneasiness on this issue in many circles and any change which would be indicated by examination of the present credit structure should be faced courageously.  There are many things we must do and many problems we must face and we should not be dependent on conditions of easy money, for instance, obtaining because money should always be easy for the investment needed to promote growth in our society.</P>
    <P>My thinking is probably pretty close to that of Deputy Costello on this point and the grave uncertainties we all have about the problems of the future indicate that this examination should be undertaken now.  I remember what happened to money in my lifetime.  Inflation has always been regarded as a dirty word and I, personally, regard devaluation as a dirtier word.  Planned control is very important and we should start talking and thinking about it.  In one regard, the Government were able to say to a most important production unit in the country they thought they were charging too much and were able to get an adjustment of the price by the Sugar Company.  The Sugar Company, being a monopoly, is easy to deal with but I think something of the same sort should operate in regard to the price of money and its availability.  We do not want this to be an umbrella that we can borrow only when the sun is shining.</P>
    <P>Last night the Parliamentary Secretary said that many industrialists needed a jolt.  Do our bankers need a jolt?  Would the Minister think of doing something in this regard?  In the <Col N="354" /><i>First Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> the Government said they would strive to reduce the effective burden of taxation by curtailing the growth in the national debt service charges by achieving maximum efficiency in administration.  Were these mere words?  Has there been any practice? What steps have been taken, or are contemplated, to increase efficiency? The criterion has been laid down that taxation which is more than 25 per cent of national income is dangerous. Have we passed that limit?  There seems to be disputation about it.  Last week the Taoiseach claimed we had not but I think the Taoiseach was relating his percentages to gross national product rather than national income.  Most people will agree that if the demands of taxation do exceed 25 per cent, it would be bad.  I think they have exceeded it.  That will inhibit our growth in the future.</P>
    <P>Listening to the debate, it was impossible not to be aware that figures are very dangerous things.  It is impossible to use money as a measure because of its changing value but there are other indices.  The trade gap continues to widen and the removal of tariffs should lead to the further widening of the gap.  The employment returns show a very stubborn reluctance to climb or even remain steady. There are possibly as many jobs fewer in Ireland now as the Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, when in Opposition, promised there would be more, when he blue-printed our future in Clery's Restaurant.  Emigration has not been exactly headed off as recent figures show.  All these disturbing trends tend to be disquieting.  We live in a kind of dreamland euphoria from which we may have a rude awakening.</P>
    <P>One of the drawbacks in regard to the Minister's appeal for saving is that it is very hard to expect people to save money for long periods because even if it earns interest, it hardly catches up with the devaluing process.  There is no encouragement to save.  I would prefer to be wrong about this and I am sure the Government would prefer that also, but intelligent men on both sides know how dangerous some of the symptoms are and how the cost of <Col N="355" /> living figures are.  We know there are fewer at work than there were ten years ago and we know there is much less than 20/- in every £1.  The gravamen of the charge that can be made against the Government is that in real terms money has been weakened; but that it has been weakened excessively is the most serious charge we can make against the Government.  We have been uneven in our distribution of benefits.  Deputy Dockrell this morning made an allegory of the ship of state which struck me as being good.  Our ship caters very well for the first-class passengers but the steerage passengers are not quite so well off. My view of recent developments is that a great many people have been left on the quayside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The country has been having a great time and the people have been encouraged by the statements of members of the Government to believe there is no end to the prosperity of the State and no bottom to the national pocket, and that the very best thing they could do was to go on spending money as fast as they could. It was in that spirit that the Taoiseach approached the electorate in my constituency in Cork city and also in Kildare before the last by-elections.  He was jubilant, full of confidence and bounce and he never expressed any of the fears which the Minister for Finance expressed last Tuesday week. It was the old story which had been told across the Channel: &ldquo;You never had it so good.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>All this was done deliberately by the Government to give the people the impression that all that the Government were doing was successful.  Up to last Tuesday week, anybody who advocated not spending money was described as a conservative, a fuddy-duddy or some such person.  When the turnover tax was first mooted in this House, we suggested that there would be a day of reckoning, that something was bound to happen as a result of it and that the prospect was not good, but the Government continued on the <i>motif:</i>&ldquo;You never had it so good; spend as freely as you like.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one very serious offshoot <Col N="356" /> of that attitude of the Government, that is, that consumer resistance was reduced to nil.  People never questioned the amazing price increases which took place in respect of the various commodities and essential services because they seemed to feel they had the money to meet them.  Of course before the two by-elections, which evidently the Government take as an <i>imprimature</i> on their entire policy, the encouragement to spend was still there.  It was the boast of the Fianna Fáil Party during these by-elections that there never had been such a Christmas as last Christmas, that there had never been so much money in circulation and that shopkeepers never did so well.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not just encourage people to spend.  When he made his pre-by-election television appearance, he implied very plainly that more or less by an act of grace of the Fianna Fáil Party, the worker had been given a 12 per cent increase in his earnings and that of course this would mean extra purchasing power for the worker. For the first time, the note of warning is now sounded by the Minister for Finance who warned the workers not to spend the increase on personal consumption goods.  If that warning had been sounded by the Taoiseach from the television screens to the electorate of Cork city and Kildare and if he had said: &ldquo;You got your increase but you are not to use it; you must save it; you must not spend it as you would like,&rdquo; he would never have got the endorsement he did get in the two by-elections.  If he had pointed out that not alone could they not use it as they wanted to but that in real terms of purchasing power they would have nothing at all, I am quite sure the policy of the Government would not have been endorsed.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to blame the people themselves.  I blame them because they are completely apathetic towards political and economic matters and they have blunted their own critical faculties over such matters.  Many of them are much better equipped to discuss the merits of a performance by the Beatles than the merits of a performance by the Taoiseach.  My own view about these performances is that there <Col N="357" /> is an amount of virtuosity about both which entirely gives them a much higher grading than either of them deserve.  We are in the position that the Government have remained in office as a result of deliberate misrepresentation to the people that the 12 per cent they were getting could be used by them in any way they liked and that it would be an actual increase. It is good to see even at this stage that instead of the &ldquo;Daddy Christmas&rdquo; Taoiseach we saw on the television before the by-elections we have the sober Minister for Finance warning that there are risks involved. At column 1536, of volume 208, No. 10, of the Official Report, he says:</P>
    <P>At the same time, it cannot be overlooked that, as the increased incomes are being paid in advance of the expected increase in output, there are risks involved for the economy.  A steep rise in productivity is needed to offset the higher wages and salaries and keep costs in industry and services from rising significantly.  If industrial costs are pushed up so as to render our goods or services less competitive with those of other countries, this will hamper the expansion of our sales abroad and our tourist industry. Since the growth of the economy depends mainly on increased exports the continued expansion of production and employment could in consequence be endangered.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to think that that was the first time that was said in this House.  It was said from this side of the House 12 months ago when the Minister's proposals outlining the turnover tax were announced.  Surely it is a bit late in the day to talk about keeping costs in industry and services from rising, as the Minister suggested in his Budget speech?  They have already risen.  There is very little that can be done about it now, unless there is some positive movement by the Government in that regard, mainly for the reason I have already given, that consumer resistance to increased prices has been completely destroyed by the Government who encouraged people to spend as they wished, without sounding any word of warning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> In so far as the Budget is meant to be a brake on the spending power of the alleged benefits given to the workers through the 12 per cent increase it is an unnecessary exercise. Even those who received the 12 per cent&mdash;and the Minister seems to forget that many have not received it&mdash;find that they have no more purchasing power than they had in the past.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the Minister's speech which interested me enormously.  It is contained in the same volume from which I have quoted.  At column 1536 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>There are grounds for hoping that an even higher growth rate than the 4 per cent of 1963 may be achieved this year.  The buoyancy of the economies of Britain, America and Western Europe should help us to expand our exports and thus to maintain the momentum gained in the second half of 1963.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to me to find that the Minister does not appear to think our exports to the Iron Curtain countries over the next 12 months are going to grow as the Minister evidently hoped. I have been a consistent critic of the Government's policy in allowing imports from the Iron Curtain countries, which gave rise to happenings such as the importation of a hundredweight of religious objects from Czechoslovakia.  If we have to have that trade, at least we should have some reciprocal trade.  The Minister, apparently, does not foresee any big improvement in the position of exports to the Iron Curtain countries and I should like to ask him will the Government use the powers given to them in the Restriction of Imports Act, 1962, if we do not get reciprocal trade from the Iron Curtain countries.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies are, naturally, horrified at the increased demands made upon the people in this Budget.  For myself, I feel that one of the difficulties in dealing with Estimates generally is that those who devise and actually carry out the estimation are never inclined to look upon expenditure in terms of real cash.  At local government level those who prepare the estimates never talk in terms of spending <Col N="359" /> so many thousand pounds.  They talk in terms of spending 1d. in the £, which sounds much better.  I imagine that in the Department of Finance they never talk in terms of spending, say, £½ million but, rather, in terms of spending a half-penny on the pint or on the packet of cigarettes, or something like that.</P>
    <P>It is a very unreal approach but I do know that it is, definitely, the approach in local government and I strongly suspect that the same sort of approach is made in Government Departments. It is a sort of occupational disease that one cannot escape regarding expenditure in terms of so much in the £ or 1d or some pence or some commodity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dolan, earlier, was talking about the question of housing in Cork city during the inter-Party Government régime and my colleague, Deputy Barry, took him up.  He did not accuse him of telling an untruth but he did say that, obviously, Deputy Dolan had not the facts at his disposal. Speaking for my own constituency, I can assure the House and the country that during the last three years of the inter-Party Government régime more houses were built than in the three years before that when Fianna Fáil were in power or during the three years after that when Fianna Fáil were in power.  In 1956, the second year of the inter-Party Government régime, there were 491 houses built in Cork, which is an alltime record, especially when it is considered that since Fianna Fáil returned to power, in 1957, we have never built more than 300 houses.</P>
    <P>I do not mind criticism of this Party or of the Opposition but the criticism should be based on facts.  If Deputy Dolan wishes to criticise us he should criticise us on a factual and truthful basis.</P>
    <P>I want to add my voice to that of Deputy J. A. Costello who spoke about expenditure on roads.  I almost forbore to do so because I have been speaking on this subject year after year since I came into this House. There has never been a year since I <Col N="360" /> came into this House, over 10 years ago, that I have not found tens of thousands of pounds being obviously wasted on the main road from Cork to Dublin.  I mention the main road from Cork to Dublin simply because I am more familiar with it than I am with other roads but the same story is to be told about other roads.  I have no objection to roads being improved but when I find immense schemes being carried out on which vast amounts of money are being spent I begin to feel that had one-quarter or one-eighth of the money now being spent on the roads been spent on CIE to keep the branchlines going, we would have a much better communications system at the moment.  The roads, obviously, are being changed and built to take traffic they were never intended to take, traffic that could be carried by rail.  I noticed work being carried out on the road when I was coming to the House yesterday.  There is no need to carry out improvements of roads to the extent that they are being carried out at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that three Cork Deputies on this side of the House had to follow one another.  I avail of this opportunity to say in relation to the present financial position of the country that the Government seem to accept the verdict of the two by-elections as a clear mandate to them to embark on every and any kind of financial folly.  It would be well for them to remember that the by-elections were held at a time that could be described as a consumer's honeymoon but that since the by-elections divorce proceedings are now actively separating the consumers from the honeymoon indulged in at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will recall that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who spearheaded the publicity for the Government in the Cork city by-election, kept a little item completely under his own hat until the people had voted, that was, the fact that in consequence of rising costs the price of bread would go up.  That was followed some weeks later by an increase in the <Col N="361" /> price of flour.  These are essential commodities which cannot be done without. These facts were withheld from the people at that time.</P>
    <P>I remember being in the working class regions of Cork city and meeting an occasional housewife who had given consideration to the conditions that then existed.  One housewife said to me: &ldquo;You can talk to me but you cannot talk to my husband.  He is below in the pub spending the back pay he got of the 12 per cent pay increase but he will have another story in a month or two when under the system of PAYE the revenue will have recovered so much of that 12 per cent, when I will have to pay the shop next door increased prices for all the necessaries of life and when, quite possibly, the little luxuries that he indulges in will also go up in price.&rdquo; The point was also raised that in relation to differential rents the Corporation in Cork city would recover a substantial proportion of the 12 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>That 12 per cent increase, as Labour Deputies have vouched for, was occasioned by the introduction of a system of taxation on the necessaries of life that was never deemed to be suitable for the economy of this country.  When the matter was considered by a commission it was rejected except as an alternative to the present income tax system.  It was introduced and made operative last November and subsequently there occurred a spiralling of living costs that required the Government to accede to demands for wage and salary increases.  The Government had already the lesson of the reduction and subsequent elimination of food subsidies and of having to compensate the sections in our community who were in a position to require them to do so, in order to abate the consequences of increased living costs.</P>
    <P>For quite a time, when it suited the aims of the Government, the Taoiseach and members of his Government claimed to be the sole architects of this increase of 12 per cent.  We recall an incident where a Deputy of this Party, in his capacity on polling day in Kildare, was approached on his <Col N="362" /> way to the polling booth by a canvasser for the Government candidate who announced to him: &ldquo;Do not forget today that you got 12 per cent, and vote for it.&rdquo; There was a leading article in the <i>Irish Press</i> after this Budget seeking to dissociate the Taoiseach and the Government from any implication in the fixing of this figure of 12 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move :</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £9,608,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1965, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and of certain other Services administered by that Office, and for payment of Grants in Aid.</P>
      <P>The net Estimate of £15,058,000 for my Department is shown in the Estimates volume as approximately £1,548,000 greater than last year's. Allowance should be made, however, for the Supplementary Estimate of £330,000 which was voted in February last, so that the actual increase is about £1,218,000.  Of that amount, £78,000 is in respect of grants-in-aid payable to Radio Éireann from, in effect, broadcasting licence fees and, accordingly, the net increase for the services directly provided by my Department is £1,140,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the increase is due to the continuing expansion of the telephone service and in respect of increased expenditure on engineering staff, stores and contracts works and on additional operating staff, and I will refer to <Col N="363" /> these matters in more detail when dealing with the individual subheads.</P>
    <P>Before taking the individual subheads, I should like to mention two points.  The first is that this Estimate contains no provision for the general civil service pay increase of 12 per cent granted as from the 1st February this year.  I understand that the Minister for Finance will introduce a global Vote to cover the expenditure falling on all Departments.  Neither does this Estimate include provision for any increases that may be granted to staff in my Department as a result of the many status and similar claims which have been put forward.</P>
    <P>The second is that, as Deputies will probably have already learned from the introductory notes to the Estimates volume, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will charge other Departments for services formerly rendered free and will pay other Departments for the services it formerly received free.</P>
    <P>These arrangements will not involve any additional charge on the Exchequer, and their purpose is to assist the Department to operate on more commercial lines, in keeping with the concept that it is a trading concern paying its way over the sum of its activities.  The matter was discussed at some length on last year's Estimate.  A more complete picture of the Department's operation, covering State and outside business alike, will now emerge in the Estimate.  Appropriation Account and Finance Account figures and a much smaller range of adjustments will be required to convert these figures into the trading picture provided in our Commercial Accounts.</P>
    <P>As regards the Estimate before us, the various receipts expected have been included in the Appropriations-in-Aid, where appropriate, and payments to be made by my Department to others have likewise been included in the appropriate subheads.  Payments in respect of the public services of the Department&mdash;postal, telegraph, and telephone&mdash;will, like other revenue from these services, be paid into the Exchequer as tax revenue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" /> Returning to the Estimate, the subheads with substantial variations are:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">SALARIES, WAGES AND ALLOWANCES</P>
    <P>The increase over 1963-64, including £66,000 in the Supplementary Estimate, is £312,000.  It is mainly for additional staff required for the expansion of the telephone service&mdash;technical staff for construction and maintenance work and telephonist staff for dealing with the growing volume of traffic. There is also provision for additional staff on the postal side, mainly because of the growth of delivery work in Dublin.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ACCOMODATION AND BUILDING CHARGES</P>
    <P>The increase over 1963-64, after allowing for a saving of some £26,000 in the Supplementary Estimate, is £756,000.  Of this, £532,000 represents new payments to other Departments in respect of services formerly rendered free; mainly £67,000 to the Valuation Office in recoupment of contributions paid to local authorities in lieu of rates on property occupied by the Department, and £463,000 to the Office of Public Works for the construction, maintenance and heating of buildings. There is an increase of £140,000 for telephone capital buildings, which have always been paid for.  There is also an increase of £53,000 in respect of additional rentings of international telecommunication circuits, which bring us not only improved services but also a larger share of the foreign traffic revenue.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONVEYANCE OF MAILS</P>
    <P>The increase of £27,000 over 1963-64, shown in the Estimates volume, represents, in fact, a reduction of £69,000 when the additional provision in the Supplementary Estimate last year is taken into account.  An additional £96,000 was provided mainly to cover payment of accounts originally expected to fall due in 1964-65, and a reduction in the provision for this year has ensued.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="365" /> POSTAL AND GENERAL STORES</P>
    <P>The increase over 1963-64, including £34,200 in the Supplementary Estimate, is £140,800.  Again the difference is mainly due to providing for cash payments to other Government Departments&mdash;£29,000 to the Revenue Commissioners for the production of stamps, <i>et cetera</i> and £86,000 to the Stationery Office for paper, printing and office requisites in general&mdash;for services which formerly involved no charge to this Vote.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ENGINEERING STORES AND EQUIPMENT</P>
    <P>The increase over 1963-64, including £109,000 in the Supplementary Estimate, is £1,545,000.  The major portion of the increase, about £1,300,000, is to meet the requirements of the greatly expanded Telephone Capital Development programme, both for the direct purchase of stores and for payments to contractors.  About £250,000 of the increase is to provide for additional maintenance work, which of course has to keep pace with the growth of the telephone system.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TELEPHONE CAPITAL REPAYMENTS</P>
    <P>Continuing heavy investment in telephone development is responsible for the increase of £318,000 in the annuities for the repayment of the capital advanced.</P>
    <P Just="Center">GRANT EQUIVALENT TO NET RECEIPTS FROM BROADCASTING LICENCE FEES&mdash;GRANT-IN-AID</P>
    <P>An amount equivalent to the net broadcasting licence fee revenue from television and sound licences is transferred to Radio Éireann by this grant-in-aid, which shows an increase over 1963-64 of £150,000, after allowing for £235,000 in the Supplementary Estimate. It is expected that revenue will be buoyant to that extent.</P>
    <P Just="Center">APPROPRIATIONS IN AID</P>
    <P>The increase over 1963-64, allowing for the additional £200,000 odd provided <Col N="366" /> in the Supplementary Estimate, is approximately £1,900,000.  Recovery from Telephone Capital funds in respect of the enlarged telephone development programme is responsible for £1,385,000 of this increase.  Overall receipts from other Government Departments are expected to go up by £513,000, mainly as a result of the new accounting arrangement whereby Departments will pay for services formerly rendered free.</P>
    <P Just="Center">POSTAL SERVICE</P>
    <P>During 1963, there was an upward trend in postal traffic.  The volume handled at Christmas was the highest recorded.  In the foreign post, first class mail for Europe was up by 10 per cent and second class mail to extra European destinations rose by 16 per cent., outgoing air parcels increased by 25 per cent. and surface parcels by 12 per cent. over last year.</P>
    <P>In August the weight limit for parcels accepted for delivery in Ireland and Great Britain was increased from 15 lb. to 22 lb.  This new facility has been availed of extensively by business firms and the public generally.</P>
    <P>During the Christmas period, containers were used for the carriage of parcel mails by arrangement between my Department and the British Post Office on the one hand, and CIE and British Railways on the other.  Motor transport is being used to an increasing extent for the conveyance and delivery of mails where the conditions are favourable.  One of the main difficulties in extending its use for delivery purposes is, of course, the number of off-the-road houses.  Motor scooters are being introduced experimentally on certain posts.</P>
    <P>The use of Dublin postal district numbers continues to grow.  Sixty-six per cent of mail originating in Dublin for delivery there now bears a district number and the overall figure for local, domestic and foreign mail delivered in Dublin is 61 per cent. Recently new posting boxes have been installed at the GPO and at St. Andrew Street in Dublin.  Each box has two apertures, one for &ldquo;Dublin <Col N="367" /> only&rdquo; and the other for &ldquo;All other places&rdquo;.  Similar boxes will be provided in other parts of the central city area.  In conjuction with this firms using meter post were asked to make similar divisions of their correspondence. The response to this appeal has been far in excess of my Department's expectations and has very much eased the sorting problem during the evening pressure period.  I am glad to pay tribute to the public generally, and to users of the meter post in particular, for their co-operation in these measures which are designed to expedite the postal service.</P>
    <P>A special &ldquo;Europa&rdquo; stamp was issued in September, 1963, simultaneously with other member countries of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunication Administrations.  A stamp to commemorate the centenary of the founding of the International Red Cross was issued in December, 1963. This was the first Irish stamp to be printed in more than one colour and was also the first stamp to be produced by the photogravure process.  In addition to the Wolfe Tone commemoratives recently placed on sale there will be a special issue to mark Ireland's participation in the New York World's Fair and there will be a &ldquo;Europa&rdquo; issue next September.</P>
    <P>In October last I appointed the stamp Design Advisory Committee to advise me in regard to new designs for our permanent series of stamps and for such special stamps as may be issued from time to time.  The Committee invited suggestions in the public press shortly afterwards for designs and themes but the selection of a suitable theme or themes is obviously one of the most difficult tasks facing the Committee.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TELEGRAPH AND TELEX SERVICES</P>
    <P>The decline in telegraph traffic continued during last year, the number of telegrams handled falling by about 100,000 to 1,573,000.  The decrease can be accounted for by the fall of about <Col N="368" /> 20 per cent in the number of incoming telegrams from Great Britain and the Six Counties.  Foreign telegraph traffic again increased and offset the reduction in our internal traffic and outward telegrams to Great Britain and the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>During the year it was necessary to increase the charges for telegrams to a number of European countries by amounts ranging from ½d. to 5d. per word in order to offset the higher payments we now have to make to the British Post Office for transit under the International Telegraph Regulations. The rates for telegrams to six countries, including France and Germany, were not affected by the revision.</P>
    <P>During the year the Gentex service was introduced for telegrams to and from Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg.  This service is based on direct connection between the country of origin and the country of destination, thus eliminating intermediate handling and speeding up transmission.  It is hoped to extend the arrangement to other countries in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Telex service is continuing to prove more popular.  Although internal telex calls declined slightly during the year, calls to Great Britain increased by 20 per cent and foreign calls by 29 per cent.</P>
    <P>Telex calls can now be made from Ireland to 74 other countries.  There are 200 subscribers' installations as compared with 189 last year and further applications for service have to be put on a waiting list, pending the introduction of automatic working.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the automatic telex equipment has now been installed and that testing has commenced.  This is necessarily a lengthy process as the equipment is complex but the testing should be completed within the next few months.  Special arrangements have been made to provide service for the bulk of waiting applicants shortly after automatic working is introduced.</P>
    <P>The only telex exchange is in Dublin and the rentals payable by subscribers depend on the distance from the exchange. With a view to making the <Col N="369" /> service more attractive to provincial firms it has been decided to reduce the mileage charges payable by subscribers whose premises are situated more than ten miles from the exchange. The new excess mileage charges will be 30/- per mile for the portion of the circuit between 10 and 55 miles and £1 per mile thereafter.  These rates represent a reduction of 10/- per mile for distances up to 200 miles.  As a result the annual rental payable, for example, by a subscriber in Galway city will be reduced from £340 to £287 and that of a Cork subscriber from £382 to £313.  These reduced rates will be introduced when we change over to automatic working.</P>
    <P>Telex calls made by our subscribers are at present charged for in accordance with the internationally accepted method of a minimum for three minutes and <i>pro rata</i> per minute thereafter. When the new system is in operation subscribers who obtain calls automatically will purchase time in 2d. units, the amount of time varying with the distance over which the call is made.  Thus it will be possible to make short calls to European countries at much lower cost than at present.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TELEPHONE SERVICE</P>
    <P>In 1963 the number of effective calls handled was 179 million, an increase of 12 million over the previous year.  Some 1,150 new trunk circuits were established, the majority by means of cables, with a total route mileage of 40,000 miles.</P>
    <P>The most important new cabling schemes that were completed or advanced during the year were those connecting Waterford to Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir, Carlow to Portlaoise and Athy, Tralee to Killarney and Listowel, Clonmel to Cahir and Fethard, and Limerick to Rathkeale.</P>
    <P>Further additions to the trunk network were provided by means of radio links, including routes brought into service between Dublin and Arklow, Waterford and Wexford, Waterford and Enniscorthy, Wexford and Enniscorthy, and Limerick and Tralee.  A link connecting Athlone to Limerick and Tralee is expected to be <Col N="370" /> in full service before the summer and work is also nearing completion on radio links between Dublin and Wicklow and between Wicklow and Arklow.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the question of improved circuiting, I should mention that during the year the number of cross-Channel circuits was increased by almost 30 per cent and the number of transatlantic circuits was increased from two to four.</P>
    <P>Exchange development included the installation of additional equipment at 188 Exchanges and the opening of 22 new automatic exchanges.  Since the year ended a further 20 automatic exchanges have been opened.</P>
    <P>Subscriber trunk dialling was introduced in 30 additional areas.  Nearly all the automatic exchanges in the country have this facility which is now available to over 70 per cent of all subscribers.</P>
    <P>While the main emphasis during the year, and particularly in the second half of it, was on the provision of trunk circuits, it was found possible to connect some 14,350 subscribers and to make progress on laying local underground cables for subscribers circuits in preparation for the general clearance of waiting applicants.</P>
    <P>I have been asked whether I could indicate, in respect of each exchange area, when trunking and similar work will be sufficiently advanced to enable new telephones to be connected on demand.  I have carefully considered this request but I am afraid that I cannot undertake to comply with it for the present.  Engineering staffing is arranged on a basis of large districts and the limited force available in each district has to be assigned to the most urgent work awaiting its attention. As I have just said, the first priority is the provision of trunk circuits. In a district where there are trunking arrears all other work in the district, including the connection of new subscribers, must take second place.  Consequently, even though there may be no special equipment difficulty in a particular exchange area, waiting applications there may have to be <Col N="371" /> deferred simply because the staff required to attend to them is fully engaged elsewhere.  Similarly, applications in one area may have to be put back pending clearance of older or more urgent applications in another area catered for by the same constructions staff.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Telephone Capital Bill on 5th December, 1963, and the debate on the Supplementary Estimate on 27th February last I dealt at length with the position of the telephone service and the difficulties that face us.  I do not think that Deputies will wish me to go over the whole ground again.  I may say, however, that extra trunk circuits have been provided or will come into service before summer which will greatly improve conditions on the routes concerned. On some other routes the equipment required to give relief is not yet available and the service will, unavoidably, be below a desirable standard. I have explained before on a number of occasions that it often takes some years from the date of ordering telecommunications equipment to the time it is in service.  For that reason and because of the extent of the works programme to be carried through, it is not, unfortunately, possible to effect a quick, spectacular improvement of the whole system.  Everything possible is being done to hasten delivery and installation of the equipment needed and special measures have been taken to ensure that there will be an ample number of telephonist staff.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of telephones, I should make some reference to communication satellites.  The successful experiments in this field have demonstrated to everyone that this new technique is a thoroughly practical one.</P>
    <P>The United States has already declared that it intends to establish, in conjunction and in co-operation with other countries, a commercial satellite system as part of an improved global communications network.  The major part of our inter-continental telephone traffic is to North America; it is increasing at the rate of 15 per cent per annum and we will need more circuits <Col N="372" /> shortly.  It is clear that any extra transatlantic circuits which are required between now and 1970 will be provided by a satellite system rather than by submarine cable.  Our practical interest in the matter is therefore obvious.</P>
    <P>Interested countries on this side of the Atlantic, including ourselves, have joined together in a European Conference on Satellite Communications for the purpose of discussing proposals with the United States and Canada. Agreement has been reached on a number of points and a further meeting between experts from both sides has been arranged for the near future. If full agreement can be reached the various European administrations propose to contribute capital to the system broadly on the basis of national shares of intercontinental traffic.  My Department's investment would come from Telephone Capital Funds but it is not yet clear whether or not amending legislation would be necessary.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SAVING SERVICES</P>
    <P>During 1963 deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank amounted to £22 millions, and withdrawals to £19.7 millions, being in both cases slightly more than the previous year. The total balance, including interest, due to depositors had been £97.2 millions at the 31st December, 1962, and at the end of 1963 it was £101.9 millions.  So, for the first time, this figure has exceeded £100 millions &mdash;a notable landmark in the history of the Savings Bank, and an encouraging sign of the ever-growing service it provides.</P>
    <P>In the Trustee Savings Banks, deposits and withdrawals during 1963 were approximately £1.4 millions and £0.5 million, respectively, both being slightly down on the 1962 figures. However, the total amount, including interest, standing to the credit of the Trustee Banks at 31st December, 1963, was £18.1 millions, an increase of £0.7 million on the previous year's figure.</P>
    <P>Sales of Savings Certificates during 1963 amounted to £4.5 millions, and repayments, including interest, to £2.4 millions.  At 31st December, 1963, the <Col N="373" /> value of principal remaining invested was £30.2 millions, an increase of £2.1 millions during the year, compared with an increase of £1.4 millions during 1962.</P>
    <P>Post offices throughout the country continue to cooperate in the issue of Prize Bonds, and have been responsible for collecting over £10 millions out of the total of £32 millions worth of Prize Bonds issued up to this year.</P>
    <P>The Savings Committee is at present more active than ever in its encouragement of the national savings movement, which is so important to our general financial stability, and I am sure that all Deputies will wish to join with me in thanking its members most warmly and sincerely for their valuable work.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REMITTANCE AND AGENCY SERVICES</P>
    <P>There is a continuing growth in the volume of funds handled by the Department's remittance services.  The total value of money orders and postal orders issued during 1963 was £24.7 millions, an increase of £0.9 million over 1962.</P>
    <P>Social Welfare and other agency payments during 1963 totalled £34 millions, an increase of about £3 millions on the preceding year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">BUILDINGS</P>
    <P>During 1963 improvements were carried out in the post offices at An Uaimh, Limerick and Mullingar and nine automatic telephone exchange buildings were erected.  The new post office at Wicklow has been in use since early this year and a new district sorting office at Finglas has been completed. The new post offices at Ballinasloe and Youghal should be ready later in the year and it is hoped to finish the building work on a new trunk telephone exchange in Dublin. Work is also in progress on improvements to Arklow and Ennis post offices, on a district sorting office to serve the Coolock-Raheny area and on five new automatic exchange buildings.</P>
    <P>As regards the new Central Sorting Office for Dublin, work is progressing <Col N="374" /> satisfactorily under the main building contract.</P>
    <P Just="Center">STAFF</P>
    <P>The Estimate provides for a total staff of 18,098, an increase of 652 on last year's figure.  The increase consists almost entirely of additional engineering workmen required for the present telephone development programme and telephone operating staff to handle the higher volume of traffic offering.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Telephone Capital Bill last December, I outlined some of the steps that were being taken to build up the necessary staff to cope with the expanded rate of development. The intake of technician trainees, which is the main avenue of recruitment for the skilled staff, is being doubled this year.</P>
    <P>At the scientific exhibition organised by the Royal Dublin Society last year, the Department displayed to the public various interesting facets of the telecommunications system such as automatic switching, microwave links, submarine cable repeaters, voice frequency telegraphs, teleprinters and fault location. The limited space available to us for a stand was found to be much too small for the numbers who tried to inspect the exhibits and I hope that the avid interest shown by members of the younger generation is a hopeful sign for future recruitment.</P>
    <P>As was announced recently, I have set up a Commission to inquire into and report on various aspects of the sub-post office system.</P>
    <P>The Department is constantly searching for improvements in organisation and Working methods in order to increase efficiency and reduce costs.  Telephone accounts are now being produced by an automatic data processing system based on the use of an electronic computer.</P>
    <P>The new system will yield savings which, while initially relatively small, will grow as the number of subscribers increases.  The possibilities of utilising similar systems for other large blocks of work in the Department are being explored.</P>
    <P>In thanking the staff for the work of the past year, I must make reference <Col N="375" /> to the special telegraph and telephone facilities which were provided for the visit of the late President Kennedy.  An extensive network of temporary communications had to be set up and a heavy burden fell on the engineering and operating staffs which they discharged with great efficiency. I am pleased to say that the facilities provided earned very favourable comment from the United States Authorities, from pressmen and from broadcasting organisations.</P>
    <P Just="Center">FINANCIAL POSITION.</P>
    <P>A summary of the commercial account results is given in Appendix D of the Estimate.  In 1962-3 there was a surplus of slightly under £50,000.  If circumstances had remained unchanged we might have expected growth of traffic to produce somewhat higher surpluses for 1963-4 and for the current year, though still extremely modest when viewed in relation to our expenditure of over £13 millions.</P>
    <P>The general Civil Service increase in pay, and the status and other claims by Post Office grades have, however, completely altered the position.</P>
    <P>I may say that a number of Post Office grades felt that they had fallen behind in pay standards by reference to current rates outside and that the Staff Side put forward a wide range of claims affecting almost all Departmental grades.  These claims have been under consideration at the Departmental Conciliation Council.  A major one-that on behalf of Post Office clerks&mdash;has been dealt with by the Arbitration Board which awarded a very substantial increase on the basis, I must assume of comparison with outside clerical employment.  Another major claim, put forward on behalf of subpostmasters, has been settled through conciliation machinery.  I consider it just and fair that settlements arrived at through conciliation and arbitration machinery should be implemented in full.  The Government are of the same view.  And I do not think that there is any Deputy who will dissent from the proposition that Post <Col N="376" /> Office employees should receive a reasonable return for their services.</P>
    <P>As many of these claims have not yet been finally resolved it is not possible to make an exact estimate of the ultimate cost.  But, in round figures, it can be taken that the net effect of the improved pay for staff and some other unavoidable increases will be a disimprovement in the Department's financial position of some £2½ million a year.</P>
    <P>My Department is extremely cost-conscious in regard to the services it provides and has always been energetic in a continuous search for greater efficiency, a process which has been intensified during the past fifteen years by the employment of a separate organisation and methods staff and by the engagement of outside consultants in appropriate cases.  Over the years very substantial improvements have been effected.  But it is quite certain that the amount now in question cannot be found by improved efficiency, by economies in the services or from increased business.</P>
    <P>It has been the settled policy of all Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs that the Post Office should pay its way on a commercial basis.  A departure from this policy is certainly not warranted now, and charges for Post Office services must, therefore, be increased substantially.</P>
    <P>Faced with the need to raise well over £2 million in excess of the revenue figure shown in the Book of Estimates, I have to look to the basic items of the letter post and the local telephone call.  But, in considering what alterations in rates should be made, all parts of the Post Office services have been examined carefully by reference to volume of traffic, their cost to the Department and their value to the public. Indeed I have not hesitated to propose an actual reduction in charges where I was satisfied that circumstances justified that step.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the reductions in telex rentals and call charges which I shall introduce when that service becomes automatic.  And in regard to one particular item on the postal side&mdash;printed paper, commercial <Col N="377" /> paper, samples and small packets sent abroad by surcharged air mail&mdash;the rate for extra weight above the first step will be 6d. for each full ounce instead of 6d. for each half ounce.  As the rate for the first ounce is being increased by 1d. only, this means that every packet in this category exceeding 1½ ounces will be cheaper than before. This concession, in so far as it covers small packets, should be of assistance in some areas of our export trade.</P>
    <P>The list of changes in rates which I propose to make has already been published but there are more general observations I wish to make about them.</P>
    <P>The postal side is heavily affected by wage increases because of its high labour content&mdash;about 73 per cent of postal costs are in respect of staff.  The sparseness of population in many rural areas means that expenditure on delivery alone in these places is several times more than the amount of postage paid on the correspondence delivered. Furthermore, while traffic generally is growing, the rate of growth is relatively small.  Apart from the increase in the basic letter rate, therefore, it is necessary to raise the charges for all classes of correspondence and as they were not increased on the occasion of the last change in letter rate, a somewhat greater proportionate increase is being applied to them. Second class mail, that is, printed papers, newspapers, etc. involves practically the same handling costs as letters and the present rates are definitely uneconomic by reference to existing staff costs.</P>
    <P>The use of the telegraph service, apart from Telex, is steadily declining as the need for it diminishes with the growth of the telephone habit.  There is no way of making the telegraph service pay.  Indeed the greater the traffic, the greater the loss&mdash;a fact which was pointed out clearly in the White Paper issued by one of my predecessors in 1955.  We have to face a continuing loss on this service and the increases in prospect will only serve to keep the loss within reasonable bounds.</P>
    <P>On the telephone side, the increase <Col N="378" /> in the local call fee is necessary if an inordinate increase in trunk call charges is to be avoided.  I may mention that, at present traffic levels, some millions of these local calls would have been charged as trunk calls until a few years ago and that, even at the increased rate, they will still be much cheaper than they were then.</P>
    <P>There is heavy capital expenditure in installing telephones&mdash;it averages about £150 per line.  This fully justifies an advance in rentals, which will still be moderate at the new rates, and the introduction of a connection fee such as is charged by almost all other telephone administrations.  Very many residential telephone lines do not at present pay their way and the new rates will help to reduce the burden which they impose on other users. Trunk call charges have, in general, been little disturbed; three of the six categories of internal trunk fees are unchanged and the other three are only slightly increased.  These small changes which will be made in internal trunk call rates are unavoidable, for technical reasons associated with subscriber trunk dialling, in view of the change in the local call fee.</P>
    <P>Allowing for certain reductions in traffic the new rates are estimated to bring in just over £2,300,000 extra revenue in a full year.  This will not go the whole way towards maintaining the finances of the Department on a sound basis.  Accordingly, proposals for economies in the Post Office services are under consideration though at the moment I am not in a position to make any definite statement about them.  The new charges will commence to operate only from later on this year whereas much of the increases in staff costs were retrospective to dates in the last financial year. There is, therefore, no way of avoiding a loss on working for 1963-4 and for 1964-5.  With many of the items of expenditure still not exactly defined, any estimate of the financial position for these two years must necessarily be very tentative.  Subject to that qualification, I should imagine that the loss on working for 1963-4 and 1964-5 will be of the other of £300,000 for each year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="379" /> BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION</P>
    <P>As Deputies must now be well aware, I do not intervene in matters concerning radio or television programmes or in the day to day administration of Radio Éireann.  Moreover, Radio Éireann's annual report, three of which have already appeared, contain a lot of information on the Authority's activities.  My remarks will, therefore, be confined to the more important matters and to those in which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has a statutory function.</P>
    <P>After deducting the costs of licence collection a sum of about £587,000 is being provided for sound broadcasting in 1964-65 and the balance, namely, £813,000 is for the television service. These figures take into account that £1 5s. out of each £5 licence is intended for the sound broadcasting service.  The amount being provided for sound broadcasting plus sound advertising revenue will probably not be sufficient to meet the expenditure on that service in 1964-65 in view of pay increases and other higher costs and the deficit will have to be made good out of the Authority's general revenue.</P>
    <P>In my Second Reading speech on the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1963, I outlined the progress the Authority had made with its capital programme, compared the expenditure to date with the original estimate and described the purposes for which the additional capital is needed.  I am sure that Deputies will not expect me to cover that ground again now.  I would, however, like to refer briefly to my announcement on that occasion regarding the decision to provide a VHF service to improve sound broadcasting coverage.  The Authority is now making its plans for the improvement of sound broadcasting reception.  Its technical officers have been engaged on the preparation of specifications for the VHF installations and tenders will shortly be invited.</P>
    <P>It will be of the order of about eighteen months before VHF transmissions will be available.  When the <Col N="380" /> VHF transmitters are in full operation, the problem of poor reception over large parts of the country&mdash;a problem which has been a matter of concern to my predecessors and myself&mdash;will at last have been solved. Until then I would ask listeners from parts of the country where interference from foreign stations is particularly bad to bear with the present unsatisfactory position as best they can.  My Department is taking every step open to it to have the interference caused to the Athlone transmissions reduced, but with the increasing crowding of the medium wave bands it is not very hopeful of the outcome of its representations.</P>
    <P>In May, 1963, I approved the Authority's proposals to increase the hours for regular television transmissions from 42 to 43 hours approximately per week, with permission to average up to 47 hours per week to allow for extra broadcasts outside the regular schedule.  In December, 1963, I agreed to a further extension by two hours per week during the school terms to provide for educational programmes for schools, on condition that the resulting additional costs would be refunded to the Authority.</P>
    <P>In the case of sound programmes, I authorised in February last an extension from 11.30 p.m. to 12 midnight on Wednesdays only so that the Authority could broadcast a sponsored programme from 11 p.m. to 12 midnight.</P>
    <P>I have had many complaints regarding the interference caused to the reception of programmes by various types of electrical equipment.  As the House is aware, all powers appropriate for the investigation and detection of interference with wireless telegraphy receiving apparatus have been conferred upon Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>In September last I announced the appointment of a Committee for a second period of two years to advise me in relation to the making of regulations for controlling undue electrical interference with the working of wireless telegraphy apparatus.  Regulations to control undue interference caused by small electric motors came into <Col N="381" /> force on 1st December, 1963.  Regulations for the control of interference from ignition apparatus came into force on 1st February, 1964.  The Committee is now engaged in studying other prolific sources of interference and how they might best be controlled.</P>
    <P>I might, perhaps, mention one source which has come to us with the increase in the number of television receivers. Many viewers now find that when these receivers are in operation their neighbours are experiencing interference with the reception of sound programmes.  This is known as &ldquo;line time base radiation&rdquo;.  It has been suggested that steps should be taken to prevent TV sets from interfering with radio reception.  It is of course not in the interests of set manufacturers to have one of their products impairing enjoyment from another of their products but a solution has not so far been found even in Britain where the problem has existed for a long time.</P>
    <P>When a solution will be found I cannot say but I am advised that listeners can, at times, reduce or eliminate the trouble by altering the position of the radio set in relation to the offending television equipment.  As I said last year, the real solution may lie more in the establishing of a code of practice for television set manufacturers rather than in the introduction of statutory regulations.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear that the general public is showing a growing awareness of the need for avoiding the creation of interference with their neighbours' viewing and listening.  Perhaps I should again refer to the effect of undue interference on reception of the relatively weak signals of the BBC and UTV. It would be altogether unreasonable to expect that electrical apparatus should be suppressed to such a degree that no interference would be caused to reception from distant television or radio stations because the cost would be prohibitive.  Accordingly, the observance of the interference limits which will be prescribed by regulation will not ensure satisfactory reception of foreign programmes.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that I was anxious that the Authority would <Col N="382" /> maintain a close liaison with the Film Censor.  In February last I was informed by the Director General that a practical working arrangement had been concluded whereby the Censor would act as a special consultant to Telefís Éireann outside his official hours.  Arrangements had accordingly been put in train just prior to his untimely death.  Of course, the responsibility for the content of films shown on television rests with the Authority. It cannot be shared with any other body.</P>
    <P>Section 16 (2) (k) of the Broadcasting Authority Act allows the Authority, subject to the consent of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, to compile, publish, distribute, sell and exchange recorded aural and visual material.  The Authority has been given permission to sell or exchange occasional copies of material which has been or will be used in its own programmes.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to two groups of experts on broadcasting and television matters which held meetings in Dublin for the first time in February last.  The first, with which my Department is directly concerned, was the TTVS group meeting of CEPT&mdash;the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunication Administrations. This group was created in Paris in 1960 to consider questions concerning television and sound broadcasting transmissions in so far as they affect telecommunication administrations.  The second was a Working Party meeting of representatives of the European Broadcasting Union&mdash;a union of broadcasting organisations&mdash;which also deals with problems concerning radio and television relays.  International broadcasting relays are now very complex and telecommunication administrators have to agree on ways and means of providing circuits for them and the conditions to be attached thereto. When we remember that there are a number of different television systems in use in European countries and that each broadcasting organisation participating in, say, the Eurovision programme of the Winter Olympics needs a commentary in the language of its own country the need for close <Col N="383" /> coordination between these two groups is evident.  The Dublin meetings demonstrated that close and friendly contacts do in fact exist between them.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year when introducing the Estimate that the Authority had joined Eurovision on a provisional basis.  As yet it has no direct technical link with the Eurovision system but the past year has been quite a rewarding one in so far as Eurovision exchanges were concerned. Of course Telefís Éireann took far more programmes than it contributed to the network.  It did, however, make important contributions by making available the main events of the late President Kennedy's visit to Ireland and a telecast of the Irish Derby on 29th June, 1963.  It is an interesting fact that the late President's address to the Dáil and Seanad coincided with the passage of one of the experimental communication satellites and was seen and heard throughout the United States as it was taking place in Leinster House.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I feel that the Authority can be congratulated on the many excellent programmes, both sound and television, which were broadcast during the past year.  In saying that I do not want to suggest that Deputies will not have points of criticism to make which I am confident the Authority will consider carefully. But to be fairminded we must all realise that it is impossible for the Authority to please all the people all the time.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister sits down, would he refer to Page 5 of his statement?  Is there a clerical error? He referred to the conveyance of mails and said:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I move.</P>
      <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>Taking the Post Office services in general, there is no great complaint.  I feel everyone will agree a reasonable service is being provided.  Congratulations are due to the Department's officials, and to other officials, for their personal interest in their work, and their efficiency.  I think a special word of thanks is due for the way in which they handled the visit of the late President Kennedy and the fine services they gave at that time.  They were under very heavy pressure during the whole period of the visit.</P>
      <P>The officials have been promised substantial pay increases which are long overdue to meet the very high cost of living which has obtained over the past few years.  I understand that the postmasters have not been dealt with.  They are very responsible men and their case should be dealt with at the same time as the case of the other officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the ordinary postmasters. There has been a steep increase in the general cost of living also and they require an increase in pay just the same as any other officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal reason for my moving that this Vote be referred back for reconsideration is the present state of the telephone service.  The Minister mentioned that there has been development over the past year.  We appreciate that there has been development but it is very slow.  The same pattern continues.  People in industry, business and agriculture, apply for the service and are told they cannot be connected up for a considerable time. When they fail in that direct approach to the Minister, they usually apply to <Col N="385" /> the local Deputy, and the reply he gets is the same.  Last year the Minister said more money was being invested in the telephone service, and this year he says that £6 million has been allocated to that service.</P>
    <P>The fact is that due to normal, modern development in industry and agriculture, there is much more demand for immediate service than there was in years gone by.  We expect&mdash;and have expected over the years&mdash;that the Minister would plan ahead to meet that demand.  Let us take the motorcar industry.  Some years ago there was very limited demand for motorcars, but in the past few years that demand has exceeded all expectation and the industry was geared to meet it.  I am sure if any person wants to purchase a car or a lorry, he will not meet any trouble in securing what he wants.</P>
    <P>The ESB is another good example. It is much better really because it is run by a semi-State body.  The ESB plan years ahead.  They do not wait until they get in so many applications. They plan ahead.  They have more planning to do than the Minister because they have to plan ahead for the production of the power as well as for making connections in the various parts of the country.  Provided a person is prepared to pay, they are always able to connect him.  Those industries set a good headline for the Minister to follow in planning ahead for what is now a natural development.</P>
    <P>The real cause of the delay in the development of the telephone service is that the Government feel they have a monopoly, and that the public can just wait until it suits the Minister and the Government to provide a full and efficient service.  If it were a private enterprise service or if it were handled by a semi-State body as the sugar industry or the electricity industry, I have no doubt that that body would provide for the requirements of the people.</P>
    <P>The telephone is one branch of the Department which is paying its way and servicing its capital requirements. Consider the surplus in the telephone account.  For 1962-63, it was £346,734 and over the past few years, that surplus <Col N="386" /> is roughly made up to £2 million. The surplus in 1962-63 was more than sufficient to meet the deficit on both postal and telegraph services and to leave a balance of £46,608.</P>
    <P>In former years, the Minister made the excuse that there was a long delay in getting the necessary equipment from overseas.  I am sure we shall hear the same excuse when he comes to reply to this debate.  In his opening statement, he mentioned that a shortage of skilled staff was one of the factors which prevented him from extending the service.  The ESB have the same difficulties as the Minister in getting skilled staff.  They have surmounted them and therefore that should not involve any great hardship. I am sure the old excuse, too, will be trotted out that we did not plan when we were in office.  Times have changed considerably over the last number of years.  The Minister mentioned that he hopes to have the circuits completed. I should like more definite information on that point.</P>
    <P>The greatest shock in the Budget speech of the Minister for Finance was his announcement that he was deducting £2 million from the deficit in anticipation of higher charges which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would announce.  He said it will be necessary to meet the additional cost of the Post Office services arising from the ninth round and other pay increases.  Further on in his statement the Minister for Finance said that appropriate Orders will be made at an early date and that the details of the increased charges will then be given by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Apparently the Minister was to introduce these increased charges at a later date but due to criticism of the suggestion about the deduction of the £2 million in anticipation of the increased charges the Minister was ordered to issue the list of increased charges before midnight. These charges also shocked the public.  I wonder if the Minister and his officials were panicked by the Taoiseach into introducing these extra charges without giving them due consideration?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> These extra charges are intended to cover the ninth round of wage increases for the Post Office officials.  Negotiations for this ninth round started as far back as last December, or before that, between the Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers.  The Taoiseach then promised that whatever the results of these negotiations, the fruits and benefits of them would be passed on to all the staff in the Civil Service.  Was that not the time to investigate and to go into the general running costs of the services?</P>
    <P>Replying to the debate on the Supplementary Estimate, the Minister stated that if the people wanted services, they would have to pay for them.  Nobody can disagree with that statement.  However, the Post Office is different from other Departments in that it is partly a commercial undertaking providing sales and services.  Has the Minister invited in any efficiency experts to advise on how to obtain a more efficient service at a reduced cost or is it a case of piling on the cost?</P>
    <P>The Minister said he brought experts into some parts of the services but I do not think that was very comprehensive. If it was, it must not have had the desired effect.  Industry in general has been invited, and assisted by Government grant of up to 50 per cent of the cost, to bring in these experts to increase productivity.  There is no reason why a large percentage of the recent increases in salaries and wages could not be absorbed by improved methods and general layout in the different post offices and other branches of the service.</P>
    <P>At column 1537 of the Official Report, the Minister for Finance stated that a steep rise in productivity is needed to offset the higher wages and salaries and to keep costs in industry and services from rising significantly. The Taoiseach later said, as reported at column 1781 of Volume 208 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>There is, I agree, an obligation on the Government to ensure that the cost of these services is not unduly inflated and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is now about to <Col N="388" /> initiate a drive for economies in the Post Office by the adjustment of the services to the reasonable needs of the people and by changes in procedures which will, it is hoped, increase individual productivity.</P>
    <P>It is very strange that the Taoiseach says that these economies are to be made now.  He states that fact when the actual increases are practically announced.  After all, he stated also in his speech that every alternative should be used to rising costs and rising prices.  If only they had followed that example in their own Department.</P>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs is a quasi-commercial Department. If they had acted on those lines, they should be ready to absorb some of the extra costs.  They should not have to wait for the Taoiseach to suggest that economies could be made when in fact the actual increases have taken place.  Of course, these officials are entitled to the increases but the responsibility is on the Minister to see that as far as possible these increases will be absorbed in greater efficiency. The Minister failed dismally in his duty in that regard.</P>
    <P>Instead of looking into the matter years ago, the Minister is now at the behest of the Taoiseach about to initiate a drive for economy.  The Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach can advise everybody down the country &mdash; businessmen, industrialists, and everyone else&mdash;as to the way in which they should operate; how they should reduce costs and increase productivity. Here, on his own doorstep, practically nothing has been done.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs states now, when the costs have to be met, that he is only about to initiate these economies. I feel that the imposition of these charges was a rushed affair.  I feel that due consideration was not given to the probable effect of these extraordinary increases on the ordinary citizen, and, secondly, on industry.  The extent of these increases shows the regard the Government have for the people of the country.  Like other things, they hope the people will forget about them in a few months.  I can assure the Minister <Col N="389" /> and the Government that it will have a very bad effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are implications in this question which I cannot accept.  For instance, the statement that &ldquo;wages increases have been offset by cost of living increases&rdquo; is, in my view, a grave exaggeration and far from there being a &ldquo;strict means test&rdquo; for medical cards, all the evidence appears to indicate that the test applied is by no means rigid.</P>
      <P>Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, requires health authorities to provide, without charge, general medical services for persons &ldquo;who are unable, by their own industry or other lawful means&rdquo; to provide the services for themselves or their dependants.  The determination of eligibility for the services is a question for the appropriate health authority and from inquiries I have made I am satisfied an income scale is not used in making such determination, each case being considered objectively and all the relevant factors are taken into account&mdash;including medical expenses.  Even, therefore, if I had the statutory power to issue an instruction such as is suggested by the Deputy, which I have not, I do not feel that I would have any justification for doing so.</P>

Under the annuity system a constant sum which includes interest and capital repayment is paid annually during the term of the loan.  The element of capital repayment in an annuity is small in the early years but increases progressively during the term.  As under the instalment system a higher proportion of the debt is paid in the early years, it follows that the total amount paid by way of interest is less than that paid under the annuity system.

      <P>Since the Deputy raised the matter this morning, I have had an opportunity of reading the portion of the typescript relevant to the incident and whilst I deprecate strongly the use of the word &ldquo;liar&rdquo; in the House in any context, as its use is not proper to decorum and order, as the epithet was not used against any particular individual member of the House, no action on my part is called for.</P>

      <P>I must say that I cannot accept that and the Labour Party <Col N="404" /> cannot accept it.  If needs be, it will be submitted to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Whilst the Minister for Social Welfare did not specifically name anybody, he said that the Labour Party are professional liars.  In the past you have insisted that Deputies who used expressions like that would have to withdraw them and I am asking you now to call on the Minister for Social Welfare to withdraw the remark.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.&mdash;Deputy Crotty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time, I was dealing with the increase in postal charges which have gone above the ordinary limits.  I think the Minister did not give due consideration to these increases.  They are savage increases and they do not bear any relationship to the actual increased costs <Col N="408" /> of salaries and wages.  Can you imagine the charge for letters, which are used by everybody, from the lowest to the highest, and which two or three years ago was 3d., being increased by 25 per cent?  The Minister earlier increased these charges by 33? per cent, to 4d. Now he has increased them further, to 5d.  A person would have to have silver now in order to post a letter.  We must remember that the charge for the same service in England is still 3d.  Is it a case that the smaller population in this country must be mulcted more heavily in order to pay for the cost of this service?</P>
      <P>The Minister should reconsider this matter, which will affect the poorest people, even the old age pensioner who writes a letter occasionally.  Apart from the effect this increased charge will have on private persons, it will have a very adverse effect on business concerns. A concern whose costs for postage were £400 will now have to pay £500.  That is a very serious increase in the letter rate and I do not think any serious consideration was given to it.  I think it was just a case of the Taoiseach, being nettled when he was challenged about the second small Budget, telling the Minister to get out these charges straight away and have them issued that evening.</P>
      <P>The increase in the postcard rate is a 50 per cent increase&mdash;from 2d to 3d.  Lettercards are used extensively, especially by commercial travellers. The increased cost in this case will be another heavy burden on the business community.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister or the Government gave any deep thought to the effects on the economy.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in the Budget debate referred to the importance of improved and expanding industry.  Will these increased charges in postal rates help to expand industry or to promote industry?  This is an example to the business people.  The Government are in power and it may be thought that there is no one to challenge them.  We, as an Opposition, are challenging them on behalf of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The newspaper rate is increased by <Col N="409" /> 50 per cent, from 2d to 3d, which will be a very heavy impost on the newspapers. We know there is one newspaper that will absorb the 12½ per cent and, I suppose, any other increase. They have not increased their prices. Other newspapers run as commercial concerns have had to increase their prices and this will be a further impost on these newspapers.</P>
    <P>The 2 lb parcel rate is increased from 1/3d to 2/-, an increase of 60 per cent.  When I saw that increase I asked myself what would happen if the service were run by a private concern. There was a proposal to increase the price of sugar, which had not been increased for quite a long time and which had to absorb various costs for raw materials and wages, by 14 per cent, which I am sure was already agreed to by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  When the Government saw the reaction in the country, they called for an investigation by the Prices Advisory Body and the result was that there was a goodwill gesture.  The proposed £9 a ton increase was reduced to £8, which satisfied the Government.  The Prices Advisory Body did some good in satisfying them.</P>
    <P>In connection with the proposal to increase the price of flour by about 5 per cent, the Prices Advisory Body were also called in to examine the matter.  I wonder if this increase in the parcel rate was put to the Prices Advisory Body or some other such body to investigate the effects it will have on the business community.  There are quite a number of businesses, especially wholesale businesses, who use the parcel post extensively.  There is one firm in my town that sends a tremendous number of parcels each day by parcel post.  What will this 60 per cent increase mean to them?  I consider that these increases are outrageous, that they were imposed in a panic and that the Minister should do what we are asking him to do in the motion, not to enforce these charges until they have been reviewed.  They are bound to have a very serious effect on business.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact <Col N="410" /> that in respect to small parcels, as the rate for the first ounce is being increased by 1d. only, every packet in this category exceeding 1½ ounces will be cheaper than before and suggested that this would be of some assistance in some areas of our export trade.  I laughed when I heard that.  He is making that small concession and on the other hand he is giving a body blow to industry by increasing the rate for parcels from 1/3d. to 2/-, which is outrageous.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, I do not think due consideration was given to this matter.  It will have the effect of pushing up prices again, especially in the rural areas.  In the rural areas people who cannot come to town use the parcel post.  The charge for one small parcel sent by post is increased by 60 per cent.  I do not think the Minister can put up any argument to justify it.</P>
    <P>We are all looking for foreign business.  We all got an invitation to the fashion show the other day.  We have been impressed as to the increase in the export of fashion goods, which now represents £3 million from practically nil over the past few years.  The foreign letter rate is increased by 33? per cent.  The rate for postcards and printed paper has been increased.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Post Office charges bear any relation to the 12 per cent increase in wages and salaries.  We are fully justified in the motion that we have put down to have these charges referred back for further consideration and I have no doubt that the people behind the Minister would support us in that motion.  It would appear to me that the increases were taken haphazardly. Airmail charges do not bear the same percentage increase as surface mail.  The rate for registration&mdash;inland &mdash;is increased from 9d minimum to 1/- minimum and, at the maximum, from 2/5 to 2/8d.  That represents at the minimum another increase of 33? per cent.</P>
    <P>The rate for customs clearance&mdash; dutiable parcels&mdash;has been increased, where the duty is not over 10/-, from 1/- to 1/4 and where it is over 10/-from 2/- to 2/4.  Not only is it intended <Col N="411" /> to make it pay, but it is intended to make a very good thing out of these charges.  Take postal orders.  Could one imagine being charged 4d for a 1/-postal order?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the telegraph traffic had gone down during the year, the number of telegrams handled having fallen by about 100,000.  Is it a fact that the Minister wants to cut out this service?  If he would say that, there would be something in it.  Imagine an increase for a minimum of 12 words of from 3/- to 5/-, a 66? per cent increase.  It is outrageous.  What the Minister should try to do is improve the service, get telegrams delivered at reasonable times instead of late at night in the case of telegrams handed in early in the day.</P>
    <P>Here the Minister should have taken the example of industry, where efficiency experts have been called in to help.  If he did so I feel sure the service would improve enormously, because more people would be inclined to avail of it than of the present inefficient service.  There is no doubt in my mind that the proposed penal charge will serve to stop people from availing of this service.  It will certainly prove an enormous hardship on people in rural areas who, because they have no telephones, rely so much on the telegraph service.</P>
    <P>Now the overnight telegrams are to be increased from 1/6d. to 2/6d.  I suppose that in proportion to other increased charges, this does not seem so bad.  Ordinary telegrams are to cost 5/- in the future and telegrams to Great Britain are to go up from 3/6d. to 6/-, an increase of 70 per cent.  With the number of young Irishmen and women in Britain there is a great demand for that service.  Therefore, the new charge seems ridiculous and outlandish&mdash;in fact, I cannot find a word strong enough to describe it.</P>
    <P>The telephone service yielded a surplus of £360,000 during the last year for which we have figures, yet now we propose to increase the charges for this service completely beyond the capacity of the people.  Charges for ordinary local calls from private telephones <Col N="412" /> and kiosks are to be increased by a large percentage.  I often wonder if we could not devise some system through which economies could be effected in the service provided by public kiosks.  People sometimes stay on the telephone for ten or 15 minutes while other people wait outside and quite often have to leave without making their calls.  Surely some system could be devised whereby the caller would be restricted to the stated time. If that were done there would be an increase in the number of calls made.</P>
    <P>The rental on private lines is to be increased by 33 per cent, from £9 to £12.  That will not be just a single increase: it will recur every year irrespective of the use being made of the telephone.  Business lines will have their rentals increased by 20 per cent. In addition, the Minister has imposed a system which will stop applicants for telephones.  A £10 fine is to be imposed on people applying for installation. Surely that will have a most detrimental effect since a person must also pay a rental of £12 instead of the present £9.  Does the Minister think people install telephones for sport?  It is no joke, I can tell him.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose a private subscriber changes his address.  Will the £10 fine be refunded to him?  Will he get a rebate if and when he applies for a telephone at his new address?  Will the person who goes into occupation of the vacated house, and who still retains the telephone, get a refund?  These are things we should like to be told because of their importance.  Such a situation could be fairly widespread because a person working for a firm could be transferred to another part of the country.  At any rate, some consideration should be given to sub-scribers to a service already yielding a surplus.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said there was room for economies.  Does the Minister think it is good economic principle to impose increases of 66 per cent and 70 per cent in charges?  He is budgeting for an extra £2 million.  I submit that if he leaves the charges as they are but gets the services of efficiency experts to help him, he will realise that needed <Col N="413" /> money through natural expansion.  We have been told that the volume of the parcel post has increased by 16 per cent and that the cross-Channel parcel post has gone up by 12 per cent in one case and 25 per cent in another.  Surely that must have produced a considerable increase in Post Office revenue.</P>
    <P>Is it not increases like that we should strive for instead of the imposition of these penal duties which will only serve to reduce the demand for the services?  In rural areas, the Minister said, the revenue from postal charges was not sufficient to meet the postmen's wages.  Does he think he will improve that situation by increasing the charges?  I do not think so because people will cut down their use of the post.</P>
    <P>Of course, all these new charges will come back again in the never ending spiral.  We have had enough increases in the past six months; in the past three months we have had three different increases in costs, involving food, clothing and the other necessaries of life.  What does the Minister think the effects will be of these further increases in essential services?  I suppose the Government foolishly believe that in three months this will all be forgotten in the normal way.  I do not think it will.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was made during the debate on last year's Estimate that the Minister should permit the use of scooters by rural postmen.  The Minister now says he has decided to permit it in experimental cases.  This will speed it up and result in a better service. I have not heard anything about it but the Minister said in his statement that they were introducing it. Rural postmen are permitted at present to use their own scooters and they get a miserable allowance of 4/6d. a week under some old regulation.  The least the Department should do is to pay any postman who has the initiative to provide himself with a scooter a reasonable allowance and reasonable running costs.</P>
    <P>Last year I raised the question of auxiliary postmen.  These are in a category of their own.  They are the lowest paid personnel in Government <Col N="414" /> service, or in any service.  The Minister will, of course, make the case that they are part-time and that they are reasonably remunerated for the number of hours they work.  These men have to go in early in the morning, sort the mails and deliver them and, after that, they are not in much form for taking on another job.  It must be remembered, too, that there is not all that part-time work available.  There may be part-time work available in the summer in the country but, in general, it is not available.</P>
    <P>Recently my attention was drawn to a case in which a man was signing on at the labour exchange and drawing £6 10s. 6d. unemployment benefit.  A temporary postman was required in the local post office.  This man was sent there.  He took the job.  Had he not done so he would lose his unemployment benefit, but the real point is that his pay for the week was £5 10s.  He received considerably more on unemployment benefit than he received for doing a week's work.  I do not think the Minister can defend that.  That man had no hope of getting a second job in the afternoon.  I suggest there should be a minimum wage paid to all auxiliary postmen, especially married men with families.  I know a married man who has been working 18 to 20 years and, after the last increase, he is drawing about £5 per week.  He has a wife and two or three children.  Could a family like that exist on something less than £5 per week.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an opportunity to improve the position.  Where there are two or three auxiliary postmen, and one retires, the Minister should divide the rounds between the remaining two and bring them up to a reasonable wage standard.  The opportunity is there, but the Minister has not used it very much.  Perhaps he has been pressed by Party supporters to make a new appointment and, because of that, the other two get no improvement. They are left as they are.  These are the only people that I know of who have no superannuation.  They are not entitled to pensions.  Practically everybody now in employment is entitled to a pension.  In years to come I believe <Col N="415" /> that industrial workers will all have pensions.  That will be a good thing because then they will be able to retire round about 65.  These auxiliary postmen drag on until 75, and even longer, because they know they will get no pension.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Post Office savings bank, that is the small savers bank, the bank for those who save in small amounts; the interest rate is very low.  The Minister for Finance in his Budget statement said he was considering trustee savings.  I trust he will consider increasing the interest rate. Savings certificates earn three per cent, free of tax.  Prize Bonds earn four per cent.  To encourage the sale of the latter the Minister recently put up two special prizes of £10,000 each. That had an effect on the recent issue of prize bonds.  The demand increased and the investment improved.  If the rate of interest were improved where the small savers are concerned people would have a greater inducement to invest in the Post Office savings bank. Of course, when these people are looking for an old age pension, the interest on any money they have is not calculated at two and a half per cent. After the first £25 it is calculated at ten per cent.  They lose both ways.</P>
    <P>I believe savings went down this year.  Last year the sum was £4½ million.  This year the total amount left is £2½ million.  I doubt if legislation would be necessary to implement this suggestion.  If the Minister can increase Post Office charges generally he hardly needs legislation to increase the rate of interest on Post Office savings bank accounts from 2½ per cent to 3 or 4 per cent.  The Minister mentioned that savings have passed the £100 million mark this year.  The Minister suggested we should encourage savings.  There is only one way to do that&mdash;raise the rate of interest and improve the service.</P>
    <P>In accordance with Government policy, I suppose, there was an increase in television licences from £4 to £5 and in radio licences from £1 to 25/-. There is roughly a charge of 10/- a week for rental.  The total cost of operating a television set is round <Col N="416" /> about £30 a year.  I do not set myself up as a critic but, in general, I think the programmes are reasonably good. The more native programmes the better.  The so-called canned programmes are reasonably good, too, but I think people would like to have greater native production.  The summer months now should provide the Authority with an opportunity for increasing native programmes.  I know the Minister is not responsible for the programmes but he can let the Broadcasting Authority know the views of Deputies on them.</P>
    <P>The only complaint I have to make is that there is too much advertising on television.  There is a break in the programme every quarter of an hour. That is too much, especially on Sunday nights.  This is a national television and broadcasting service, not a commercial service.  I know revenue has to be got somewhere.  I was looking at &ldquo;The School Around the Corner&rdquo; last Sunday week.  The programme was extended but there were three breaks for advertising.  If people want to advertise on Sunday night then the charges should be increased and the time should be reduced.  There should not be a break for advertising every 15 minutes.  At most, it should be every half hour.</P>
    <P>The Minister was asked a question here about publishing the cattle market report on television.  He promised to look into the matter, but, so far, these reports have not been published. I note he stated they are given on the radio.  People may use television and may not use the radio at all.  It is a matter the Minister should look into because it is important for some people to get that information.</P>
    <P>I am glad a settlement was reached between the Post Office and the subpostmasters. The Minister got very hot under the collar last year when I suggested there should be arbitration. He would not agree to that.  He said that neither he nor the Government could agree even to conciliation.  I am glad the Government and the Minister changed their minds even if it took a little trouble throughout the country to bring that about.  In a great number <Col N="417" /> of cases, these people had very small remuneration and it is satisfactory that an amicable settlement has been arrived at.</P>
    <P>I understand the educational programmes on Telefís Éireann are very much appreciated.  We hope such programmes will not only be continued but extended during the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is undeservedly unfortunate that the Minister should introduce his Estimate to-day when Cork and Dublin are absolutely incommunicado as far as the telephone is concerned.  For most of last evening and to-day, as far as I know, no contact can be made by telephone with Cork from Dublin or from Cork to Dublin.  It is an unfortunate coincidence and is in no way indicative of the service that has been rendered by the Department over the year.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to note the Minister saw fit to pay tribute to the staffs in the various sections of his Department for the manner in which they carried out their duties during the year.  This House should compliment the Minister, his executives and the staff of the Department on the tremendously efficient service we have received.  All of us have our own little cribs one way or another in regard to this section or that, but it would not be unfair to say that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is, in many ways, the most efficient Department in our service. From the Minister and the executives down to the smallest boy messenger, they are the people who are most in contact with the public day in, day out, and, therefore, most open to criticism. I should like to pay tribute to the Department for the very good relations that exist between the officers and employees of the Department and the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was inclined to preen himself on the achievements of Telefís Éireann.  He is not entitled to do that because he has explained from time to time in this House that he has nothing to do with the day-to-day working of Telefís Éireann and nothing to do with its programmes.  Therefore, I am not praising the Minister when I congratulate Telefís Éireann on the programmes generally.  I say this not just from personal <Col N="418" /> feeling.  Anybody in public life has his finger on the public pulse and knows how the public feel on various matters.  While, as the Minister said in his speech, you cannot please all the people all of the time, particularly in a diversified society such as we are, with rural and urban dwellers, I think the general consensus of opinion is that with the resources available to them, the Telefís Éireann Authority have carried out their job magnificently during the year, particularly in relation to outdoor fixtures, the various sports, horseracing, and so on.  There will always be the cranks writing to the Press and saying this programme does not suit them and another one suits them better, but taking our society as a whole, I believe there is general satisfaction.</P>
    <P>One thing that did strike me regarding Irish programmes on Telefís Éireann is that perhaps we should have a little more.  However, I should like to make this constructive criticism in relation to some of our programmes, as Gaeilge, that the Authority should not assume, and it would be wrong and detrimental for them to assume, that their audience are completely fluent in Irish.  The children are probably more fluent than the adults. The adults of the 40 to 50 age group have a basic knowledge of Irish, people who did their Leaving Certificate through Irish and who for want of practice are not fluent in Irish.  If those associated with the programmes would realise they are not addressing a fluent Irish audience and if they would take things a little more slowly and quietly, it would help the restoration of the language.</P>
    <P>The Department are to be congratulated on the manner in which they have kept up with modern methods and in relation to the arrangements they have made with the BBC on many occasions for the transmission of programmes of vital interest.  I suppose we can pride ourselves on the fact that, as the Minister mentioned in his speech, we were able to reciprocate magnificently on the occasion of the late President Kennedy's visit to Ireland.  I was glad the Minister paid tribute to the telegraph and telephone <Col N="419" /> sections of the Department for the excellent job they did on that occasion. He is quite right in saying that a tribute was paid to them by the foreign Press from all over the world for the manner in which they provided facilities to enable the Press to cover that historic occasion.</P>
    <P>Having said that in tribute to the Minister and his Department, I part company with him on some other matters.  I notice from the text of the Minister's speech in relation to the postal charges that his attitude is a kind of pale reflection of the attitude adopted by the Taoiseach in his speech on the Budget.  The Taoiseach tried to justify the increases in the postal charges and telephone charges as being completely attributable to the claims made by the Post Office staffs in regard to remuneration.  As reported in the Official Report, Volume 208, column 1781, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>These increases are required solely to meet the cost of higher wages and salaries in the Post Office service.</P>
    <P>He went on to say further down the same column:</P>
    <P>... there is a retrospective element in the wages and salaries paid this year.</P>
    <P>If there is a retrospective element in the wages and salaries that have been claimed and granted, either through conciliation or arbitration, that is not the fault of the unions concerned. The Taoiseach admits that: &ldquo;When the Government examined the position in the Post Office, we found that salaries had fallen behind comparable classes in other branches of the public service...&rdquo; That did not happen today or yesterday.  It did not happen because of the ninth round of wage increases.  It did not happen because of the 2½ per cent turnover tax.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that there was a justifiable claim by Post Office clerks, postmen and boy messengers, hanging fire for a number of years. When I indict the Minister for not having dealt with it, I am indicting his predecessors all the more.  It was left hanging between the earth and <Col N="420" /> the sky, and no one saw fit to deal with it.  If that claim had been met down through the years, as others had to be met&mdash;claims in private employment and particularly claims in the public service&mdash; the cost would have gone in to the general expenses, would have had to be met by the Exchequer, and would have had to be passed on to the population in general through general taxation.  Successive Ministers, and the Department, having neglected to deal with it for one reason or another&mdash;and the reason always baffles me&mdash;we now have the whole bonanza together.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes into this House and says: &ldquo;It is because of the fact that we must increase the wages of boy messengers, postmen and Post Office clerks that we are putting 1d extra on the stamp, charging £10 to have a phone installed, and increasing the rental and other charges, but do not blame us&rdquo;.  The attitude of the Government is: &ldquo;We have a fall guy on the left.  We will throw that pass out to the telegram boy&rdquo; and therefore the old age pensioner has to pay 1d extra for a stamp.  The Government throw up their hands in horror and say: &ldquo;Do not blame us.  We gave you 2/6 and we would not have raised the price of the stamp, were it not for the fact that these servants and officials of the postal service demanded these increased wage rates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to clarify one point in the Taoiseach's statement, a point also made in the Minister's statement today. As reported in the Official Report, volume 208, column 1781, the Taoiseach asked:</P>
    <P>Am I to interpret Deputy Tully's statement denouncing these increases to mean that he and his Party are against the upward revision of the salaries and wages of Post Office workers?</P>
    <P>That is almost too puerile to be worthy of comment from the Labour benches. The Taoiseach can be naive, and very naive when he sees fit.  Let us make our position absolutely clear in this regard.  We are prepared to support, with all the means at our disposal, the statement that the employees of the Post Office, the employees of the <Col N="421" /> Minister's Department and the postmen, are entitled to a decent wage and a just wage, the same as the Garda and the Army man.  We have made claims for the Garda and the Army in recent times, and who ever came along and said: &ldquo;Because of the fact that you are getting that increase, the price of this or that is going up by 1d., 2d. or 3d.&rdquo;.  No one ever attempted to specify a particular section of the public service as being responsible for a specific rise in the cost of a commodity or service.</P>
    <P>It is unworthy of the Minister to follow the line that the unfortunate postman must go around delivering letters next week and the week after, being upbraided by everyone saying: &ldquo;That was a nice thing you did.  I am paying 1d. extra for a stamp and extra charges for my telephone because you had to get an increase in wages.&rdquo; That is very unfair.  The Minister is a reasonable man&mdash;as I have always found him&mdash;and if he examines his conscience in that regard, he will find he is a little guilty.</P>
    <P>I am interested to know if the Minister will elaborate a little further on the proposed economies in the Post Office.  We got a kind of nebulous statement that, having put up the charges, they are now going to proceed to examine into how economies might be brought about.  One would think that it would be more sane if that had been done before the charges were increased. We will all look forward very much indeed to the results of the Minister's investigation of the economies he proposes to bring about.  We have had the unfortunate experience in this House, and outside it, that there are loud protestations about the cost of running a Department or a business, and then we get ponderous statements from Ministers and business executives that they are about to embark on an economy crusade.</P>
    <P>That is all very fine and dandy but unfortunately we in these benches must say that practically invariably when we hear the results of the examination by the efficiency experts, all they can ever advocate is that the fellow down at the bottom of the cage must get the knock.  We would not be surprised if, as a result of this examination, the Minister <Col N="422" /> comes along and, on the advice of his efficiency experts within the Department, says: &ldquo;We have too many boy messengers, or we have too many postmen.&rdquo; Worse still, they may decide that they will not send a postman down a boreen or up the side of a mountain in Kerry with a daily service. They will keep them all in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  They will probably increase the service there, and they will probably decide to cut down the services in the outlying and the country districts.</P>
    <P>I am waiting patiently to know what the result of this economy will be.  I am telling him that if the economies are anything in the line of what I have suggested, it might be they will be resisted violently here and by the unions catering for the Post Office workers.</P>
    <P>We do not accept the suggestion that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should be regarded as something apart, on a purely commercial basis.  I want to be quite clear about that because the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The principle that the Post Office should pay for itself and not be subsidised in taxation is not merely sound but so far as I know has not been questioned in the Dáil.  We should like to see the Department paying for itself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We do not disagree with him on that point at all but we certainly part company with the Government in their suggestion that it must be regarded as something apart, as a commercial sector apart from this House and apart from the public service generally, and that if it does not pay, then particularly the employees of the Department must carry the can.</P>
    <P>We will not accept for one moment that if there is a deficit in the Department in their annual operations, it should be subsidised, not by the public generally but by the boy messenger, by the postman and by the clerk.  That is not accepted.  Their claims to a just wage and to just conditions of salary are something apart from the deficit or the surplus.  I should like to ask the Minister, if the Department show a surplus sometime, if he would now <Col N="423" /> act on the line the Taoiseach was suggesting and that the surplus would be doled out to the employees concerned.</P>
    <P>We regard the postal service as a public service.  I am much afraid that this particular idea which is not over-brilliant must have been imparted to the Minister by his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power. The Minister for Transport and Power had several mad ideas in his time.  On one occasion he felt that if CIE were not paying their way, then the employees of all grades in CIE would just have to put up with it.  We had the executives of CIE coming along to the trade unions about wage and salary demands and saying, in effect: &ldquo;We lost so much last year and we are liable to lose so much this year and we cannot do it.&rdquo; The unions took them along to their ordinary negotiating men and arbitration machinery and put their case before an independent arbitrator.  We had the CIE people with the old song and dance suggested by the Minister for Transport and Power that they could not afford to pay.  The unions made the case that the employees were entitled to wages and salaries comparable with those paid in decent outside employments.  Of course, the arbitrator found in favour of the unions.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I do not think the Minister would disagree in any way that it would be an absolutely untenable position not alone for the unions but for himself if anyone were to suggest that the wages and salaries in the various grades in the Post Office service should be determined by the fact that there was a deficit or a surplus in the operating costs of the services over the year.  I hope I have made myself clear on that particular point.</P>
    <P>We regard the Post Office service as a public service.  We think that in no way should the salaries or wages or claims or conditions of service of the employees be related to the revenue of the Post Office.  We object strongly to the attitude of the Government in endeavouring to pretend that the <Col N="424" /> increased postal charges, which, to our mind, are unjustified and unjustifiable, can be attributed to the claims of the Irish Post Office Workers Union.  It is a backlog of several years.  It is a mean and cheap trick to get out of the position in which the Government find themselves at the moment in facing the strong protestations of the public in relation to these increased charges.</P>
    <P>One would think that the claims of the Post Office workers had nothing to do with Government policy.  By and large, of course, the various claims down through the years of the Post Office workers&mdash;outside comparability and status claims&mdash;were due to the increased cost of living deliberately brought about by action of this Government. They have created the situation that they drove people into the seventh, eighth and ninth rounds of wage increases.  To come along then, with a brazen face, and to suggest to the public that the reason the ordinary postage stamp has gone up from 4d to 5d is that the postmen want something more is most unfair, to put it mildly.  Of course he wants more, not to enjoy a higher standard of living but just to keep in line with his fellow workers.  I hope I have made my case quite clear.</P>
    <P>I warn the Minister that if it is attempted to do anything whereby the postman will be asked to subsidise a public service, whereby the postman is picked out particularly as against the general taxpayer to subsidise a public service, we shall resent it and oppose it with all the power at our disposal.</P>

    <P>While there are many complaints regarding the delay in the installation of telephones, I think that those who consider the whole picture in a reasonable manner will agree that the Minister and his Department have considerable problems and difficulties to <Col N="425" /> overcome in relation to this matter. The growth in the number of applications for telephones over the past few years has been phenomenal and this reflects the upsurge in the economy that has been so noticeable during that period.</P>
    <P>I was rather amused at Deputy Crotty's efforts to write off the exceptional demand for telephones by relating it to other irrelevant matters but these extra demands for telephones and the result of the improved economic conditions we are experiencing over the past few years.  The actual installation of telephones is not by any means the major problem.  The main problem is to provide the cable and lines to carry the extra traffic if extra telephones are installed.</P>
    <P>The wholesale installation of telephones without making proper provision for cabling and trunk lines would ultimately create chaotic conditions.  Where we have 100 complaints now from people who applied for telephones and are experiencing delay, we would have thousands of complaints from those who already have telephones, because of the disruption that would result.  Instead of relieving the situation, we would have a much worse position.  The Minister is doing his utmost to provide these extra cables.  Last year 1,115 new trunk circuits were put into operation.  The Government recognise the importance of providing a telephone service for all those who wish to avail of it.  That is clear from the fact that we voted this year on a special Bill an enormous sum towards telephone capital development and by the fact that included in this year's Estimates is a sum of £1,300,000 to meet the requirements of a greatly expanded telephone capital programme.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that there is still a backlog so far as the installation of telephones is concerned, despite the fact that over the past few years we are putting in on average 5,000 more telephones than were put in in 1956 and that there are 600 more permanent employees in the Engineering Branch.  This shows the enormous increase in the number of applications for telephones.  I know I am preaching <Col N="426" /> to the converted when I urge the Minister to continue to do his utmost to provide more trunk lines.  Coming from a highly-industrialised constituency, I say the need for more telephones is obvious.</P>
    <P>There are some applications with the Department for a considerable time because of the difficulty of providing the necessary circuits.  Since they have been with the Department for a long time, an extra effort should be made to clear them up.  Perhaps a more reasonable attitude could be adopted in some instances.  I have one case in mind of a man who applied for a telephone a very considerable time ago.  In the meantime two people came to live in the district, both of whom had phones in their previous homes, and who were, therefore, entitled to priority.  Their phones were installed in their new dwellings. When the Engineering Branch were installing these phones they might have installed the phone for the man in question who was living beside these people.</P>
    <P>My experience in regard to local calls is that there has been an exceptional improvement over the past year. Local calls from where I live are put through with commendable speed.  I should like to thank the Minister for the provision of the extra lines necessary and to praise the efficiency and courtesy of the local post office staff. There was a problem with regard to kiosks in Drogheda, but this has been cleared up to a large extent.  Perhaps a little more consideration should be given to the siting of kiosks.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the recruitment of technical staff.  The Minister's problem in relation to technical staff is probably due to the very considerable expansion of industry, which is taking up a large proportion of the technical staff available.  I do not know what are the wages paid to the staff the Minister has in mind, but they would need to be on a par with the wages available to similar staff in industry if the Minister is to get sufficient staff of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that he is setting up an advisory body to advice him on the design of the ordinary <Col N="427" /> stamp issue.  This is something to be commended.  We cannot claim that the design of our ordinary stamps is very imaginative.  One shows the map of Ireland, another the crests of the Four Provinces and another the Claidheamh Solais, which has a historical background but which has not, I am afraid, any particular meaning to many people at present.  Of course, that is largely our own fault.  The design of our stamps could be used to propagate a better knowledge of our country and of its scenic beauty.  It could help to encourage tourism.  I know there are objections to this, but if the stamps were of a sufficiently high standard of design no harm could come of this proposal.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann are still a young organisation but they are rapidly coming to maturity.  The percentage of home produced material is much greater than we had any reason to hope for when the television service was first started.  It is simple for Deputies to call on the Minister to have more home produced programmes, but the cost factor must be taken into consideration.  I am informed that the cost of this would be prohibitive.  It is much more expensive to produce &ldquo;live&rdquo; programmes at home than to broadcast &ldquo;canned&rdquo; programmes.  We can be proud that such a high percentage of home produced material is being broadcast at present.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the original Television Bill, I advocated that before the service came into operation, we should produce as many programmes as we could at Ardmore Studios.  I felt that, while they might cost us a reasonable amount at the time, we would have a ready market for our productions in other countries.  Programmes such as &ldquo;Radharc&rdquo; which is done by&mdash;I was about to say&mdash;amateurs but they would put many professionals to shame, are excellent and produced at relatively low cost.  They prove it is not necessary in all cases to spend enormous sums to get good programmes.</P>
    <P>A special word of praise is due to the sports section of Telefís Éireann because of the way they portray the <Col N="428" /> country's national games, football and hurling.  Before their first telecast of hurling, I felt, because it was such a fast game and the ball so small, it could not be suitable for television.  In fact, it has turned out to be one of the best programmes and I believe the television portrayal of it will do much to encourage hurling in the counties where, as a general rule, it is not played.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been made that Telefís Éireann is not producing sufficient Irish language programmes.  To some extent I agree.  I feel that if they produced more simple types of programme suitable for adults who have not a very extensive knowledge of the language, they would do much to help the revival of the language.  I feel very much the same as Deputy Casey does in this respect.  In the main, the Irish programmes of Telefís Éireann are excellent but are directed towards people with a good knowledge of the language and their content is not suitable to teenagers for the most part, the content being, in general, too dull for them.  If Telefís Éireann could produce Irish language programmes that are short, snappy, well produced, well directed and simple the results would be very much better.  I stress the well-produced angle because on many occasions I have watched Welsh language programmes.  I do not understand Welsh but because the programmes are so well produced I watch them to the end.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann is doing very good work in its broadcasts to schools, which are very much appreciated.  There was some initial difficulty because Telefís Éireann had to put these programmes into operation at pretty short notice and did not, therefore, consult various teaching organisations.  I am sure that will be remedied this year and that the teaching organisations will be consulted.</P>
    <P>I also suggest it should now be possible for Telefís Éireann, having gone into the educational sphere, to broadcast programmes suitable for vocational schools.  Returning for a moment to Irish language programmes, the danger we face there is that if we overload  <Col N="429" /> Telefís Éireann with Irish language programmes, particularly in areas such as my constituency where we can get BBC and UTV as well as Telefís Éireann, people will simply switch over to UTV or BBC.  Instead of gaining anything we should be worse off.</P>
    <P>In my area, as I suppose in most areas, addresses have been changed considerably in recent years For example addresses which had the postal address &ldquo;Dunleer&rdquo; now have the postal address &ldquo;Drogheda&rdquo;.  The postal authorities should give a little more publicity to these changes of address because if letters are wrongly addressed it means considerable delay.</P>
    <P>Finally, I regret that it has been necessary to increase the postal charges. I have no doubt the Minister and the Government also regret it but the fact remains that there was a deficit of £2.5 million which had to be met in some way.  The Taoiseach said the Post Office was expected to stand on its own and pay for itself and I want to stress that this is something which was accepted by all Governments for a considerable time past. Whether I agree with that is another matter but in regard to what Deputy Casey said I stress the point that this is something that was accepted not only by present but by previous Governments.</P>
    <P>There is a number of ways in which we could have got over the deficit. We could, as we have done, increase the postal charges.  That was done because it was felt the Post Office should pay for itself.  Instead of making these increases we could have increased general taxation or we could have refused to increase the wages and salaries of post office workers.  The Opposition are opposing the increase in postal charges because that is the method we adopted but we are well aware that had we adopted any other method they would oppose it equally.  For example, if we had increased the price of cigarettes and beer by another 2d or 3d to meet this deficit we would be told by the Opposition that we were subsidising the tycoons' stamps at the expense of the poor man's cigarettes and pint.</P>
    <P>Regarding the third possible way of <Col N="430" /> clearing this deficit, by not increasing workers' wages, that is a method this Party would never adopt.  We believe the Post Office staffs who are doing such excellent work are fully justified in getting their increases and we are ensuring that they get them.  Deputy Casey said the Labour Party would say the postmen were entitled to their increase but there is a big difference between saying it and doing it.  When we do these things we must do other unpopular things in order to put ourselves in a position to do what is right. The Opposition want to have it both ways.  Of course that is fairly common. It has been common during the years in which I have been a member here.  They have always been anxious to give more and more to everybody because that is popular, but they are never anxious to support the taxes necessary to provide that extra money. Finally, I wish again to thank the Minister for his courtesy to me during the year and for his help in overcoming the problems which faced me in my constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I want to make it perfectly clear that the Post Office workers are entitled to the increase of 12 per cent, in the same way as any other member of the community.  They also have to meet an increase in the cost of living which was due in no small way to the Government's actions during the past 12 months.  I am glad to note that the subpostmasters got their conciliation and that that claim has now been settled. It took a long time but I am glad that the Minister eventually saw fit to let the subpostmasters have arbitration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have said conciliation.  I was amused listening to the previous speaker.  He mentioned that we on this side of the House are always in favour of doing the popular thing for everybody but that nobody should have to pay for it.  He gave the impression that if these increases in postal and telephone charges were not made, postal workers throughout the country could not get their increase. <Col N="431" /> Surely he realises that these increases are more or less what has already been described as a &ldquo;mini-Budget&rdquo;. The Minister for Finance introduced a budget last week and within a few hours on top of that we had these increases being announced.</P>
      <P>I believe these increased charges will cause grave hardship to industrialists. They are being imposed on top of the increased tax on petrol and diesel oil which the Minister for Finance announced.  In addition to that, during the past few months, tariffs have been lifted and in January next, further tariffs are to be lifted.  This Government always prided themselves on being the sponsors and protectors of industry.  I do not think their actions in the Budget and their actions in increasing these charges bear out the line they took some years ago.</P>
      <P>I know that at the moment they turn hither and thither.  One moment they are trying to nurse the industrialists and the next moment they are trying to nurse the small farmers.  I should not like it to go from this House that we think increases can be paid without some call on the Exchequer.  I am not surprised to hear Government speakers saying that the reason for these increased postal charges is that the postal workers had to get their 12 per cent increase.  It is not two years since the same Government gave an increase of 1d. a gallon for milk to the farmers and put an extra penny on the packet of cigarettes and then said that the farmers were responsible for that taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we look at the Minister's statement and see all these increased charges, it is time we asked what is happening all the money that is being taken in by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  In my area, at the Carlow end of the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency, there are 175 applicants awaiting telephones.  Only about three weeks ago, the Minister told me that it would take a short period to clear something like 35 of these applications. Surely if money is to be voted here to keep this Department going and make it pay its way, the <Col N="432" /> people are entitled to have its affairs so managed that those who foot the bill will obtain a service?</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, a lot of business is done today on the telephone and there are a lot of people in business&mdash;including those in the catering trade&mdash;who cannot get a telephone connection to their houses.  It is all right to be told: &ldquo;We will clear 35 of them in the next few months&rdquo;, but at least we should have some idea as to when it will be possible to apply for a telephone and get it within a reasonable period.  The position should be improved now that applicants will have to pay £10 when they apply for a telephone.  I fully realise that the Department have very heavy expenses in respect of trunk lines which they are improving.  I was glad to note in the Minister's statement that the Department have been working on the lines from Carlow to Portlaoise and Carlow to Athy.  This should lead to a great improvement in the service in the area.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to raise is that in the post office in Carlow town, the staff are working under very adverse conditions in an old building.  They are giving a good service but I would say that it is impossible for them to be as quick in answering telephone calls and in dealing with the public as they would wish.  I understand that a site has been procured to build a modern post office in the town.  The building has been erected for an automatic exchange but I am told that nothing has happened in regard to seeking tenders for the post office.  If that is the case, it will be some years before the excellent staff there will have an opportunity of working in decent surroundings.  Where they are, it is not possible for them to give the service that they would like to give.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that the increase in postal charges will have far-reaching ill-effects not alone on industries but on small shopkeepers and the ordinary businessman: Many of these people send parcels to customers by post or have parcels delivered to them from the firms with which they deal <Col N="433" /> on which they have to pay postage. To a person in a small way of business that may amount to an annual sum that will have a disastrous effect on his business.  Apart from being crippled by the famous turnover tax which in respect of some items he cannot pass on to the customer, the person in a small way of business, working to a small profit, will have to bear a further loss due to the action of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in increasing postal charges.</P>
    <P>The Telefís Éireann Authority are to be congratulated on their progress and on the programmes they produce. At the outset, as with any other business, they must have had teething troubles but they were few.  The Authority are to be congratulated on the way Telefís Éireann is run.  However, there is one criticism that I wish to make.  Another Deputy mentioned the matter today.  There are far too many interruptions of programmes by advertisements. The Minister should have the position examined with a view to seeing whether advertisements could be grouped or televised in some way so that a programme would not be interrupted every 15 minutes.</P>
    <P>I heard of a case where a viewer was watching a televised golf match in Woodbrook.  The winner was just about to take his last putt on the green.  The programme was interrupted before he hit the ball, for the purpose of showing an advertisement.  I suggest that there should be a bigger gap between advertisements and that programmes should not be interrupted so frequently.  The Minister would be well advised to have the position examined. I have heard quite a number of complaints about it.  I realise, of course, that revenue is derived from advertisements but I would ask the Minister to examine the position with a view to getting over the difficulty.</P>
    <P>These are the main points I wish to make.  I am astounded, as every other Deputy is, at the additional charges for telephone and postal services that the people are asked to bear. While I have been critical I should like to say that during my short term in the House the Minister has always <Col N="434" /> received me with the greatest courtesy and has been most helpful to me.  Any criticisms I have to offer are made purely and sincerely in the interests of the people whom I represent and the people of my constituency generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share with many other Deputies the opinion which they hold of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Of all Departments of State I regard it as the most grossly inefficient and badly run.  Considering the simplicity of the services it has to perform it is one which ought to be efficient and ought to be able to absorb, without any additional imposition in the way of postal and telephonic charges, the recent relatively small increases given to the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I am also well aware that the income of the Department is substantial and that the wages paid to employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are amongst the lowest wages paid to any group of employees in the State so that even 12 per cent of the paltry wages they earn should have been capable of being absorbed.  Of course, it could quite easily have been absorbed if the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was concerned with trying to earn money and lived up to its responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the reply to a Dáil question which I asked yesterday we learn that in the Dublin area alone the telephone exchanges have 13,470 lines available which are not being used although&mdash; I have not the figure quite ready at the moment but hope to have it before I finish&mdash;there are certainly anything up to 7,000 or 8,000 applicants in the same area who cannot be given a line because the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is not efficiently organised to answer these applicants and applicants they remain.  Here we have a situation in which the Department could be earning income from equipment which is already installed and they can do nothing about it and because they have this unutilised <Col N="435" /> equipment already installed, which must be paid for but which cannot be used, the rest of the community are being blistered unnecessarily in this savage second Budget.</P>
    <P>Why will not the Minister and his Department take steps to see to it that the 13,470 lines which are available in Dublin exchanges are used instead of asking people to wait, as they are now asked to wait, for one, two, three or even five years before they can get the telephones that many of them require for urgent personal health reasons or urgent business reasons? The excuse that is given time out of number for the Minister when questions are asked in this House is that of the applicants that are waiting none is a priority case.  I do not know what relation that has to answering demands when the equipment is already there.</P>
    <P>The excuse, of course, can be given that the lines are not there from the exchanges to the house of the applicants but that is no excuse.  The electricity contractors, the gas contractors, the water contractors, be they the ESB, the Dublin Gas Company or any other gas company or any authority supplying water, can all put in the service in anticipation of demand.  But not the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. That would be an intelligent thing to do but intelligence and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are complete strangers.  What does that Department do instead?  It multiplies the cost of installing lines.  It waits until housing estates are completed and then comes along, sometimes years afterwards, to rip up concrete roadways and pathways, to rip up grass margins, to rip up trees and all kinds or shrubbery put there for the improvement of the appearance of the estate, and then to waste months on end doing work which would have been perfectly simple to do when these estates were virgin soil, wide open to all kinds of development.</P>
    <P>Instead, they have to use gangs of workmen to dig trenches on concrete roadways and paths when the work could be done efficiently, cheaply and quickly with excavators before putting in the volume of cable necessary to meet prospective demand.  If the <Col N="436" /> work were done in that way, we might not have our suburbs so grossly disfigured as they are with masses of perpendicular poles and horizontal lines.</P>
    <P>I can tell you the story of a tree.  It is the story of a tree planted about five years ago outside my house, an ash tree, the kind of tree you cannot stop growing sometimes, be it on top of a heap of coal or on rocky soil. This tree sprouted and displayed its leaves with great gusto for a year or two.  Then along came the men from the engineering section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to dig a hole right in the middle of its roots. Then, about 18 inches away from this small tree, they planted a pole.</P>
    <P>Then they disappeared, but they came back about a year later to give connections to the people in the area through this pole.  That required the digging of another hole in the middle of the roots of this little tree.  Since then, they have dug four holes through the roots of this little tree and on each occasion they left the roots bare, exposed to the elements in different seasons, for several weeks on end. Last year they topped it all.</P>
    <P>I wondered whether these engineers would turn out to be good gardeners. They took the tree out of the ground and planked it on top of a heap.  I was wondering were they really going to try an experiment in nature by planting it again, and they did.  I marvelled at the works and wonders of the Lord when, notwithstanding this maltreatment at the hands of the engineering experts of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, that little tree succeeded in sprouting some foliage last year and kept up a very brave front until the autumn, when the leaves, in the ordinary course of nature, fell from it.  But that was too much for it.  The poor tree has now died.  Because of the treatment by the Department workmen, it had not got the reserves to last out the winter, mild and all as it was.  Last Saturday, I had the painful duty of removing this tree which had been so grossly mishandled by the Department.</P>
    <P>That is a sample of the kind of thing that can happen, but it is not every tree that is fortunate enough to have <Col N="437" /> a Deputy observing every moment of its life.  I have made several efforts in this House and by letter to do something about it.  It is an indication of the way in which the Department are destroying whatever beauty there may be in our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>The Department have three scales for installing telephone lines.  If they are installing new lines in a highly-rated suburb in which wealthy, influential people live&mdash;they might be either civil servants or substantial people known to a Minister or in a position to contact Ministers&mdash;they will get first-grade treatment.  If any disruption of the pathways, the roadways or of the other amenties is necessary, the clearest possible instructions go out to the workmen to see that all amenities are restored with maximum speed.  If it appears to be a suburb with only medium valuations, such as the modest area in which I live, then the men are told they need not be too particular, and they are not, unless duress is brought to bear.</P>
    <P>If it happens to be a poor area, such as a local authority housing estate, the men go in and dig manholes and never take care that the area is properly restored.  That is the official, deliberate policy of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which, of course, I expect the Minister vehemently to deny.</P>

      <P>If it happens to be an area of high valuations, then proper manhole covers will be installed, but if it is another kind of area, they will put all kinds of electrical and engineering works under the soil, and if they cover the excavation with as much as an inch of clay and get away with it without anybody noticing, that is good enough.  That happens all over the place.  Of course, it will be many months before people discover why their grass is not growing on this inch or two of clay.  It is simply because there is an iron cover immediately below the surface.  If people are not in a wealthy area, an inadequate manhole cover&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised here another matter in which the Minister has also denied discrimination.  Yet, <Col N="439" /> from my own experience and the experience of those to whom I send letters, there is discrimination.  If letters are posted in the centre of Dublin for the first morning post, they should be delivered in the Dublin suburbs in the afternoon.  They will probably be delivered, in my constituency, in Rathgar, Rathmines and Terenure, but they will not be delivered until the following morning in Crumlin, Drimnagh, Inchicore, Walkinstown and Ballyfermot.  The areas in which they are not delivered until the following day are areas in which working people live because, by definition, they must be working people in order to be housed in houses built for members of the working classes under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts. In the other areas, the people are people of means and people, therefore, whose complaints will be listened to, so, again, we have yet another indication of class distinction in the operations of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>I want to complain also about the increasing congestion in the Dublin area, congestion which I find it difficult to understand in view of the Minister's figures which show there are 30,470 lines in exchanges not in use because they have not been allocated. Complaints are made here repeatedly about the frequently occurring instances in which, on dialling the first, second, third or fourth digit in five and six number figures in the Dublin area, people get the engaged tone.  That is happening with greater and greater frequency.  It is either due to the fact that the equipment is breaking down at a faster rate, indicating that it needs replacement, or that the equipment is not being properly maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another occurrence which appears to be on the increase is the crossing of lines.  You lift your telephone receiver and, without dialling a number at all, you find yourself in on someone else's conversation; or, on dialling a few digits, you find yourself listening in to another person's conversation.  I can sympathise with those who have been very properly complaining about the <Col N="440" /> tapping of telephones, but I am quite certain that the number of cases of tapping under warrant of the Minister for Justice are negligible as compared with the hundreds and thousands of overheard telephone conversations, which occur daily without any warning, and which, in some cases, could be a cause of very grave and serious embarrassment.</P>
    <P>We have also had complaints here in recent years that telephone bills are far in excess of any cost that could possibly have been incurred and we have had the Department refuting this and denying it most emphatically.  We have had the Department disconnecting telephones because people who maintained they were being over-charged refused to pay bills.  Their telephone connection was cut off and, after several years of acrimonious discussion between the Minister, the agents of his Department and the people in question, we have had admissions here that in one exchange at least in Dublin the meters had been jumping and people who made no calls at all had calls recorded because those with numbers somewhat similar, when they used their phones, caused vibration throughout the whole meter system in different exchanges.  These are the cases we know of.  How many other cases have occurred in which there has been improper charging, cases in which faulty equipment recorded charges against innocent people?  I am sure the number must be legion.</P>
    <P>There is another case &mdash; it was brought to light here&mdash;in another part of the city.  A person went away on vacation and, before going away, he tied up his telephone and sealed it in the presence of a number of neighbours. On coming back after a three months' absence, there was a telephone account waiting for him covering the period during which the phone had been tied up and sealed.  The person concerned asked for an inspector from the Department to come out.  He made an appointment and got the other witnesses. The inspector, with the witnesses present, was shown the phone and, only because these people testified to the fact that the seals were unbroken, did the Department admit that <Col N="441" /> there had been another mistake and apparently another case of faulty meters recording calls which had, in fact, never been made.</P>
    <P>These incidents are frightening and I do not think it is sufficient for the Minister to say that the complaints are so few in number notice need not be taken of them.  Most people, when they get the engaged tone on dialling, leave it at that.  They may wait for some time or they may give up in desperation. The number that have come my way and the way of other Deputies indicates there is something seriously wrong with the telephone equipment in Dublin.  The Minister and his Department should tackle this matter forthwith.  If it is that they are short-staffed in the Engineering Branch and cannot get the engineers, we will accept that they must pay salaries sufficient to attract and keep the engineers.  We do not think, however, that it is necessary to increase postal charges in order to carry that extra salary because, if we had the engineers, we could ensure that the telephone system is adequately used and the equipment already there made available to the thousands of applicants who are at the moment crying out for that amenity.</P>
    <P>Another example of the inefficiency of the Department came to light some time ago.  An individual paid a telephone account at a local post office within the period specified in the notice from the Department.  Admittedly, it was the second notice, but it was within the seven days specified. Despite payment of the account, five or six days later the telephone was cut off for outgoing calls.  The individual concerned complained.  Only after a couple of weeks of acrimonious correspondence did the Department admit there had apparently been some breakdown between the handing in of the money at the local post office and the receipt of the money in the telephone accounts department.  This may be only one case and the Minister's alibi will be that hundreds of thousands of accounts go through every year without difficulty, but it seems unpardonable that a person's phone should be disconnected because of the failure to <Col N="442" /> transmit the money from the local post office to the accounts branch of the GPO.</P>
    <P>Another sample of inefficiency in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is the large number of letters which go astray.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to state as a definite provable fact that the Minister for Justice, in authorising warrants for the tapping of telephones of private citizens, acted without legal authority, has abrogated the Constitution, has invaded the privacy of the home which is the citizen's most precious possession and, in short, has affronted the ordinary decencies which make life possible.</P>
      <P>Early this morning I gave notice of my intention to raise this vital matter which concerns the essential liberty of the citizen, the right of the citizen to conduct his conversations, whether they relate to social or business matters, in the strictest secrecy, a right which is guaranteed to him by the Constitution and which has been taken from him, in effect, by the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the day I asked a question of the Minister as to where he got his authority for this reprehensible act of tapping private telephones and his reply is interesting inasmuch as it is an obvious effort to put <Col N="443" /> a face on something which does not bear examination at all.  The reply given today has no relevance to telephone tapping whatsoever.  I asked the Minister by what legal authority he was empowered to authorise the tapping of telephones and he said:</P>
    <P>I would refer the Deputy to section 56 of the Post Office Act, 1908, as to which an Adaptation Order was made by the President of the Executive Council on 19th July, 1926, under subsection (2) of section 11 of the adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922, determining that the Minister for Justice is the appropriate Minister to exercise this function of issuing postal warrants.</P>
    <P>Postal warrants, and if you go down through the rest of the reply you will find no reference whatever to the practice of the tapping of telephones. Let us examine what this reply actually means.  I have gone to the part of this House where these statutes are to be found.  I have here the British Act upon which the Minister bases his alleged authority, a nonexistent right, the Public General Acts, Edward VII, 1908.  The Minister referred me to section 56 of the Post Office Act, 1908, and I take it that subsection (2) of section 56 is the one which he claims is relevant.  The subsection reads:</P>
    <P>Provided that nothing in this section shall extend to the opening, detaining, or delaying of a postal packet, returned for want of a true direction, or returned by reason that the person to whom the same is directed is dead or cannot be found, or shall have refused the same, or shall have refused or neglected to pay the postage thereof, or to the opening or detaining or delaying of a postal packet under the authority of this Act or in obedience to an express warrant in writing made under the hand of a Secretary of State: Provided that the warrant in Scotland may be either under the hand of a Secretary of State ... in Ireland shall be under the hand and seal of the Lord Lieutenant....</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> Postal packets, not one word of telephones. Let us have a look at the definitions.  The definition of a postal packet is to be found on page 227 of this volume which contains the Post Office Act of 1908.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;postal packet&rdquo; means a letter, post card, newspaper, book packet, pattern or sample packet, or parcel and every packet or article transmissible by post, and includes a telegram.</P>
    <P>That is all.  It is on this the Minister bases his reply of today, in other words, a patent and obvious admission that there is no legal power whatever to enable him to do this thing which he has admitted doing in what he claims to have been the pursuit of those allegedly responsible for or suspected of being guilty of what he himself apparently has the right to define as serious crime.  Article 40 of section 5 of the Constitution states specifically that the dwelling of every citizen is inviolable.  I take it that must mean that no person, no authority, has the right to invade the privacy of any man's home.  But the Minister has, on his own admission, done so by tapping telephones which, we take it at any rate, lead to private homes.</P>
    <P>In the course of a question asked last week by Deputy Barrett of Cork, I made inquiry of the Minister about this business because I could not really believe that it was going on.  I sought his affirmation that it was.  He did so affirm, but he added a remark which he did not repeat today and which betrayed an extraordinary attitude of mind towards the rights of the citizen. He said: &ldquo;An innocent person has nothing to fear.&rdquo; That, to my mind, is a spurious dictum used in an attempt to justify a palpable wrong.  Who is to decide who is an innocent person? Have we not machinery established over the years, namely, the courts of law and justice, to determine who are innocent and who are guilty people? Is it not an impertinence on the part of anybody to assume to himself the right to determine who is an innocent person and who is a guilty one?  Only the courts have that right.</P>
    <P>Suppose for a moment we accept this spurious idea, that there does <Col N="445" /> reside some right in any quarter of Government to eavesdrop on conversations between citizens because someone suspects they are guilty of something. Suppose we accept that, where will it end?  Does it not follow that you must winnow the whole population and listen in on every subscriber in the country in order to determine who is innocent and who is guilty? Is not that the logical end to this kind of invasion of rights?</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the principle of the liberty of the citizen in this matter.  I do not think any Minister of State should have the right to do this. I do not think the people of this country would consciously invest any Minister of State with that right.  I think they are just as indignant about it as I am, and as any ordinary person would be.  Consider the possible abuses inherent in it.  Consider for a moment a situation arising where we had holding the high office of Minister for Justice a person of little or no scruples.  Such a thing is not impossible. A democratic system very often produces rather peculiar end results.  Such a thing is not inconceivable.</P>
    <P>Imagine for a moment just how this power could be used if such a person held that office.  Where would his phone tapping activities end?  In defence of his activities, the Minister has said it is done only in the detection of serious crime.  What is serious crime?  Who defines serious crime?  Is it not possible that if such a person as I have described were in office, he could easily regard his political opponents' valid opposition as serious crime? In fact, have we not seen stride across the stage of Irish politics and history such people who were so intolerant of the views of their opponents that in their hearts they thought their opponents were criminals?  Such people were not loath&mdash;or a bit behind the door&mdash; so to describe them even when it was obvious that those descriptions were totally unjustified.</P>
    <P>These days the papers are full of discussions on this problem in many countries.  I recall reading that the Supreme Court of America decided that evidence taken by this undesirable and deplorable method was not admissible <Col N="446" /> in a court of law.  From what we have observed of the American courts of law, even at this remove, one would have thought that practically anything was possible, in some of them anyway. Even there they will not accept this kind of evidence.</P>

      <P>I was talking about the American courts, but I should have imagined we would have a higher standard in certain respects than some levels of American jurisprudence.</P>
      <P>Today we read about the West German Government being highly concerned about the continuation of this practice which arose during the occupation, and was justified by reference to the unsettled conditions which obtained in Europe.  In Finland and Sweden it has raised a storm of controversy, a storm of protest from the ordinary people who feel threatened by it, as they should.  Everywhere men cherish the principle of liberty it has been looked upon as a most undesirable thing and a grave and positive danger and threat, no matter how carefully exercised, and no matter how carefully operated, to the liberty and privacy of the citizen.</P>
      <P>I read in the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> of 19th April, 1964:</P>
      <P>I understand that a special room in the trunk telephone headquarters at Crown Alley has been allocated for this work, now a regular task for the detective force.  The central Dublin exchanges have also made regular arrangements for listening-in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> I do not know whether the Minister is aware&mdash;but I am&mdash;that there is abroad in this country, and certainly in the city, a widespread conviction that there is large-scale telephone tapping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says it is not true.  The best thing the Minister could do is divest himself of this power which he does not rightly have, which he has assumed.  Perhaps it may be said that it was assumed by others who went before him.  I am not concerned with that.  The first time it was brought vividly to my notice was when this particular question was brought up in the House. I did not think that in this country of ours, where we are trying to fashion forms of democracy suitable to our own people, there could be what I can only describe as &ldquo;flyboy gim-mickry&rdquo; operated in the background, unseen and unknown to the population.</P>
      <P>I now call for a stop&mdash;a complete stop&mdash;to this, because whatever alleged benefits the Minister may argue flows from it, they are microscopic compared with the damage and danger caused by the abrogation of the principle of privacy as between citizens in conversation, whether by telephone or otherwise.</P>

      <P>This business of telephone tapping seems to me to be the parliamentary equivalent of the Loch Ness monster in journalism.  It rears its ugly head any time there is a political doldrum to be filled.  It undulates on the surface for a moment or two, and then disappears into the depths, until some politician feels it incumbent upon him to haul it up again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This experience is not peculiar to this country.  Deputies will have seen that the matter has been raised in Germany recently, and in Norway; and in Britain, also, it seems to arise from time to time.  Indeed, I am told also that apparently not wishing to be out-done in the scramble for publicity, one of those pseudo-liberals, who seem to regard Telefís Éireann as nothing more <Col N="448" /> than a medium through which they may inflict their half-baked views on the rest of us, sought to air his views about it, and of course gave a distorted picture in the process of doing so.</P>
    <P>I wish the Labour Party and all those fringe elements would make up their minds and let me know clearly where they stand in matters of this sort.  One day they pretend to be enormously perturbed at lawlessness, vice, unsolved crimes, and so on.  They berate me and the Garda Síochána for not doing better in stamping out this or that particular evil.  Then, as soon as we take positive action in one direction or another to deal with any given situation, they suddenly discover that they have the most tender consciences and they weep for the poor unfortunate criminal on whom the Gardaí are using unfair practices and devices in order to apprehend him.</P>

It is only where the Garda Síochána, as a responsible institution in this country, are satisfied that a person is actually engaged in some serious criminal activity that this question arises at all.</P>
      <P>I had not the privilege of being a member of this House when Deputy Seán Dunne's colleague, Deputy Everett, was Minister for Justice or, indeed, when he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the other Department vitally concerned in this matter.

      <P>Deputy Corish, who was actually a Cabinet colleague of Deputy Everett, talked here last week about Gestapo methods.  Did he ever find time, I wonder, to talk to his Cabinet colleague about this practice and to persuade him how reprehensible it was&mdash;or was he so gloriously innocent and unaware of the fact that it was taking place?  I want to say that there is no such thing in this country&mdash;and I am happy to be able to say it in defence of my predecessors in office of all Parties&mdash;as widespread or indiscriminate interception of telephone conversations.  This device is resorted to only in cases where either subversive organisations or organised criminal conspiracies are involved and where the information concerned can be shown to be obtainable in no other way.</P>
      <P>I know that many innocent people from time to time imagine that their telephones are tapped because they hear all sorts of clicking noises or background noises of one sort or another.  These background noises exist in every telephone system in the world.  Indeed, I am sure they are responsible for a great deal of the misapprehension there is about this particular matter.  They are due, I am told, to a variety of causes&mdash;faults in switchboards, faults in junction boxes, faults in cables, close proximity to high voltage equipment, vibrations in buildings caused by traffic and the temporary dislocation of lines for one reason or another.</P>
      <P>The Post Office engineers say that all that can be hoped for at any time in any system is that the subscriber will have a reasonably clear line.  So, for Heaven's sake, let me say to Deputies that the next time they hear one of these background noises they should not imagine that somebody from the Department of Justice is listening to their every word.  It is probably, I suggest, due to nothing more sinister than that some unfortunate earwig has come to an untimely end in a junction box.</P>

      <P>The interests of the general public and their fundamental right to privacy are fully safeguarded in this matter.  No telephone conversation can be intercepted except under the authority of a warrant signed and sealed by the Minister for Justice and these warrants can be issued only in a very limited category of cases&mdash;the types of cases I have outlined, namely, serious criminal activities or the activities of subversive organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy when he was speaking.  I shall also deal with that.  I want to make this point to the House.  The Minister for Justice cannot initiate this procedure.  He cannot, in regard to any telephone, start the process.  He can act only when a written request comes to him from the responsible authority and when he is satisfied and when his Departmental advisers are satisfied that the information concerned can be obtained in no other way. Therefore, there is no question at any stage&mdash;as the Deputy tried to suggest &mdash;of some unscrupulous Minister for Justice abusing this power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the House that the very limited number of warrants issued in the limited category of cases is regularly and at short intervals reviewed by me as Minister for Justice and the necessity for their continuance in operation must be justified to me.  I am continually reviewing the list and striking off any for which there is no justification.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner and the Garda Síochána carry an enormous responsibility. Day in and day out the Commissioner and the Force are responsible for the safety and security of this State and for the protection of the lives and property of all of us.  This is a task from which there is no respite.  Every day, there is some new development, some new menace to be met.  We must, as a Parliament and as a Government, within the limits of democratic freedom, give them every assistance possible to carry out their task and discharge their responsibility to the community.  They do not wish, nor would this Government permit them, to interfere with the liberty of any individual or hinder him from going about his lawful affairs as a free citizen.  On the other hand, we are not prepared to frustrate them in their fight against organised crime or to deny them the use of this perfectly legitimate device in that fight &mdash; a device which is permitted in every other country of the world that I know of, many of which are just as passionately devoted to individual liberty and democratic freedom as we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> I want to quote from <i>The Irish Law Times</i> of 6th December, 1958.  It says:</P>
    <P>The fact that private armies, fifth columnists and other underground subversive associations can and do exist&mdash;and indeed flourish&mdash;in the modern State, makes it imperative for the State to take all necessary steps for its own protection.  To grant immunity, or almost complete immunity, from interception of messages must have the effect of opening wide the door to danger and invite disaster by exposing the State&mdash;and, indeed, other States also&mdash;together with the inhabitants to whatever villainy conspirators choose to design.</P>
    <P>The opening of letters and the overhearing of telephone conversations seem to be an absurdly trifiingly small price to pay for the continued peace and welfare of the nation and Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the British Government appointed a Committee of Privy Councillors to inquire into this matter. That Committee had no hesitation whatever in recommending the retention of this power.  I quote the various conclusions and recommendations. Paragraph 158 reads:</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that interception has proved effective in the detection of major crimes, customs frauds and dangers to the security of the State.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 165 states:</P>
    <P>It would be against the public interest for the Secretary of State to give figures of the extent of the interception in communications, for the reasons set out.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 168 states:</P>
    <P>We recommend that the powers of interception should continue to be used subject to the conditions and safeguards we have set out in Part III and in this summary of conclusions, but that there should be no extension beyond those we have so carefully defined.</P>
    <P>That Committee, I suggest, of Privy Councillors in Great Britain was just <Col N="453" /> as concerned with the liberty of the individual and the democratic rights of the citizen as Deputy S. Dunne.</P>
    <P>I want to give this House a most solemn assurance, as Minister for Justice, that this practice is resorted to only where the Garda are satisfied beyond any shadow of doubt that the persons concerned are actually involved in or about to engage in serious crime and that the information they require about that crime can be obtained in no other way.  The telephone system, after all, is a service provided by the State for the people.  I want to ask Deputies if they think it is right that these people should be able to use it freely and without hindrance in furtherance of their criminal activities.</P>
