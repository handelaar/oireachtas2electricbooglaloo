      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In pages 9 and 10, to delete subsection (1) of section 10 and to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) (a)  Every claim of a complete specification shall have effect from the date provided for by this section in relation to that claim and in this Act a reference to a priority date is, unless the context otherwise requires, a reference to such date.</P>

    <P>(b)  A patent shall not be invalidated by reason only of the <Col N="778" /> publication or use of the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification, on or after the priority date of that claim, or by the grant of another patent upon a specification claiming the same invention in a claim of the same or later priority date.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 29, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f)  that a condition which by virtue of section 54 of this Act is null and void has been inserted in a contract made after the commencement of this Act in relation to the sale or lease of, or licence to use or work, any article or process protected by the patent:&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Quite recently, there was a Supreme Court judgment which reversed a decision by the Controller as affirmed by a judge of the High Court.  The decision of the Supreme Court was based, in the main, on technical grounds and did not go to the merits of the application that was made before the Controller on which he decided and which decision was affirmed by a judge of the High Court.  The purpose of this amendment now is to cure a defect in the law as it stands.  I may explain what the defect is by an example: A person in another country, as happened in this case, owns a patent and licenses the use in this country and imposes in the deed a condition that other forms of objects cannot be used by the licensee of that patent.  Under existing law, that condition is null and void.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may go further and mention the particular case.  The patent was a method of sealing jam jars.  The patent in this respect was assigned to users in this country, with a condition that no other forms of jam jar seal be <Col N="779" /> used.  That was regarded as an abuse of monopoly.  A small firm making alternative jam jar sealing devices in this country objected to the condition in the licence as being an abuse of monopoly.  Our law already provides that such condition is a nullity.  Therefore, the Controller decided that the licensee should be entitled to use other forms of jam jar sealing devices. When it got as far as the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court decided that since such a condition was a nullity, nothing flowed from it; therefore, there was nothing before the Supreme Court to decide was an abuse of the monopoly.</P>
    <P>We propose now, Sir, to insert in section 39 a new provision to the effect that if such a condition is imposed which, by virtue of section 54 is a nullity, that condition is an abuse of monopoly and may be treated accordingly. I hope I have made the position clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It will have no effect on that decision as such, except, of course, it will give the small manufacturer here the right to have his patent or his device used against the big monopoly from another country. The amendment will come into effect, of course, after the commencement of this Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 43, to delete lines 51 to 54, and to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( )  Any appeal from the Controller under this Act shall be to the Court and shall be heard by one judge of the Court and the President of the High Court shall from time to time make arrangements for securing that all appeals under this section shall, so far as practicable, be heard by the same judge.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>During the Committee Stage discussion, I proposed that an appeal from the Controller to the High Court should be taken by a nominated judge of the High Court who would, to all intents and purposes, act in much the same way as the Appeals Tribunal in Britain does for that purpose.  Therefore, he would be to an extent an ordinary judge of the High Court but my proposal was that he would have special status in relation to these patent appeals.  I have now been advised that there is doubt that my proposal would be constitutional and, therefore, I am asking the House to adopt this amendment which does not purport in any way to change the status of the High Court judge when he hears patent appeals.  I am also asking that the President of the High Court will make arrangements for the hearing of these appeals by the same judge as far as will be practicable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is; it is a matter of administration.  Patent law is a special branch of law and it is desirable that a particular judge should be nominated to deal with these matters as far as is possible.  Any judge can hear the appeal but the purpose of the amendment now is that while the appeal may be taken by any judge there is a desire expressed in the subsection that it will be the same judge as far as practicable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 44, to delete lines 3 to 6.</P>
      <P>This is the principal amendment. In section 75 of the Bill as passed through Committee, there is subsection (4) which, in effect, gives the right of audience before a judge of the High Court to a patent agent. The patent agent in that respect would be in a representative capacity.  There is, and always has been, a principle in law that any person has the right of audience before any court in the land but if that person is to be represented in court the practice is that he be represented by counsel.  When I originally sought to give the right to a patent agent, objection was taken to that course.  The amendment ensures that a patent agent will still have the right of audience as a principal, but if he purports to represent another person, he will not have the right of audience.  In this amendment I am reverting to the <i>status quo.</i></P>

      <P>When introducing the Bill, I informed the House that this was the last stage in bringing our law on commercial property up to date.  I find now that there is another outstanding <Col N="783" /> aspect of the existing law that will require to be brought up to date. Last year, the new Acts in relation to trade marks and copyright were passed.  The Act in relation to trade marks came into operation on 1st April and I hope soon to be able to announce a date for the coming into operation of the new Copyright Act. Then we will have to deal with the question of industrial design.  This aspect of the law is at present contained in Part III of the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act. My proposals for bringing this part of the law up to date will be put forward as soon as possible but I should be glad to receive representations from persons interested on the changes necessary to suit our modern conditions.</P>

      <P>The necessity for this motion arises from the fact that amendments Nos. 5 and 6 to the Bill introduce new matters which are not related to any provisions of the Bill as it went through the Second Stage.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 2, line 14 to delete &ldquo;is hereby repealed&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall be repealed on the date of coming into operation of this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move this on behalf of Deputy McGilligan.  If the Minister is agreeable, I suggest we discuss this and amendment No. 2 together for the purpose of bringing out the same point. The Minister will recall that on Second Reading I expressed opposition to the section on the basis that it was designed to reverse a decision taken in 1953 with regard to the number of circuit court judges and that this Bill was designed, in effect, to increase the number of circuit court judges at a time when it was stated Government policy to take away from the courts a large volume of the work done by the circuit court &mdash; work in relation to workmen's compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the suggestion then that it might be more prudent in present circumstances for the Government to put their policy in relation to workmen's compensation into effect and see what <Col N="785" /> the result was in so far as the volume of work in the circuit court was concerned before taking the step of increasing the number of judges.  If the stated policy of the Government in relation to workmen's compensation is put into effect, obviously there will be a reduction in the volume of work to be handled by the circuit court bench. Since then&mdash;I do not know whether this is settled Government policy or not&mdash; it was announced in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 29th February last that there was also a move to take away from the circuit court the matter of malicious injuries. It is reported in that newspaper that a comprehensive change in the law relating to malicious damage claims is to be made soon on the lines of recommendations made by an inter-Departmental Committee set up two years ago.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to forecast that instead of the malicious injuries code as we know it at the moment, there will be a change which apparently envisages some type of compulsory insurance cover rather than that applicants who suffer loss through malicious damage should be required, as they are now, to make application to the courts and, if there is no agreement, to have the matter dealt with entirely by the courts.  Of course, that is simply the newspaper report.  I do not know whether there has been any Government announcement.  If that report is correct, it will diminish very considerably the volume of work dealt with in the circuit court.</P>
    <P>I propose to refer briefly to some figures given by the Minister in relation to circuit court sittings and in relation to the volume of work done by the circuit court throughout the country in respect of the different types of cases coming before them.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan addressed a question to the Minister on 6th February last in relation to the number of days sittings required to deal with the volume of circuit court work arising in Dublin and asking the Minister to indicate in regard to such work, in each of the years 1960 to 1963, the number of cases which arose under road traffic, workmen's compensation and malicious damage headings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> According to the Minister, in 1960, the total number of sitting days was 436. The number of Road Traffic Act offences by way of appeals amounted to 195; the number of Workmen's Compensation Acts claims was 156; and there were 761 malicious injury claims.  In 1961, there were three Road Traffic Act cases on indictment, 259 appeals from the district court, 189 workmen's compensation cases and 596 malicious injury claims.</P>
    <P>The same picture is shown for the remaining two years 1962 and 1963. There was an increase in both years in the number of sitting days.  In 1962, the figure was 465 and in 1963, 464. In the year 1963, there were as many as 918 malicious injury claims and 156 workmen's compensation claims.  In the preceding year, 196 workmen's compensation claims were dealt with in the circuit court in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It seems quite clear from these figures that as far as the Dublin circuit courts are concerned, there is a very large volume of both workmen's compensation and malicious injury cases. If either one or the other were taken from the courts, clearly it must relieve pressure on the courts.  If both were taken away, it must have a very considerable effect on the volume of work which the judges are required to do.</P>
    <P>I referred to the fact that in the Minister's figures there is an increase in the number of sitting days, and it is necessary for us, I think, to understand that when one talks of the number of sitting days in relation to court work, it means the number of sittings which are held by the total number of judges.  In other words, if one were to get the average number of days on which the courts sat, it would be necessary to divide the figure which the Minister has given by the number of judges sitting.</P>
    <P>On 3rd December last, Deputy R. Barry asked for the number of days on which individual judges sat. I think I am interpreting the Minister's reply correctly when I say that the greatest number of days any judge in the circuit court and anywhere in Ireland sat in the three years covered, 1961, 1962 and 1963, was 191.  The number varied.  The least number of <Col N="787" /> sitting days mentioned in the answer is 83.  The maximum is 191.  I am not making any particular point about the least number of days on which a judge sat because the explanation may very well be that he was appointed somewhere during the period covered by the question and, accordingly, the number of days he sat may be well up on the average.</P>
    <P>The point I really want to make is that the maximum number of days any circuit court judge sat anywhere in the Republic in the three years, 1961, 1962, and 1963, was 191.  There are 365 days in the year.  If we take out the Sundays, we are left with 313. The courts, with the exception of some of the district courts, work a five-day week.  Consequently, if you take out the Saturdays as well, you are left with 261 days on which the courts might sit.  If you are generous, and allow 61 days in the year for holidays, that leaves 200 days on which it would not be unreasonable to expect the courts to sit.  There is no single circuit court in the country which has come up to even the 200 days in any of these three years.</P>
    <P>It is also relevant, I think, in considering this matter to remember that the court sittings we are talking about &mdash;again, I am leaving out the district court, because they sit longer hours&mdash; are the circuit court sittings.  The circuit court normally sits for only four hours in the day.  It starts at 11 a. m.; there is a break for lunch of three-quarters of an hour, or so, and the court resumes at 2 p.m. or a quarter to two, and sits until 4 p.m.  These sitting hours were fixed, I suggest, in more leisurely days and for more leisurely times.  While I fully appreciate the mental strain a member of the judiciary must undergo, because of the fact that he must concentrate so very assiduously on the cases coming before him if he is to do his job properly, and the mental fatigue associated with that kind of intensive concentration, nevertheless it does seem to me that the proper remedy here lies not in increasing the number of judges in this small and comparatively <Col N="788" /> poor country and poor community but rather in asking the judges to sit half an hour earlier in the morning and half an hour later in the evening. If the judges were prepared to do that, coupled with the taking away of the volume of work it is proposed to remove from the circuit courts, I think any overcrowding of circuit court lists would be solved in no time at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan's amendments are designed, first, not to repeal <i>instanter</i> section 16 of the 1961 Act but, rather, to state that it shall be repealed on the coming into operation of this section.  Secondly, he suggests that a new section be added providing that the section will not come into operation earlier than 1st April, 1966, and that the actual date of the coming into operation might be fixed by Government Order.  The purpose of the suggestion is, as I stated, to enable the Minister, the Government and the Dáil to see how the proposals in relation to the taking away of workmen's compensation cases from the circuit court will affect the situation and what effect it will have on the work in the circuit court.  I think it is a sensible suggestion.  It is one I recommend to the Minister.</P>
    <P>In relation to sitting days, and the problem we are considering at the moment, we should remember that for a considerable period the Government found it possible to release one circuit court judge for duty abroad from 14th November 1960 to 15th January 1962 to enable him to accept an appointment as President of the High Court in Cyprus.  I do not know to what extent his absence increased the difficulties which, I understand from the Minister, are there at the moment in relation to the overcrowding of the lists in the circuit court, but it is certainly a matter which should be borne in mind before the Government ask the House to increase the number of judges in the circuit court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel Deputy O'Higgins will not be popular with his professional colleagues in Dublin as a result of the attitude he has taken on this proposal because, apart altogether from any examination of this problem <Col N="789" /> carried out departmentally, I am assured by practitioners on both sides of the House that the situation in Dublin is far from satisfactory, even as matters stand.  I mentioned on Second Reading that I had been told the position in Donegal was unworkable and a prominent member of the Fine Gael Party assured me that, whatever I did now, I would in time be convinced that the requirement was two extra judges and not one.  That is the background to this matter as affecting those who practise in the circuit court.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear to the House that we are not, in this instance, really providing an extra judge.  We are only maintaining the <i>status quo.</i> Because of a decision taken in 1953, the situation was that, when Judge Binchy retired, the number of judges available would be reduced by one. What we are doing here now is to go back on the 1953 decision and ensure that instead of a reduction in the number of judges, the number will be retained at ten.  This Bill is not providing for an extra judge at all.  It is only ensuring that we carry on with the same number of circuit court judges as we had up to now.</P>
      <P>When the decision was being taken in 1953 to reduce the number of judges from ten to nine, that decision was very severely criticised by Deputy Sweetman, Deputy T.F. O'Higgins and Deputy D. Costello.  As reported in the Official Report, volume 141, column 958, of the 29th July, 1953, Deputy D. Costello said:</P>
      <P>I am convinced, however, that it is wrong to reduce the number of circuits and the number of circuit court judges just at the time we are increasing the work they have to do.</P>
      <P>Again, as reported in the Official Report, Volume 142, column 709, of 27th October, 1953, Deputy Sweetman said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is vitally essential that there should not be a reduction in the number of circuit court judges.  If I may put it this way, there should be a &ldquo;fluid&rdquo; judge who could be sent around as a <Col N="790" /> sort of shock troop to clear up wherever there is an accumulation of work.</P>

      <P>I think the 1953 decision was a mistake and that those who criticised it at the time were right. However, that statement is made with hindsight.  We see that in recent years the number of sitting days in Dublin has been increasing very considerably.</P>
      <P>The figures Deputy O'Higgins quoted are misleading in this respect. He quoted a number of cases that sounded very favourable from the point of view of his argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the Minister's figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but what is important is not the number of cases but the number of sitting days involved. In 1962-63, we had a total of 464 sitting days in Dublin.  Of those, only the equivalent of 16 actual sitting days were taken up with workmen's compensation cases, and the equivalent of 12 sitting days with malicious injury cases.  So those two aspects of circuit court work do not take up anything like the amount of time one <Col N="791" /> would imagine as a result of listening to the figures quoted of the number of cases.  It is the sitting days that matter in this context, and not the number of cases.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to look into the future and say: &ldquo;When this happens and that happens, there will be no necessity for two judges in Dublin, and so on&rdquo;, but I have to deal with the situation as I find it now.  In present circumstances, something must be done.  There is a certain amount of delay in the circuit court and a certain amount of time-lag, and if we had not restored the position to ten judges when Judge Binchy retired, very serious delays would have arisen.  We now have ten judges acting &mdash; one has a temporary appointment&mdash;and they are all fully occupied, so it is impossible to contemplate the removal of one, unless we are prepared to let the work of the circuit courts get into a very serious and unsatisfactory position.</P>
      <P>Admittedly, the Government have announced their intention of making comprehensive changes in the workmen's compensation code, and no decision has yet been announced on the question of malicious damage to property.  In the very nature of things, it will be some considerable time before any change of a comprehensive nature can be made either in the workmen's compensation code or in regard to malicious damage to property.  If it transpires ultimately, when these changes are made, that the full services of ten judges are not required for the circuit courts, we can always deal with the situation on the next retirement which will arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, it is no good at this stage speculating on what will happen in the circuit courts, if and when these changes are made.  On Second Reading, Deputy S. Collins offered to have a wager with me that the number of common law cases in the circuit courts would treble as a result of the proposed changes which the Government are about to make in workmen's compensation. That may or may not be. I do not know.  I cannot speculate on what may or may not happen.  The reality which we must face is that the <Col N="792" /> problem is there now and requires to be dealt with, and this is the only way of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>My answer to Deputy O'Higgins's argument is that if it transpires in the future that we can carry on with eight or nine judges, that is another day's work.  We can deal with it whenever the first retirement comes about. Deputies know there are retirements from circuit courts all the time arising in the normal way, and we can always revise the arrangements on the occasion of a retirement.  It is necessary to do this now from the point of view of my Department and, I am assured, from the point of view of the profession &mdash;and members of the profession in Deputy O'Higgins's Party &mdash; it is essential that it should be done.  Indeed, some practitioners would urge me to go further and appoint two judges, and to have 11 judges rather than ten at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister answer a question with which he has not dealt?  Have the Minister and the Government given any consideration to the question of asking the circuit court judges to extend their daily sitting hours?  Judges work a four-hour day for five days.  That is a 20-hour week, so far as sittings are concerned.  As I have already said, I appreciate the strain because of the particular nature of the work, and I appreciate that very often they have to do their homework the same as anyone else, but to the ordinary person a 20-hour week seems very short.</P>
      <P>This situation would be resolved, and this problem would be solved, if the Minister could persuade the judges to sit for one additional hour each day &mdash;half an hour earlier in the morning and half an hour later in the evening. That would mean an additional five hours each week for each judge.  The Minister would solve the problem if he would do that.  I know that even for members of my own profession there is a certain convenience in having the court sitting at 11 o'clock rather than earlier, and finishing at 4 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two arguments in favour of that, from the point of view of a person in my profession.  Take, first, <Col N="793" /> a solicitor.  When the court sitting starts at 11 o'clock only, it is possible for solicitors to arrange consultations with counsel on the morning of a court hearing and to have their witnesses down in the Four Courts or in the circuit court in country circuits on the morning of the hearing.  Also, if a solicitor is engaged in a court case which will take the entire day it is a certain convenience to him to know that he will be in his office at least until 10.30 or 11 in the morning and that he can count on getting back to his office at 4.15 or 4.30 in the afternoon.</P>
    <P>The general good should be considered. I think solicitors would adapt themselves to earlier and later sittings by the courts very easily; I remember the change that has come over the legal profession in this city even over the past 10 or 15 years.  Deputy Colley will probably agree with me in this.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, it was quite normal to see even busy solicitors arriving at their offices at 10 or 10.30 in the morning.  That is all changed.  It has changed greatly because of the gradual introduction of the 5-day week into solicitors' offices.  I think the Minister will find that a great number of solicitors are now on duty before 9.30 in the morning.  That change has come as far as one branch of the legal profession is concerned. We talk about &ldquo;the wind of change&rdquo;, and so on.  I think we must face up to the fact that, as far as court sittings are concerned, the present hours are completely outdated.  They were fixed in the time when it was a question of the pony and buggy bringing both the judges and the witnesses to court.  The Minister should give serious attention to the question of extending the hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am all for increased productivity and for everybody working harder and achieving the objects set out in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> I am afraid this is not an area in which we can do very much.  First of all, the position in Dublin is that circuit court judges as a rule work a 5-day week.  Down the country, the normal thing is a 4-day week but then there is a great deal of <Col N="794" /> travelling to be done by circuit court judges.  On the question of hours, of course, I think if I were to attempt to do what Deputy O'Higgins suggests we would have a revolution on our hands from the legal profession, apart altogether from the reaction of the judges. The only thing I can say is that Deputy O'Higgins personally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;must have a very large and lucrative sort of practice which never involves him in getting involved in the hurly-burly of the courts.  To suggest that we should lengthen the court hours is completely unreal.  Deputy Sweetman, in this famous debate in 1953 to which I have already referred, dealt with this particular point&mdash;the suggestion that court hours be lengthened.  At that time Deputy Sweetman said:</P>
      <P>The Minister is not a legal gentleman, but will he agree that when we sit here at half-past ten in the morning and continue sitting until four or five in the afternoon, it is a most tiring thing for the Minister in charge of a Bill?  Is not that a fair analogy with a judge's work?</P>
      <P>That quotation is taken from column 687 of volume 142 of the Official Report.</P>
      <P>He proceeded to talk about what happens when the circuit court goes to Mayo.  As reported at column 683 of the same volume of the Official Report of 27th October, 1953, Deputy Sweetman said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it comes to the circuit court, however, other considerations arise. Mayo has been mentioned, and in Mayo people from Achill have to travel to Ballina to the circuit court. A 10 o'clock sitting would mean that they would have to come the night before because what invariably happens in the country&mdash;and I think Deputy Cowan will agree&mdash;is that the consultation is held at 10 o'clock before the circuit court sits.  There is never a consultation the night before, and putting back the hours of sitting <Col N="795" /> for the circuit court in the country would merely mean that litigants and witnesses would inevitably have to travel the night before and that would very substantially indeed increase the cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing to a large extent, applies there.  The main argument against extending it is, if you like, the strain on the judge, jurymen and so on.  But, in addition, from the point of view of the legal profession, it is important to them, because when a case finishes in court, they have a lot of tidying up to do.  It is important that they should be able to get back to their offices in the evenings to attend to these administrative matters.  That, of course, applies particulary in the case of a rural solicitor who may be attending a circuit court 40 or 50 miles away from his base.  On the whole, I think it is just not feasible to attempt any change when you take all the various aspects of the matter into consideration.</P>

      <P>I admit that my experience is a little bit in the past now but I had some experience of this matter on circuit and particularly on circuits in Deputy O'Higgins's constituency. I think we are losing sight of the fact also that there is, particularly in country circuits, a certain amount of irregularity of hours and the strain that goes with irregularity of hours, in the work of circuit court judges and district justices.  I have vivid recollections. I could mention practically every town on the eastern circuit where I have seen judges sitting until 10 p.m. <Col N="796" /> but very regularly until 6 and even 7 o'clock in the evenings to keep the work going.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the point I want to make, that there is a great deal of give and take and mutual convenience in the country circuits, anyway.  I have on many occasions seen the court, with the full cooperation of the Bar and the solicitors, sitting until late hours voluntarily in order to get the work done.  I am sure Deputy O'Higgins will agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That elasticity is extremely useful.  I need not elaborate on the reasons why.  If Deputy O'Higgins puts himself in the position either of a client of a country solicitor or a barrister on circuit, he will agree that co-operative elasticity is extremely useful.  The eastern circuit is an extremely busy circuit.  The work there was got through and, in my experience, if a case was carried over, it was because it was not possible because, say, a witness was not available or there was some administrative difficulty rather than that the court was not sitting.  I have never seen a judge refuse to deal with a case that could have been dealt with on the spot and, what is more, I have often heard judges volunteer to come for an extra day if there was pressure on the circuit. I stress that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not lose sight of the fact that in its very nature the work of judges is casual, in the sense that you cannot say that there will be so many cases of so long a duration before the judge on any particular day or in any particular session.  There will be slack periods and there will be periods of pressure.  Therefore, <Col N="797" /> we cannot legislate on the basis of a Civil Service day.  If you attempt to do that, you will lose that, to my mind, very valuable element of elasticity which enables practitioners and judges to do their best for the litigants by adjusting the times.  In my experience, there was never any lack of that.</P>
    <P>I have never heard, in my time on the circuit or in the Bar Library, any serious complaint that could be taken as a general complaint about the judges not coping.  I have heard&mdash;at that time it was common to hear&mdash; in the Dublin circuit that there was too much work in the circuit but I never heard any complaints about either the manner or the willingness of the judges and the court staffs to face up to it.  Whenever there were complaints of that nature among practitioners, it was always fully realised that it was due to the volume and pressure of work and not to any shortcoming on the part of the judges or court staffs.  When one takes that background into consideration, I ask Deputy O'Higgins: is it really in the interest of the point of view he is putting to make the case he is making?</P>
    <P>I have spoken of voluntary co-operation but there is another aspect that should also be considered in the life of the judges.  Judges have very heavy responsibility and they have consciences and most reputable people in the position of judges feel compelled to study and to give reasoned judgments. That entails some burning of the midnight oil and a degree of concentration that can be appreciated only by people who have to sit and adjudicate.  Furthermore, we are conveniently forgetting here that criminal jurisdiction often involves much longer hours than the average.  I have seen cases where the court has been going from 10 o'clock in the morning with the minimum hour break for lunch &mdash;it is always a minimum, as Deputy O'Higgins will probably agree&mdash;until as late as 10 or 11 o'clock at night waiting for juries or to clear juries.</P>
    <P>I have been in such cases myself. These are not so exceptional as to be treated as exceptional.  They occur sufficiently often and involve a court <Col N="798" /> sitting perhaps an hour or more on the average beyond what would appear in the timetable more frequently than people may realise.  In fairness to the judges, I think it would be an inaccurate picture to consider them as merely coming in, punching the hours Deputy O'Higgins has mentioned and then going off.  In country circuits, in any case, judges frequently sit longer and are compelled to do so in criminal cases and sometimes do this to a large extent and overall they have the responsibility of studying and digesting cases.</P>
    <P>It may be, shall I say, mechanical expedition to rush a large number of cases through quickly but remember that the circuit court particularly is there, not to give rough and ready summary justice but to give considered justice to the litigants and ensure an ordered standard of fair play and justice to the community as a whole.  You cannot do that by turning a handle: it can be done only after judicial consideration and that takes time.  The human brain has not got to the speed of the modern electronic calculating machine.  It would be absolutely wrong to attempt any adjustment in the country circuits.  It would be a mistake from the practitioners' point of view and I think it would be overlooking all the factors the Minister mentioned in regard to clients and solicitors and everything else.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the country circuits, I might make one other point. Although the allotted time for a judge in a particular circuit town would be a fortnight, when the pressure of work was such as to require it, I have frequently seen judges volunteering and saying: &ldquo;I can come next week&rdquo; and sitting the whole week and adding it on.  I have seen that happen in such towns as Dundalk and Wicklow.  All over, there is uncertainty even in regard to the amount of crime before a circuit.  The judge who may get white gloves one week may find he has to give a whole week to crime in the following week.  It would be very unwise of us to interfere in regard to country circuits.  The judges and local practitioners are doing a very good job and supplying a social need in the community very effectively.  We can <Col N="799" /> judge its effectiveness by the lack of any serious complaint.</P>
    <P>What about Dublin?  I can appreciate Deputy O'Higgins's points more readily in regard to Dublin.  Again, I am, as Deputy O'Higgins may say, back in the past and perhaps that is so because I have not had experience within the ten years Deputy O'Higgins has referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Higgins will agree with me that although the courts sit at 11 o'clock, it is true that work really starts at 10 o'clock.  It is necessary for the solicitors to be there and they often complain that they had to be there in order to know how things were going and to arrange with barristers and clients, and perhaps the clients could only turn up at that time.  In any case, nobody was in a position to be under way before 11 o'clock and I have seen the barristers coming in, meeting solicitors and clients as early as half-past nine at the Four Courts. There was a minimum break for lunch. I have often seen the Dublin circuit give the extra half hour&mdash;shall I put it this way&mdash;that Deputy O'Higgins is talking of.  I do not really try to read everybody's thoughts or supply everybody's ideas but I think we would be most unwise to undertake legislation in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My criticism about the tendency of all this kind of legislation, although I understand the necessity for it, is that the more prescriptions there are as to what judges will do or will not do, the less can the community have the benefit of their standing and discretion. The more directions there are as to hours and times and whens and wherefores, the more we lose through a mechanical level of adjustment.  A <Col N="800" /> mechanical level of adjustment surely enough is often uniform but it is often a very low level.</P>

      <P>When Deputy O'Higgins suggested to the Minister that it might not be a great strain on anybody to increase the hours of sittings by half an hour at the end of the day, the Minister, with what I think I can only describe as his tongue-in-cheek method, said he was all for increasing output and harder work and seeing that the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was successful. What I cannot understand are the two different applications of mind by the Minister; for the worker, yes, an increased output is essential&mdash;and if the worker is to get an increase, it is of course on the basis that he increases his output&mdash;for the judiciary, a big increase in salaries and a reduction in output.  That is what we are faced with here at a time when there is a substantial increase on the stocks for them in the next fortnight and the Minister comes in and seeks to reduce the amount of work by an extra appointment.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that it would be wrong, particularly in rural areas, to increase the day sitting by half an hour at the end of the day and that he was thinking of juries as one aspect of the problem.  That was the first time I have heard any consideration <Col N="801" /> being expressed for juries in this issue.  If the Minister were really serious about jurymen, he would not just be making a casual comment about them.</P>
      <P>I shall not delay the House except that I want to say that there is an air of unreality in all this as far as the Minister is concerned.  He wants increased output from the worker and a reduced output from the judiciary and one of the reasons he is favouring the judiciary is that he has concern for the jurymen.  Would the Minister do something about that concern for juries who fill such a vital role?  Unfortunate jurymen have to travel 30 miles in my constituency and they have not even got their busfares but must find their own expenses to travel to court, pay for their meals and find sufficient money to pay their way home again.  There are no expenses or consideration for them and the Minister would get far more support from the ordinary citizens for any such measure as this if he said he had the greatest concern for the people who must make the decisions and those people are the jurymen.  I see no sign on the part of the Minister of coming in and saying that.</P>

      <P>It is not quite fair of Deputy McQuillan to say that, because, first of all, in the Capital Punishment Bill which we passed recently, I included a provision which obviates the necessity for locking up juries in murder cases.  That was done as a concession to jurymen in an endeavour to make their very onerous task somewhat less difficult.  I have every sympathy with jurors.  There is probably nothing about which I get more representations daily than in regard to unfortunate businessmen who are called away from their business or work and suffer very considerable inconvenience and hardship.  Indeed as a result of that situation, I have asked the committee which has been established to go into the whole question of court practice and procedure to examine into and to see whether it would be possible to do away with juries altogether in civil cases.  Personally I would favour that, subject to <Col N="802" /> whatever reasoned decisions this committee may come to.  As Deputy McQuillan knows from his knowledge of these matters, if we could dispense with the necessity for juries in civil cases, that would go a long way towards making life much easier for jurymen.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5: <Col N="803" /></P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 6, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3) of this section, where a person (in this section referred to as an accused) charged with an indictable offence is sent forward for trial to the Circuit Court, an application by the Attorney General or the accused to the judge of the Circuit Court before whom the accused is triable to have the trial transferred to the Central Criminal Court shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in case the party making the application, not less than seven days before making it, served notice of his intention to do so on the accused or the Attorney General, as the case may be, be granted, and</P>
      <P>(b)  in any other case, in the discretion of the judge, be either granted or refused, and the decision to grant or refuse the application shall be final and unappealable.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  two or more accused are sent forward for trial to the Circuit Court and it is proposed to try them together, and</P>
      <P>(b)  an application by one or more, but not all, of the accused under subsection (1) of this section is granted.</P>
      <P>an application, without notice to the accused, by the Attorney General to the judge who granted the application aforesaid to have the trial of one or more of the remaining accused transferred to the Central Criminal Court shall be granted.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where there are less than seven days between the date on which an accused is sent forward for trial and the date of the commencement of the trial, an application under subsection (1) of this section in relation to the trial shall be granted.</P>
      <P>(4)  Section 54 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, and subsection (8) of section 34 of the Finance Act, 1963, are hereby repealed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="804" /> Since 1924, an accused person has been entitled, on application, to have his trial transferred from the Circuit Court to the Central Criminal Court, if he is charged with an offence for which the maximum penalty exceeds one year's imprisonment or five years' penal servitude.  This provision was designed to enable an accused person who felt he might not get a fair trial from the local jury to have his trial transferred to the Central Criminal Court which has always sat in Dublin. Under section 34 of the Finance Act, 1963, a similar right was provided in relation to offences under the Customs Acts which by virtue of that particular section, were triable on indictment. The Attorney General has the same right as the accused to have a trial transferred.</P>
    <P>In this new section, I propose that this unrestricted right to have the trial transferred will continue to apply but that it will be subject to the accused on the one hand and the Attorney General on the other, giving seven days' notice of the intention to make the application for the transfer.  Where notice of intention is not given at all, or is not given within the prescribed time, the granting of the application will be at the discretion of the trial judge.  In other words, even if the accused or the Attorney General does not apply within the time limit, he still will not be debarred from getting the transfer.  It will at that stage be at the discretion of the trial judge as to whether or not he will grant it.</P>
    <P>I am making this provision with a view to preventing to some extent what is undoubtedly an abuse of the existing rights, to have these transfers granted automatically on request.  In the past cases have been transferred to the Central Criminal Court for no better reason than to secure an adjournment which had already been properly refused or to suit counsel or simply because the accused wanted to postpone the evil day.  As a result of this, much of the time of the High Court had been needlessly taken up with criminal trials which are really proper to the circuit court.  The necessity for transferring trials to Dublin <Col N="805" /> has diminished since the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, because section 19 of that Act empowered a circuit judge to transfer criminal trials from one place within a circuit to another, if he felt the accused might not get a fair trial in any particular venue.  As regards persons who are chargeable in the Dublin Circuit Court, they have not the excuse that by applying for a transfer they are likely to get a fairer trial, because the jury in the Dublin Circuit Court and in the Central Criminal Court are drawn from the same jury book.</P>
    <P>The amendment has a fairly limited objective in that it will preserve the existing absolute right to have a trial transferred to the Central Criminal Court, subject only to the accused or to the Attorney General, as the case may be, giving seven days' notice before the trial of his intention to apply for a transfer.  If for any reason he neglects to give the notice or if, in the meantime, circumstances arise which make it desirable to apply for a transfer, he can still have the transfer at the discretion of the trial judge, and I am sure we can expect that that discretion will be exercised properly and reasonably by the trial judges in all cases.</P>
    <P>Even though this modification is a very limited one, it will help to prevent much of the present inconvenience and expense to witnesses, jurors and police in respect of unnecessary attendance at court.  As Deputies may have seen from the newspapers, there have been some recent cases which have given rise to very strong criticism, criticism which, I think, was entirely justified.  This is not simply a question of the inconvenience to witnesses and all concerned by the exercise, without notice, of the right of the accused to transfer. In some cases, particularly where witnesses travel voluntarily from abroad, the result may be that they will not come forward at all on the second occasion, with the result that the administration of justice is considerably impeded and prejudiced.</P>
    <P>The amendment is a reasonable approach to this problem.  It is a fair compromise between the right of the <Col N="806" /> accused or the Attorney General, on the one hand, and the necessity for the proper administration of justice in the circuit court, on the other.</P>

      <P>This year for the first time I propose to take Votes 8, 9 and 10 together.  The purpose of these Votes is well known <Col N="810" /> to Deputies and it is hardly necessary for me to describe them.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for Vote 8 shows an increase of £66,500 on the provision for last year.  This arises mainly from a revision of accounting arrangements. Until now it has been the practice to recover from other Votes the salaries and expenses of engineers engaged on work covered by those Votes, for example. Arterial Drainage (Vote 9) and Land Project (Vote 40).  These charges will for the future, be borne finally on Vote 8.  The altered accounting arrangements for Post Office services explains the provision of £17,000 under Subhead C.</P>
      <P>When the Estimate was being taken last year, I indicated that under the experiment previously announced, 20 trainee architectural assistants had been recruited and were in training.  In view of the promise of success which the scheme holds a second group of trainee architectural assistants has been recruited.  A trainee scheme on similar lines for engineering technicians has been initiated and is progressing satisfactorily.  Further groups of both classes will it is hoped be recruited this year.  The full effect of these schemes of training will be felt in about two years time and the difficult position which has arisen as a result of the shortage of professional staff, both architectural and engineering, will be eased.  It is, of course, not the intention to have these technicians doing professional work for which they will not be qualified.  There is certain work, which is not properly professional, ancillary to the work of every architect and engineer and it is this which the technicians will be doing.  Later the technicians can, of course, take out a professional qualification if they so desire.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for Vote 9 also shows an increase over last year's provision. The expansion of activities which, as the House will recall, required a Supplementary Estimate last year, continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall run briefly through the subheads of the Estimate.  The main items covered by Subhead A are the purchase of sites for new Garda stations and the purchase of lands and other properties <Col N="811" /> required for the major fishery harbours schemes.</P>
    <P>Subhead AA makes provision for a grant-in-aid to the trustees of the Republican Plot in Glasnevin cemetery. This plot originated in 1868 when a space was leased for the cenotaph to the memory of the Manchester Martyrs, Allen, Larkin, and O'Brien.  In addition to the cenotaph the Plot includes the graves of a number of persons who took an active part in the Struggle for Independence, as well as an area in respect of which an option was given many years ago by the Dublin Cemeteries Committee.  The option was not taken up and under a trust deed dated 12th October, 1963 the Cemeteries Committee gave a fresh option in respect of the area in question. The trustees recently applied for a grant to enable them to take up that option and, having regard to the history of the Plot, I consider it appropriate that the application should be granted.</P>
    <P>Deputies have already been furnished with a statement setting out particulars of the items for which provision has been made in Subhead B, and while it is scarcely necessary for me to go into the details I propose to refer to some of the more important works.</P>
    <P>The work on the extension to Leinster House is proceeding satisfactorily. It seems certain that before this time next year the new building including the restaurant, etc., will be in use. Deputies will agree that the amount of inconvenience arising from the building operations has so far been negligible. For this, credit is due to the architects and the builders.  Everything possible will be done between now and the completion of the job to minimise upsets to the House, but as the members will, I am sure appreciate these may not be completely avoidable.  The part of the scheme which would probably cause the greatest upset to the House is the reconstruction of the Press block immediately behind the Dáil Chamber.  In the circumstances it is planned to do this work during the summer recess along with various <Col N="812" /> smaller items such as breaking through existing walls in connection with the new link corridor around the Dáil Chamber.</P>
    <P>Since I spoke on this Estimate last year, a low level sound reinforcement system has been introduced into the Chamber, and I think it will be agreed that, notwithstanding some teething difficulties in the early stages, the system has proved to be a success.</P>
    <P>A substantial provision has been made for the rebuilding of the demolished drawing room and bedroom block at the State Apartments at Dublin Castle, the site of which has already been cleared.  It is hoped to invite tenders for the work very shortly.</P>
    <P>Plans have been prepared for the provision of a new building to house the staffs of the Stamping Branch, the Estate Duty Office and other staffs of the Revenue Commissioners totalling about 300, but as the occupants of certain existing buildings on this site will first have to be rehoused, there will be an interval before the work begins.</P>
    <P>The cross block with accommodation for about 80 of the Revenue Commissioners' staff is now virtually completed.</P>
    <P>A commission has been placed with the sculptor, Edward Delaney, for the preparation of a bronze statue of Davis to be erected in College Green.  Mr. Delaney is at present engaged on the preparation of the plaster model of the statue prior to having it cast in bronze.  This part of the work is of a tedious nature and I cannot yet say when the bronze figure will be available.  Every effort will, of course, be made to expedite the completion of this project.</P>
    <P>The main architectural work on the Garden of Remembrance is virtually complete.  An additional strip of ground is being acquired from the Rotunda Hospital authorities, which will be used to give a better approach to the Garden along the east side of Parnell Square.  This work should be completed by the autumn.  A final decision still has to be taken on the form which the central sculptural feature will take.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> A sum of £95,000 is included for the temporary ferry terminal at the East Pier, Dún Laoghaire.  As has been announced, British Railways will provide a car ferry service between Dún Laoghaire and Holyhead commencing in May, 1965.  It was originally intended to reclaim an area between the Mail Boat Pier and the East Pier, Dún Laoghaire, and to provide the terminal facilities for the service in the reclaimed area.  There was, however, strong opposition to this proposal and accordingly it was decided that it should be abandoned and an alternative site selected elsewhere in the harbour.  Possible alternative sites have been examined and St. Michael's Wharf has now been selected.</P>
    <P>The permanent terminal on the new site could not be completed by May, 1965 and it, therefore, became necessary to provide temporary facilities. The only possible site on which even temporary facilities could be made ready in time is at the East Pier.  The works required for the temporary terminal include dredging, the construction of a wharf between the existing dolphins, the provision of a mechanically operated ramp, a slight widening of the pier near the landward end and the erection of buildings to accommodate passengers, customs examination hall, etc.  The dredging is in hands and will be completed shortly.  A contract has been placed for the marine structures and the temporary buildings will be prefabricated and erected when progress with other works permits.  The temporary facilities will be removed and the East Pier restored as soon as the permanent terminal is completed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power, who for a long time had been pressing British Railways to provide a ferry service, undertook that the terminal facilities would be available when required.  The Office of Public Works are simply the authority responsible for the execution of the work.</P>
    <P>The sum of £735,000 is provided for improved accommodation for the Garda Síochána.  This includes £100,000 for the completion of the training centre at Templemore which is already occupied, and £25,000 for work on the extension of the garage and workshop accommodation at the <Col N="814" /> Garda Depot, Phoenix Park.  This is expected to commence soon.</P>
    <P>A programme for the replacement of about 250 unsuitable Garda stations and the erection with each rural station of at least one house for a married member of the force is being undertaken.  It is proposed to spend £180,000 on this in the current year. Last year 14 stations and 17 houses were completed and contracts for a further 21 stations and 33 houses are at present in progress.  In addition, a large Metropolitan station was completed last year at Cabra and another is at present being built at Crumlin. Improvements are also being undertaken at various existing stations and it is hoped to spend £30,000 on these in the current year.</P>
    <P>The National Building Agency Ltd., are erecting houses for married members of the Garda Síochána at various centres throughout the country and the expenditure incurred by them is recouped by the Office of Public Works. £400,000 is being provided for this purpose this year.  This programme constitutes a substantial contribution to the provision of houses in the provinces.</P>
    <P>Work is proceeding satisfactorily on the erection of a Memorial at the Depot in the Phoenix Park to Gardaí who lost their lives in the performance of duty and it should be completed next autumn.</P>
    <P>I spoke at length last year, and again in February when I introduced the Supplementary Estimate, about school building.  I outlined the progress made, the task still to be accomplished and the steps that have been taken to cope with the programme.  During the year ended 31st March, 1964, contracts were placed for the erection of 113 new schools and the execution of 75 major improvement schemes.  On 1st April, 1964, there were 233 building projects in hands, 159 new schools and 74 major improvement schemes.  Expenditure on this service in 1963-64 amounted to £2,326,000 which was the highest ever.  A provision of £2.4 million is proposed for 1964-65.</P>
    <P>The expanded programme which the Office of Public Works is now putting into effect and which is reflected in the provision proposed for 1964-65 has <Col N="815" /> brought with it certain practical problems which must be overcome.  We are anxiously concerned with solving the school building problem as quickly as we can and for that purpose we are engaged in research into all aspects of school building techniques to find the best solution.  One of the objectives of the research, and an important one, has been to increase the speed of erection of new buildings. After all, improved planning and design will be of no avail if we cannot produce completed buildings at a rate fast enough to meet requirements.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the methods used, until now, are no longer adequate.  A prototype of a new modular plan building, in which factory-made timber units are used extensively, is being erected in Ballyboghill, County Dublin.  This type of building can be put together quickly and lends itself to mass production of the component parts and the completed buildings.  I am having a short film, to illustrate the design and construction of the Ballyboghill school, made with a sound commentary.  It is proposed to show this to managers, to architects and to builders to give them the opportunity of appreciating fully the advantages.</P>
    <P>To exploit fully this type of construction technique it would be desirable to place contracts for a number of buildings with one contractor, so that several projects may proceed simultaneously, or at least that there should be no interruption between the completion of one building and the commencement of the next.  To permit of smooth transition from one job to the next it would be necessary to obviate the delays which are inherent in the present system of tendering by substituting bulk tendering.  The contractual details for a large number of jobs can be settled in advance and the way opened for the systematic erection of schools according to the pre-determined programme.  It is hoped to devise a system of bulk tendering this year.</P>
    <P>It is not enough, of course, to accelerate the programme at the building stage only: all the preliminary <Col N="816" /> processes must be speeded up, right back to the initial step&mdash;the provision of sites.  The provision of sites for schools is a local liability and it is the responsibility of the manager to acquire and offer the site to the Department of Education.  On this question of the provision of sites and the responsibilities of managers, it has been remarked to me that a false impression might be created by certain observations made by me during the debate on the Supplementary Estimate in February.  The suggestion that in some cases all was not well has been misconstrued as a reflection on managers.  Might I say that the very large number of schools being built is proof of the zeal of so many managers for their schools?  We hear now and then of an odd exception and the publicity given to it goes to obscure, and to make people forget the excellent co-operation of the general body of managers.</P>
    <P>It is no harm for me to repeat that there are about 650 schools now requiring to be replaced and it is hoped to clear these in the next six or seven years.  Old schools, of course, will continue to fall due for replacement and accordingly to deal with the school requirements comprehensively will take up to ten years.</P>
    <P>A secondary problem facing us is the provision of running water and w.c's in all schools.  This is not an easy matter in country districts.  We have developed a free-standing prefabricated sanitary block, a prototype of which has been erected at St. Patrick's National School, Drumcondra, Dublin.  This may prove to be the solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>Tenders have been received for the extension to the National Gallery and a contract will soon be placed.  The addition will provide 43,000 square feet of additional gallery space, a lecture theatre to seat 300, an Art library and some storage.  The upper floors will include administrative offices and interconnected galleries communicating with the existing galleries at the main floor levels.  When the work&mdash; which will take about three years&mdash;is completed it will be possible to display many pictures that are not now <Col N="817" /> available to the public for want of space.</P>
    <P>The preparation of plans for the erection of a Preventive Centre at Finglas, Dublin, is well advanced and construction work will, it is hoped, commence this year.  The new building which will have accommodation for about 85 boys will replace the present House of Detention at Glasnevin and will help the type of boy who requires only a short period of specialist corrective treatment to regain the road to good citizenship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  A provision of £200,000 has been included for the development of major fishery harbours at Dunmore East, Killybegs, Castletownbere, Howth and Galway.  Construction works started last summer at Dunmore East and a start was made recently at Killybegs.  As a first stage of the development at Castletownbere the existing pier requires temporary strengthening.  A fairly extensive scheme of dredging will also be undertaken.  The work to the pier is expected to commence about the end of next month and the dredging later in the summer.</P>
      <P>Difficulties have been encountered, particularly at Killybegs and Castletownbere, in the acquisition of privately owned property which is essential to the commencement of full scale development operations.  It now seems clear that legislation will be necessary to overcome these difficulties and this matter is being considered at present.</P>
      <P>Site and model investigations have been completed for Howth and Galway but the schemes for those harbours have not yet been settled.</P>
      <P>A sum of £25,000 has been provided for improvement works in fishery interests at other small harbours around the coast as follows: Schull, County Cork; Ballinacarta and Green-castle, County Donegal; Cahirciveen, County Kerry; Clogherhead, County Louth; Enniscrone, County Sligo and Passage East, County Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> A provision of almost £260,000 is being made for a variety of works in agricultural interests, at Abbotstown Farm, Athenry Agricultural School, Backweston Farm, Ballyhaise Agricultural School, Clonakilty Agricultural School, the Munster Institute, Thorndale, and the Veterinary College at Ballsbridge.  The new residential colleges at Athenry and Clonakilty are nearing completion and the new Veterinary Field Station at Abbotstown Farm is well under way.  So also is the extension of the pig progeny testing station at the Munster Institute.</P>
    <P>Almost £300,000 is provided for various works for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the chief of which is the erection, now in progress, of a new central sorting office in Dublin.  Another large scale work in progress is the building of new warehousing accommodation at St. John's Road, Dublin.  Other substantial works are proceeding at Ballinasloe, Ennis, Wexford, Wicklow and Youghal.</P>
    <P>The planning of the new building for the Departments of Health and Social Welfare at Haddington Road is nearly completed but at the moment I cannot say when work on it is likely to commence.</P>
    <P>The £20,000 in subhead BB provides for works of coast protection already in progress at Rosslare Strand and Wicklow.  It also includes a sum for any schemes which may mature during the year under the Coast Protection Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>Subheads C to H do not require much comment except perhaps in regard to the national monuments service which comes under subhead C.  Work on the conservation of national monuments has continued satisfactorily.  The expenditure in the year just finished was £40,000 which was reasonable considering that special skilled staffs are needed and that the work must be slow if it is to be effective.</P>
    <P>A full archaeological investigation of Ballintober Abbey was completed and works are now in hand to present the findings and set out the ruins of the Abbey.  Another work of an unusual nature is the restoration of <Col N="819" /> Rothe House, Kilkenny, for the Kilkenny Archaeological Society.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners are under constant pressure to take over monuments for preservation and while they have full sympathy with the claims of the different monuments it has to be realised that everything cannot be done all at once and that the process must be gradual.  State ownership, without prospect of early works, serves no purpose and the skilled resources for carrying out works are limited.  However the number of monuments in State care is constantly being added to. A recent notable addition was Tintern Abbey, County Wexford.  Monuments to be acquired shortly include the castles at Trim and Cahir.</P>
    <P>An exhibition of photographs of national monuments was held at the Royal Dublin Society Horse Show in August, 1963, and at the Building Centre, London, in January of this year.  It is now being presented in Vienna.  The press reports indicate a very wide and very favourable reception. Other centres, both at home and abroad, will see the exhibition as it becomes possible to make arrangements. It will also be shown in Canada and the United States.</P>
    <P>We have considered the proposal for a special independent body to deal comprehensively with monuments, but we think it would be better to defer the idea for the time being.  Alternative interim suggestions have been put forward and I am having these examined.  Also, the Minister for Finance has agreed to increase the allocation for the service by £10,000 a year for the next five years.  We will then be spending £100,000 a year, twice as much as at present.  This would enable more preservation and development works to be undertaken, and produce results of value to our own people and the tourist.</P>
    <P>A programme of aerial photography in this country was organised for the summer of 1963 by Dr. St. Joseph of Cambridge University.  Despite unfavourable weather conditions, Dr. St. Joseph's team made two visits and took over 600 photographs of sites of different kinds suggested by various <Col N="820" /> organisations, including the Office of Public Works which supplied a fairly full list of archaeological sites.  A representative cross-section of the sites was photographed.  Prints have been supplied to the National Museum where they can be seen by appointment. A further programme will probably be carried out in the summer of 1964.  I should add that the survey is experimental and is not intended to be a comprehensive one.</P>
    <P>The second stage of the archaeological survey of the country has been initiated and field work will be begun shortly.  Aerial photography will play an important part in the detection and recording of sites.  It is expected that satisfactory arrangements can be made with the Department of Defence to have this work done by the Army Air Corps.</P>

      <P>Archaeological excavation is carried out by trained archaeologists, under the aegis of the Royal Irish Academy, with the aid of grants from public funds.  Much valuable work has been, and is being, done and the nation, and, indeed, the learned world as a whole, is much indebted to the enthusiasm of these workers.  It is rarely they come into the limelight. I must, also, pay a tribute to the work of the Archaeological and Historical Societies throughout the country which are performing a very valuable service in awakening the interest of the public in our heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Hill of Tara has been the subject of publicity recently.  Archaeological remains on the Hill of Tara are in the guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works and are adequately protected.  The entirety of the Hill is a national monument and accordingly has the full protection of the National Monuments Acts, 1930 and 1954.  The Commissioners are owners in fee simple of 43 acres on the south side of the Hill.  The remainder of the area containing about 70 acres is owned privately.  Negotiations for the purchase of portion of this, amounting to 58 acres, have been latterly conducted by Bord Fáilte Éireann but owing to nonagreement <Col N="821" /> on price, were deferred. The Commissioners of Public Works, under the National Monuments Acts, have powers of compulsory acquisition which could be used at any time, if necessary.  In that event, the purchase price would be determined by an arbitrator.</P>
    <P>St. Stephen's Green, the maintenance of which is also provided for under Subhead C, is a pleasant oasis in the city and I think the careful and constant attention it receives is appreciated by the citizens and visitors generally. Minor improvements are carried out from time to time but the possibility of having more extensive improvements effected so as to make it an even more attractive feature of the city is now being examined.  The advice of a landscape architect may be availed of.</P>
    <P>The Green is, of course, only one of the State parks in the care of the Office of Public Works.  The others are Phoenix Park, the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park at Muckross in Killarney and Garnish Island, Glengariff.</P>
    <P>The present Subhead G in Vote 9 covers an item&mdash;Services carried out on an Agency basis by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;not previously shown separately.  There is a reciprocal new item in the appropriations-in-aid subhead&mdash;Subhead K. This is in accordance with the new accounting arrangements introduced by the Department.</P>
    <P>The I group of subheads deals with arterial drainage and embankment construction works and associated services.  The survey and design of a drainage scheme for a major catchment is a very great task which occupies several years.  The carrying out of the scheme requires even more time.  Consequently, there can be no spectacular change in the overall drainage position in the relatively short space of twelve months.  At present construction works are proceeding on four major catchment schemes:&mdash; the Corrib-Clare in Counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon; the Inny in Counties Cavan, Longford, Meath and Westmeath; the Moy in Counties Mayo, Roscommon <Col N="822" /> and Sligo; and the Deel in Counties Limerick and Cork; and on two minor catchments:&mdash;the Broadmeadow in Counties Dublin and Meath and the Killimor in County Galway.</P>
    <P>Embankment reconstruction and repair schemes are in hand on:&mdash; the northern bank of the Shannon estuary, Coonagh section, and the southern bank in the Ballinaclogh, and Ring-moylan-Mellon sections; the Swilly estuary, Castlewray-Thorn and Big Isle sections.</P>
    <P>The total cost to date of all schemes completed or in hands amounts to over £16 million and they have given benefit to 400,000 acres of land.  An embankment scheme for the River Maigue outfall section&mdash;the biggest section of the Shannon estuary chain of embankments&mdash;is about to commence. Surveys have also been made of embankments on the River Swilly above Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>Survey and design work is proceeding on schemes for the following major catchments:&mdash;the Boyne in counties Louth, Meath, Cavan, Westmeath, Offaly and Kildare; the Erne in Counties Cavan, Leitrim, Longford and Monaghan; the Suir in Counties Tipperary, Waterford, Kilkenny and Limerick; the Maigue in Counties Limerick and Tipperary; the Corrib-Mask in Counties Galway and Mayo; the Mulkear in Counties Limerick and Tipperary; the Boyle in Counties Roscommon, Mayo, and Sligo; the Owenmore in Counties Sligo, Roscommon and Mayo; and three minor catchments: the Bonet in Counties Leitrim and Sligo, the Quin in County Clare and the Owenkeagh, County Cork.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to commence, also, this year engineering surveys of two more minor catchments, the Dunkellin and Lavally both in County Galway.</P>
    <P>Progress is being made with the extension of the main arterial drainage programme to deal with what are called &ldquo;intermediate rivers&rdquo;, small catchments with independent outfalls to the sea or larger lakes and which do not form part of listed catchments.</P>
    <P>Two schemes&mdash;the Swilly downstream of Letterkenny and the Owvane, <Col N="823" /> County Cork&mdash;have been completed. Work is in progress under contract on the Duff scheme in Counties Sligo and Leitrim; the Matt (or Ring) River in County Dublin; the Abbey River in County Donegal.  Tenders have been received for the Brickey river scheme, County Waterford.</P>
    <P>Schemes are being considered for the Lough Nahinch, or Carrigahorig, County Tipperary; the Knockcroghery or Ballyglass, County Roscommon; the Owenavorragh, County Wexford; the Creegh, County Clare; the Cloone Burn, County Donegal; the Kilcoole, County Wicklow; the Oranhill, County Galway; and the Lee (Upper), County Cork.  Engineering and valuation surveys of further intermediate river catchments will be undertaken this year.</P>
    <P>It may interest Deputies to learn that aerial photography has been used for drainage survey work.  There is a standing arrangement with the Department of Defence under which the Air Corps provide this service.</P>
    <P>Aerial photography is not, of course, a substitute for ordinary ground survey.  It is, however, a useful supplement, particularly in the delineation of flooded areas, the location of post drainage lake shore boundaries and in securing periodic records of meandering tidal estuarine channels.  Aerial photography has also been used in connection with marine works such as coast erosion and major fishery harbour surveys.  Development in the commercial field of aerial survey will be kept under observation with a view to extending the use of that technique in connection with arterial drainage and marine works surveys.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters I would like to mention in connection with arterial drainage.  The first relates to the central engineering workshop where all the drainage plant is serviced.  The re-organisation of stores and material control has been completed.  The costing service is being revised and extended and it is intended by the end of the financial year 1964-65 to have a system of management accounting in operation.  This <Col N="824" /> will ensure a close and continual check on the efficiency of the workshop.</P>
    <P>The second matter relates to the introduction of the incentive bonus scheme to which I made reference last year.  Incentive bonus is now being operated on two drainage schemes, namely, Broadmeadow and Inny, and it is continuing to prove beneficial to the workers and the State.  It is hoped to extend it to other drainage schemes as the staff position permits.</P>
    <P>Excluding civil servants, the Office of Public Works gives direct employment to about 2,800 men and the annual wage bill is of the order of £1,200,000.  In addition, very many more men are employed on the works done by contract.</P>
    <P>Before finishing with the Estimate for Vote 9, I should like to direct the attention of Deputies to the first issue of the Office of Public Works bulletin, <i>Oibre.</i> We hope to have further issues at least once a year.  As Deputies will have noted the bulletin is not intended to be a comprehensive report on the activities of the Office of Public Works.  It merely presents a few facets of those activities in, I hope, an interesting way.  Too often little is known of the important work of the Office and for a long time I have felt that something should be done to keep the general public informed.  The bulletin is an attempt to do that.</P>
    <P>Objection has been taken to the title of the bulletin, <i>Oibre.</i> This, which is an old plural form, is the telegraphic address of the Commissioners and was chosen deliberately for the bulletin with full knowledge of the fact that &ldquo;Oibreacha&rdquo; is the standard form.  A different title may be chosen for the next issue.</P>
    <P>The Vote for Employment and Emergency Schemes for the coming year shows a net increase of £43,600. compared with 1963-64.  There is an increase of £50,000 for Rural Improvements Schemes, Subhead H, offset by a net decrease of £4,400 in the administrative subheads, and by an increase of £2,000 in the estimated receipts of appropriations-in-aid, Subhead J.  The Estimate does not provide for the 9th <Col N="825" /> round wage increases to staffs covered by Subhead A.</P>
    <P>As on previous occasions, I have circulated for the information of Deputies a statement of the expenditure under the various subheads in each year since 1956/57.  The figures for the financial year just closed are subject to revision, but it is expected that almost the full amount of the Vote will be expended.</P>
    <P>The numbers of men employed on the schemes are subject to seasonal variation, being highest in the winter months when the need for additional employment is greatest.  At the peak period of employment in the week ended 14th December, 1963, a total of 3,737 men were employed on schemes financed from last year's Vote.  Of these 2,795 were employed on the works carried out expressly as employment schemes under Subheads D, E, and F, and 942 on the improvement schemes financed from Subheads G, H, and I.  Some 596 men were employed in the urban areas, including the county boroughs; 259 in the non-urbanised towns; and 2,882 in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>The annual census of adult male unemployment assistance recipients and unemployment insurance benefit claimants was taken on 25th January, 1964 and gave a return of 22,752 UA men compared with 23,357 in 1963, and 22,656 men in 1962.  The change compared with 1963 was greatest in the county boroughs and other urban areas where there was a drop of 11.1 per cent.  In the non-urbanised towns there was a drop of 5.4 per cent and in the rural areas an increase of 1.3 per cent.  The combined 1964 census figure for UA and UIB men was 52,502 compared with 56,972 in 1963 and 52,489 in 1962.</P>
    <P>Coming to the individual subheads of the Estimate for the current year, there is a reduction of £5,500 under Subhead A, Salaries, Wages and Allowances, due partly to the replacement of senior officers on retirement by junior officers on lower points of the salary scales, and partly to a decision that the Office of Public Works will not in future recover from <Col N="826" /> the Vote the salaries and expenses of their staff engaged on marine works on an agency basis.  This decision is also the principal reason for the reduction to £600 in the Estimate for Subhead B, Travelling and Incidental Expenses.  As I have already stated, the ninth round wage increases have not been provided for and it is estimated that they will add approximately £12,000 to the expenditure under Subhead A.</P>
    <P>Consequent on the grant of established status to some of the supervisors, formerly known as supervising gangers, and unestablished status to the others, it has been decided that it is now more appropriate to charge their wages and travelling expenses to Subheads A and B respectively, instead of to the works Subheads F, G and H.  In the printed Estimate, the 1963/64 figures have been revised to show a true comparison between the amounts of the subheads for the two years.  The duties of these supervisors include the furnishing of reports and estimates on minor employment and bog development applications. They also assist the inspectors in the supervision of all schemes in the counties in which works are carried out by the Special Employment Schemes Office engineers.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a new Subhead, C, arises from a general direction affecting all Votes, that in future payments in cash should be made for all services rendered by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>The provision under Subhead D, for employment schemes in the four County Boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and in the 55 other urban areas is the same as last year, £200,000.  The grants are conditional on the local authorities submitting suitable work schemes through the Department of Local Government, and contributing towards their cost.  It is expected that the local contributions will amount to £41,000 making a total of £241,000 for initiation of new schemes during the year.</P>
    <P>Last year, schemes were approved to the total value of £234,675, of which £170,974 went to road works including <Col N="827" /> footpaths, and the balance, £63,701 to amenity schemes, including the laying out and development of parks, clearance of derelict sites, construction of riverside walks and the development of open spaces.  Including local contributions, the allocation was £112,500 for Dublin, £21,000 Cork, £16,800 Limerick, £9,335 Waterford, £4,375 Dún Laoghaire, and £70,665 for the 55 other urban areas.  The allocations in the other urban areas varied from a minimum of £350 in small towns like Carrickmacross to £6,000 in Dundalk.</P>
    <P>It has always been the policy that these schemes should justify themselves as useful public works apart from their value as employment schemes.  The aim has been to keep a reasonable balance between &ldquo;relief&rdquo; and &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; by selecting schemes which lend themselves to efficient operation by direct labour without resorting to the extreme mechanisation which a public works contractor would use.  Road improvement works continue to be the mainstay of these programmes.  In areas like Dublin and Cork, however, there has, owing to the high standard of work required for modern traffic conditions, necessarily been some increase in the use of plant leading to greater employment of semi-skilled men; and in areas like these we have had to accept schemes with as low as 25 per cent unskilled labour.  I am satisfied, however, that these urban schemes are well worth while, and that there is a distinct social advantage in reserving even this limited amount of work in the various areas for men who would otherwise have to remain on the dole.</P>
    <P>The provision under Subhead E, Rural Employment Schemes, is also the same as last year, £35,000.  With the county councils contributing one-quarter of the cost, a total of £46,665 will be available for grants for works in the non-urbanised towns having the required minimum of registered unemployed.</P>
    <P>Last year some 145 schemes averaging £322 were sanctioned for 138 of the 484 non-urbanised towns in each of which there were not less than eleven unemployed.  No grants were <Col N="828" /> given in the other 346 towns in which there were in all only 985 unemployed of whom 175 were UA men.  Of these schemes 135 costing £43,657 were for road works, including £33,722 for the reconstruction of footpaths or their extension on the outskirts of the towns. The remaining ten were amenity schemes including clearance of derelict sites, improvements to a fair green and the provision of recreational walks.  Most of the allocations were limited to £270 but higher grants were given for the larger town areas such as Kilkee, Edenderry, Balbriggan, Tuam, Mullingar, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>The Estimate for Minor Employment Schemes, Subhead F, £124,000, is also the same as for last year, when adjustment has been made for the transfer of the cost of the wages and travelling expenses of supervisors to Subheads A and B, already referred to.  As heretofore, full cost grants will be available in the winter period for the repair and reconstruction of accommodation and bog roads in the electoral divisions, mainly in the western counties, in which the numbers of unemployment assistance recipients as recorded at the January census is sufficient to justify the grants.</P>
    <P>Last year 914 grants averaging £142 were sanctioned in 383 qualifying electoral divisions of the total 2,874 in the country.  The bulk of the expenditure was in Donegal, Mayo, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Sligo and Roscommon, but grants were given in fewer than a dozen areas in each of the other Minor Employment Schemes counties of Cavan, Clare, West Cork, Limerick and Longford.</P>
    <P>The provision for Bog Development Schemes, Subhead G, £155,000, is also the same as last year, allowing for the change in regard to Supervisors' wages and travelling expenses.  These are not employment schemes in the strict sense, although unemployment assistance recipients get priority in employment. The criteria for the allocation of grants are: the cost; the annual rate of turf production on the bog; and the number of families served. Many more schemes come up for consideration than can be approved, and it is only the more important cases, <Col N="829" /> judged on the above criteria, that are finally listed.  I consider, however, that the proposed provision will be sufficient to deal with the most urgent cases coming up for attention in 1964-65.</P>
    <P>Last year 1,318 bog development schemes averaging approximately £121 were approved, representing a total allocation of £160,000.  Bog drainage schemes numbered 643 and amounted to £72,435.  There were 675 road schemes amounting to £87,565.</P>
    <P>The proposed provision for Rural Improvements Schemes, Subhead H, £267,000, shows an increase of £50,000 compared with last year allowing for the change in regard to supervisors' salaries and expenses.  As Deputies are aware, the provision for this very popular scheme has been previously increased from £200,000 to £225,000 in 1962-63 making a total increase of £75,000 since 1962.</P>
    <P>Last year 637 new schemes averaging £302 were authorised at a total cost of £192,521.  Of these 472 schemes costing £155,351 were road and bridge works and 165 schemes costing £37,170 were drainage works.  Taking into account the commitments at 1st April, 1963, in respect of uncompleted schemes already sanctioned, the total expenditure in 1963-64 is estimated at £237,000 compared with the provision of £225,000.</P>
    <P>The demand for grants under this scheme is still running very high, and while the additional provision of £50,000 will go some distance towards easing the pressure it will not by any means resolve all our difficulties in regard to arrears of applications.  We had been accepting contributions for a number of months past on the basis that the work could not be sanctioned until after 1st April, 1964, that is, the new financial year.  Approximately £123,000 of the new provision of £267,000 has been taken up by schemes for which the contribution had been received before 1st April, 1964, and the balance of £144,000 will not be enough to cater for all the existing applications outstanding at the present time.  We cannot sanction any new applications at all, and a proportion <Col N="830" /> of those already on hands will have to wait over until the following financial year before they could be put in hands.</P>
    <P>There will necessarily also be some delay in the inspection of existing applications due to the difficulties in filling vacancies in the engineering staff.  In the last twelve months two of the serving inspectors resigned so that there are still three vacancies and efforts are continuing to fill these.</P>
    <P>The provision for Miscellaneous Schemes, Subhead I, £17,000, is also the same as for last year.  While the ambit of this Subhead is very wide and can cover schemes of very varying character, in practice the bulk of the grants are earmarked for archaeological excavation schemes carried out under the aegis of the Royal Irish Academy, and minor marine works sponsored by the Department of Agriculture or by the Fisheries Branch of the Department of Lands.  Last year, grants amounting to £8,150 were made for five excavation schemes, including £4,500 for the completion of the scheme at High Street, Dublin, and £2,000 for the continuation of the excavations at Newgrange, County Meath.  Grants amounting to £6,371, supplemented by county council contributions of £2,124 making a total of £8,495 were authorised for the improvement of landing facilities at Gerahies near Bantry, at Crookhaven and at Garnish near Allihies, all in West Cork.</P>
    <P>The main item in the estimate of £43,000 for receipts under the Appropriations-in-Aid, Subhead J, is £40,000 for Rural Improvements Schemes.  It is expected that total receipts in 1963/64 will fall short of the £41,000 estimate, by about £2,000, because of a reduction in the number of offers of grants issued under the Rural Improvements Scheme.</P>
    <P>If Deputies require more information either now or later on any matters in these three Votes, I shall do my best to give it to them.  I may add that the staffs of the Office of Public Works, the Special Employment Schemes Office, and myself are at all times ready to help them in any way we can.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>Looking through this Estimate we find the old recurring item.  Apparently it will always be with us: Arus an Uachtaráin, total estimated cost of improvements to the plant house and accommodation, £11,000: total expenditure to 31st March, 1964, £10,000. Over the past ten years, I would estimate that we have spent over £30,000 on Arus an Uachtaráin.</P>
      <P>With regard to Leinster House, I am sure it is great news for the gentlemen of the Press and the Press Gallery generally that their accommodation will be brought up to date in the new building.  That improvement has been overdue for many years.  I am sure Deputies have had the experience of going into the Pressroom and finding an enormous number of men working under appalling conditions. They were overcrowded and they did not seem to have the normal amenities and facilities or the kind of conditions they would have in a newspaper office, or, indeed, in any industrial office.  The accommodation is quite inadequate. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will press on with the work so that all these amenities and facilities will be available to the members of the Press gallery when we come back, please God, towards the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the sound equipment here. While I will not say it is a complete success, it is certainly a great improvement.  It was often very difficult to hear the Minister for Finance, for instance, over here.  It was often practically impossible to hear him in any part of the House.  Indeed, he was the sounding board for a good many of us over here.</P>

      <P>I am not being contentious in the matter I now propose to raise.  I know that in the new building the oil paintings of Griffith, Collins and O'Higgins will come back.  There are experts in every field and, like doctors, they do not always agree.  With regard to these oils, some maintain they should be under glass while others maintain they should not.  Now, in every art gallery, including those in Dublin, there are notices saying &ldquo;No smoking.&rdquo; I hold that these oils should be under glass here because, otherwise, they will deteriorate.  The atmosphere will not be conducive to preservation, temperature varies.</P>
      <P>I hope that when the rebuilding and decoration of Leinster House has been completed, the Meagher Flag of the 69th New York Regiment, the flag which was so generously presented to the Irish people by the late President Kennedy, will be exhibited in a place of honour in this House.  I feel a particular sentiment about this flag and I think a short history of it should be printed.  The history of the flag is that in December, 1862, hundreds and hundreds of men having been killed in a desperate attack the Irish Brigade had to go in.  One standard bearer after another, and one flag after another, had been shot down.  Brave men kept coming forward taking up the flag, but they were shattered, one after another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Brigade continued to go in and succeeded in breaking through the Confederate line.  The flags and the flagstaff were cut to pieces.  In the ordinary course of events, a fresh set of flags was ordered from the depot in New York and carried at the battle of Fredericksburg.  General Meagher drew the attention of the men to the fact that there was a boxhedge nearby and they took green sprigs from it and <Col N="833" /> pinned them to their hats, to the US flag, Old Glory, and to their company pennants.  We have a great treasure in Waterford city in one of the pennants which was carried at Fredericksburg, and which still has a piece of green boxhedge pinned to it.  We should have more appreciation of these treasures. The people can see the green battle standard presented to the nation by the late President Kennedy, but we should also have a reasonably good history of it.</P>
    <P>We are very glad that the statue of Thomas Davis is in hand, and we hope the plaster model will be in hand quickly.  There are great difficulties, because artists cannot be rushed as we can rush an ordinary contracting business.  We welcome the fact that the Garden of Remembrance is virtually complete.  Several of my constituents have asked me to refer to that matter.</P>
    <P>It appears that there is great objection by some people to the proposal in regard to Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  I know this is not within the Parliamentary Secretary's bailiwick, but I should like to know what the objection is.  I am not surprised that there is some objection, because no matter what the Minister for Transport and Power puts his finger in, he seems to be able to detonate the people concerned.  We need better facilities for landing cars at Dún Laoghaire.  I have been there myself to meet friends, and I have seen the frightful state of affairs there.  In bad weather, people who come to meet their friends have to stand out in the rain because there is no shelter.  On two occasions I saw people getting drenched.</P>
    <P>I want an explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary regarding works undertaken for the Garda Síochána.  I see that £620,000 is provided for Templemore.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary tell me did the Department of Justice jump the gun and say: &ldquo;We do not want the Office of Public Works to do this work; we will do it ourselves&rdquo;?  If the Office of Public Works were unable to reach on that work because of a shortage of staff, say, I should like that explanation to be given to the House, because I would <Col N="834" /> prefer work of that type to be carried out by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>A sum of £13,900 is provided for a memorial to Gardaí who lost their lives in the performance of their duty. Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell us what the form of the memorial is to be?  Will it be a monument, or a statue, with the names of the men inscribed on it.</P>
    <P>The provision for houses for married members of the Garda Síochána is £400,000.  The Parliamentary Secretary will excuse me for saying this&mdash;I am sometimes twitted by my colleagues about it&mdash;but in the past ten years, I have seen enormous sums of money voted for different purposes, but it is never spent in my constituency.  The Garda in Waterford have to live in houses, the same as anyone else.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary is informed by the Department of Justice where the houses are to be built, but I want to take this opportunity to ask why houses are not built for members of the Garda in Waterford.  A further 21 new Garda stations are to be built, but there is only one down for Waterford.  It is there so long now that we look upon it as a kind of a fairy story.  When will it start or will it ever start?  I have been asking the Minister for Justice for years when he will build the new Garda station in Tramore.  The present one is located outside the town.  We pay taxes but we get nothing back.</P>
    <P>With regard to primary schools, I have been to the opening of many new schools which I must say are excellent.  I have been mentioning this practically since I came into the House.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider making this point to the school managers or to the Department of Education?  The schools are called after saints.  There should be a statue or a painting of the saint or some work of art should be commissioned by the Office of Public Works in order to give our young artists an opportunity of earning their bread and of showing what they are capable of turning out in the way of a work of art in this year of 1964.</P>
    <P>I have not seen the new prototype <Col N="835" /> schools but I have seen pictures of them in the newspapers and I have talked to my friends about them.  I suppose it is a very good idea.  Some people want a school erected practically overnight. It may happen that a school becomes overcrowded because a new housing scheme opens in an area near it.  The Parliamentary Secretary has then to provide increased accommodation in the school quickly.  I should like to compliment him in that respect.  It is a good idea to try a new thing and if it is a failure, we shall not be too hard on the Parliamentary Secretary.  However I have an idea that it will be a success.</P>
    <P>We often say that temporary buildings are not the thing, that they do not last, that they are not good, and so on.  Maybe what I have to say now will give the Parliamentary Secretary a litle bit of hope and he may use this if he likes.  When I was brought by the hand to my first school, I was promoted to the gallery in the infants' class.  That was in Philip Street School in Waterford.  It was a kind of clapboard, corrugated-iron temporary building.  It is there yet and has given very good service.  Many people might sneer at it.  It will be taken down for a new building but it has given very good service.  I am sure that this, say, modular plan building which the Parliamentary Secretary has erected is much better.  It is better looking and I think it will be a success.  I wish him luck with it.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says his idea is that the contract details for a large number of jobs might be settled in advance.  That is very interesting.  I am sure the Office of Public Works will see to it that the proper foundations and other necessary requirements are satisfactorily provided when these prefabricated walls are sent out.</P>
    <P>There are 650 schools to be replaced.  I think more money should be voted to the Parliamentary Secretary's Office so as to step-up the work. A great number of schools are now falling down.  I do not say that the Office of Public Works can build them all in the one year because that would <Col N="836" /> be impossible but I think the pace should be speeded up a bit more.  I am only too well aware of the great difficulty in providing running water in many of the rural schools.</P>
    <P>It is balm to my soul to read that a provision has been included for the development of major fishery harbours, including Dunmore East.  At last, Dunmore East is recognised as the premier fishing port in Ireland.  We now have it in writing from the Office of Public Works.  Work has started down there and it will justify itself.  I have visited several fishing harbours and seen great works there but it was just a case of throwing money away because no fish were being caught there and there was no intention of catching fish there.  However, Dunmore East can be developed into a great fish market.</P>
    <P>There is a subhead in respect of works of economic development at other fishery harbours.  I am surprised and very grateful to see that Passage East is included.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands was down there on the occasion of the dispute with the fishermen and he told us that this work would be pressed ahead.  I hope it will not be put on the long finger like Tramore barracks.</P>
    <P>From time to time, there is mention here and outside of our national heritage. We have a national heritage.  The Office of Public Works look after our national monuments.  I have seen some of that work throughout the country and it is excellent.  The Department of Local Government make roads to some of them.  The Tourist Board make roads to some of our national monuments and the Office of Public Works do the same thing.  There should be some co-ordination between these three bodies&mdash;the Department of Local Government, Bord Fáilte, and the Office of Public Works&mdash;so that one body would do this.</P>
    <P>I submit the proper co-ordinating body in this matter is the Office of Public Works.  They are the people who, in the first place, preserve the smaller ancient monuments and the historical remains that are a national heritage.  I particularly ask the Parliamentary  <Col N="837" /> Secretary to take note of that and I appeal to the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Transport and Power to examine the position in regard to matters like this and have their efforts co-ordinated.  We have the sentiment in regard to these things but it is no harm to say that, apart from being a national heritage, these historical things are a national asset.  Tourists are interested in the history of the country they visit and all the more so if they see history brought to life in the great abbeys, castles or churches.  They are interested in prehistoric remains which show development and in things that existed before the dawn of history.</P>
    <P>There is a great lios at Harristown, County Waterford, over the estuary. This, one may say, relates to the Stonehenge period, probably Phoenician. With the help of the Office of Public Works, the late Canon Power did a very good job on this 15 or 20 years ago but it is impossible to get to the lios unless you are a good climber.  When you get there you find you can see the whole Waterford estuary, out over Hook Tower cape and you can also see the Saltee Islands and the coast down to Dungarvan, one of the most wonderful views imaginable.  When we develop these sites a short road should be provided with an apron on which to park cars.</P>
    <P>I note that the Board of Works are restoring the Rothe House in Kilkenny for Kilkenny Archaeological Society.  This is a magnificent Tudor building and I think the only one of its kind in the country.  The society collected a good deal of money and then approached the Government.  I am glad the Board of Works have taken the matter in hand.  Work has been going on for some time there as I have seen scaffolding there for the past year.  Kilkenny is one of our most interesting cities from the point of view of historical remains, and I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on this job.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that they were to take over Cahir Castle.  That is practically perfect but some boys apparently got in there and did more damage than the Earl of Essex when he took it.  All the <Col N="838" /> windows were smashed.  And I ask the Parliamentary Secretary, if he is taking that over as I think he is, to get the Board of Works to take steps immediately to notify the Gardaí in Cahir to try to prevent trespass there. That would be another great tourist attraction and will not involve great expenditure.</P>
    <P>I take no credit from the Parliamentary Secretary regarding aerial surveys but the first time I heard this mentioned was some years ago when it was suggested by the Leader of my Party, Deputy Dillon.  I am glad it has been taken up because I have seen some wonderful pictures taken from the air which showed prehistoric remains that nobody previously knew were there.</P>
    <P>It is good that we in the Parliament of the country should compliment historical and archaeological societies on their good work in keeping records and preserving small items of interest that perhaps would not come to the attention of the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Hill of Tara is safe in the hands of the Board with the powers they now have.  It would be impossible now for amateur excavators to come along and do as was done in the early part of this century by amateurs who came in and probably did untold damage.  I read in the papers of a suggestion to move back the railings at St. Stephen's Green 20 or 30 feet so that we could park cars.  I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary should give Carson's answer to that: &ldquo;Not an inch.&rdquo; I walk in Stephen's Green occasionally and I think it is one of the most wonderful small parks in the world.  The air is like wine in the mornings.  The gardeners employed by the Board of Works are the most helpful and courteous people I have met in such gardens, and go to great trouble telling inquirers when certain blooms will appear, what is expected and whether or not something was disappointing. This is really worthwhile.</P>
    <P>We spend a lot of money on arterial drainage and I suppose that is right. We spend a lot in the west of Ireland and I do not begrudge it because I saw the dreadful floods there when I was a boy.  I often heard people say <Col N="839" /> then: &ldquo;If we had our own Government, something would be done.&rdquo; It has been done and it is good that it has been done.  The total cost to date of all schemes completed or in hands amounts to over £16 million&mdash;we cannot call this a cowardly country&mdash;and they have given benefit to 400,000 acres of land.</P>
    <P>What I am interested in, and it is not in my constituency, is the survey and design work proceeding on schemes for major catchments.  There is the scheme for the Boyne in Counties Louth, Meath, Cavan, Westmeath.  I commend the Office of Public Works for this, even though they have put the Boyne before my own river, the Suir, because I realise that some of the best land is along the Boyne.  It is good that when development works of this sort have been completed in Mayo, Galway and Roscommon, the men and machines should move into the Boyne area and the great catchment there.  I know that this will result in a great improvement in some of the most valuable land in the country.  The Erne is next, followed by the Suir and the the Maigue in Limerick and Tipperary.</P>
    <P>A few years ago when the Parliamentary Secretary was appointed, some Deputies mentioned to me that he had switched some of the drainage work and the repair of embankments down to Limercick.  I replied that that was a natural thing for him to do and asked would he not look after his own constituency.  In any case, the banks he was going to have built up were going to reclaim and improve lands that were nearly as good as the land in Meath.</P>
    <P>Now we come to coast erosion.  I am interested in this from the point of view of County Wexford.  Rosslare received a grant from the Board of Works in order to save the strand.  I do not find fault with that; it was badly needed and it would have been a terrible state of affairs if a very fine resort like Rosslare had been swept away.  There was a great danger of many of the houses being swept into the sea and this was the right thing to do.  The Wexford County Council contributed a reasonable sum of money <Col N="840" /> and the Board of Works contributed a substantial amount.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should cast his eye in the direction of the great strand at Tramore.  There has been a breakthrough on the banks and only a few sleepers have been put down and no more.  This is not a small strand or a small resort.  The strand is three and a half miles long.  I should like to know if the Waterford County Council put up a case to the Office of Public Works for doing for Tramore what was done for Rosslare.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £43,600 in the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote and I wonder will it employ as many people next year, with the 12 per cent increase, as the sum of money we voted last year.  This is very important work because it provides employment where work is scarce.  I have seen people being rehabilitated, as the saying is, in backward areas where there was no work to be had; when these schemes were brought into the area the people were able to get back on their feet again. It meant that they were taken off assistance and given a full week's pay over a period.</P>
    <P>There is a provision for bog development schemes of £155,000, the same as last year.  Evidently the Parliamentary Secretary's Office do not think it necessary that we should go on with bog development.  There is not a great deal of this development in my constituency but wherever there are bogs, it is important for the people that they should have proper roads into the bogs so that they can get their turf out.  More and more people are now cutting their own turf.</P>
    <P>I want to make one final point.  I have said this on previous occasions on this Estimate and I usually conclude on it.  I want to compliment whoever is responsible in the Board of Works in what I might call the buying section, the people who buy the furniture for Government offices.  I never knew who these people were but I should like to compliment them on their taste.  Down the years they have bought magnificent furniture.  It seems to be a tradition in <Col N="841" /> the Office of Public Works and I am glad they have kept up that tradition. It is very nice to go into a Government office and see furniture that has been made in Dublin by craftsmen, great cabinetmakers, and also Donegal carpets.</P>

I realised a long time ago that these things did not just happen, that somebody was responsible for putting the furniture there. I never found out who but I want to tell them that if ever we are short of money and put up for sale a lot of the beautiful things we have in Government offices we would make a substantial profit on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to the Parliamentary Secretary, it must be admitted that during his period in charge of the Office of Public Works, he has brought a breath of fresh air into it.  I am sure he has received full co-operation from the officials because things seem to be running far more smoothly now than some years ago.  It is grand to find that a job is being handled efficiently and that the people in charge of the Board of Works do not consider that they are above the law and should not have to answer questions or letters.  At the present time I am very glad to say that, as far as I know, members of the House receive the utmost courtesy from the people working in the offices of the Board of Works, and the Parliamentary Secretary himself, when dealing with such matters, is a model of courtesy and efficiency.  When the occasion arises, all of us can be very critical of people who hold such an office and when we find somebody doing the job properly, it is only right we should throw an odd bouquet as well as the showers of brickbats we throw across the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the sound system used in the House is a success.  I should like to think that I personally do not need it.  There are a number of people in this House who can make themselves heard without the assistance of a <Col N="842" /> microphone but it is true that until it was introduced, it was impossible to hear comments particularly from the Government front bench, excluding the Parliamentary Secretary.  A number of other Deputies seemed to take delight in making their pronouncements in such a way that nobody except their nearest neighbour could hear them.  In addition to that, people who came to the Public Gallery found they were unable to hear anything at all except a low mumble.  I have gone up there myself to check and found it was so.  Now the merest whisper in the House can be heard all over the place.  One drawback is that there is a great deal of noise when files are placed on top of the microphone.  That has been done and is still being done. It is rather stupid that people who have achieved the rank of Front Bench members of this House should continue to do it.  The backbenchers do not do it and there may be a moral in that somewhere.</P>
    <P>As regards the Public Gallery, perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would look up occasionally and consider whether or not we have reached the time when that grille should be removed.  We do not expect anybody to shower objectionable material down on top of us.  If practically every other Parliament in the world can get along without a grille, I am sure we can, too.  It is not decorative and must look awful to people who come in here only occasionally.</P>
    <P>With reference to arterial drainage, the job is being done reasonably well. Every effort is being made to expedite the schemes which are being planned. However, something will have to be done to remedy the irritating matters which have arisen again and again. One is the question of spoil.  It is most annoying to somebody who has a small portion of land, particularly along the bank of a river, to find this material interfering with his land. Could the Parliamentary Secretary find out if there is some other way of disposing of this?  Surely there are old swamps which are being drained, old quarries, and so on, into which a lot of this could be dumped rather than leaving it spread over the land of <Col N="843" /> some unfortunate person who has very little land.</P>
    <P>I have a case in mind of a man who had an acre of good land attached to his garden and well over a rood of it was ruined because this spoil was dumped there.  I know the people carrying out the work must carry it out in the most economical way but some consideration should be given to this problem.</P>
    <P>Another question to which I should like to refer is that of people who have land on both sides of a stream or river that is being cleaned, deepened or widened.  Occasionally people who have land on the far side of the river find that the land is absolutely useless because they cannot get across to it unless an accommodation bridge is provided for them.  That is a problem which, with a little thought, could be dealt with fairly easily.</P>
    <P>The next matter I wish to raise is one which I mentioned last year.  It is a matter which will create a major problem for the counties in which a large amount of arterial drainage is being carried out, that is, the cost of maintenance.  There is a lot of unrest, in areas where very necessary arterial drainage work is being carried out or is about to be carried out, in regard to the actual cost of maintenance on the rates when the scheme is finished. Take the Boyne which flows through most of my constituency.  There will be a tremendous amount of good done by the drainage of the Boyne and all the other rivers leading into it.  Much land which hitherto has been flooded for three or four months of the year will be left in good condition.  However, there is no use in telling somebody who lives in Navan town, in Kells or in Trim that a wonderful job will be done in draining somebody's land in some other district.  You cannot persuade the people in east Meath it is a grand thing that people in north or south Meath will have their land drained and made useful when these people, according to some of the suggestions, will have to meet a very considerable extra impost on rates.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to judge whether or not the statements made are <Col N="844" /> correct.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to give some rough estimate as to what the average cost of maintenance has been, what is the pattern, if there is a pattern, so that we can have some idea of what it will cost.  If it is going to cost an exorbitant amount, is there any hope that the additional expenditure or some of the additional expenditure can be carried by the State?  I know the Parliamentary Secretary can say: &ldquo;The State has already put up £16 million to do the job.  Is that not enough?&rdquo; We are fast reaching the stage in some places where we cannot afford things we need very badly and I should hate to think that situation would be made worse because of the way these things go.</P>
    <P>I know the Office of Public Works will do everything they possibly can to help out in this matter but the matter will have to be studied now before it becomes a very real problem, and I understand it is becoming a real problem where I am.  There are small portions of rivers drained, only a matter of a few miles, and there is 6d. in the £ collected each year to pay for maintenance.  The Boyne runs right through County Meath; the Black-water runs through about a quarter of the county, and the other rivers flow through a big portion of the county. In addition, the Boyne runs through Kildare but the amount of land that it covers in Kildare is relatively small compared with the amount covered in County Meath.  Therefore, there is a lot of worry in regard to the situation which may arise.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would alleviate that by making a statement when he is concluding. I want to make it very clear that as far as I am concerned, the sooner the Boyne is done the better. The draining of the Boyne and its tributaries will do a tremendous amount of good.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other matters in regard to arterial drainage on which the Parliamentary Secretary might give assistance.  One is the bonus scheme which is in operation.  I see no reason why that should not be extended.  It is unfair that people who are working on the Feale should have <Col N="845" /> to work for pounds less than people who are working on the Broadmeadow or on the Inny.  An effort should be made to level it off because word goes round very quickly.  The trade union of which I am general secretary receive these complaints from one job to another.  The workers say : &ldquo;Why are we being left in this position while the others are getting more money?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the bonus scheme has improved the position as far as the Board of Works is concerned&mdash;I understand it has made the job to the Board of Works cheaper&mdash; is there any reason why it should not be extended as quickly as possible? I am grateful for the way in which the ninth round increase of 12 per cent has been passed on to the workers in these jobs with effect from 1st February.  That has been the general thing and I am glad it has been dealt with so expenditiously.  I think a slight mistake has been made in one area, Rosslare.  The men employed in Rosslare are working at county council rates and the Wexford County Council paid their increase on 14th January.  The Board of Works paid it on 1st February.  A slight adjustment should be made there because the Board of Works cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>If the Government and the Board of Works are not deliberately holding it up, I think, in everybody's interests, the question of the five-day week must come into operation as quickly as possible.  I know a major Government decision is required on this.  The Government, so far, have held the line that nobody in Government employment except those in the building trade should have the satisfaction of the five-day week.  But it is coming.  It must come, and an effort should be made to put it into operation in order to do away with the dissatisfaction under the scheme because of the failure of the Government and the Board of Works to operate it.  Where a big number of men work together, it causes annoyance, whereas in the case of one or two, the loss sustained would be very small, particularly if the bonus scheme is introduced.  I <Col N="846" /> would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to try to have this straightened out as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>With reference to the bog development schemes, one very extraordinary thing happened which I discussed with the Office of Public Works.  I want to refer to it briefly now.  It is a question of a job which was being done in my constituency in 1961 by a local man whose bog was being drained.  The engineer of the county council, who was to supervise the job, and the local contact man both agreed that the amount allocated was far too small, that the job would require double the amount laid down.  As a result, the scheme was cancelled. Applications were made on two further occasions and eventually, with the same contact man, the scheme was approved at an amount of money almost up to what was estimated by the engineer, but it turned out that an attempt was made to drain the bog from the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>I referred to it at the time as an effort to do what St. Fechin did in County Westmeath&mdash;to make water flow up the hill.  It drained the bog in this particular case but it did not drain the portion which was originally being drained by the scheme sanctioned in 1961.  I do not want to blame anybody on the staff of the Office of Public Works for what has happened but I think their outdoor officer who eventually approved the scheme should have had a longer look at it.  Perhaps he had not his level with him or did not see whether the river was flowing east or west.  If, in fact, the job which he sanctioned solved the problem, then the whole river would flow up through this man's turf bank.  I think a mistake was made and if it could be corrected in the coming year, somebody should have it rectified.  The old man was annoyed when he discovered he had spent several years arguing to get work done for somebody else.  Perhaps it can be said that it would not come under this Estimate, but it is bog development work and that is why I am raising it.</P>
    <P>Over the years more and more of the Special Employment Schemes as applying to the towns have been dropping in <Col N="847" /> employment content.  A smart guy in the urban council or town area who wants to get a job done in the town tries to get the Special Employment Schemes to cover the job rather than have it done out of the rates.  While that might be an admirable way of having the amenities of towns improved, if the scheme is for the purpose of giving employment, mainly to people who would not otherwise be employed, I think it is unfair that something like 20 or 25 per cent labour content or less should be shoved in to do this work when in fact the labour content should be very much higher.</P>
    <P>Occasionally the Office of Public Works have to refer the scheme back and point out that it is not the type of scheme which should qualify.  The result is that often coming up to Christmas, I find people coming to me asking whether there is any hope of having the scheme sanctioned before Christmas so that the men can get a few weeks' work.  When we check over, we find that the local council has submitted an impossible scheme and the blame is not on the Board of Works, but, in fact, is at local level. I think the Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised if he would, early in the year, check on the proposed winter schemes.  He should point out that they should not put in schemes of concrete work, which it is absolutely impossible to carry out in winter.</P>
    <P>I am glad to know that the Castle of Trim, with others, is being taken over. Trim is one of those places where there is a tremendous amount of fortifications, castles and old ruins, some of which have been attended to but others which have not.  People will say that in 50 years' time, we will not worry about it, but I think they should be looked at now.  The Parliamentary Secretary, having made a start with the castle, should recommend that further inspection be carried out in order to see how much of value exists in that area.</P>
    <P>Tara was referred to by Deputy T. Lynch.  He said Tara was safe.  I cannot agree with him.  Tara is not safe.  The Office of Public Works have <Col N="848" /> authority to acquire it compulsorily and they have in fact a considerable portion of it in their possession.  It is true that the person who owns Tara has attempted to sell it.  If he wants money, there is no good reason why he should not do so.  I think it would be stupid for somebody to offer a fraction of the value of this land.  I suggest that somebody who has an idea of the value of this type of land should negotiate with the owner of Tara and try to reach a reasonable price.  I am not a friend of his and I can speak freely.  I think anyone will find him as reasonable as anyone who owns land and knows the value of it. That should be done.  We should not wait for a German or an American to come here and put a tremendous, highly inflated value on Tara before we decide who is to take it over.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, there was talk about having a museum built there. Certain arrangements were made and a good deal of money was spent locally but the museum has not been built and there is no question of its being built for a considerable time.  Unless somebody who has a businesslike mind takes an interest in Tara now, we will be dickering and dickering, and eventually we will be buying Tara from somebody, not a native of this country, at a much higher figure than has been offered up to now.  That is a personal opinion but, as I know the place very well, I thought the opinion should be offered.</P>
    <P>People may ask what is in Tara except a couple of fields, a hill, a couple of mounds badly marked, and what attraction is that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that if the Board of Works want to acquire Tara, there is a system of arbitration which can be used.  I suggest it should be used as quickly as possible, that we should not wait until three or four times the value has been offered.  If somebody comes there from another land, as many of us are expecting will happen, and realises that Tara is the site of one of the most ancient seats of <Col N="849" /> government in the world, and puts up there a replica of some sort of what Tara was supposed to have been like thousands of years ago, the result will be that the Parliamentary Secretary or the Government will not have enough money to buy it.</P>

      <P>I wish I could be as sure of it as the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy T. Lynch are.  I sincerely believe that something like that is likely to happen in the not too distant future.  However, I do not want to hold up the House discussing Tara.  Something should be done about it.  The newspaper scare headlines should not be allowed to give the impression that there is something going on that is just not right.  If the person who owns Tara thinks he can sell it and get a price for it, we cannot say that he should not do it but an effort should be made by the State to acquire it.  It will have to be done eventually. There was a development committee there at one time but there does not seem to have been much development carried out as a result of their activities. Perhaps they did the best they could.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to coast erosion.  Perhaps he can let us know whether or not there is at present a number of proposals from local authorities before the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would expect that. Could the Parliamentary Secretary say whether or not there will be a difficulty about engineering staff when the question of examination of these works arises?  If that is so, we should now make provision for staff rather than wait until all the works come in because when the matter becomes a live issue, as it will before very long, there <Col N="850" /> will be no point in the Parliamentary Secretary coming in here and saying that the Office of Public Works are doing the best they can but that they cannot get engineers.  It will be just too bad if that stage is reached.</P>
      <P>An excellent effort is being made with regard to the erection of schools. I asked a question of a Minister last week and made a comment at the end of it which was a slur not on the work of the Parliamentary Secretary, but on the system.  It was a case where repairs had been carried out and an addition had been made to a school.  The work was completed but for one hour's painting work.  For three long months, that school was left in that condition. Some of the children were attending an old broken-down school which had been closed the year before.  Other children were attending the newly-repaired school while workmen's material was scattered around the place.  The fact that the work could have been finished was proven because when I put down a question on Friday, the job was finished and the children were attending the school by the following Thursday.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an example of what is happening.  If I took the Parliamentary Secretary up correctly, I do not think it is a good idea that the contracts for school building should be grouped.  I think what the Parliamentary Secretary had in mind is that where there are 40 or 50 schools to be erected, contractors would be invited to tender for that number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, maybe 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise the effect that will have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time, <Col N="851" /> contractors can tender for individual schools.  You get a global figure of 20.  A man might not take on 20.  He might not be big enough.  We can also get tenders for each individual school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will realise that if there are 20 schools being built and there is a global tender for 20 schools by one of the bigger contractors, he may cut the price because of the fact that he is doing a big job and can handle it in a certain way.  The smaller contractor can be completely cut out.  In addition, the big contractor who will be carrying out all the jobs may find, as many of them who are carrying out housing schemes at present find, that he has so much on hand that he is unable to carry it out and, after six months or 12 months he may say that he is terribly sorry, that he is unable to complete the work in the time and ask for an extension of the time.  I should not like to see the smaller contractor, who is doing such good work in the erection of schools, cut out by this system of asking the big contractors to carry out a group scheme.  The smaller man would be cut out and he is giving very good employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>He might not be cut out because we pay every month and he can get credit from the merchants for three to six months.  The small man has just as good a chance in this matter as the big contractor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that the smaller man may not be able to compete as far as prices are concerned.  It may mean that schools will be built at less cost.  However, we will see what the position is next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The underlying idea is speed and a certain amount of saving but, particularly, the speed of erection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it will have the opposite effect.  However, the Parliamentary Secretary has a better idea of what is happening than I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> There is another matter that may have nothing to do with the Parliamentary Secretary but which perhaps he would discuss with his colleague the Minister for Education.  Time and again, when new schools have been built, within a period of two or three years it is found that they are not big enough to house the number of children attending them and additions have to be made or new schools have to be built.  Is there any possibility that, for the little extra cost, a bigger school can be erected where the population trends would suggest that a bigger school should be provided?</P>
    <P>At present there are a number of schools, even in my constituency, to which additions have had to be made. The one I referred to a few minutes ago is an example, where an addition had to be made.  There are cases where additional schools have had to be built after two or three years because the schools originally provided were not big enough to house the children attending them.  I know that it is difficult to gauge population trends but it does seem rather ridiculous that within three or four years of a school being built the necessity should arise for a bigger school.  The cost would be much less if proper steps were taken initially to cater for the probable school-going population.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the provision of water and sewerage facilities in as many schools as possible. In this respect he might go ahead of the ordinary proposals.  Where a school has been condemned or it is expected it will be replaced, is there any way in which the gun can be jumped and some type of water and sewerage facilities provided for that old school?  It is a shocking state of affairs that so many schools have no sanitation.  There may be 40, 50 or 100 children attending that school for the next five to ten years.  In such circumstances, the Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised to have water and sewerage laid on, from a health point of view, apart from anything else.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the provision of houses for the Garda.  I have an idea about this which may not coincide with the ideas other people may have on the <Col N="853" /> subject.  In country districts where houses are being built for the Garda, I suggest that they should not be built beside the barracks but should be sited in outlying centres of population.  The Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate my reason for making the suggestion. If adopted, there would be perhaps less of the teddyboy type of hooliganism which, unfortunately, breaks out from time to time in country districts, even in the best regulated towns and villages. These things do happen and the presence of a guard in the district has an amazing effect.  If that idea were followed up, it might solve the problem.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says that no final decision has been made on the design of the Garden of Remembrance.  If that is the case, it looks to me as if we will not be able to open it for the next couple of years. When the final decision regarding the design has been taken, that decision has to be put into effect.  I know the work is being rushed ahead.  You got a little assistance from a lorry last week and more of it fell than should have fallen.  Something worse might happen if the work is not completed quickly.</P>
    <P>The work done under the Special Employment Schemes and the Rural Improvement Schemes is generally carried out by county council workers. When they are employed on that work, for some extraordinary reason, the workers who have been working a 45 hour, five day week for the council find themselves working a 5½ day, 48 hour week for the Office of Public Works. That is difficult to explain to people who are working under the same supervision and doing the same type of work.  They do not understand why they should have to work on Saturday morning.  Some people may consider that this is a matter which is not worth raising here but it affects every county in the country and we have complaints from all over about it.  The good offices of the Parliamentary Secretary might be used to see that this practice comes to an end before the end of the present season.</P>
    <P>Let me say that the Office of Public Works has taken a great turn for the <Col N="854" /> better over the past few years.  The influence of the Parliamentary Secretary on that Office is quite evident to everyone. There is a number of matters that we can still talk about.  We can object to this, that and the other thing but it is good to see so many things being done so much better now than they were a few years ago.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by Deputy T. Lynch to the Press facilities in this House.  I was glad to understand that the Parliamentary Secretary is making arrangements to improve these facilities but would it be too much to ask him that a certain amount of priority should be given to this work?  I know that when the Dáil is in recess, the major proportion of the work here as far as the Pressmen are concerned has been done but it is ridiculous that any group of people should be asked to work here under conditions such as those under which they have had to work.  If my information is correct, these conditions have not improved very much over the past 40 years. Recently there was a room available downstairs which was offered to them and I know that if such a room was offered to the Pressmen of any other nation, a very strong reply would be given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would whisper to his colleagues to answer our questions here at the first go-off so that we will not have to ask half a dozen supplementaries we might adjourn very early.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the two Deputies who have spoken from the Opposition benches I wish to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and his staff on the efficient report they have presented here.  The Parliamentary Secretary's Office deals with minor employment schemes, rural improvement schemes and bog drainage schemes and I was wondering if all the Gaeltacht schemes could not be put in the hands of the local authorities. The local authorities have the <Col N="855" /> machinery to do these schemes and if they were asked they would be quick to take them over.</P>
      <P>We in County Galway get a fairly substantial sum under the bog development scheme but it is mostly spent in the eastern part of the county and we in the west are left lagging behind in that respect.  The majority of the turbary rights in the west have been cut almost to rock bottom.  Now the tenants have to move further afield to get sufficient turbary for the heating of their homes in the winter.  There are great stretches of turbary nearer to the villages than where they now have to go, which could be used if they were properly drained.</P>
      <P>There is a certain amount of delay in the inspection of rural improvement schemes.  I know there is a big waiting list but the work could be stepped up by the use of more inspection staff.  I was sorry to hear that one of the engineers died last week while he was actually on his way to an inspection in my county.</P>
      <P>Slips and piers are something we need very much in the west and the work on them needs to be stepped up. In the past three or four years, the use of these slips and piers for the landing of boats has increased considerably. With the seaweed factories now in the west, people are going out to cut seaweed and they find it difficult to get suitable landing places.  There are old slips and piers in existence and it would not cost a very large sum of money to put some of them in a condition in which they could be used for landing seaweed.  The small farmers in the west also cut seaweed and use it as manure and they also use the slips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Board of Works people go to inspect these places, they insist on quite impossible standards.  We have cases where applications are made and the Department of the Gaeltacht are prepared to give a certain sum, but if it goes beyond that figure the application must be submitted to other Departments&mdash;Agriculture and Fisheries.  I submit that those two Departments should get in at the start in the matter of pier erection where the estimated cost of the pier is more than that <Col N="856" /> which the Department of the Gaeltacht are prepared to meet.</P>
    <P>On the question of new schools, I suggest there should be a standard plan to avoid the delays which occur at the moment.  The manager is asked for a certain sum and when that is forthcoming there should be nothing to prevent the immediate advertisement for tenders.  The advertisement should be issued within at least six weeks after the manager has intimated the money will be forthcoming.  The Parliamentary Secretary should take action to see that these delays are avoided wherever possible.</P>
    <P>I should like both in the House and outside it to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and his engineers for the final clearing up of the drainage works undertaken in the Killanin, Moycullen and Collanamuck districts. I should like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary most sincerely because he has relieved the lot of several farmers and has added considerably to their acreage.  They are more than grateful to him for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When I read the special expenditure contemplated on public buildings, typical of which is the estimate under Subhead B&mdash;works, alterations and additions&mdash;of £1,788,000 for the new headquarters of the Department of Social Welfare in Dublin, it struck me as a strange anachronism that we should be preparing to appropriate £1,788,000 for a new headquarters for that Department, while at the same time the houses are falling down on the people's heads in Dublin and their families are being put into institutions because there are no houses for them to live in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have put down a motion to refer the Vote back, which rather widens the scope of the discussion.  It brings into our purview the general consideration of policy relating to the outlet of money under this Vote.  It seems a shocking thing that a Government who have so signally failed to meet the housing shortage in Dublin and in other towns and cities throughout the country should be boasting of the vast sums they have available to <Col N="857" /> build public buildings of one kind or another at a time when we are sending families into institutions because their houses are falling down and there are no houses available to put them into.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the responsibility of the Government of which he is a member.  I comment on it because I think it is a grave reflection on the whole approach to this question.  The Government should be marshalling the resources of the State for the advantage of our people.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, dealing with erection of schools, commented on the difficulty of providing water and sewerage in some schools he proposes to erect.  I invite him to consult with the Minister for Education with a view to further investigating the question of whether, in consultation with the parochial or diocesan manager, this difficulty could not be overcome in certain areas where the clerical manager would be prepared to contemplate a new departure.</P>
      <P>The circumstances in which the Parliamentary Secretary finds difficulty are mainly, I imagine, in respect of relatively remote, small schools and perhaps one or two relatively substantial schools.  If the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Education got together it would be possible for them in some such cases to find agreement for a plan not to replace the small school but rather to build one good central parochial school and provide a transport system to bring the children to the school in the morning.</P>
      <P>I realise this could only be done on the initiative of the Minister for Education, but if the Parliamentary Secretary is finding the difficulty to which he refers, the readiest solution is the one I have proposed.  He would require the consent of the Minister for Education and of the diocesan authority and I believe in some areas at least that consent would be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a solution of the problem would not only remove the Parliamentary <Col N="858" /> Secretary's difficulty but would confer a very material benefit on the parish, first, because there would be a fine modern school with all amenities, which would be permissive when one had the larger attendance which a central parochial school would provide; secondly, you would not have your teachers scattered all over in remote schools because you would have a group of perhaps eight or ten teachers assembled in one academic centre; and thirdly, such a substantial unit would provide the ground on which you could build to provide secondary and technical schools, thus building up a valuable academic centre in the parish to the advantage of everyone concerned.</P>
    <P>In this country we regard as an insuperable problem the provision of transport for school children.  Anybody who has lived abroad knows that throughout rural America the system has been in operation for 40 years. All it involves is the gathering of the children at appropriate spots, the sites of the old abandoned schools, and drawing them thence into the central school in the morning and back to the sites of the old schools in the evening to make their own way home from where the old schools used to be.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, in a situation in which he finds these problems confronting him, he should take counsel with the Minister for Education to find out if a solution to some, at least, of these problems might not be found on the lines I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I am glad to read that the preparation of plans for the erection of a preventive centre at Finglas is well advanced, and even more pleased to learn that construction work will commence this year.  I notice, however, there are the rather alarming words &ldquo;It is hoped&rdquo;.  I have been agitating for proper accommodation of this kind for many, many years.  I understand that the Dublin Preventive Centre is to take the place of what used to be Summerhill detention centre, which was subsequently transferred to another premises, and is now to go to Finglas.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that, when these <Col N="859" /> premises are made available, the Government will take action to ensure that they are properly staffed.  It would be a tragic thing if we built a relatively satisfactory premises for this purpose and allowed it to be staffed on gravely inadequate standards, the type of standards on which it has been staffed heretofore.  However, I recognise this as a matter to be taken up more reasonably with the Minister for Education on his Vote as I believe the maintenance and staffing of this centre are his responsibility.  I welcome the transfer from the present premises to something that will be more satisfactory and I shall take up the question of proper staffing with the Minister for Education in due course.</P>
    <P>I learn, with regret, from the Parliamentary Secretary that, having considered the proposal for a special independent body to deal comprehensively with monuments, he thought it better to defer the idea for the time being.  I heard general approbation of the proposal to set up such a body.  Is there any particular reason why the matter is being deferred for the time being?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it would be in the public interest to know why the matter is being deferred.  It seemed to me to be a good idea and a departure <Col N="860" /> on the right lines in that it proposed to set up an independent body which would concern itself to serve areas of activity, which it could draw to the attention of the Board of Works and, in a sympathetic and co-operative way, work with the Board of Works to see that that which was necessary would be done as soon as opportunity offered.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary has at last awakened to the fact that without aerial photography archaeological survey in this day and age is virtually impossible.  I note with great satisfaction that Dr. St. Joseph of Cambridge University has made a partial survey aerially of selective sites. I also notice that the Parliamentary Secretary says he has discovered that aerial survey is of great assistance for drainage survey work and that the Air Corps is providing this service.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that this piecemeal approach to this problem is really inadequate.  On many occasions I have suggested that we should undertake, either through the Air Force or through another agency that it may prove advantageous to employ, a complete aerial survey of the country.  I have repeatedly pointed out here that such an aerial survey would be most valuable from the archaeological point of view, that it would be most valuable from the arterial drainage point of view, and also most valuable from the point of view of the work being done by Foras Talúntais for the general survey of the land at large.</P>
      <P>We are now doing this work in bits and pieces for the archaeological division of the Board of Works.  We are doing it in bits and pieces for the arterial drainage section of the Board of Works.  I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that, if he would consult with the Minister for Agriculture and, possibly, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, to whom these surveys might be of considerable value, and the Department of Lands, he would discover that the needs of all these Departments put together would abundantly justify a complete aerial survey being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems of these aerial <Col N="861" /> surveys is that they must be done in winter because they must be done when the leaves are off the trees; otherwise, much of the survey is lost through deciduous trees obscuring the land under them.  Therefore, there is a restricted period in which the survey can be done satisfactorily because, in our winter conditions, very frequently atmospheric conditions do not permit of a survey being made.  Not only have you to do the survey in winter but you have to choose the type of weather.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, instead of doing it in bits and pieces, he should get authority to do the whole job.  I do not believe it would cost much more than the piecemeal approach and, once done, it would be a record of incalculable value.  I acknowledge that, in trying to fix a survey to meet the requirements of a variety of Departments, you may run up against the difficulty that one Department may want the survey done from one height and another would prefer to have it done from a different height; but I believe these requirements could be substantially reconciled and, in any case, a complete aerial survey would enable the Parliamentary Secretary to pinpoint those areas requiring closer survey for specific purposes, whether archaeological or arterial drainage, and these could be undertaken on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
    <P>I want to urge on the Parliamentary Secretary that, in the absence of such a complete survey as I suggest to him, a vast treasure of archaeological remains may be lost because I am informed by those competent to speak that Ireland, owing to its peculiar history, is probably one of the richest archaeological laboratories in the world.  We escaped the Roman invasion and there survive here archaeological remains which I understand are of incomparable value.  The tragedy is that, <Col N="862" /> without aerial survey, many of them exist unknown to anybody.  I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary has had brought to his attention the survey that was made of Cruachan in County Roscommon, but I have already directed his attention to the fact that on that site the peripatetic survey revealed five archaeological sites while the aerial survey turned up nearly 50, the existence of which was quite unknown to anybody until that survey was made.  I believe a similar experience would be had in many other parts of the country, but it will not be available unless the general survey is made, and the awful danger is that, with the passing of every year, many of these sites are being irrevocably destroyed and obliterated.</P>

      <P>A patient, such as the Deputy refers to in his question, whose social welfare benefit exceeds the maximum appropriate weekly allowance payable under the regulations, including the rent allowance, would not ordinarily be entitled to an infectious disease allowance.

It is only very rarely that an applicant states why he is not proceeding with a loan.  It should also be borne in mind that many of the loans sanctioned in a certain financial year are not and cannot be issued until the following financial year.  It is not correct to assume that, because the number of loans approved in the period 1st May, 1963 to 8th April, 1964, exceeded the number issued by 915, all these 915 applications will not be proceeded with.

      <P>Local authorities do not carry out rural improvements schemes or minor employment schemes on behalf of the Special Employment Schemes Office, but in some counties the county engineers, in their personal capacity, act as agent inspectors for the carrying out of these schemes, and also bog development schemes.  To cover the value of the technical and clerical services rendered, the county engineers concerned are paid fees on a sliding scale ranging from 6 per cent to 4? per cent of the actual annual expenditure on the schemes.</P>
      <P>Applications for rural improvements scheme grants are considered individually as they are received.  When the report and estimate have been furnished by the inspector, and assuming the scheme is suitable, an offer of a grant is issued to the applicants' representative, conditional on the payment of the appropriate local contribution. When this has been paid authority is issued to proceed with the approved scheme.</P>
      <P>The funds provided each year for minor employment schemes are allocated to the electoral divisions having each a specified minimum number of unemployment assistance recipients, and in proportion to the numbers of such persons.  Schemes to absorb the allocations for the separate electoral divisions are selected from the pool of suitable proposals awaiting attention, preference being given to the works having the greatest utility in relation to their cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland) (for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The emergency calls in question were not received at the exchange.  From the information available to the Department, it would appear that they were attempted at and shortly before 12.20 a.m.  Calls on the 999 system had been received at 9.21 p.m., 10.08 p.m., 11.30 p.m. and 11.36 p.m., and further calls were received at 12.34 a.m. and 12.36 a.m.  It is, therefore, established that the system was functioning normally both shortly before and shortly after the time of the unsuccessful attempts.</P>
      <P>At 2.0 a.m. it was found that a mechanical fault had developed on part of the apparatus.  The fault was cleared immediately.</P>
      <P>There is no way of knowing whether the mechanical defect existed at 12.20 a.m.  If it did, it would not by itself have prevented emergency signals being received and answered.  If the defect did not exist, the system could still have been rendered temporarily ineffective by callers dialling 999 and then leaving the receivers off the rests, thus producing an engaged condition on the emergency circuits.  It is unfortunately the case that the 999 system is seriously abused by members of the public, particularly at night, and that the great majority of emergency calls received are bogus.</P>
      <P>There is no question of failure to answer immediately any 999 signals received at the exchange.  Emergency calls set off a hooter in the switchroom as well as lighting special calling lamps.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.  &mdash;(Deputy T. Lynch.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The only other matter to which I want to refer relates to the provision for Employment and Emergency Schemes.  The total provision for that Vote today is £920,500 as compared with £731,200 in 1956-57, but, of course, we are without £250,000 which was then available under the <Col N="879" /> Local Authorities (Works) Act which did so much useful minor work in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunately a fact that although we have subheads for urban employment schemes, rural employment schemes, minor employment schemes, bog development schemes, rural improvement schemes and miscellaneous schemes, none of these heads seems to be wide enough to cover the kind of work that was habitually done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act in relation to the removal of obstacles from minor rivers.  That is a condition continually obtaining in many parts of Monaghan and other parts of the country where a river may not require drainage but presents an immediate and urgent problem as a result of trees which have fallen into it or blockages which have arisen and which cause very material local inconvenience. Such works do not seem to come under any of the subheads provided in the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote and yet they urgently require to be done.  They cause quite a disproportionate amount of inconvenience if they are left undone. Useful employment is provided for local people if such works can be undertaken.  Under the Local Authorities (Works) Act they were habitually done under the supervision of the local authority engineering staff as that was the most convenient and economical way to do it.</P>
      <P>I should be glad to know if the Parliamentary Secretary would consider opening a subhead in this group of subheads which would cover those kinds of works for which the Local Authorities (Works) Act used to cater and which cannot be undertaken under the existing subhead of this Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other detail I want to mention, and it is only a detail. Recently, I communicated with the Parliamentary Secretary's Office in relation to a job under the Rural Improvements Scheme.  The story was that a laneway supplying two or three houses had been repaired under the scheme and the work of repair did not use up all the money of the original <Col N="880" /> grant.  The people who proposed the original scheme and paid their contribution returned to the local engineer and asked if he would consider completing the job by tarring the surface if the local people were prepared to make a further contribution in view of the fact that the total appropriation for the original job had not been used.  The local engineer told the local people that if they left in £30 as a local contribution to the engineer's office by a certain day, the job of tarring the road would be done. The man who acted for the people concerned proceeded to collect the £30. It took two or three days to do it, but he got it.</P>
    <P>He then went in and proceeded to deposit it but was told it would not be accepted and that the work would not be done.  I understand the reason was that it is a general rule that the Employment and Emergency Schemes Office will not tar the surface of a road that serves less than a certain number of houses.  I am not prepared to quarrel with that&mdash;you must lay down some general rule as to the minimum public service for which you undertake public expenditure&mdash;but where people go to a responsible official locally and get an undertaking to get a public service done, it is exceptional hardship to have that decision reversed by headquarters.</P>
    <P>While I would not urge that the general regulation is unreasonable, I suggest that a wise discretion might be used in cases where a mistake has occurred or a consent has been available, even though it is not in strict conformity with the accepted regulations. It is a pity that an undertaking from any authorised officer of the Board of Works, or any section of it, should be subsequently repudiated at a higher level.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make a mountain out of this because it is really a molehill but the Parliamentary Secretary will understand that what appears to be a molehill to us assumes mountainous proportions in the area concerned. I want to be most express on this: I do not like praising the Parliamentary Secretary, and I have no desire to do so, but he acts for his <Col N="881" /> Office in the House and since he must take the criticisms he is entitled to get the praise.  It is not personally directed to him.  I have always found his staff to be extremely co-operative, most helpful and understanding in every possible way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Usually the officials fully understand the special circumstances that obtain in the country and are anxious to meet the problems of Deputies and individuals on a most satisfactory basis.  I have always found the Department for which the Parliamentary Secretary is at present responsible showing zeal and a desire to discharge their duties effectively and I have no hesitation in saying that is the case today.</P>
      <P>I trust the suggestion I have made regarding the general aerial survey will receive active consideration as I think it would be a pity that public money should be wasted on a whole series of fragmentary surveys when a general survey would achieve the lesser and the greater purpose also.</P>

      <P>This Vote, for which the Parliamentary Secretary is responsible, constitutes a very large sector of State investment in building and is also a valuable aid to employment through the Employment and Emergency schemes which are operated under it. The Office of Public Works is responsible for public buildings which are many and varied, ranging from schools &mdash;one of the most important aspects&mdash; to the various other buildings Departments of State require, particularly, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone is the question of new buildings involved but also the maintenance of buildings and I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary when replying to say if a general survey in regard to additions, adaptations and improvements of these buildings is <Col N="882" /> carried out ahead of expenditure?  Is there a final figure determined in regard to the works necessary or do some of these works come up during the year, as it were?  I have in mind some of the expenditure in regard to a place like Shelton Abbey which has been under notice for several years.  Is there a final figure in regard to expenditure under this head?  Equally, in regard to the Department of Agriculture and the various works with which the Office of Public Works has to deal, is there a question of finality in these works or do they continue more or less as they come up during the year, as proposals are made?  I should like to think there was some overall scheme to which we were working. The Parliamentary Secretary might be able to indicate the extent of the problem that has to be met by his Office in that connection.</P>
    <P>The major portion of expenditure on new works generally goes to schools and it is divided between the work directly undertaken by the Office of Public Works and work undertaken by the managers who submit proposals to the office for approval.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate the total expenditure as between these two headings, the amount for which his office is directly responsible and inspection and supervision carried out by his own Department, and the amount in cases where the work is carried out by the managers with their own architects.</P>
    <P>Schools at present being erected are pleasing and the outlook for children and teachers in them is pleasant. There has been a vast improvement in the type of schools provided and any remarks I make in regard to them are intended to be helpful and to further increase the admiration people have for the type of school now being erected.  The question of the number of schools requiring replacement is something the Office of Public Works have been wrestling with for a number of years.  Under the present Parliamentary Secretary, that work has been speeded up even to the point where he contemplates the new departure of providing the prefabricated building <Col N="883" /> where the need is greatest.  I should like to hear him defend the prefabricated building in respect of rural areas.  Is it intended to deal with the problems which arise by means of what may be described as prefabricated schools?  I should like to know what is the life expectancy of such a type of school?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>It is heartening to hear that from the Parliamentary Secretary because quite a number of people wondered if they would give the same service.  I can see the problem being met in urban areas where you have a type of school which can be readily assembled and perhaps as readily taken asunder.  I think it was Deputy Tully who referred to the planning of schools particularly in rural areas and the consideration of whether the attendances are going to rise or fall.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of cases where new schools were erected and after a short time additions were needed.  I do not say that this is the fault of the Office of <Col N="884" /> Public Works.  It is something about which I will have more to say on the Vote for the Department of Education. This is a point about which we should be more generous when we are erecting these buildings and if some extra space were left at that stage, it might obviate more expenditure in perhaps ten years time when an additional classroom has to be provided.</P>
      <P>This will probably be more of a problem in the immediate years ahead as the policy of the Minister for Education is to reduce the ratio of pupils per teacher and this will lead to a need for additional classrooms. However, I am sure that is something the Parliamentary Secretary will take steps to deal with in his Office.  In regard to the schools which are being erected, they are well-designed and well-built and many of those which I have seen have very pleasant colour schemes.  This is new and it is a pleasing feature and shows an advanced outlook. Indeed, this has a marked effect on the children who spend quite a share of their young lives within these buildings.</P>
      <P>Many of my points are small points and perhaps technical but I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will not object if I mention them.  I have mentioned them to the Department of Education and they seem to think that they should be mentioned to the Office of Public Works.  In regard to room size and the standard number of pupils expected to occupy a room, say, 36, or 40 or 48 pupils, it should be possible to allow for extra space&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have increased the standard recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but I am suggesting that perhaps you could be even more generous to allow for the problem of the extra eight or ten pupils in a school and where the erection of a separate classroom would not be justified.  In the normal type of rural school where you have two rooms, then if one were of extra generous proportions, it would cater for that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the question of windows in schools.  They are large and <Col N="885" /> airy and afford plenty of light but one thing I have noticed is the diversion of interest where windows are low down and the lower panes are not opaque.  If something more exciting is happening in the immediate vicinity outside, it is very difficult to hold the interest of the class.  I know it does not look well to use that type of glass in the lower sections but the necessity is created for making those lower panes opaque if class interest is to be maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This brings up the question of television sets being turned on while children are doing their lessons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is a continuing problem and I suppose various ways will have to be resorted to to cope with the situations which arise.  Modern conditions are not similar to conditions when I was growing up. Another point is in regard to the placing of the catches on the windows. There is no ready way to open or close the windows except to climb on to a stool or a chair.  I do not know whether it is within the province of the Parliamentary Secretary's Department to devise some way of getting over this but I would suggest if this is not the case in the new buildings, that something in the nature of a stepladder stool should be provided as well as a pole for lifting and lowering the windows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of the perforated board for charts and maps is a very welcome innovation and I want to pay tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department for this advanced idea. One of the things of most benefit in a classroom, to teachers and to pupils, is that these charts and maps should be readily on display and this board should be standard equipment in all classrooms in future.  Another minor point is in regard to the placing of a map rail.  The Parliamentary Secretary will have noticed that because of the placing of the blackboard&mdash;in front of the pupils, naturally&mdash;the rail overhead does not extend or come down and consequently maps have to hang on the rail at the end wall.  I think it <Col N="886" /> would be practical to have the map enclosed in a map case in front of the class and have a simple type pulley to lower or raise it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary in consultation with the Minister for Education, would regard as standard equipment the inclusion of clocks in classrooms.  A most important thing in the lives of pupils from the very beginning is the matter of working to a routine and of being punctual.  A clock is very important in any classroom.</P>
    <P>In regard to the modern sanitary facilities provided in schools, they are of a very high order and first-class material is used.  I am not the only teacher who feels that the siting of these within the school building is not very often the most suitable.  I know many arguments can be adduced in this respect.  Some people say that for the comfort of the children, they ought to be readily accessible within the building itself.  That is all right until something goes wrong with the system and then what was an amenity becomes very much a monstrosity. More thought should be given as to where these sanitary blocks are to be located in the building of the future, but certainly they should not be in close proximity to the rooms where teachers and a large number of pupils congregate for several hours a day.</P>
    <P>The type of furniture provided for schoolrooms at the present time is very appropriate.  However, if furniture has to be moved&mdash;and that happens very often because children will move furniture&mdash;it tends to damage the walls. If a timber railing were erected at about the height of the furniture in the classrooms, it would protect the walls.</P>
    <P>As regards heating, the Department has changed its mind in that it is now more inclined to arrange oil heating within the schools than storage heating. It is very hard for the manager of a school to make up his mind, without proper information, as to which system he ought to use.  The Office of Public Works should be in a position, from its experience, to advise which is the better system, not alone from the point of view of heating but from the <Col N="887" /> point of view of maintenance and running costs, because there is also the problem of the local contribution which must be faced in all these cases. I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give the views of the Office of Public Works in regard to this question.</P>
    <P>One thing I can never understand is why the architects in the Office of Public Works do not advert to the extra large dash which is used on the outside walls of schools.  Children must run about and play and even in the best regulated schools, accidents will happen.  If a child falls against one of these walls serious injury could be caused.  No matter how much supervision there is these accidents can happen and in the ordinary way the parent, feeling incensed, will hold the teacher responsible while the children are under his care.  Several teachers and managers have mentioned this matter.  I suggest the walls, particularly the lower portion, should have a plain finish; then there would be less risk of injury to young children than with the large type of dash used on these walls.  I am glad to see variety has been introduced into the finish of school buildings.  The colour scheme is made to fit in with the surroundings and the result is very pleasant.</P>
    <P>No progress which can be made in regard to the school building programme will be too fast for the people whose children attend school and for the teachers.  I realise the limitations imposed on the Office of Public Works by the inadequacy of staff to deal with these matters.  That has been borne out during the past couple of years by the fact that the Office of Public Works has not been able to deal with all the work that has fallen to it.  I noted from the Parliamentary Secretary's report that there is still this problem of trying to fill staff vacancies.  That is hard to understand but I suppose the explanation given here on several occasions is the true one, that more attractive terms are available in other employment.  As regards the building programme, quite a large amount of building will be undertaken by managers on their own. <Col N="888" /> Even so, the Parliamentary Secretary has quite a large building programme on his hands.  I wish him well in proceeding with it and I hope the records he has created in this matter will be equalled or exceeded in the coming year.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the National Building Agency which has dealt with some of the work which would fall to the Office of Public Works or the Department of Justice in regard to the provision of housing for Garda personnel and other State personnel in areas where houses are not readily available to them.  When the National Building Agency Bill was before the House, some very interesting figures emerged. I forget the exact figures but the position was that the cost of building houses through the National Building Agency compared very favourably with that of houses built under local auspices.  I hope, for the improvement of housing, that that scheme will expand.  As a matter of fact, if the Parliamentary Secretary could take some of this information to the Department of Local Government, it might help in regard to some of the backlog in housing generally which falls to be dealt with by that Department.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to say, in regard to the Garda Barracks at Templemore, whether we have a final figure.  That matter came up for discussion last year at the Committee of Public Accounts.  I know the Office of Public Works have a certain amount of responsibility for it.  It is taken in their Vote but the actual supervision work was really under the Department of Justice.  The original figure, I think, was £435,000.  I think I interpreted the Parliamentary Secretary correctly as saying, that at the moment, that has gone to over £700,000.  This has been done on the ordinary contract basis rather than on a definite system which was introduced for this particular type of work and a definite type of cost.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to say if he is satisfied that this type of procedure, although it may on this occasion have had to be indulged in, is the type which will give the best value for the money which has to be <Col N="889" /> expended, and whether the cost, both from the point of view of supervision and architects' fees, is in keeping with what is normally within the practice of the planned campaign, as adopted by the Office of Public Works?</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the arterial drainage scheme and the embankment scheme are making good progress.  I want to pay tribute to the work being done under both headings.  I have seen the work at close quarters in my own constituency, both from the point of view of drainage and from the point of view of embankments.  I want, personally, to pay tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary for his work in that connection and for his readiness to assist people in emergency conditions arising from flooding in their areas.</P>
    <P>There is one point to which I should like to draw his attention, that is, in relation to large machines being used on those drainage schemes today. When these large machines travel over land, they create quite an amount of damage at certain times of the year. The removal of the spoil from the stream and its placing at what I consider to be an inordinate distance from the stream itself is something which is hardly justified.  I think more regard should be had to the size of the little stream which is being dealt with, and the spoil should not be placed so far from the bank.  In that way a smallholder can lose a considerable portion of his land if the stream runs quite a distance through it.</P>
    <P>I also want to speak about boundaries between farms.  We use a word for those in County Limerick, which I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will recognise, and that is &ldquo;súls&rdquo;.  They are erected where the stream passes from one farm into the next and where something has to be done to stop cattle going through. This word comes from the Irish word for &ldquo;eye&rdquo;.  I have seen some of these opened up and the timber hanging loose.  This is caused by cattle in the stream raising their heads and lifting the timber away.  Consequently, you have quite an amount of trouble created between neighbouring farms because the cattle get on to tillage or <Col N="890" /> meadow land.  This is a small thing but is something which should be looked into.</P>
    <P>The amount of very good work, which is being done under those schemes, is very commendable.  I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether the maintenance charges which are recovered from county councils are sufficient or fall short of those which are necessary to keep those boundaries properly maintained?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that; but is the amount recovered for the work done sufficient or is it more than sufficient?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed at one stage it was less than what was needed but at another it was over it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to Vote No. 10, Employment and Emergency Schemes, I presume the number of counties where the county engineer's services are still used has not changed a great deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect it is still about the same.  I recollect, on a previous occasion, that the work done could, in fact, be done as well, and perhaps more cheaply, if the personnel to deal with it were available in the Department. There is also the problem of recruiting the necessary officers to do the job.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to electoral divisions in regard to employment and emergency schemes.  Is the electoral division referred to here the county council division, the local government division or is it purely a local division?  Is it the county health district?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="891" />
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>It just struck me there must be quite a job in employment exchanges keeping track of the number employed in any particular electoral division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>You take the same time every year, the third week in January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>We used to have an old division in County Limerick, the Glin division.  It is not there now.  Rath-keale, Abbeyfeale, Newcastle West and Glin are all registered now under Newcastle West.  I wonder how they are able to keep them segregated.  The same applies to bog development.  The schemes are allocated in a certain fashion and I wonder how the situation arises that some bogs come under that division and others do not.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of development work, would the Parliamentary Secretary consider, at this time of the year, whether it should not be allowable that work on the preparation of sites for the development of housing schemes ought not to rank for the type of work which could be engaged in by local authorities within that sphere?  We use it for roads at the present time.  I think if we used it for access roads to sites and site development work, it would materially help the problem in regard to housing.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that there is an increase in the amount being made available for these schemes because at the time of year when they come into operation, there is usually a problem in regard to employment in the urban areas which of course, peculiarly, does not exist in rural areas.  If the Parliamentary Secretary can do anything to provide employment at the end of the year, it will certainly be very commendable.  I should like him to consider whether or not he could assist local authorities in the country by allowing that type of work to qualify for some of these grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works, over which the Parliamentary Secretary presides, is a very important office. Personally, I have found the Parliamentary <Col N="892" /> Secretary most helpful in any matter in respect of which I have approached him.  He has brought to that Office a very forward look.  He has received great co-operation in general and within his Department. The Office of Public Works has a vast amount of work to do and does that vast amount of work very well.</P>
    <P>I should like to think that the technical staff in the Office would bear in mind the points that have been made of minor detail in regard to schools, arterial drainage schemes, spawning, and so on.  Such consideration on their part would be deeply appreciated. There should be deep appreciation of the amount of work which falls to be done, and is being done very well, by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyGMillar" hpid="Mr. Millar Mr. Millar">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Millar</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, let me congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the splendid work he has done since taking over this very important office, the Office of Public Works.  In any dealings that I have had with the Parliamentary Secretary personally he has been most co-operative.  He has given great attention to detail.  I have much evidence of that and wish to thank him sincerely for it because, as I have said, he presides over a very important office, which covers a very wide field of activity.  Personally, I think it is a Minister who should be presiding over the office.  Consideration should be given to the feasibility of having the office raised to a Ministry.</P>
      <P>I intervene in this debate because I am mainly interested in the very important problem of drainage, particularly in regard to four rivers.  My main interest is, of course, in the Shannon, which has a catchment area of some 4,554 square miles; in the Suck, which has a catchment area of 618 square miles; in the Killimor, which has a catchment area of 150 square miles and the Dunkellin-Killimor, which has a slightly smaller catchment area of 149 square miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of drainage has been recognised in this country for many years.  In 1955 or 1956, the Government invited Mr. Rydell to report on the question of drainage, special <Col N="893" /> emphasis being laid on drainage of the river Shannon.  Mr. Rydell made certain recommendations at that time.  He recommended that certain investigations be carried out.  On 6th June, 1961, a joint report on the first stage of those investigations was submitted by the Office of Public Works and the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to quote at great length from this report, which makes many recommendations.  One could speak all day on these recommendations.  I should, however, like to refer to the speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary when introducing the Estimate for the Office of Public Works on 17th May, 1962, where he stated:</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be well to recount briefly the various stages in the development of a drainage scheme.  The catchment has to be surveyed, the data obtained, plotted and studied, and a design of works evolved.  This work must be carefully done by skilled men and the time consumed on it is unavoidable to get good results without wasteful expenditure.  A formal scheme is then prepared.  This is a comprehensive document embodying detailed maps and showing the works proposed to be carried out and proposed interference with properties.  The scheme has to go on exhibition locally and notices must be served on the persons whose property will be interfered with.  Persons affected may lodge observations within a month. The local authority has three months in which to lodge observations.  All observations have to be considered by the Commissioners who then have to consult with certain other Government Departments.  Finally the scheme is submitted to the Minister for Finance for confirmation.  All these steps can take several years for a large scheme and even for the small intermediate schemes, up to two years are needed.  The reason I go into detail in this connection is that, first, I had to obtain this information for my own benefit and, secondly, I appreciate the fact that there are many new Deputies here to whom this explanatory statement may be of assistance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> That statement was made on 17th May, 1962.  I do not for one moment suggest that no progress has been made with regard to this very serious problem of flooding on the Shannon since 17th May, 1962, but I sometimes feel that we are not putting enough effort into all this.  In my opinion, there is nothing so important as drainage. If we are to have increased productivity, better grass lands, a prerequisite is a very ambitious drainage programme.</P>
    <P>Several damaging ill-effects result from excess water.  First of all, excess water results in the exclusion of air, which considerably reduces microbe activity, nitrate and root activity.  It results in a decreased feeding area. This is a point that it is well to note: it takes five times as much heat to raise the temperature of water one degree as it takes to raise the temperature of an equal amount of soil.  Excess water in soil reduces soil temperature. Dry soils have a good crumb structure. Wet soils never have.  This is a very important point.  One can go as far as to say that there cannot be early growth without good crumb structure in the soil.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the problem of flooding on the Shannon cannot be successfully dealt with overnight.  It will be many years before the problem is solved.  Indeed, it is quite possible that it will never be solved to the full satisfaction of everybody concerned.  I think Mr. Rydell said that in his report.  I cannot get the reference just now but I think he did point out that it would not be an economic proposition to carry out all the recommendations he made.  However, in some way, at least, I disagree with Mr. Rydell because I believe that no matter how much money is spent on drainage, it is money very well spent, indeed.</P>
    <P>I am also interested in the river Suck but I fully appreciate that you cannot tackle the Suck flood problem until you have first tackled successfully the Shannon problem.  Mr. Rydell recommends in his report that the Suck be diverted and he even recommends that a canal be cut at the lower part of the Suck reducing the <Col N="895" /> amount of water flowing into the Shannon.  Some people may think I am emphasising this matter too much but a large part of my constituency is affected by this flooding.  When I came in here in 1958, I was invited to Clonfert, which is part of my constituency and also to Meelick and I saw the most terrible sights imaginable.  I saw thousands of acres of potentially good land under water.  All one could see was miles and miles of water dotted with cocks of hay.</P>
    <P>That land was useless after the floods subsided and was useless the following year.  Lands that are subject to much flooding are likely to be breeding grounds for fluke and worms which kill many of our cattle and sheep.  I come from a county that at one time produced one-third of the total sheep population of the country.  That proportion has now dropped to about one-fifth and in that area people have great difficulty in keeping the number of sheep they would like to because of the flood problem.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to do his utmost to ensure that there will be no undue delay in putting into effect many of the recommendations contained in this report.</P>
    <P>Another river in which I am interested is the Killimor, with a catchment area of 150 square miles.  Work on it was started a few years ago and I must compliment the Parliamentary Secretary and his engineering staff on the wonderful work they are doing down there.  It is very much appreciated by the people whose land was previously affected by flooding from this river.  While the machinery is down there the Parliamentary Secretary should issue a directive requesting the drainage of more small rivers that are related to the Killimor catchment area.  There may be a very good argument against this but there is also a very good case to be made for it.  It can be appreciated that when you bring large machinery into an area and it is working there it is easy to extend the activity of the machines to smaller drains not included in the catchment area but not too far away.</P>
    <P>Day after day I get letters from <Col N="896" /> people asking me to have their particular drains included in the Killimor catchment area.  I can do nothing but pass the letters on to the Parliamentary Secretary who gives them every consideration but sometimes he finds it impossible to accede to my request.  He has satisfied a great number of people in this locality and they certainly appreciate it.</P>
    <P>The problem of spoil is one which we cannot avoid when tackling a big job.  So far I have not had many complaints but there have been a few, usually from people with very small holdings.  I should like that in these cases spoil should be kept to the lowest possible minimum.  In some of these areas the farms are very small; they cannot be ranched and the farmers go in for a very intensive type of farming.  Some of the lands are used for the production of celery and other crops of that type which can be sold to a processing factory which has been set up near Banagher.  When the Corrib-Clare was being drained there was a very big problem with spoil and people wrote to me regarding compensation. So far I have had only one or two complaints from people affected by the Killimor river drainage.</P>
    <P>People listening to me may think that flooding is the only problem in Galway but we have another river there with a catchment area of 149 square miles which requires to be attended to.  This is the Dunkellin river and I am glad to see, from page 15 of the Parliamentary Secretary's brief, that it is hoped to begin the survey and design work on this scheme this year.  It causes a lot of flooding and as this is a sheep area it reduces the number of sheep farmers are able to hold.  The flooding is at its worst at New Inn and the contiguous area. It is, however, encouraging to note that a beginning is to be made this year on that river.  It is very welcome news.</P>
    <P>On page 17 of his brief, the Parliamentary Secretary points out that, excluding civil servants, the Office of Public Works gives direct employment to about 2,800 men whose wages bill amounts to about £1,200,000.  That <Col N="897" /> number should be greatly increased and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to do all in his power to initiate further drainage activities so as to employ more in this very important national work.</P>
    <P>I feel the extra £50,000 allocated this year to the Special Employment Schemes Office is far too small.  For a long time last year people came to me to say they had made applications to this office to have certain roadworks carried out but that nothing had happened.  It was brought to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary and this year £50,000 extra is being given.  It is a step in the right direction but I hope it is only a start. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have the amount allocated under this head considerably increased when he introduces his Estimates next year.  It is the experience of Deputies that every day people come complaining that their applications in respect of roadworks and drainage schemes have not been attended to.  Finally, I should like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for the personal attention he has given to all matters I have brought to his notice at all times.</P>

      <P>A couple of years ago, I referred to the safety of children in Stephen's Green.  I mentioned the need for some sort of guard around the pond there, pointing out that there is an incline towards the water and no protection to stop one falling in.  It is most dangerous for children and two months ago a child fell in early in the morning.  Luckily, there was an adult nearby to rescue the child.  There is no rail or bar there which one could grab if slipping.  Children tend to throw food into the pond and that, of course, causes them to slip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for providing a site for a Fenian memorial in Stephen's Green.  We like the Green as a site because we know proper care will be taken by the State to preserve the memorials.  Some of the memorials in our public streets are most unsightly. I do not know who has charge of the monument near Hawkins Street but the inscription is defaced and illegible. <Col N="898" /> That is why we were anxious to get a site in the Green, on the derelict plot of the old plant house.  We are informed it is only at the sketch plan stage and that we must wait until next year for its erection.  I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will ensure that the site is ready by August, 1965 at the latest.</P>
    <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell me when the Garden of Remembrance will be completed?  Can he also say what form the memorial will take?  I am very interested in monuments and historical sites.  Those for which this Department are responsible should be inspected at least once a year and kept in good order.  They are visiting places for tourists and many of them are in a disgraceful condition. The Parliamentary Secretary should see to it that they are properly looked after.</P>
    <P>In Dublin we are confronted with a very serious problem in which the Parliamentary Secretary might be able to help.  We are in a sweat as to what to do with old people&mdash;we have nowhere to accommodate them.  The problem of accommodating families is not so severe but we have great difficulty in finding places for single old people or old couples.  We have scraped the bottom of the barrel and have found only one vacancy in the whole of Dublin, though there are 12 old people awaiting eviction before the end of the week.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could clear out some building or part of a building.  What about making the Green Street garda station available?</P>
    <P>This is not the usual sort of appeal made to the Parliamentary Secretary; it has been made to all Departments of State and the possibility is that the Parliamentary Secretary may have at his disposal a structure, or even part of a structure, which he might temporarily hand over, because, during the next 12 months, two-thirds of the old people who come out will have to stay out.  We simply have nowhere for them.  In desperation, we had to get caravans.  Between site preparation, and everything else, they are costing anything from £500 to £1,000.  If the <Col N="899" /> Parliamentary Secretary can help, I appeal to him to get in touch with the principal officer for housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>While appreciating that the Parliamentary Secretary has dealt fairly extensively with ancient monuments, it seems to me that the approach made by him and those who advise him does not exactly meet the situation.  It is an accepted fact that we here escaped the destruction of monuments that took place in other civilised countries over the centuries and we have, therefore, an opportunity of offering to those who visit us an unrivalled number of monuments scattered throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
      <P>I gather from the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that a survey of these monuments is at present taking place.  I understand that the idea is to write a detailed statement on the archaeological history of the monuments. I believe a somewhat different approach would be better.  Nearly all Americans who come here look for something that is old.  Now what we regard as old is something that has come down through several centuries. What the Americans regard as old is anything up to 100 years.  We can provide in practically every parish an ancient castle in some shape or form. The Parliamentary Secretary, his officials, and others concerned do not know the extent of these monuments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago I asked the Minister responsible for tourism if there was any particular approach from the point of view of tourism and I suggested that archaeology might prove a very attractive amenity in the off-tourist season. Subsequently.  I received a letter from the Tourist Board in which they informed me that the Board of Works had been asked to produce, on their behalf, a brochure giving a list of monuments in each county.  I have seen the brochure and, as far as my recollection goes, it consists of a couple of pages giving the more important monuments, the ones with which everybody is familiar.  What I have in mind is an up-to-date inventory of <Col N="900" /> every old castle that exists in the country.  The people who visit monuments&mdash;even the Americans have their archaeological and historical societies &mdash;for the purpose of studying them are fully conversant with the archaeological study and what they really want to do is to visit the monument themselves, with the idea of studying it for themselves, instead of reading a long essay written by someone else on it. What they really want to know is where the monument is.  There is no reference in the Minister's statement as to whether or not he has been asked to produce this brochure.  He has probably been asked to look into the matter all right and apparently he has done so to a certain extent.  If he has been asked, would he indicate whether or not he intends to do this and, if not, is there any particular reason why he should not do it?</P>
    <P>In one Department we have a section in which the officials are experts on this particular subject and have a pretty shrewd idea of where these places are.  They would, however, need to be sent out through the country with a mandate to travel and mark these particular monuments on maps or charts.  That would, of course, take a considerable time and it would probably mean a full-time official doing the work, but I think it would pay a richer dividend than some of the other items in this Estimate to which I shall refer later.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will consider what I have suggested.  I have met a number of Europeans who are anxious to visit this country and see these monuments. I have been asked if I could indicate where they are.  The answer I have given is that they are literally everywhere. I think we do not appreciate how many there are.  I invite the Minister and his officials, next time they are out through the country, to see how many monuments they can pick up between here and the extreme south. They will be absolutely amazed for they literally abound everywhere.  Perhaps the Minister will give this matter his consideration.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the Dún Laoghaire ferry terminal.  It is stated <Col N="901" /> that British Railways have asked that a ferry service be provided and a sum of £650,000 has been allocated for that purpose.  It is common knowledge that the chief port of entrance from the point of view of a ferry service into this country at the moment is Rosslare. The Board of Works have received from the Department of Transport and Power a demand on behalf of those interested in Rosslare, and probably also from British Railways, for a considerable extension of the existing facilities at Rosslare.  There is nothing in the Minister's statement to indicate that any improvements will be made at Rosslare.  The existing facilities are not sufficient to deal with the modern demand.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in trying to discuss anything on the Board of Works Estimate is that the Board of Works are not directly responsible for anything. I say that in the kindliest spirit.  I have the greatest admiration for the Board of Works and great sympathy for them because of the difficulties under which they operate.  They are entirely dependent on whatever is transmitted to them in relation to Rosslare harbour.  If it has not, it is very difficult to understand why not.  This has been a live issue for quite a number of years, long before there was any idea of a car ferry terminal at Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is a realist.  He is also a representative of the southern half of the country.  He will appreciate that it is undesirable that all the motor cars should come in through Dún Laoghaire.  Dublin has already got more than a fair share of the benefits of tourism, without making it any easier for Dublin to enjoy still greater benefits.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will indicate whether there are any plans with regard to Rosslare, whether or not these plans have been shelved, and, if not, whether we may expect some expenditure in that area in the future.  There will be the greatest disappointment because of the fact that there is nothing in the Estimate to suggest that the southern part of the country will get benefits <Col N="902" /> equivalent to those which Dublin is getting.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of drainage.  Year after year I have suggested that the system in regard to drainage is most unsatisfactory, in that it should be within the compass of one Department to deal with drainage rather than having half a dozen Departments concerned with it.  My experience as a rural Deputy is probably parallel with that of other Deputies.  I am constantly approached by constituents who can prove to me that there is considerable submarining of lands in certain areas.  It is most difficult to find out who is responsible for that drainage.</P>
    <P>As I understand the position, the Office of Public Works are responsible for main drainage alone, but you cannot possibly say they have no other function in the matter because, if you do, you make nonsense of the whole drainage system.  We have the Office of Public Works; the land reclamation scheme; local government have a certain responsibility; and there is the Special Employment Schemes Office.</P>
    <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary has great difficulty because of shortage of staff.  I know he has the greatest difficulty in getting expert engineering staff, due to the fact that there is a great deal of sameness in the work. Young professional men like variation, and they do not like to work on the same job all the time.  For that reason it is difficult to get a sufficient number of people to deal with the problems of catchment areas that arise.  If the Office of Public Works had overriding authority over all drainage work, it would simplify the work of the officials, the work of the Office, and the work of the Government.  It would also simplify the work of the technical experts.</P>
    <P>In discussions in the Office of Public Works, the question usually is: &ldquo;Who is responsible for the work?&rdquo; I was glad to note the other day that there now appears to be some form of liaison between the Office of Public Works and the Special Employment Schemes Office.  If the Office of Public Works feel they are not responsible for some drainage work, they pass it <Col N="903" /> back to the Special Employment Schemes Office for consideration.  I do not know when that happy state of affairs came about.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary is responsible for it, but if he is, he has certainly achieved something towards simplifying the matter.  If the Office of Public Works are not responsible for some drainage work and transfer it to the Special Employment Schemes Office, at least there is a cut and dried scheme which you can take to the people concerned and tell them what to do.  I do not know what influence the Parliamentary Secretary has within the confines of the Government.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed to hear that.  I thought the Parliamentary Secretary showed great promise.  However, perhaps he has some influence with his Minister, the Minister for Finance, who controls the money and could arrange for him to have overriding authority to deal with drainage.  If he had, many of our problems would be solved, and we could really get somewhere.</P>
      <P>There are certain drainage schemes to which I should like to refer briefly. I understand that the River Owen-varragh in Wexford is to be drained. I should be obliged if the Parliamentary Secretary would tell me when work will start, how long it will take, and to what extent the catchment area will be drained.  The drainage of the River Assaly has been investigated and reinvestigated by experts.  I understand there is some hope that some limited work may be done in that direction.  I should like to know if such is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that under the direction of the Office of Public Works, schools will move over as quickly as possible to what is known as prototype schools or pre-fab schools.  I further understand that there is a new type of prototype school in which the corridors which existed so abundantly in our old schools will be abolished. That will bring about a great economy of space.  We will have a more economic type of school, and it will cost less to build.  It will also provide more <Col N="904" /> accommodation and will be a better and more up-to-date building, generally speaking.  I do not know if such is the case.  I have heard rumours to that effect.</P>
    <P>I know that in Europe there have been considerable advances in pre-fab structures.  Although all these schemes which are on foot have not been finalised, a great deal of pre-fab construction is going on in Europe and in America also.  It is a cheaper type of building, and it is simpler for the purpose of accessories such as heating, and so on.  It is more economic, and its durability is good.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that pre-fab schools were estimated to last for 70 years.  I do not know if that is right.  My information is that they will last for 50 years, but even 50 years would be something in the life of the education of a country.</P>
    <P>We have many obsolete schools, badly lighted, badly sited and with a tremendous amount of waste space. The Parliamentary Secretary might tell us if it is intended to push ahead in that direction.  I understand these prototype schools are put together but not manufactured here.  If the Parliamentary Secretary could give the House some information in relation to this matter it would be helpful to Deputies and to people such as school managers who will, no doubt, look to the Estimate hoping for more up-to-date development in the construction of schools.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to what he called a &ldquo;preventive centre&rdquo; which, I suppose, is a school for, shall we say, juvenile delinquents.  I was unaware of the fact that there was a school of that type in the city.  I am aware that certain interested parties have been trying to get a school built in Finglas, and I am aware that that scheme has been mooted for something in the period of two or three years, but there has been considerable delay.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    <P>The preparation of plans for the erection of a Preventive Centre at Finglas, County Dublin, is well advanced and construction work will, it is hoped, commence this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> If that is the centre I have in mind, it has been in the offing for a considerable time.  Many people had hoped that by now it would have been commenced.  From a telephone call which I made today, I am aware that it has not been commenced yet.  The House is entitled to some definite information in relation to the school for the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents.  There is nothing derogatory in the fact that the city of Dublin or Ireland requires such a school because, proportionately speaking, other cities have probably far more juvenile delinquents.  I trust that everybody concerned will act as fast as possible to bring this necessary work to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>There are several things which puzzle me in relation to the expenditure of money under this Vote.  There is talk about the capital programme of the Government.  We on this side of the House are really not allowed to question anything about finance.  We are supposed to be retarding the wonderful progress of the Fianna Fáil Party who are spending £200 million a year in this country.  It is the plan for economic progress and we are supposed to bow down and be silent.  The duty of an Opposition is to see to it that money is equitably and well spent.</P>
    <P>I note that a sum of £1,788,000 is provided for a new Department of Social Welfare and that for Dublin Castle, with the total sums added up, the amount is practically £1 million.  I am not very clear whether they are all in respect of Dublin Castle and it may well be more than £1 million.  Some years ago, the question of Dublin Castle was debated in this House. Quite a long discussion arose on a Supplementary Estimate.  The foundations of Dublin Castle were supposed to be insecure.  There was a lengthy discussion as to whether or not it was worth while reconstructing Dublin Castle because of the danger of insecure foundations.</P>
    <P>There has not been any clear indication since the time I heard it debated here as to whether or not the foundations of Dublin Castle are secure.  I wonder if those who advise the Parliamentary Secretary have any information <Col N="906" /> on the matter, whether they have satisfied themselves that it is an economic undertaking and that the money will not, in the long run be thrown away.</P>
    <P>We are expending £1,788,000 on the erection of a new Department of Social Welfare.  Is there any real justification for that?  I suppose it is being built probably out of voted capital funds.  Are we such a wealthy country that we can afford to chuck away all this money when we already have a Department of Social Welfare which is contained in a modern air-conditioned building, practically the only such building in the country?  The Parliamentary Secretary should indicate whether or not the present building which houses the Department of Social Welfare is being scrapped and, if so, why.  If it is not being scrapped, what use will be made of it?  We should at all times ensure that money is spent only when it is absolutely necessary.</P>

      <P>This Estimate is the show-window of the prosperity of the nation under a Fianna Fáil Government. It is a good criterion of the times.  It shows that the nation is prospering. The Parliamentary Secretary has proved an excellent man in the job and his approach is original.  Both he and the Commissioners and the staff generally are doing a jolly good job.</P>
      <P>They have done wonderful work for schools in recent years.  It is regrettable that there are still nearly 700 bad school buildings throughout the country but the Parliamentary Secretary hopes that within the next seven years they will all be demolished.  In my constituency, we experienced great co-operation from the school managers and a lot of schools were built in recent years in Dublin city and county which have cost millions.  Prefabricated schools, and so on, are welcome because in certain areas we are in a very bad way for extra accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the passing of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, the State has spent £16 million on arterial drainage and we are still going ahead with the work.  I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary because we in County Dublin succeeded in getting our share of it. <Col N="907" /> Almost £500,000 will have been spent by the next few months on drainage in the north County Dublin area and we have a number of other intermediate rivers which will be brought up later.  I was sorry the Parliamentary Secretary did not mention Skerries harbour because we have been discussing it and making representations about its reconstruction and extension. Of course, he will do the job but there is still a feud going on between Dublin County Council and the Fisheries Section of the Department of Lands. When that is settled, I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will look after the matter.</P>
    <P>Another burning question in County Dublin is coast erosion.  I should like to see the nation prosperous enough to be able to afford to do more about coast erosion.  While the Parliamentary Secretary introduced a Bill dealing with this subject, it is one of the problems we still have in my constituency. There is very severe erosion in various areas, at Skerries, Rush, Donabate, Portrane, Malahide and Portmarnock. I should like to see the Parliamentary Secretary able to give a certain amount for coast erosion protection work each year.  That is the only way we can deal with it.  I know that some surveys have been carried out in my area and more are under way.  This is a national problem and even if we can do it only on a piecemeal basis, by spending £5,000 or £6,000 in an area, we might save acres of land, and perhaps houses, from being washed away. Until the Bill was introduced, we could do nothing because, unless council roads were affected, the councils did not move.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have dealt with ancient monuments.  It is nice to see them preserved.  They are part of our tourist attraction and show that we have some traditions.</P>
    <P>The rural improvement schemes are very much appreciated.  We have availed of them in County Dublin and I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for assisting me in relation to quite a few of them.  We have a few more outstanding, but, as he said today, we must take our place in the <Col N="908" /> queue because there are a number of families and groups of people trying to get roads and other things done under these schemes.</P>
    <P>There has been a very fine improvement in regard to Garda barracks and I am delighted to hear the Parliamentary Secretary is in a position to do something worthwhile for them.  Some barracks in County Dublin were really depressing, especially for young recruits. They were overcrowded and insanitary. I welcome the new approach by the Government and the energetic Parliamentary Secretary in regard to the provision of barracks and Garda houses.</P>
    <P>A matter that does not come under the Parliamentary Secretary and about which we have a number of complaints is the condition of courthouses.  Some of these are a disgrace to our country and I very often get complaints about them. These come under the jurisdiction of the local authorities and for that reason I refer to it only in passing.  I am sorry they are not under the Parliamentary Secretary's control as they are anything but what they should be.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I delayed the Parliamentary Secretary but I had been waiting all morning to say a few words.  I am deeply concerned about coast erosion and I hope the problem will be tackled by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government.  If Fianna Fáil are left in office, with the help of my old friend, Deputy T. Lynch, we shall get a lot of work done.</P>

      <P>I imagine it would be quite impossible to reply to all the points raised and do justice to them in the short time available.  It is unusual for a Vote to finish so quickly. Usually the person dealing with it has an opportunity to study in more detail the queries raised by Deputies.  At the outset, I want to thank the House, on behalf of the officials and staff of the Office of Public Works and on my own behalf, for the constructive criticisms they made and the complimentary things they said about us.  Where they were not so complimentary, I assure them that all matters, big and small, will be carefully examined.  Where necessary, having got the requisite information &mdash;if I do not deal with it today&mdash;I shall write to the Deputy concerned in detail on the matter mentioned by him.</P>
      <P>Deputy T. Lynch made his usual constructive contribution.  He referred to the barracks at Templemore.  Subject to confirmation of this, from my notes, the position is that the original estimate was purely provisional.  I think it was £435,000.  The actual estimate was £560,000 and the eventual cost £620,000.  There was an increase in wages and the cost of materials and my Office was quite satisfied with the standard of workmanship and the progress generally.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy mentioned the acoustics in this House.  As I said, the amplification system in operation had its growing pains but Deputies would contribute greatly to its effectiveness if they would not throw files down on top of the microphones.  I should like to make it clear that at any one time there are only two microphones switched on.  As I speak, the other microphones are dead.  If I sit down and Deputy Lynch rises to speak, the microphones on each side of him are switched on and those over here go off.  It is an exaggeration to suggest that private conversations of Deputies who are not addressing the House could come over the loudspeakers.</P>

      <Col N="910" /> I had a very nice letter from the Press Gallery.  As we all know, they had difficulties in the past.  They could not hear, and reports at times led to unpleasantness and misunderstanding. There is no excuse now for anyone to suggest that he is misquoted because the sound is very satisfactory in the area of the Press Gallery and in all areas of the House including the Distinguished Strangers' and Public Galleries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch asked about the memorial to the Garda.  I think it will take the form of a slender column with a plaque with the names of the members of the Force who died in the execution of their duty inscribed on it. He also mentioned Tramore Garda station.  The position is that there has been local objection to building the station there.  Is the Deputy aware of that?</P>

      <P>It would be better if the local people were consulted at first hand rather than by letter.  I would ask the Minister to send down one of his officials and this could be settled on the spot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made several efforts to get a suitable site and the local Commissioners are aware of the position.  If Deputy Lynch can use his good offices, we would greatly appreciate it.  The sooner we get a site the sooner we can go on with the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are studying the opinions expressed by Deputy Lynch with regard <Col N="911" /> to glass in oil portraits generally. There are two schools of thought about this point.  One eminent painter tells us that oil paintings should always have glass in them and an equally eminent Irish artist tells us that it is entirely wrong to have glass in oil paintings and that the reflection of light, the reflection of the person looking at the picture and so forth, detract from the merits of the painting. The point Deputy Lynch made was that a picture could be damaged in the atmosphere here.  We will look into it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Thomas Davis memorial, the plaster cast of the statue of Davis will probably be ready by the end of this year.  We will consider the suggestion about the flag of the Fighting 69th Regiment.  With regard to the suggestion that a history should be prepared, this initially would be a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but we can arrange, I am sure, to have the matter raised there.  I am sure the Deputy's representations will be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch also mentioned the question of coast erosion in Tramore. As the Deputy is aware, a proposal in this regard has to be initiated by the local authority, in this instance the Waterford County Council.  We do not appear to have received any application from them as yet and we cannot make the first move.  The work at Rosslare of course was started before the Coast Protection Act became law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully mentioned drainage.  I should like to point out that the minimum rate of wages for drainage workers is now £8 for a 48-hour week. It was, I am glad to say, recently increased by £1.</P>
    <P>There was also the question raised of having a painting or a piece of sculpture in new schools.  This is a matter for the Minister for Education. We just do what we are told.  It would be a matter for his Estimate but I will bring the point to his attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider it a good idea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but a better <Col N="912" /> idea would be to have the 1916 Proclamation in every school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was in every school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in every school and it would be a good idea if it were.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lynch also said that more money should be voted for schools. As I said, we are spending a record amount this year.  It will take seven years at least to clear the arrears of 650 to 700 schools that need replacement. The new prototype which we are testing at Ballyboughal, County Dublin, if it is successful, should reduce the time further.  I can assure the House that the Government will not be deterred from solving this problem by a shortage of money.  We will have to be realistic.  The figure included is the most we can spend, and it is a very big sum.  We are acutely aware of the problem in my office.  Certainly some of the schools would be classified by any medical officer of health as unfit for human habitation.  We realise how paradoxical it is to have health schemes and school meals' services and so on while certain schools could be classed as unhealthy.  We all know how bad some of them are, but the Schools Section of our Department is very farseeing and have a very enlightened outlook.  They are most co-operative and I hope that this time next year, if we are all here, please God, we will have further progress to report.</P>
      <P>The question of Tara was also raised.  We are well aware of the position at Tara and of its historical associations.  The owner received a very good offer from Bord Fáilte. For reasons best known to himself, he has indulged in quite a lot of publicity.  That is his own business. He can sell it to whoever he wishes, if he does not wish to accept the very generous offer from Bord Fáilte. However, whether he sells it, or keeps it for himself, the position would be that any attempt to develop Tara which did not have our approval, or which was not carried out under our supervision would lead to immediate and overnight action by us.</P>

      <P>: The owner knows his business, but it is not uranium he has on the land! Deputy Lynch is aware that we could use our compulsory powers and arbitration and so on but up to now we have tried to be as generous as we could and to settle this matter by mutual agreement. We have not been successful. I think it is about time we moved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Government Departments do not have the power to meet anyone halfway.  You are given the figure.  Anyway, I am quite satisfied.  The offer was raised already and it was quite the maximum that could be given for some 58 acres of land.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde asked if we had any information in regard to a ferry service at Rosslare.  Proposals for three different groups were sent to the Office of Public Works by the Department of Transport and Power and we gave the Department very broad reports on technical aspects of the proposals.  Very much more detailed investigations would be required before any proposals could go ahead. A decision in that matter rests with the Department of Transport and Power.  As far as we are concerned, a project there is quite feasible.  Anything can be done.  If the money is made available and instructions are given, we will proceed.  We have first-class engineers in the Harbour Section.  However, as I say, that decision is not one for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully suggested that bigger schools should be built.  When the schools are being designed, the Department of Education in consultation with the local manager make the best assessment they can of the likely trend of population in each case.  Of course, they are not infallible or endowed with the gift of prophecy, and it may well be that instead of being too small, some of the schools may prove to be too large, if there is a change in <Col N="914" /> population, for instance, a swing to another area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also criticised the grille around the Public Gallery.  I suppose the matter can be considered further but there are two schools of thought about that, too.  In the first place an alternative, if decided upon, would be quite expensive, and then, who is certain it would be a good thing to remove it?  There is always the danger that a mentally unbalanced visitor might feel an urge to jump down on top of someone. The question of persons throwing things need not worry us.  That could be got over, but there are people who get such an urge, as I have mentioned. I think it is as well to leave it the way it is.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde referred to Dublin Castle.  He need have no fear about its not being possible to get a secure foundation for the new buildings there.  The foundations are quite sound.  Our officials are quite satisfied on that score.</P>
    <P>Referring to drainage, various rivers were mentioned by Deputy Millar.  As he said, the great problem is the drainage of the river Shannon.  It is true that in June, 1961, a joint report was published as agreed between the Office of Public Works and the Electricity Supply Board.  Even the summer relief scheme mentioned therein would take a minimum of 15 years to carry out and, at present day costs, would run to £20-25 million.  A fantastic number of engineers would be required.  As Deputy Lynch is well aware, the output from our universities is limited.  To carry out this scheme we would have to divert all our engineers to the Shannon.  Even with a small number of engineers on the job, unless the survey were tackled properly and finished within a reasonable period, at least within seven or eight years, there would be the difficulty of having new men, strangers to the work, coming along and taking over.  This is a problem which is constantly agitating our minds.  I do not know what the eventual solution of the Shannon problem will be.  It is not a problem which has been filed away, but it is no use misleading the people in the area around Meelick and the other areas of <Col N="915" /> the Shannon.  We have no quick solution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to the system of bulk tendering.  We are satisfied that a small contractor will not be injured in any way by this.  In fact, we will ensure that he is not, because the small contractor in rural Ireland has been the backbone of the building industry.  There is work he has done in the past and will continue to do which none of the larger contractors could ever accomplish.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde mentioned the overlapping of drainage authorities and suggested that the Land Project and the Special Employment Schemes Office rural improvement schemes were clashing.  I do not think they are and I do not think a liaison of any type is necessary.  Our terms of reference, so to speak, are clearly set out so far as major catchments and minor catchments are concerned under the governing Act, the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to inform the House that I shall write to each individual Deputy on points raised during the debate, points which I have not succeeded in answering in the short time at my disposal.</P>
