      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal purpose of this Bill is to provide relief for the policyholders of the Equitable Insurance Company Ltd.  As Deputies are aware, I presented a petition to the High Court in May, 1963, for the winding-up of this company on the ground that it was insolvent; shortly afterwards the necessary winding-up order was made by the court.  Although the preparation of the legislation was prompted by the failure of this one company, Deputies will observe that the arrangements envisaged by the Bill are of a general and continuing nature, so that it will also provide suitable machinery for the relief of policyholders in the case of any future insurance insolvency. I need hardly say that there are no indications at present that any <Col N="923" /> other insurance company will go bankrupt.</P>
    <P>The liquidator of the Equitable Insurance Company is unable to give any reliable indication of the sums of money required to meet claims under the various classes of policies, mainly because the legal position in relation to certain liabilities and assets of the company is not clear.  On a very rough basis, however, he feels that the net liabilities may amount to some hundreds of thousands of pounds.  The Motor Insurers Bureau, which is representative of all companies doing motor business here, will, in accordance with the terms of a long-standing agreement with the Minister for Local Government, meet certain liabilities under motor policies, but this will still leave a substantial amount of claims unsatisfied.</P>
    <P>It had been hoped that the other insurers would take over some, at least, of the Equitable's liabilities, and I had discussions with the Irish and British companies with this end in view before I presented the petition for winding-up. The Irish companies were prepared to contribute one-third of the amount needed to pay all creditors in full, provided the balance was contributed by the British companies and/or the Government. The British companies refused, however, to make any contribution whatever.</P>
    <P>I was extremely disappointed that this attitude was adopted by the British companies who enjoy full facilities, on the same basis as our own native concerns, to conduct their insurance business here.  In fact, they are to a certain extent shielded from excessive competition by virtue of the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1936. They take the lion's share of the non-life business arising here, the approximate division in recent years being about 80 per cent for the British companies, as compared with 20 per cent for the Irish companies.  Despite all this the British companies made it quite clear to me that they would not, in any circumstances, voluntarily contribute one penny towards meeting the claims on the Equitable.  The <Col N="924" /> explanation they gave me was that they are opposed in principle to any arrangements for bailing-out any company which gets into difficulty, as this might lead in the future to the adoption of reckless practices by other insurance companies and intermediaries.</P>
    <P>It is evident to me from correspondence received in my Department and from appeals made by Deputies in this House that unless some special steps are taken the failure of the Equitable will give rise to serious hardships for its policyholders, particularly in the case of persons who were insured with the company under employers' liability policies.  I am satisfied also that the failure of an insurance company to meet its liabilities differs in many ways from the failure of an ordinary business concern.  As is well known, insurance companies act in concert in many matters, including the rating of risks and the determination of premiums.  Most insurance companies work on much the same principles, and exchange information one with the other.  There is also the point that the insurance market here in Ireland is, to a large extent, reserved for the companies operating here.  Furthermore, the law has, for many years, recognised that the insuring public are deserving of special consideration and protection, within the limits of a free enterprise system.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I have come to the conclusion that if the insurance industry itself will not voluntarily come to an arrangement under which the policyholders of the Equitable can be assisted, then it will be necessary to impose such an arrangement on them by legislation.  Having given the matter a good deal of thought, it also seems to me appropriate that any machinery provided by law should not relate specifically to the Equitable but should be available to deal with any other insurance insolvency situation which may arise, however remote the possibility may be.</P>
    <P>I have had further discussions with the insurance companies in regard to the introduction of legislation on these lines.  Both the Irish and British companies were opposed to this course. <Col N="925" /> For the reasons I have already given, however, I feel that it is right that, having failed to procure a voluntary scheme, I should introduce this Bill providing for a statutory scheme.  I am satisfied that there should be no difficulty in so operating the proposed scheme, that in any given year the financial burden by way of contributions payable by individual companies will be quite small, and I believe that the arrangement envisaged by the Bill now before the House will not cause any serious financial problem for even the smallest company.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies expressed the view that it would be unfair and illogical to require them to meet claims under workmen's compensation in view of the decision in principle made by the Government some time ago to expand the social insurance scheme by providing for payments to persons injured in the course of their employment.  Although this decision has not yet been crystallised, I feel that there is some validity in the point put by the insurance companies, and the Bill, accordingly, provides for a State contribution which will be roughly equivalent to the workmen's compensation liabilities of the Equitable.</P>
    <P>I have given this matter the most serious consideration and have listened carefully to representations from many sources.  I am quite satisfied that the interests of policyholders must be adequately protected and that there is no compelling reason why the statutory scheme to relieve them should not be introduced.  The main features of the scheme as envisaged by the Bill are as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  All non-life licensed insurance companies will contribute to the fund in accordance with their premium income. A non-repayable contribution of £30,000 will be made to the fund by the State with the object of covering the Equitable's workmen's compensation liabilities.</P>
    <P>(b)  the fund will be available to meet claims under policies issued by any insolvent insurance company which is being wound up by the High Court; the eligible classes of insurance <Col N="926" /> will be those for which a licence is needed under the Insurance Acts, other than life; creditors other than those claiming under eligible policies will not have access to the fund.</P>
    <P>(c)  As the annual contribution envisaged will not be sufficient to discharge the liabilities of the Equitable within a short space of time, the Minister for Finance will make loans to the fund to enable it to cover all outstanding claims without delay; these loans will be repaid to the Minister for Finance in due course.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Equitable Insurance Company prompted questions about the degree of protection afforded by the existing law for policyholders in this country.  I think we will answer those questions effectively by providing suitable statutory arrangements for meeting claims on insolvent companies. In order to improve the law further, however, I think it is desirable to do something about the present statutory requirements in relation to the deposits made by insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The existing provisions in this respect require a deposit of £15,000 from each company doing motor business and a deposit of £20,000 from each company doing any one or more of the other controlled classes of business, except life and industrial business, where the deposit is £20,000 in respect of each.  These figures were fixed in 1936 and are obviously too low by present day standards.  The Bill provides, therefore, that a deposit of £100,000 shall be required from each insurance company, no matter how many classes of business it carries on. I gave some consideration also to the share capital requirements set out in the Act of 1936, but I am satisfied that it would not be feasible to do very much on this score, for the present.</P>
    <P>In any event, it must be conceded that statutory share capital requirements do not provide any conclusive protection for policyholders since share capital can be lost in the normal course of business.  The making of a deposit is in an entirely different category, since this requires the placing of cash or its equivalent in the High Court which <Col N="927" /> retains physical possession of it for the sole benefit of claimants on the company.</P>
    <P>Under the Act of 1936 certain licensing rights were given to existing Irish and British insurance companies, and there is a residue of these rights which has not yet been taken up. Bearing in mind the failure of the Equitable Insurance Company, I am satisfied that some tidying-up is called for in this respect.  The Bill proposes, therefore, to provide that no new licences may be issued to any company, Irish or foreign, except in the case of a newly established Irish-controlled company satisfying the share capital and other requirements of the 1936 Act.  The opportunity is also being availed of to make some changes in the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938 in relation to the connection between the Minister for Finance and the Irish Life Assurance Company Ltd.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the enactment of these provisions will improve the existing law relating to the insurance industry, and will answer a number of criticisms which have been voiced in this House from time to time.  I have no hesitation in commending it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will be welcomed in so far as it is necessary to provide a means whereby policyholders who had insured with the Equitable Insurance Company will be protected.  To that extent we are satisfied that it is necessary.  It does seem, however, that there are a number of questions which require to be examined and, if possible, answers given to them.  The fact that it is necessary to introduce this legislation because of the failure of the Equitable Insurance Company naturally prompts the question whether the statutory provisions which existed under the 1936 Act were properly implemented and also whether these provisions were complied with in full or merely in a formal manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1936 Act, there are a number of sections dealing with the presentation by insurance companies of accounts and the examination of these <Col N="928" /> accounts by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and by officers appointed by the Minister to carry out this examination and investigation.</P>
    <P>From discussions which took place some time ago in the House, it did appear as if the accounts were examined by the Minister and that up to a short time prior to the bankruptcy or insolvency of the insurance company in question, these accounts disclosed no facts which would warrant the assumption that the company were in difficulties.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, however, that the investigation or examination of the accounts should have disclosed the circumstances or at any rate the trend in the finances of the company which would at least point to the need for further and closer examination.  It is hardly necessary to refer to the precise sections of the Act but it seems to me the sections which gave the Minister power were sections 87 and 88 and later sections dealing with foreign companies.</P>
    <P>The question now arises as to whether these sections were adequate or whether the procedure adopted in connection with the presentation and examination of the accounts afforded sufficient information to the Minister and his Department to have available the requisite returns in order accurately to assess the circumstances of companies of this sort.  One of the matters which from time to time have been the subject of discussion here, and indeed the subject of some consideration not merely by the House but by, I think, different Governments&mdash;certainly during our period of office&mdash;is the question of having statutory or semi-statutory or other bodies whose accounts were presented to the Dáil made amenable in one form or another to such investigation.</P>
    <P>Generally, these investigations applied to statutory companies or companies regarded as covered by the terms &ldquo;State&rdquo; or &ldquo;semi-State&rdquo;.  In this case, while the insurance company might not come within that overall description, there was, as I have said, a provision in the 1936 Act for the examination of accounts and for the presentation to the Minister for Industry <Col N="929" /> and Commerce of accounts, books, documents and so on, to enable a proper assessment of the position to be made.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to imagine that if a full investigation and examination of these accounts were made, some evidence would not have been forthcoming which would disclose the situation that had developed.  If, on the other hand, it is to some extent a formal matter&mdash;in many cases it may be that these matters, either through practice or recognised procedure, become a formality&mdash;then it is necessary at this stage, before we enact this piece of legislation, to consider whether the powers in the 1936 Act were adequate for the purpose originally envisaged.</P>
    <P>If these powers are not sufficient, then it is essential we should in this legislation insert sufficient power to ensure the Minister has in the future adequate machinery for purposes of investigation so that not merely will no similar case arise in the future but so that power may be available to him to prevent, should the tendency disclose itself, any possibility of a similar happening in the future.</P>
    <P>This decision to ensure that protection is provided for policyholders in the Equitable Insurance Company is just and fair because in many cases&mdash; probably in most cases&mdash;persons who insure with an insurance company and who find they have to meet claims are people in a small way of business, people whose resources would not allow or enable them to meet the claims they may have to face as a result of actions which may be taken against them.</P>
    <P>In any event, irrespective of the financial standing of persons concerned, it is essential in the public interest, in the interests of the community generally as well as in the interests of insurance companies and business concerns, that those who place insurance with an insurance company should have no doubt about the financial soundness or the integrity of the company concerned.  This Bill is obviously necessary to avoid hardship to claimants against the Equitable Insurance Company.  It will provide <Col N="930" /> relief for defendants in various types of legal proceedings, in particular for those whose business does not come within the cases covered by the Motor Insurers Bureau.</P>
    <P>One of the problems adverted to in the course of the Minister's introductory speech was that in respect of persons covered for workmen's compensation. It would appear that aspect of the matter has been covered by proposals in the Bill.  I gather from the Minister's speech that the figure of £30,000 which has been arrived at is calculated on the basis of the liability or the responsibility which would accrue to the Equitable Insurance Company.  If that is not so, I hope the Minister will give details when he is replying.  It did seem to us that the compensation fund would have been better administered by the insurance companies concerned rather than through the High Court and through the Accountant of the High Court.  I understand from the Minister's remarks that the reason for a statutory fund is that the insurance companies concerned were not prepared to accept a scheme. This may well pose the question whether the whole matter of insurance should not be the subject of an inquiry.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Solicitors Bill established for the members of the profession a fund administered by the profession.  The decision to establish that fund and the manner in which the solicitors' profession accepted responsibility for administering the fund reflected the highest credit on the profession. It is not a very easy matter to administer and, particularly, to administer a fund dealing in certain cases with problems created by either defalcation or in some way or other the mismanagement or neglect which individual members of the profession were responsible for but I believe that since that fund was established, it has been administered in a manner which has reflected credit on those who conceived the idea of administering it as well as on the profession and the officers of the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
    <P>The fund referred to in this Bill has <Col N="931" /> now to be administered under the auspices of the President of the High Court through the Accountant of the High Court.  One of the criticisms made by members of the legal profession is that there is considerable difficulty in getting business transacted expeditiously through the Accountant's office.  That is obviously because of pressure of business.  Whether this fund will still further encumber the business of that office is open to question. Is it proposed to strengthen the staff there or to provide any extra machinery for dealing with this matter? If not, will it further delay the proceedings of the Accountant's office and further complicate, not merely the existing business which is channelled through that office, but also the business which will fall to be dealt with in connection with the fund established under this legislation?</P>
    <P>I would be interested to know on what basis the contributions by insurers will be made to the fund or has this matter yet to be settled in consultation with the insurance companies?</P>
    <P>The Minister, no doubt, has received, as have Deputies, a memorandum from the Private Motorists Protection Association. This memorandum refers to the application which was made by the Private Motorists Protection Association for a licence to carry on insurance business.  The association refer to the fact that they have complied with the 1936 Act by lodging the required sum of £15,000 and that they also became a registered company.  The Minister decided to postpone a decision on the application, pending the introduction of the present piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>This organisation, which has been formed as a result of a view held by a number of people that motor insurance is too costly, is composed of a number of reputable persons who came together for the purpose of effecting motor insurance business and it seems that an adequate reason should be given as to why the body is not being granted a licence.  They have complied with the terms of the 1936 Act and indicated some considerable time ago that they proposed to comply with the <Col N="932" /> terms of the Act.  Since then they have done so and they now await the granting of a licence.</P>
    <P>When I express the view that the opinion is held that insurance is costly and that an inquiry might elicit certain information, may I say that it is well known that where insurance companies or insurance policies fall to be liable, particularly in the case of accidents happening to mechanically-propelled vehicles, costs tend to rise and if, say, a claim is made otherwise than by means of a policy of insurance the costs are generally lower.  Whether it is a natural tendency of human nature to exploit the advantages of passing on extra liability to others may be difficult to say but to whatever extent added liability arises because people tend to charge up on the basis that the insurance company is liable to pay it then to that extent it must affect the cost of insurance.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, as the Minister remarked, insurance companies here have very considerable opportunities and the fact that the British companies have declined to participate in the proposed arrangement is certainly worthy of comment.  It seems to me that if facilities are afforded by means of legislation here to carry on business, then there is some obligation on those who are prepared to avail of the opportunities here and to carry on business to accept whatever consequences may flow from that, and to the extent to which it is necessary to have all insurance companies participating in order to operate this fund, it seems to me there is some obligation on the companies concerned to participate in it.</P>
    <P>I noticed in the Minister's concluding remarks that it was proposed, as he put it, to implement certain rights under the 1936 Act which had not been taken up.  I should like to know why these rights were not taken up and what provisions of that Act had not been complied with.  Under section 12 of the Bill, it is proposed to enable the Minister for Finance to acquire by subscription or purchase and sell any shares of the Irish Life Assurance Company, Limited.  What is the purpose of buying out this company?  The <Col N="933" /> reference by the Minister did not clarify the provisions of the Bill and did not specify the reasons for this proposed step.</P>
    <P>There is one provision in the 1936 Act which was not implemented, that is, the portion in Part VI, sections 77 to 90, which deal with the insurance compensation fund.  These sections provide for the formation by the Minister for Finance of a reinsurance company and section 89 of the Act provided that every assurance company or syndicate, excluding life and industrial assurance business, must, to the extent it reinsured its assurance business, reinsure with the company.  The amendments to the 1936 Act proposed in this Bill do not repeal Part VI of the Act and I should like to know from the Minister whether it is intended, after this legislation is passed, to establish a reinsurance company.  I should also like to know whether the Equitable Insurance Company reinsured its business or not and if it had done so would it have enabled it to avoid the situation which has arisen.  All these question require to be answered so that the House and the country may have full information on the general position as well as the particular problem which has arisen due to the insolvency of the Equitable Insurance Company.</P>
    <P>There is a small point in section 13 under which it is proposed to amend the 1938 Act and where it says: &ldquo;...for the purposes of sub-paragraph (x) of paragraph 8 of the agreement set out in the Schedule to the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938, be deemed...to be and always to have been a citizen of Ireland and a qualified holding body corporate...&rdquo;  I find it hard to understand the purpose of that because the Constitution lays it down that only Irish citizens can be elected to the Dáil and the Minister for Finance must be a member of the Dáil.  This proviso is unnecessary, unless there is some meaning which is not apparent from the phraseology.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Labour Party agree that some type of legislation was necessary in order to remedy the position which has arisen as a result of the failure of the Equitable Insurance <Col N="934" /> Company and to ensure that something like this would not happen again, there are a number of points in the Bill about which I should like to ask the Minister for information.  I may add that I have a personal as well as a Party view on this because I am one of those people who got their fingers burned with this company.</P>
      <P>One of the things I cannot understand is that, despite the fact that the Minister has admitted in the House that for quite a considerable period this company was suspect, nevertheless right up to the time at which he took the necessary action to terminate its activities, the company were allowed to collect premiums and in fact did so from some of my friends up to within a week or so of the date on which they went, to put it bluntly, broke.  Not alone that but when the Receiver was put in, he had the audacity to notify policyholders, including myself, that the company's cover for insurance terminated on the 31st July, even though he had been put in there early in May. All of us knew that if we wanted protection for our cars, we had to take out insurance with some other company from a date in May and if we were wise, as some of our people discovered, we should have had cover for 12 months previously because apparently that company were not in a position to pay anybody.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say, as the Receiver did in an impudent letter to me, that the Receiver had the right to terminate the policy, that I had not the right to terminate the policy. I still think that when the Minister found that insurance company was unable to give cover, there was no cover, and no official Receiver or anybody else had the right to say he was continuing the policy in operation until 31st July, almost two months after the company had collapsed. It was one of the most extraordinary things I have come across in public life and I should like the Minister to give some information as to how this came about, that all of us who paid our premium regularly found we had to renew it and had to pay twice in one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of this about <Col N="935" /> which perhaps the Minister knows a great deal and on which I should like him to comment.  Could he say if premiums paid through brokers ever found their way for that year to the Equitable Insurance Company or is it a fact that brokers did not pay the year's premium to the insurance company, despite the fact that they required their clients to pay a second premium to another company?  It is the general talk throughout the country that that is the position.  Somebody appears to have collected on the double.  I should be glad if the Minister would satisfy me on that point.</P>
    <P>We hear the story about the amount of money which motor and fire insurance is losing.  It is well known that one company, which has declared a loss of £4 million on motor and fire insurance and, therefore, claims that premiums must go up, did in fact re-invest the money which was paid to them in premiums&mdash;as they were entitled to do&mdash;and have made a profit of £12 million.  We are not so naive as to believe that when the insurance companies get money, they put it in a box and lock it away until somebody has a crash and then they go to the box and pay some of it out.  That seems to be the general idea that insurance companies put across to us.  In fact they re-invest in safe investments, as they are entitled to do, and they make a lot of money out of it.  For that reason, it is dishonest for them to try to put it across that they must balance the amount of money paid in in premiums with the amount of money which they pay out in claims.  That should be taken into consideration when this matter is being dealt with.</P>
    <P>I am rather disappointed that the Bill did not go a little further to remedy a number of other defects in Irish insurance at the present time.  Incidentally, the Minister's opening statement that the principal purpose of this Bill, is to provide relief for the policyholders of the Equitable Insurance Company is not exactly correct. It is only those who were unfortunate enough to have an accident who are covered.  The ordinary policyholder who did not have an accident will be still at a loss.  Apparently, nothing can <Col N="936" /> be done about that.  I am appalled to find that the English companies have not agreed to pay their share.  I suppose, being human, it is easy enough to understand they cannot see why they should have to pay because an insurance company in Ireland fails to meet its commitments, but if they are to be allowed to trade here, they should bear whatever share of loss would be attributed to the trade in this country.  The Minister is quite correct if he lays down conditions that they should either pay their share or, if they do not do so, that they should be made do so.</P>
    <P>One extraordinary thing is this: I understand that all companies doing motor insurance in this country are members of what is known as the tariff ring.  In England that is not so; only half the companies in England are members of the tariff ring and those outside the ring are able to quote very much lower premiums.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that. If that is the case, I am sure something can be done to remedy the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the Private Motorists Protection Association and their attempt to get a licence. I should hate to think that our Government deliberately decided to withhold a licence from an Irish company until such time as they could bring in legislation which would prevent them getting that licence.  The Minister has, I believe, rightly increased the amount of deposit.  He says that £15,000 in present money values is too small.  I agree.  Last week I saw that somebody had got an award of £65,000 and if that is so, £15,000, to quote the Minister for Transport and Power, would be small beer, but I think an assurance should be given by the Minister that provided the PMPA meet the requirements he has laid down, they will get a licence because it is common knowledge in the city that insurance company representatives are boasting that no matter what they do, the Association will not get that licence.  I hold no brief for them but I should not like it to go out that they can be prevented from getting that licence and that nobody outside the ring, who might possibly pull down premiums, would be <Col N="937" /> allowed to get a licence.  It would be too bad if that were so.</P>
    <P>The Government are putting up £30,000 and they say it is mainly to cover workmen's compensation claims. That amount for workmen's compensation for the Equitable Insurance Company seems to be an extraordinarily high sum for one year, but if the Minister says so, I take his word. The sooner the Minister or his colleague brings in legislation to deal with workmen's compensation, the better for all concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the levy which is being placed on other insurance companies, can the Minister give any assurance that this will not automatically result in an increase in premiums, that it will not be collected from the motoring public?  This is important because I personally believe that the insurance companies are making quite a handsome profit at present and that they should not be allowed to use this as an excuse to increase their premiums further.  I should be grateful if the Minister would let us have his views on this when replying.</P>
    <P>There is another paragraph here which is briefly referred to:</P>
    <P>The opportunity is also being availed of to make some changes in the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938 in relation to the connection between the Minister for Finance and the Irish Life Assurance Company, Ltd.</P>
    <P>What a Bill that has been introduced to deal with an insurance company that has gone broke has to do with the activities of an assurance company which is mainly controlled by the State is something I cannot understand.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of it but he has done something which should not be done by any Irish Government: he has set tongues waging. The general view of the public who are involved in insurance is that the Irish Life Assurance Company must be going broke since they are specially mentioned in a Bill which deals with an insurance company which has already gone broke.  The Minister has mentioned that there is no other company affected at present. Would be confirm for the benefit of <Col N="938" /> the employees of the Irish Assurance Company that there is no danger whatever of this company being bankrupt in a few weeks' time?</P>
    <P>Another aspect of that which I think is rather sinister is the matter of the right to sell or buy shares in this company.  Is this an implementation of a suggestion made by the Minister for Finance nearly two years ago and which was apparently forgotten up to now, to make available shares to the public in Irish State concerns?  Is there anything in that, or any reason why it should be included now?  Would the Minister say why the Irish Life Assurance Company should be included in a Bill mainly dealing with the bankruptcy of the Equitable Insurance Company?  I think it is not unfair to ask that.</P>
    <P>A final question: were the Board of the Irish Life Assurance Company consulted before it was decided to put this into the Bill?  What are their views on it?  That is also a very interesting point if the Minister would be prepared to comment on it.  Apart from that, we all agree some action should be taken to deal with companies that go broke so that the ordinary citizen who pays his way should not find himself in the position in which a number of them are.  Some of them I know myself have had serious illnesses as a result of worry about claims against them which they feel they are unable to meet because of the failure of the Equitable Insurance Company. May I ask that in future in the case of any insurance company that does not appear to be able to float, the Minister will take the necessary steps in time and will not accept the statement that £80,000 was invested in a non-existent company and could be used as assets by a company trying to carry on and cod the people of this country?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is, of course, aware and some members of the House are aware, that I am connected with an insurance company and I want to make it quite clear that I am speaking as a Deputy and not as a person concerned for or on behalf of that company.  May I begin by being <Col N="939" /> rather pedantic and suggest to the Minister that as a barrister of standing, he should not suggest that a company could go bankrupt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I was being pedantic.  I am afraid from the information I have, which is not necessarily exhaustive, the statement the Minister made in relation to the attitude of the British companies is not the whole truth.  My information is that the British companies indicated they were not prepared to take part in a scheme that was put forward because they regarded the scheme as one that would cloak fraud.  They indicated, too, that once the fraudulent aspect was disposed of they would be perfectly prepared to consider the situation.  It is a matter of current gossip, as Deputy Tully has pointed out, that one of the assets in the company's balance sheet was an entirely fictitious asset in value. I have no knowledge whether it was or not, but I am aware that the Tower Insurance Company shares were included in the Equitable portfolios as being in the region of approximately £80,000 in value.  Rumour said that was an entirely fictitious value.  I do not know whether it was or was not. Only the liquidator and, I presume, the Minister, through the liquidator, could know whether that was true or otherwise.  If it were a fictitious value, then it does seem to me that the suggestion that there was fraud in the certificate given under the Act is undoubted and cannot be denied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand the view the Minister has taken that there was no obligation on him to investigate the contents of the balance sheets returned to him.  May I say that, if his view of the law under the 1936 Act is correct in that respect, then I am even more amazed that he has not included in this Bill a section giving him that power.  Frankly, I think there was always the obligation on him under the 1936 Act not merely to receive the accounts but also to investigate the accounts and I am absolutely certain that that obligation was acknowledged <Col N="940" /> as being part of the statutory duty imposed by the Act of 1936 and that, over the years, inquiries were made of certain companies because of that obligation.</P>
    <P>I should be grateful if the Minister could assist me in relation to one phrase used by him in his opening speech.  He said that creditors other than those arising under eligible policies will not have access to the fund.  Does he mean that to cover, so to speak, a creditor for stationery supplies, for instance, or is it intended that &ldquo;eligible policies&rdquo; will restrict underwriting arrangements, or what exactly does it mean, because I have had considerable difficulty in interpreting the Bill itself?</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Cosgrave, I do not understand the purpose of the section dealing with the Irish Life.  May I say that I know, and the Minister will say it in a moment&mdash;I have not heard the rumour about that company that Deputy Tully has heard&mdash;quite categorically that there is not the faintest possible shadow of justification whatever for it?  The Irish Life is an absolutely sound concern.  Even if it were not, the shares are held by the Minister for Finance and there would be an absolute obligation on the State to stand over the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an obligation I believe any Minister for Finance would accept.  After all, the whole purpose in establishing the Irish Life Assurance Company was to take into account the valuations that were made in 1936 of the then companies and to float them as a solvent concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was also made to Part VI of the Act&mdash;the Part that was not put into operation&mdash;in relation to the establishment of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  That was not put into operation at the time because the British companies agreed to concede to the Irish companies a proportion&mdash; from recollection, 14 per cent&mdash;of their business which would be held in an Irish pool.  There was no suggestion at the time that arrangement was made that Part VI would not be put into <Col N="941" /> operation, that such ceding would be only to Irish companies which were tariff companies and that non-tariff companies would not be included.  It is not an Irish insurance organisation but a London organisation which decides whether a company is tariff or non-tariff.  I think it is a matter of regret that the Irish insurance pool has been restricted by the decision of the London office to solely Irish tariff companies instead of Irish companies as was certainly the intention in 1936, or some time after that, when the pool was set up in exchange for the dormancy of Part VI of the Act.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, speaking as a Deputy and not for an insurance company, with a little knowledge, not necessarily complete, of certain matters we are discussing, I should like the Minister to give the House a flat statement&mdash;he must have got a report from the liquidator&mdash;as to whether this asset in the Equitable balance sheet at approximately £86,000, I think, has in fact been proved to be of any value.  If the liquidator has concluded his investigations in that respect, I am sure that he has made a report to the Minister in regard to that. It seems to me the value of the asset is the kernel of the question as to whether there was or was not fraud in the presentation of the accounts.  The scheme that was suggested was not a scheme for the setting up of a fund like this but a scheme for the continuation of the Equitable Insurance Company on another basis which would undoubtedly have had, whether it was intended or not, the effect that the value of that asset and the reason for its certification in the accounts would never have seen the light of day.</P>

      <P>I should like to be clear as to the full provisions of this Bill.  Is it the intention to meet only claims where judgment has actually been given?  That is the first question. What is the position in regard to a claimant who, because he was in process of trying to settle out of court, had not had his case finalised?  It will be a great hardship if such cases are not covered.  If they are not covered, then they should be embodied in the Bill so that justice may be done.</P>

      <P>It is a good thing for the Dáil to approve a Bill such as this.  Our duty in this Dáil is to act as protectors of the people.  That is the primary objective of this Bill.  People were taken in by this insurance company and awards have already been made in court, in regard to workmen's compensation and other matters, and the unfortunate claimants have no way of getting the money.  I would say that this has been an expensive lesson for us all.  I would not accuse the Minister but I would accuse some of his colleagues for refusing to answer Parliamentary Questions.  This is a justification of something about which I have been arguing in this House for years, that we are representatives of the people, the watchdogs, you might say, of the people and instead of being brushed aside when we are asking questions about State companies, or about companies with a large amount of public money in them, it is only right that Ministers who are responsible or who say they are responsible &mdash;some of them who say they are responsible will not give information to the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think what I am saying is very important.  I am not accusing the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a pity, but we will leave that end of it.  The English insurance companies refused to come in on this and put up some money.  I thought at first that that was a little bit high-handed but when they gave their reason it was a good one, that if in the future there was a &ldquo;chancy&rdquo; company, they could take a <Col N="943" /> chance spending money on promotion and if it came off, well and good, but if it did not, the taxpayer would pay.</P>
      <P>I should like to give credit to the insurance companies for the manner in which they came forward because it is hard lines to have to put down a deposit of £100,000 of what we call locked-up money to make sure that if in the future&mdash;and I do not think there will be, with the help of God &mdash;there were any defaulters, the Minister would have a fund to compensate the policyholders or people who had claims.  I will say to the Minister, as I am allowed to speak only to the Minister, that he should continue his policy in this House and continue to answer Parliamentary Questions put down to him in regard to companies for which he is responsible.  Many people might not like this but we as the representatives of the people are entitled to know, and the fact that we get answers showing that everything is open and above board is something which should strengthen the company if questions are asked about it and if anything is going wrong with a company, it is a good thing that it should be brought into the House. I welcome the Bill from the point of view that it is going to pay the claims that have been made and the awards given in court to unfortunate policyholders.</P>

      <P>This is an insurance Bill and is one of a number of such Bills which come along at intervals only.  Advantage was taken of the introduction of this Bill to include a provision regarding the connection between the Minister for Finance and the Irish Life Assurance Company for the purpose of clarification of a certain situation which I propose to explain to <Col N="944" /> the House.  There is no other significance whatever in the inclusion of these two sections, sections 12 and 13 which refer to the Irish Life Assurance Company.</P>
      <P>Section 12 empowers the Minister for Finance to &ldquo;acquire by subscription or purchase and sell any shares of the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited.&rdquo;  The section, as I said, was introduced at the request of the Minister for Finance.  Under the existing law, the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938, the Minister already has power to dispose of shares held by him in the Irish Life Assurance Company but has no power to purchase further shares. That not only explains the position but relieves the fears expressed by Deputy Tully that the Minister for Finance has the intention only of disposing of shares.</P>

      <P>The other section to to which both Deputies Sweetman and Cosgrave referred is section 13 and they asked for clarification of it and the reason for its insertion here.  As the Deputies are aware, section 14 of the 1938 Act provides that the memorandum and articles of association of the Irish Life Assurance Company must be so framed as to conform with the provisions contained in the Agreement scheduled to the Act.  Paragraph 8 of the Agreement provides <i>inter alia</i> that the voting rights attached to the shares in the Irish Life:</P>
      <P>shall be declared to be that each issued share shall entitle the holder thereof (being the beneficial owner thereof) and being either (a) the Terminating Company, or (b) a citizen of Ireland, or (c) a &ldquo;qualified holding body corporate&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>to vote in respect of that share.  Some doubt has been cast on the qualification of the Minister for Finance as a shareholder of the company to qualify under these respective headings.  The Minister himself has no doubt about it but since doubt was cast whether he would qualify, he asked me to include this provision to remove all doubt so that he can, as a beneficial <Col N="945" /> owner or as a citizen, use his voting rights as a shareholder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>To come to the generalities of the Bill, if I may call them that, the purposes for which it was introduced, Deputy Cosgrave referred in particular to auditing arrangements.  I think Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Tully also to an extent felt that more might have been done with regard to ascertaining the exact position of the company as disclosed in its balance sheets and that more might be done in future to ensure that the true position of insurance companies as to their solvency is disclosed in the returns they are obliged by Statute to make to the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Insurance companies who carry on business under licence in this country are obliged under the 1936 Act to deposit annually with the Minister for Industry and Commerce returns comprising accounts, balance sheets, and statements in the form prescribed in the 1936 Act and in the preceding Act of 1909.  These returns must be audited in accordance with the Companies Acts.  The requirements as to auditing, with which the Equitable as well as <Col N="946" /> other companies had to comply, were set out in sections 112 and 113 of the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908. That Act is now repealed but this obligation has been repeated and expanded in the 1963 Act.</P>
    <P>Under these provisions a company was required to appoint at each annual general meeting an auditor or auditors to hold office until the next annual general meeting.  The provisions precluded a director or officer of the company from being appointed as auditor and prescribed a requirement regarding the giving of notice relating to the appointment of auditor.  The auditors were required to make a report to the shareholders on the accounts examined by them and on the balance sheet laid before the company in general meeting.  The report had to state (a) whether or not the auditors had obtained all the information and explanations they had required, and (b) whether they were of opinion that the balance sheet was properly drawn up so as to exhibit a true and correct view of the state of the company's affairs to the best of their information and the explanations given to them, and as shown by the books of the company.</P>
    <P>The requirements in the matter of auditor's certificates are even more elaborate since the coming into operation of the Companies Act, 1963, which, as the House is aware, came into operation on 1st April, 1964. Apart from the requirements to which I have referred, the 1936 Act prescribes a certificate which must accompany the balance sheet of an insurance company and which must be signed by the chairman, two directors, the principal officer of the company and the managing director, if there is one.  These persons must certify that the assets shown in the balance sheet do not exceed in the aggregate their market value, after taking into account any investment reserve fund; certify that the mortgages and loans are adequately secured; where the values of the Stock Exchange securities shown in the balance sheet are higher than the public Stock Exchange quotations, explain how the values have been arrived at; state the amount of <Col N="947" /> every increase of freehold or leasehold property which is not solely due to the cost of additions since the last balance sheet.</P>
    <P>These are stringent obligations on both the auditors and directors and principal officers of the company.  In so far as there is any suggestion of fraud in the returns made by the company, that is a matter with which the court, having seisin of the winding-up, will deal and may be regarded as <i>sub judice</i>.  I do not feel I should comment further on that.</P>
    <P>As far as the Department are concerned, the accounts of insurance companies are not required to be audited by the officers of the Department. There is no provision in the Act requiring officers of the Department to evaluate the assets of an insurance company as a matter of course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the doubtful solvency section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>But there has to be a doubt about solvency&mdash;that is the only case.  The function of the Department is to see that the accounts are submitted in the prescribed form and that they are certified in the prescribed manner.  Naturally, I did give some consideration to the question whether the present procedure should be altered to ensure a tightening up in the supervision of these accounts.  As I said previously in this House, our whole system of commerce so far as accounts are concerned depends on auditors' certificates.  The wheels of commerce are oiled to a considerable extent by these certificates, by the certified returns of auditors which are accepted in commerce in every walk of life, in the courts and as between companies. If auditors' certificates were not relied on, the whole fabric of our commercial structure would have to be altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of insurance companies, one of the alternatives that has been suggested is that the returns of insurance companies might be examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General. I do not think this would be feasible, in view of the fact that some 60 foreign companies would be obliged to have <Col N="948" /> their accounts submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General and these would inevitably include assets and business that have no direct association with this country.  Even if these accounts were confined to the business in this country of both Irish and British companies, I do not think the staff of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office would be of sufficient size to undertake this job.</P>
    <P>There have been other suggestions as to having the accounts of the insurance companies examined by a special panel of auditors.  Again, having regard to the diversity of choice the companies have and exercise in regard to auditors, it was found this would not be practicable.  In any event, I have decided that, apart from the vigilance that must continue to be exercised in my Department, there is hardly any necessity for stricter obligations to be imposed.  In the first place, we are in this Bill setting up a compensation fund to meet claims, and in the second place, we have a further assurance to the insured persons that their interests will be more properly looked after by providing that substantial deposits must be made in court.</P>
    <P>In regard to the increase in the deposits required in the High Court and the effect of these increases on the Private Motorists Protection Association, I would like to point out that this company did apply for a licence and, after some discussion with my Department, were prepared to comply with the law as it then stood.  At the time of their application.  I knew that the introduction of such a Bill as this was imminent, and I felt it would be unfair to this new insurance company, which it undoubtedly is, to issue a licence under the existing law, realising then that there would only have to be a deposit of £15,000 and that when this law came into force, they would have to increase that to £100,000.  I thought it better that their full obligation under the law as it will be when this Bill comes into operation should be made known to them before the licence was issued.  If PMPA apply for a licence and conform with the full obligations of the law as it will be <Col N="949" /> when this Bill passes, they will get the licence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked why cannot the insurance companies administer the fund themselves as the Incorporated Law Society does in the case of the fund for solicitors.  In the first place, they declined to participate in the fund in this form, and even when told that it was being set up, they made no suggestion whatever that its administration should be entrusted to them.  As the liquidator had been appointed by the court and as much work had been done by the court in relation to the winding-up of the company, I thought it better that the administration of the fund be retained in the court.  I do not expect that it is likely in our lifetimes, or ever, that another insurance company will become insolvent in this way.  I believe that this will be a once-and-for-all operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>When the fund is created, it will be invested by the Accountant of the court.  What will happen to the interest on that investment? Will there be any point at which it will arrive at a maximum and a surplus distributed between the contributing companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given some thought to that possibility but at the moment I do not intend to do anything. Contributions will be arranged in consultation with the companies in relation to their premium incomes.  As soon as a certain amount is lodged in the fund, it will be time enough to consider where we ought to call a halt and where the accretions to the fund will be sufficient.  There will then be plenty of time to decide whether we will distribute any surplus over a certain amount.</P>
      <P>With regard to Part VI of the 1936 Act for the promotion of a re-insurance group in Ireland which Deputy Cosgrave says was never implemented, Deputy Sweetman has, to a considerable extent, stated what the reasons were.  The Irish insurance companies requested that it not be implemented by reason of the agreement to which they had come and to which Deputy Sweetman referred</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="950" /> Deputy Sweetman stated rather categorically, and I quote: &ldquo;That the British insurance companies would not take part in any scheme that would cloak fraud&rdquo;.  I saw the representatives of the British insurance companies some time back.  The officers of my Department saw them subsequently, and they never used the word &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; in any of the conversations.  I cannot remember in detail what they said to me at that time but the effect of it was that they would not contribute voluntarily because this could lead to a reduction in standards of management and efficiency in the industry.  I believe it was in the same vein that they continued their subsequent discussions with the officers of my Department but I am assured that the word &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; was never used by the representatives of these companies.</P>
    <P>There were some questions as to what type of claims would be met.  I want to assure Deputy Coogan that claims arising out of judgments will not be the only claims met.  Settlements will also be met but the liquidator will have to be satisfied that they are settlements properly and reasonably made.  The ordinary creditors, such as stationers, will not be covered by the fund and neither will re-insurance debts.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully has said that £30,000 seems a very high amount in regard to claims under the Workmen's Compensation Acts but these claims continue over a number of years.  Accidents happen and the injured person is paid a weekly sum over a certain period.  That payment may be ultimately compromised.  The £30,000 will cover all these claims.</P>

      <P>That is correct. Deputy Tully complained about the action of the liquidator in writing to policyholders determining the point at which he had ceased to have responsibility for policies.  As the Deputy is aware, the liquidation is being done under the aegis and authority of the High Court and any matters he refers to in connection with the liquidator are really matters for the High Court. They are matters on which I cannot reasonably comment.  The action of the liquidator in writing to policyholders was prompted by a desire to explain the legal position as he saw it at the time and he was and is operating under the authority of the High Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

That, among other <Col N="952" /> things, will presumably arise for consideration in the course of the winding up.  The liquidator now is an officer of the court and not under my control.</P>

On paragraph (e) of the subsection, I would be satisfied in connection with this question of compulsory Irish to let this amendment go at the moment, if the Minister would express agreement to accept on Report Stage an amendment to the effect that if two candidates are found to have equal qualifications, preference will be given to the candidate with a <Col N="953" /> knowledge of Irish.  I would be satisfied if the Minister signified his agreement to have such an amendment inserted. Is there to be no bridge?  The Minister sits there as if he were not paying the slightest attention.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>This section dealing with the Irish language is simply to maintain the <i>status quo</i> in relation to CIE clerical appointments.  Deputies have debated this subject and it is clear there are very divergent views on it.  If any change of any kind, either to make the condition more stringent or in the reverse direction, in regard to compulsory Irish were to be made in connection with CIE clerical appointments, this is certainly not the time or the occasion.</P>
      <P>I hope Deputies realise that a commission was appointed who made recommendations on the use of the Irish language throughout the State&mdash;recommendations and comments on the use of Irish in semi-State bodies and in the Civil Service and on the teaching of Irish&mdash;and I think it would be entirely wrong for me to recommend to the Government, in advance of any general recommendation the Government may make, that there should be a change in the rules for the Irish test in one particular grade of the staff in CIE in respect of which this Irish test has been in force since 1924.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For one thing, it would be giving the public an idea that they were getting some hidden clue as to the final recommendations of the Government on this question.  I think it would be wrong.  Speaking entirely hypothetically, if I knew that the Government would be more stringent, or that they would leave the situation as it is, or that they would be less stringent in the matter of the Irish language, I should still say that to take this isolated group of people and make a change would <Col N="954" /> create a false impression.  It would cause all sorts of additional controversies.</P>
    <P>The suggestion in the Bill is that there should not be any change here. The trade union governing the relationship between the clerical officers and the management of CIE are well organised and they have made no complaints to me.  None of the people associated with this has made any complaint to me.  Deputy Casey, perfectly correctly, said last night that there had been no agitation for any change.  People seem to be satisfied with the position.  There is a section in the Bill which makes some traditional arrangements for relatives of people who have already been in CIE.  None of the relatives have complained to me, or their union, and the union is a close, well-knit and organised body which looks after all the interests of the staff of that grade.</P>
    <P>In view of that, and in view of the fact that this whole question will be the subject of consideration later on, I would not make any recommendation to the Government that they should alter the rule either one way or the other in advance of the general consideration of this matter, because, if I did so, as I have already indicated, it would merely start a controversy about what the Government are going to recommend in future for other State bodies, for the Civil Service.  It would trigger off a whole new series of arguments and controversies based on a change which would appear to indicate some future trend.  It would be entirely wrong from my point of view. It is far better to leave it the way it is. I hope that will shorten the debate on this subject.  It would be entirely wrong for me to make this change.</P>

The Minister is the first person in the course of this discussion to refer to the matter of the Commission which reported some time ago.  He made the case that it would be undesirable to anticipate the Government's White Paper on the Commission's report.  It is precisely because of the Commission's report and because of the pressure group now endeavouring to have that report implemented, because of the pressure being put on the Government, that we feel it is very desirable that we should take issue with the Minister at this stage, on this section, because, bear this in mind, Sir, we have not been afforded an opportunity of discussing the Commission's report at any stage.</P>

      <P>This provision is unnecessary and irrelevant because the Minister has argued that he has indicated to the trade unions that the tests to be applied will be the intermediate certificate and the leaving certificate <Col N="960" /> and, as we know, Irish is already a compulsory subject for these examinations. In these circumstances, what is the point of this provision?  The Minister says he has received no representations from the trade unions nor has he received any complaints from outside bodies.  He is receiving complaints upon this matter from the Fine Gael Party who represent 350,000 people in this country.  That is the answer to that.  The matter of trade unions catering for the CIE clerical workers' attitude is a red herring.  We are concerned about the young people who have not yet entered the CIE service. We are concerned about the young people who would be debarred from entering CIE.  We are concerned about elementary justice and we are concerned to see thrown over the humbug and hypocrisy which has been manifested again here by the Minister.</P>

      <P>This section relates to the appointment of directors to the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company.  I endeavoured to speak on this on the Second Stage and I was ruled out of order and told I could speak on it now.  I have here the Fishguard and Rosslare Railway and Harbours Acts and section 70 of the 1898 Act is a very important provision. I should like the Minister's assurance that when he is appointing a director, he will have this section drawn to his attention.  The port of Waterford has been very badly treated by British Railways, notwithstanding a British Act of Parliament.  We could nearly say it was worse than the breaking of the Treaty of Limerick by the British.  Section 70 (1) of the Fishguard <Col N="961" /> and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Act, 1898, reads:</P>
      <P>The Great Western Company shall unless and until Parliament shall otherwise determine continue to provide or afford a daily service by steamer between Waterford and either New Milford or Fishguard as efficient as that provided by them at the date of the passing of this Act and the Railway and Canal Commission shall have the same powers for enforcing this provision as they have for enforcing the provisions of section 2 of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1854.</P>
      <P>This section deals with the continuance of the service by steamer between Waterford and any of these ports in Wales.  The importance of this is that in the 1930s, thanks to the Minister's friends, we had an Economic War and there was practically no cattle traffic or livestock traffic on this hitherto well-supported service.  British Railways came to the Waterford Harbour Commissioners and got their permission to reduce the service to a three-day service.  They were justified in doing that.</P>

If we ask the Minister a Parliamentary Question he refuses to answer, so he had better take it now.  I want to ensure that the director <Col N="962" /> will not be sent jaunting off to his directors meeting without being aware of it and aware of the kind of people he will have to meet in British Railways.</P>
      <P>We had our three-day service and Waterford Harbour Commissioners got an application from British Railways to take off the passenger service as they proposed to increase the container capacity of the ship and remove the passenger cabins.  The Commissioners did not agree to that and&mdash; here is the importance of having people in the Government representing the local interest&mdash;the present Taoiseach who was Minister for Industry and Commerce and responsible for Transport and Power at the time, when British Railways appealed to him, said that they could by legislation get what they wanted.  I was the still, small voice who said: &ldquo;Let the British get out by their own legislation if they like and rat on the agreement they made with Waterford Harbour Commissioners and the people of Waterford&rdquo;.  They could have been compelled to keep the service there.  I draw the Minister's attention to that. When a man is going to attend these meetings, he should be specifically instructed and should be shown these Acts which the British Parliament solemnly passed and in which they gave undertakings to various authorities here.</P>
      <P>I contend that the British Government &ldquo;pressured&rdquo; themselves out of this and they were able to do that because Waterford Harbour Commissioners were abandoned by their own Minister.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="964" /> Notwithstanding anything contained in section 89 of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Act, 1898, the Board, in exercise of its powers under that section, may nominate at any time, if it so thinks fit, persons who are not members of the Board as directors of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company.</P>
    <P>If they are to bring in these outside men, or even directors of CIE, it is no harm that they should be aware of what is in these Acts as regards agreements made between the old railway companies in England&mdash;now British Railways&mdash;and ourselves, agreements which were cast-ironed by these British Acts of Parliament.

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this section because, as I know the position, the Rosslare-Fishguard Company consists of representatives of British Railways and CIE and I have considerable apprehension in regard to the future of the port of Rosslare in which I am interested.  This section says that notwithstanding anything contained in the previous Act&mdash;I take that to mean the directors of this company would be representatives of British Railways and CIE&mdash;the Minister may appoint an outside director.  I think that is a correct interpretation of it.  The director need not be a member of the Board of CIE.  That is the section we are dealing with.  I am apprehensive because I have the feeling that the joint responsibility for the Rosslare-Fishguard Company, which also deals with hinterland places like Waterford, is at the moment administering jointly the cross-Channel shipping between the two ports and it is essential that the people who are administering that should be concerned <Col N="965" /> entirely with the development and survival of the port and the further advancement of the facilities of the port and the service also.</P>
      <P>I know from Press reports that British Railways have already shown their intention of establishing a ferry service in opposition to the one I am particularly concerned with at Rosslare. I have learned from the Minister that he is aware of the fact that the existing ferry service is a paying service, expanding and increasing daily.  What worries me is that I feel that CIE who are in financial difficulties already must naturally be concerned with preserving and maintaining any institution that is giving them revenue.  It is fair to say that the operations of the Fishguard-Rosslare Company are remunerative.  They pay a dividend; they have never been subsidised and have never produced a loss, but they are only a part of the general scheme of CIE.  It is a solvent company which has to carry the losses of CIE as a whole.</P>
      <P>I conceive this to be a local matter, vital to the fundamental financial interests of CIE.  Because of that, I am apprehensive about this section.  I do not see any reason for the introduction of such a section when there is already in existence legislation covering the whole position.  There must be something in the minds of those advising the Minister when he introduces a section such as this, changing the existing pattern.  Being a Wexford man I am naturally apprehensive that this is a move on someone's part to appoint a director who will decide that Rosslare no longer justifies its existence and CIE will make more money out of Dublin.  My own belief is that they will make less money because the overhead expenses will be far greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constitution of this Board as it stands is in no way inimical to Rosslare and I should like the Minister to give a full explanation of the introduction of this section.  Why should we be asked to give power to appoint a particular director?  This has nothing to do with the suggested ferry at Dún Laoghaire, a project to which a great many people in the area are opposed.  I hope I have made crystal clear the full explanation <Col N="966" /> I want the Minister to make publicly here so that those concerned may be assured they are adequately safeguarded. Practically the whole area around Rosslare is dependent on Rosslare Harbour.  I support Deputy Lynch's plea for Waterford.  They have no longer their own shipping service and are, therefore, dependent on this area as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE consider it would be advantageous in certain circumstances to have whole-time officers rather than part-time members of the Board under the relevant Acts to represent the interest of CIE on the Board of the Fishguard-Rosslare Company.  They think more effective work would be done.  I have already given information as to the likely developments at Fishguard and Rosslare. I am glad to say the new manager of the Western Regional British Railways is taking a great interest in the development and modernisation of the services there.  Already increased facilities have been provided for cars, facilities to enable cars to be transferred more expeditiously to the boats at Fishguard.  There were additional sailings last year and an increase again this year, with a corresponding increase in the car space available.</P>
      <P>It is impossible for me to give in advance the character of the report being prepared jointly by the Great Western Regional British Transport Commission and CIE on the future development of Rosslare.  All I can say is that the report is likely to be very favourable.  I cannot commit the British Transport Commission in advance. The whole matter is being studied. Consulting engineers have been appointed to examine the position on behalf of the Fishguard-Rosslare Harbour Company.  I have made it clear to CIE that, if there is agreement on a project for improved services, and CIE cannot find the capital, the matter should come before me.  This is a matter of national interest.  Everything is moving favourably at the moment.  Until agreement has been reached, I cannot give any details.  The Deputy, however, need have no fear in relation to the future of Rosslare and Fishguard services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="967" /> In relation to the exploratory work which is being done, I do not think I am giving away any confidential information when I say the market research was carried out at a time when the full impact of the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead ferry service could be appreciated. When the new chairman decided to investigate this matter, he asked for estimates of future potential traffic. These were highly favourable, despite the knowledge that the Dún Laoghaire ferry service would be in operation in 1965.  There will be considerable motor car traffic through both Dún Laoghaire and Rosslare on the run-off and run-on basis.  I have every reason be believe that the final report will be to our advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible for me to forecast.  I should imagine we will know something about it before the end of the summer.  Highly technical considerations enter into the picture in regard to Rosslare because of silting in the harbour.  CIE have spent considerable sums desilting the harbour.  The construction of a road and the formation of shore facilities involve technical examination also.  It would be very difficult for me to predict in advance how long the study will take.  All I can say is that I have told CIE I regard the matter as one for urgent attention and the study must be constantly and continuously proceeding. They have accepted that position.</P>

      <P>Yes, and in Dún Laoghaire and Holyhead.  The first and most important thing was to get a response from the British side.  That <Col N="968" /> response has come.  Anyone may say it could have come earlier.  The market research could have been undertaken at any time in the past, but, as I have already indicated, the major part of the study on the side of British Railways has been since 1960 and is related to the new attitude taken by the two chairmen of the Midland Region of British Railways and the attitude taken by the new chairman of the Western Region of British Railways and to the general directions which obviously have been given by Dr. Beeching to British Railways to seek new traffic, develop sales and bring in new business. All this has been happening since 1960.  We may say, from our point of view, that it is rather late but we are very glad it is happening.  It commenced in 1960 and has been happening ever since.</P>

      <P>The Minister may be able to advise me now on a point. I had an amendment to section 6 which deals with the annual grant to the Board.  The Minister also tabled an amendment and told us that the type of order he contemplated under section 6 was a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; type of order and could not be amended.  The chief difference between my point of view and his was that my amendment was that the order should be open to amendment.  The Minister's reply was that the parliamentary draftsman had more or less insisted on the form we have from the Minister. I asked the Minister why and he agreed that he was not briefed on the matter and proposed to be briefed at a later stage.  Has he got the explanation now as to why my form, asking that an order should come in draft form and be open to amendment, is wrong?  I am asking this for the purpose of putting down an amendment.</P>

      <P>The difficulty is that under the procedure laid down in the Constitution, if the Seanad amends a Bill already passed by the Dáil, or in the case of a Money Bill makes recommendations, the Bill must come back for further consideration by the Dáil.  There is no such procedure for ministerial orders and the situation could arise, if the Deputy's amendment were accepted, that the Dáil could amend the order in one way and the Seanad could amend it in another way, and there is no procedure for reconciling the amendments between the Dáil, and the Seanad.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £3,414,530 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the <Col N="971" /> charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st March, 1965, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Transport and Power, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The net Estimate of £5,121,530 for 1964/65 compares with £5,219,890 for 1963/64.  However, the 1963/64 provision included £1,175,000 for a grant to Córas Iompair Éireann and no provision other than a token sum of £10 appears for 1964/65.  If the legislation which is at present before the Oireachtas is enacted it will be necessary to bring in a Supplementary Estimate for £2 million so that the total net Estimate for 1964/65 would be over £7 million, an increase of nearly £2 million as compared with last year.  For the purpose of comparison I am assuming that the £2 million for CIE will be payable this year.</P>
    <P>The principal increases are in the provision for CIE grant and redundancy compensation, £1,125,000, Tourism, £551,000, grants to Shannon Free Airport Development Company, £250,000.  Increases in other subheads amount to £277,000 making the total increase £2,203,000.  Decreases in expenditure on airports and catering service amount to £240,000, and on other subheads there is a decrease of £15,000.  There is also an estimated increase of £47,000 in Appropriations in Aid.  These amounts reduce the increases by £302,000, so that the net increase for 1964/65, assuming a £2 million grant for CIE, will be about £1.9 million.</P>
    <P>I have circulated to Deputies notes on the activities of the State companies with which I am concerned and since only a few months have elapsed since the Estimates for my Department for 1963/64 were discussed in the House I propose to confine my remarks to policy matters and the more important features.</P>
    <P>In view of the early recess of the Dáil, I have not been able to refer in detail to many aspects of Departmental <Col N="972" /> administration.  The general work of the Department, the planning directives and the very specific supervision over the companies for which I am responsible, together with the administrative practices in relation to the investigation of complaints are already set out in my speeches on last year's Estimates in Vol. 207, No. 4, Cols. 650-652 and Vol. 207, No. 11, Cols. 1496-1576.  I would suggest that Deputies refer to these statements as it will enable a more constructive approach to the policy of the Department.</P>
    <P>Although the total number of passengers handled at Shannon in the year ended 31st March, 1964, decreased by 9 per cent to 334,000 and the number of landings decreased by 19 per cent to 5,080, the number of terminal passengers&mdash;both embarked and disembarked&mdash;increased by 15 per cent to 188,000.  It is probable that the increase in terminal traffic in 1964 will offset the drop in transit traffic, and that as from 1965, the total traffic at the airport should begin to rise again.</P>
    <P>In fact, in the first five months, January to May inclusive, of this year while total freight of 6,750 tons is the same as last year's figure, total passenger traffic at 82,000 has shown an increase of 13 per cent over the 72,500 in the same period of 1963.</P>
    <P>Deputies may wish to know that arrangements are in train for the celebration in September next of the Silver Jubilee of Shannon Airport operations.</P>
    <P>Works in progress at Shannon include the erection of a new control building which will be more centrally situated in relation to the runways than the existing control tower. Accommodation will be provided in the new building for air traffic control and radio service staffs with a view to the efficient co-ordination of these services and the most economical utilisation of staff.</P>
    <P>It is intended during the coming winter to commence the reconstruction of the concourse area which formed part of the original terminal building and is now in poor structural condition. This work will provide improved <Col N="973" /> facilities for the handling of the increased number of terminal passengers who embark or disembark at Shannon. It is not possible to undertake this work during the peak traffic which occurs in the summer.  In the meantime, however, work is proceeding on a preliminary part of the scheme.  This includes alterations and improvements to the public catering accommodation and facilities involving the installation of a modern grill bar and cocktail bar to provide a faster meals service together with a first-class restaurant with a dance floor.  The lounge area on which no major renovations have been carried out for several years is also being redecorated.</P>
    <P>All sectors of traffic at Dublin Airport showed significant increase in the year ended 31st March, 1964.  A comprehensive five year building plan continues and structures for cargo, administrative and catering and passenger reception continue to be planned and erected in due sequence.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the flight victualling and catering service building will be started this year.  The next step will be the construction of a new cargo terminal and a link building between the first and second piers already erected.  The final step will be the erection of a new passenger terminal building which is becoming necessary owing to increases in passenger traffic.</P>
    <P>During the year ended 31st March, 1964, Cork Airport had almost 98,000 passengers, an increase of 24 per cent. Freight traffic, which is as yet not very significant, showed a small drop of 3 per cent to 266 metric tons.  In addition the Cork/Bristol car-ferry service carried 678 vehicles.  This service will operate at an increased frequency this summer.</P>
    <P>The increased participation by BEA on the Dublin/London, Dublin/Manchester and Dublin/Birmingham routes continues.  Increased capacity will be offered by Aer Lingus on its cross-channel routes this year and frequencies will be increased on the Dublin/ Leeds, Dublin/Glasgow, Dublin/Liverpool and Dublin/Edinburgh routes as well as on the Cork/London and Cork/ <Col N="974" /> Birmingham routes.  The Aer Lingus vehicle-ferry services which were so successful last year will be continued this summer and increased frequencies will operate on the Dublin/Liverpool and Dublin/Cherbourg routes.  The Aer Lingus services to the Continent are being maintained this year, and next year, with the introduction on these services of the BAC One-Eleven jet aircraft, it is expected that there will be a big increase in traffic on the routes.</P>
    <P>The BEA shareholding of £95,199 in Aer Lingus has been acquired by Aer Rianta which now holds all the shares, except directors' qualifying shares, in the company.  Accordingly Aer Lingus is now 100 per cent Irish-owned, the Government holding all the capital.</P>
    <P>A new Boeing 707 aircraft has been added to the Aerlínte fleet this year, and it is expected to be in operation shortly.  The aircraft, which can carry up to 178 passengers as well as a cargo load of 4 tons, represents a considerable advance over the present 720 aircraft which carry 130 passengers and 3 tons of cargo.  A further Boeing 707 will be acquired in 1965. These purchases will enable Aerlínte gradually to replace its existing fleet. One of the existing Boeing planes which has lesser capacity will be sold at the end of the summer at its present book value.  Another plane of the same type will be on charter to a foreign air line during the winter.  These arrangements have enabled Aerlínte to utilise its fleet to the maximum extent during the summer when traffic is at its peak.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus as well as Aerlínte are conducting a vigorous campaign abroad to stimulate tourist traffic to Ireland.  Their expenditure this year will be of the order of $1¾ million in North America and £120,000 in Britain.  Aer Lingus is also expanding its student exchange plan, as there appears to be considerable traffic potential in this type of operation.</P>
    <P>While the audit of the accounts of the air companies is still proceeding and certified accounts will not be available until mid-July it appears that the profit for the year, after providing <Col N="975" /> for all charges including depreciation and interest on loan capital, will amount to approximately £350,000 for Aer Lingus &mdash; which compares with a loss for the preceding year of £120,904. In the case of Aerlínte the profit will amount to approximately £900,000 which compares with a profit of £466,000 in 1962/63.</P>
    <P>The profit earned by Aer Lingus will have to absorb the adverse balance of £77,486 on the profit and loss account for 1962/63.  The balance of approximately £272,000 together with Aerlínte's profit of £900,000 will be a useful contribution towards the companies' capital expenditure in the next few years of approximately £14 million, to which the Exchequer will contribute £2 million, the balance being found by the companies either from their own resources or by borrowing. Details of the proposed capital expenditure are given in the Notes.</P>
    <P>Both Aer Lingus and Aerlínte have greatly increased their traffic during April and May of this year but in the case of Aerlínte the profit position may be affected by the substantial reduction in transatlantic fares.  The average fare for April and May showed a reduction of 25 per cent on the corresponding months in 1963.</P>
    <P>This year sees the coming into operation of two new Irish nonscheduled airlines: Shannon Air Limited and Aer Turas Teoranta. These will mainly operate freight charter flights.  It is hoped that they will make a considerable contribution to the development of aviation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>A sum of £410,000 is being provided for the Development Company by way of grant-in-aid in 1964/65, to meet the running expenses of the company and to provide financial assistance for the setting up of industrial, commercial and trading enterprises on an increasing scale.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1,250,000 is being provided in the Capital Budget for 1964/ 65 to meet share capital and repayable advances, used mainly for factory building and community services, compared with £1,400,000 issued to the company in 1963/64.</P>
    <P>Up to 31st March, 1964 the total <Col N="976" /> State investment in industrial and housing development at Shannon amounted to £5.4 million.  At that date there were 12 manufacturing and 8 trading concerns in operation at Shannon employing 2,109 persons.</P>
    <P>The company's tourism promotional activities are designed to promote tourism generally and, particularly, to spread the benefits of increased tourism earnings throughout the west of Ireland where tourism forms an important part of the regional economy.  The company's mediaeval tour is proving highly successful and is encouraging an increasing number of Americans travelling to and from Europe to include a stop off at Shannon in their itinerary.  Work on the folk park project as an extension to the Bunratty Castle development is also proceeding satisfactorily.  Both these projects were initiated in my Department.</P>
    <P>The progress of the company in the past year, as reflected in the expansion of industry and the increase in employment to which I have referred, is very gratifying.  The company is at present negotiating with several firms interested in setting up at Shannon and, with the expected development of new industries and the continued expansion of existing ones, the future of the Shannon Industrial Estate appears to be bright.  It is intended that the provision of housing and community development will keep pace with the requirements of the expanding estate.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Ltd. now have a dry-cargo fleet of 17 vessels totalling 146,400 tons deadweight and three tankers totalling 39,380 tons deadweight. Having regard to the privately owned tonnage available it has been decided that the current dry-cargo fleet is adequate to meet strategic requirements and that additions to the fleet will be considered when commercial considerations so justify.</P>
    <P>The accounts of Irish Shipping Ltd. for 1963-64 have recently been presented to the House and, although the position is still far from satisfactory, the results were considerably better than in the previous year.  The company had an operating surplus of <Col N="977" /> £445,322 on working account for the year and after providing an amount of £1,023,845 for depreciation of the fleet and allowing for investment income, bank interest, directors' fees and auditors' fees, the net commercial loss amounted to £556,721.  The improvement was due to the temporary increase in freight rates which took place at the end of 1963, although about 70 per cent of the revenue for the year was attributable to rates obtaining before the increases became effective.</P>
    <P>The provision of £190,000 for grants for harbour improvement works covers works in progress or works expected to commence shortly.  The principal current improvement schemes are those for Galway, Drogheda and Wicklow, for which grants totalling £340,000, £175,000, and £100,000 respectively have been approved.  The growing importance of the ports is reflected in the country's export trade which increased from £174 million in 1962 to £196 million in 1963.</P>
    <P>In relation to harbours, the Government's <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> assumes that normally all harbours should be operated as commercial undertakings and that maintenance charges and improvements required by expanding trade should be financed on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>Efficient cargo handling is a matter of vital interest, not only to the individual harbour authorities, whose trade will expand or decline according as shippers and consignees find the port an economic one to use or otherwise, but, it may be said, to virtually the entire industrial and commercial community. It is pleasant to be able to record that advances continue to be made in this field.</P>
    <P>The procedure governing the documentary clearance of goods through ports is also a matter calling for inquiry and I have set up a working group to investigate the possibility of securing a freer flow of goods.</P>
    <P>The new car ferry vessel, to operate on the Holyhead-Dún Laoghaire route, is now under construction and I am informed by British Railways that they <Col N="978" /> hope to have it ready to put into service by June, 1965.</P>
    <P>Very substantial improvements in second class accommodation will be effected on the British Railways passenger vessels this autumn.  This, together with increases in the number of sailings, the additional platform at Holyhead and other improvements make a most welcome modernisation programme initiated in 1961 and continued since that year under the two able Midland Board chairmen of the British Transport Commission and ably assisted by the British Railways Irish Sea Traffic Manager.</P>
    <P>CIE and British Railways are, through the medium of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company, jointly carrying out a comprehensive examination of the improvements necessary on the Fishguard-Rosslare services to cater for the traffic through that port and for the very substantial growth in tourist traffic&mdash; especially cars&mdash;which is foreseen.  The proposed improvements include the improvement of Rosslare Harbour and the provision of road access between the mainland and Rosslare Pier which can at present be reached only by rail.</P>
    <P>I come next to energy.  The energy we used in 1963 was supplied roughly as follows: oil, 36 per cent; turf, 30 per cent; coal, 26 per cent; hydroelectric 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>The final results of the working of the ESB in 1963/64 are not yet available in full, but I understand that they will show a surplus which will be somewhat less than the surplus &mdash;£636,000&mdash;for 1962/63.  Hydro conditions during the year were a little below average and the mild weather in the last quarter of the year resulted in a slight slowing down in the growth of demand for current.</P>
    <P>The Board's programme of generating plant construction provides for a long term increase in demand of about 9 per cent per annum.  Between now and 1970, 530 megawatts, of which 420 megawatts will be oil-fired and 110 megawatts will be milled peat fired, will be added to generating capacity.</P>
    <P>The Board is pushing ahead rapidly with the re-canvassing of rural areas <Col N="979" /> in connection with the post-development rural electrification scheme.</P>
    <P>By the time the new canvass has been completed in all areas, that is to say, within the next three years, practically 100,000 unconnected houses will have had an opportunity to benefit from the increased subsidy, at standard charges or slightly above standard charges.  If all these should accept there would then be connected about 96 per cent of all rural premises.</P>
    <P>The task of canvassing these 100,000 houses is a considerable one which must be organised and carried out on a planned basis so as to ensure its completion within the specified period and in the most economical manner.  The canvassers are followed by the construction crews who have been specially organised for maximum output under the particular conditions. These are self-contained units supplied with the necessary transport and equipment. The keymen move from place to place with the crews but the unskilled workers are generally recruited locally.  It is essential in the interests of cost and efficiency that these crews operate according to a carefully planned programme.  Of course no matter what system was adopted it would be impossible to reach some areas before 1967, but every unconnected householder can be assured that he will be offered connection in his turn within the next three years.</P>
    <P>The issue of £10½ million 6 per cent stock in March last brings the Board's total stock issues to £37½ million.</P>
    <P>The probable financial result of Bord na Móna's operations for the year will be a small surplus after all charges have been met.</P>
    <P>A fourth briquette factory to be based on the Shannonbridge-Athlone group of bogs is planned to come into operation in 1968.</P>
    <P>Moss peat is a very successful product of Bord na Móna.  Sales in 1963/64 were worth almost £300,000. A new moss peat factory is expected to come into production in County Laois about the middle of next year. Its capacity will be about 300,000 bales and it will employ about 250 workers <Col N="980" /> bringing total employment in moss peat production to over 550.  The cost of bog development and the erection of the factory will amount to about £450,000.  About 80 per cent of moss peat production is exported.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna had a successful issue of £2,000,000 stock last month&mdash; their first appeal to the public.  The eager response reflects the confidence of the public in the organisation.  This issue exhausts the Board's borrowing powers and amending legislation will be necessary to authorise them to obtain additional capital.</P>
    <P>Coal consumption in this country amounts to about 1.6 million tons annually.  In 1963 coal represented about 26 per cent of the country's total supply of energy.  For coal supplies the country is almost entirely dependent on imports which come mainly from Great Britain, the United States and Poland.</P>
    <P>The investigation into the prospect of using the reserves of high ash content coal in the Arigna coalfield in an extension to the Arigna Station is still proceeding.</P>
    <P>Oil, of which about 1.5 million tons is now used annually in this country, accounts for about one-third of the country's entire requirements of primary energy.  Consumption has been increasing rapidly over the last five years and the indications are that by 1970 it will supply nearly one-half of requirements.</P>
    <P>It has recently been decided that my Department should assume overall responsibility for co-ordinating matters concerning nuclear energy.  Other Departments having special interest in particular aspects of nuclear energy will, of course, continue to be responsible for these aspects of the subject.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned previously, my Department is sponsoring a promotional drive with the object of interesting industrial firms in the very considerable savings which can be achieved by the efficient use of fuel.</P>
    <P>43 firms were visited during 1963 and the potential savings in fuel costs which could be achieved by these firms were estimated at £138,000 annually or <Col N="981" /> 20 per cent of an annual fuel bill of approximately £690,000.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal with CIE in the course of this speech as I recently dealt with it very comprehensively in my Second Stage speech on the Transport Bill, 1964.  Should Deputies wish to raise any particular questions concerning road or rail transport during the debate on the Estimates for my Department, I shall endeavour to deal with them when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>The provision for tourism this year is £2,020,000 compared with £1,469,000 last year, an increase of £551,000.  This takes account of requirements under the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  The provision takes the form of three grants-in-aid to Bord Fáilte Éireann&mdash;Subhead F.I. under which £1,350,000 is provided for the discharge of the Board's general functions including overseas publicity and advertising and a wide range of activities at home and abroad; Subhead F.2 which provides for a sum of £250,000 for resort development grants; and Subhead F.3 under which £420,000 is being provided for grants to assist the development of holiday accommodation.</P>
    <P>The <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> aims at a doubling of tourist income over the decade 1960 to 1970 and this calls for an average annual increase of 7.2 per cent as compared with an annual 6.8 per cent during the <i>First Programme.</i></P>
    <P>In December, 1962, I asked Bord Fáilte to consider a very detailed memorandum relating to the requirements of the tourist promotional drive based on the objective of encouraging medium-priced grade traffic to this country and setting out at length the factors involved, from the provision of accommodation to the improvement of local facilities in resort areas.  This enabled advanced planning to be undertaken before the very high second programme tourist growth target was set in the middle of 1963.</P>
    <P>The programme, as devised by Bord Fáilte, was discussed and examined at great length with them.  The target will be difficult to achieve because the increase in direct tourist expenditure by genuine tourists from countries <Col N="982" /> other than those where expenditure is likely to expand only moderately must be very large indeed to provide a net 100 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>The Bord Fáilte organisation has been strengthened, particularly on the marketing side, and the very best marketing methods are now being employed.  Increased emphasis is being placed on particular facilities and amenities in Ireland which are likely to be attractive to special categories of visitors &mdash; angling, pleasure boating, student travel, conference business and so on&mdash;and some of these are already proving quite successful.  More personal contact is being promoted through the visits of travel agents and travel writers.</P>
    <P>The scheme for developing major resorts has gathered momentum and the grants paid by Bord Fáilte last year amounted to £180,000, or more than double the previous year.  Increased assistance can now be given in respect of new accommodation&mdash;hotels, holiday camps or holiday villages&mdash; especially in the more remote tourist areas of the West not adequately supplied with accommodation for visitors. The grant schemes for the extension and improvement of existing premises are being continued with increased maxima to take account of money depreciation and with other modifications made in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>A significant new feature is that grants are now available for guest houses which provide not less than ten guest bedrooms either before or after completion of improvement works.  In view of the need for more entertainment facilities for visitors, particularly outside the urban areas, grants for this purpose have been extended in scope. Assistance is also being made available towards the provision of additional youth hostels, especially in the West, and for the improvement of existing hostels.  In addition, residential schools and colleges, which can accommodate groups of visitors during the summer season, will be assisted where necessary to improve their facilities.  There will be continued emphasis on the need to provide medium-priced accommodation for lower and middle-income visitors.  This question is, of course, <Col N="983" /> affected considerably by the capital investment required for new building and the difficulty of remunerating this capital on the basis of a short holiday season.  The campaign for extending the tourist season continues and a commission is now sitting to examine how far changes in public and bank holidays can ease the position.</P>
    <P>With the formation of the eight new regional tourism organisations, we now have the framework for a co-ordinated tourist campaign using the resources of all sections of the community. Many local authorities have shown their appreciation of this new development by increasing very substantially their contributions to tourism and I am sure that the fruits of this investment will be evident in the expansion of the tourist trade in their areas.  I hope that members of this House on all sides will lend their support to the new tourism organisations and will encourage all interests in their constituencies to work together in this new co-operative endeavour.  In 1965 the boards of directors will be elected on a proportional and democratic basis.</P>
    <P>The Transport Act, 1950 (Additional Powers) Order, 1964, is being taken with the Estimate.  Therefore, I should give some explanation of it.  The purpose quite simply is to enable CIE to establish a subsidiary company for the handling of air freight.  This is a very highly-specialised business and CIE consider it important that it should be operated by a separate company.  At the present time, the volume of air freight between this country and other countries is not more than a small fraction of the volume of freight moving by land but, in terms of value, air freight is not inconsiderable.  Between this country and Great Britain, for example, air freight represents about seven per cent of the value of total import and export trade.</P>
    <P>CIE are well placed to provide a specialised transport network throughout the country for air freight.  However, the main reason why they wish to establish this subsidiary is in order to qualify for recognition by the <Col N="984" /> International Air Transport Association as an air freight forwarding business. To participate effectively in the air freight forwarding business, it is desirable for CIE to dissociate air freight business from general carrying business.  For this reason, CIE find it necessary to establish a subsidiary company to deal with the air freight forwarding business.</P>
    <P>There are other technical reasons. There is a difference in the character of operation.  There has to be very special flexibility and very high speed air-freight transport.  For that reason, I recommend that the Dáil agree to the formation of this subsidiary company.</P>
    <P>I should add that the powers of the company will not be wider than the powers already exercised by CIE.  It will be subject to official control.  The memorandum and articles of association will be subject to the approval of myself and the Minister for Finance. Alterations cannot be made in this memorandum without my prior approval and the same applies to the company's borrowing powers.  The procedure, in fact, is in line with that adopted when CIE formed a separate company for hotels, Ostlanna Iompair Éireann, Teoranta.</P>
    <P>The directors will be the same as the directors of CIE, including the chairman, who will also act as chairman of the subsidiary company.  Neither he nor the ordinary directors will be paid any remuneration for their services to the company.  I think that gives the particulars of the reasons for establishing the subsidiary company.</P>
    <P>The motion on the Order Paper in relation to the State Guarantees Act, 1954 (Amendment of Schedule) (No. 2) Order, 1964 a copy of which in draft has been laid before the House, is also being taken.  The purpose of the Order is to add Aer Lingus, Teoranta, to the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act, 1954, to enable the Minister for Finance to guarantee borrowings by the company up to a limit of £5 million. The existing legislation in regard to the guaranteeing of borrowing by the Air Companies is contained in section 75 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, as amended by <Col N="985" /> section 3 of the Air Navigation and Transport (No. 2) Act, 1959, and provides that the Minister for Finance may guarantee debentures issued by Aer Rianta up to a limit of £5 million. There is no provision for the direct guarantee by the Minister for Finance of borrowings by Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>It is considered that Aer Lingus should be in a position to borrow direct from commercial sources, under the guarantee of the Minister for Finance, moneys required for its own purposes and it is proposed to provide for this and other matters in legislation which I hope to introduce later in the year in relation to the air companies.  As an interim measure, it is proposed to avail of the machinery of the State Guarantees Act, 1954, to provide the Minister for Finance with the necessary powers of guarantee.  I would propose on the enactment of the new legislation to have Aer Lingus Teoranta deleted from the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has ordered four short-haul jet aircraft, for use mainly on the company's continental services, and these aircraft are due for delivery next spring.  Of the total cost of about £5 million, £2 million will be provided from the Exchequer by way of equity capital.  It will be necessary for Aer Lingus in the near future to borrow moneys from commercial sources towards the financing of the purchase of the short-haul jet aircraft and for other capital purposes.  Borrowing from commercial sources&mdash;provided the terms are reasonable&mdash;is to be encouraged as it reduces the demands for loans from the Exchequer.  The addition of the company to the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act will facilitate the proposed borrowing as it will enable the borrowings to be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance would, of course, be prepared to give a guarantee only where he is satisfied with the terms of borrowing.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the State Guarantees Act, 1954, requires the Minister for Finance to lay an annual statement before each House of the Oireachtas giving details of each guarantee given <Col N="986" /> by him under the Act and borrowings by Aer Lingus guaranteed by the Minister will be included in the annual statement.</P>
    <P>The immediate capital commitments of the air companies involve an expenditure of the order of £14 million, of which the State contribution will be £2 million towards the purchase of the four BAC One-Eleven aircraft.  It is expected that the companies' own resources will provide about £4 million of the total cost.  The source of provision of the balance of upwards of £8 million has not yet been determined but it is expected that substantial borrowing will be required from commercial sources.  It is the policy to encourage the companies to secure as high a proportion as possible of their future capital needs from outside sources and so increase the capital resources available for the State's capital programme, including the companies' own development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>I have not been able to take in the last two documents the Minister read.  I thought the agreement in this House was when speeches were made from documents, the practice was to supply copies of the documents.  The Minister was good enough to supply copies of the 15-page speech he made on the Estimate.  Any remarks I make will have to be circumscribed by the fact that I have not had an opportunity of considering the other two documents.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transport and Power is at least moving a little bit out of the region of illusion and fairyland it has been in for many years.  At the same time, there is still a tendency to state in very optimistic terms, what, realistically considered, ought to be expressed rather pessimistically.  It is quite clear in regard to CIE, after all the blather there has been over many years, CIE is a social service and it is to be regarded as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister wound up his speech on transport by claiming, as almost a <Col N="987" /> discovery, it has now been proved that CIE could not pay its way.  I am sure he alone, amongst politicians, must have laboured under the illusion that CIE could pay its way.  I do not believe anybody in the country ever believed that.  We went down to bedrock in regard to CIE.  The earlier part of the document tells us that the main increase in the demands of the Ministry for this year is to be found in the £2 million subsidy which has to be paid to CIE.  So far as that is an acceptance of the real condition, it is to be welcomed. It is rather a setback to find, after all the talk there was about making the service pay, the best we can do is to accept that CIE must have a subvention which, on the documents circulated in regard to the Transport Bill we have just recently been discussing, will be not less than £17 million.</P>
    <P>In regard to Irish Shipping, I notice in the Minister's speech there are only seven lines and a bit at the foot of page 7 and possibly another 15 to 20 lines on page 8 which refer to it.  This is a service which recently came before the public.  There was a full page in each of the daily papers telling about the annual general meeting of Irish Shipping where there were some speeches made.  First of all, the chairman brought forward the accounts and made his comments on them and there were contributions by civil servants representing two Ministers, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport and Power.  The way in which the speech of the Minister tries to pass off the situation about Irish Shipping can be contrasted with what was said at that annual general meeting.</P>
    <P>At the foot of page 7 the Minister says:</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Ltd. now have a dry cargo fleet of 17 vessels totalling 146,000 tons deadweight and three tankers totalling 39,380 tons deadweight. Having regard to the privately owned tonnage available it has been decided that the current drycargo fleet is adequate to meet strategic requirements and that additions to the fleet will be considered <Col N="988" /> when commercial considerations so justify.</P>
    <P>In a moment I shall return to what was said at the annual general meeting, which is certainly not according to the tenor of these remarks.  The Minister continues in his speech:</P>
    <P>The accounts of Irish Shipping Ltd. for 1963-64 have recently been presented to the House and, although the position is still far from satisfactory, the results were considerably better than in the previous year.  The company had an operating surplus of £445,322 on Working Account for the year and after providing an amount of £1,023,845 for depreciation of the fleet and allowing for investment income, bank interest, Directors' fees and Auditors' fees, the net commercial loss amounted to £556,721.  The improvement was due to the temporary increase in freight rates which took place at the end of 1963, although about 70 per cent of the revenue for the year was attributable to rates obtaining before the increases became effective.</P>
    <P>That is the Minister's presentation of Irish Shipping.  It was a better year than the year before, still far from satisfactory, but considerably better. Then we get the calculation that the loss is £556,721.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the material given us through the daily press the other day. I quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 23rd June, 1964.  After the chairman had presented the accounts, the representative of the Minister for Finance spoke in these terms:</P>
    <P>The company's position and prospects unfortunately gave little ground for optimism.  It is true that the latest accounts show an improvement on last year, but last year was, to use your own words, Mr. Chairman, &ldquo;one of the blackest in shipping history&rdquo; and what happened was that a loss of about £840,000 has been reduced to a loss of about £550,000.  This improvement, while welcome and commendable, is apparently only temporary as freight rates have again disimproved.  While the working surplus is the highest since the Suez crisis, it must be <Col N="989" /> remembered that the company's fleet and the annual charge for depreciation have increased greatly since then.</P>
    <P>He continues:</P>
    <P>For seven consecutive years the company has incurred a loss because of the severe depression in freight rates.  The reserves accumulated in earlier years when freight rates were remunerative are nearing exhaustion. Though the annual charge for depreciation alone is now almost £1 million, the market value of the fleet is below its net book value. The prospects of economic operation in the immediate future are not encouraging.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister stated that &ldquo;the determination of the company's future policy requires most urgent and careful consideration&rdquo;.  The need is no less now.  The Minister has asked me to express his satisfaction that the company, in its drive for efficiency, has engaged the services of management consultants, and to say he shares the hope expressed by the Minister for Transport and Power that the company will find it possible to obtain expert advice on the implications for it of present and future world conditions so that at the next Annual General Meeting, if not before, you, Mr. Chairman, will be able to report on the measures which the company is taking towards meeting its costs.</P>
    <P>That is a realistic presentation of Irish Shipping Ltd.  I want to compare it with the light-hearted way in which the Minister read his 20 or so lines about Irish Shipping.  The outlook is completely black.  Indeed, one wonders why this was ever embarked upon.</P>
    <P>Another Civil Service representative present at the meeting said:</P>
    <P>.... if we were to rely for future guidance on the experiences of recent years there would be a very gloomy prospect indeed.  In the past, shipping slumps were regarded, more or less, as regular cyclical features of the industry which could be expected to work themselves out <Col N="990" /> in time&mdash;otherwise why should anyone remain in the industry?</P>
    <P>The present slump is, however, not the result of a trade depression but is due to an excess of world tonnage which is being perpetuated by a continued high level of new building.</P>
    <P>That excess of world tonnage has been there for many years.  Our contribution to that was to build more over a certain number of years.</P>
    <P>At a later point, this second Civil Service representative said:</P>
    <P>The Minister, who is naturally concerned about the effects on Irish Shipping Ltd. of the disastrous freight rates or recent years, directed that we should exercise ourselves in the Department in trying to pin-point factors affecting the company's competitive position, particularly by comparison with other cargo companies. I may say that this study has not thrown any great light on the scene as other cargo companies with which comparisons might be made have usually different accounting methods.</P>
    <P>Later we have:</P>
    <P>It is clear, however, that the shipping industry in general, which has so long been steeped in tradition, is now becoming alive, if somewhat belatedly, to the need for economic appraisal.</P>
    <P>Would it be possible to write those words on a tablet somewhere and post it in the Minister's corridor?  That might have his mind directed belatedly to the need for economic appraisal with regard to most of these insolvent concerns comprising the group over which the Minister is said to have supervision.</P>
    <P>Again, I return to this second contribution at the general meeting of Irish Shipping Ltd.:</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Ltd. with losses, (after depreciation) totalling nearly £1½m. over the last two years, is clearly faced with the need for some reassessment.</P>
    <P>Then there are congratulations that the company have decided to call in <Col N="991" /> management consultants in the hope they will tell them where to direct their feet in recent years.</P>
    <P>The contribution then continues:</P>
    <P>No doubt the Board have also under consideration the possibility of some economic research into the implications of present and future world trading conditions for Irish Shipping Ltd. and will seek expert advice in this connection if, indeed, such advice is available.</P>
    <P>We then get a reference to the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> We are told that that:</P>
    <P>.... relieves the company of the responsibility of expanding the fleet beyond its present level until commercial considerations justify such action.</P>
    <P>Is it possible people are seriously praising the so-called Second Programme because it is asked that before the fleet of Irish Shipping is increased beyond its present level, commercial considerations ought to play a part in the deliberations of the Board and the Ministry in respect of future buildings? I want to put that on record as against the Minister's 20 or 25 light-hearted lines.  What was said at the annual general meeting represents reality, but the Minister has given it to us in a very light-hearted fashion.</P>
    <P>The Minister then turns to the Electricity Supply Board.  He tells us:</P>
    <P>The final results of the working of the ESB in 1963/64 are not yet available in full, but I understand that they will show a surplus which will be somewhat less than the surplus&mdash;£636,000&mdash;for 1962/63.</P>
    <P>I had not time to study the notes circulated earlier this month but I did at least read this.  The financial results are comprised in five lines:</P>
    <P>Total electricity revenue in 1963/64 amounted to £20,383,000 an increase of 4.8 per cent on the preceding year.  Revenue from rural consumers increased by 6.7 per cent.  The deficiency on rural account <Col N="992" /> was £889,000.  The surplus on non-rural account was £1,055,000.</P>
    <P>I am told here that this meant that the net surplus for the year 1963/64 was £372,000.  This morning the Minister said the final results were not yet available, but he understood that they showed a surplus which would be less than the surplus of £636,000 on 1962/63.  If the earlier document was able to portray the financial results or sum them up by saying that the net surplus was £372,000, what has happened that the Minister this morning could only tell us that the final results are not yet available but will show a surplus somewhat less than £636,000?</P>
    <P>Right through these notes I was looking for certain items.  I could find them here and there but not completely. Surely at this stage of the Ministry&mdash;it has not an awful lot to do&mdash;we could get this.  What money has been spent by the State on the airports in this country?  What is the present position?  Are the airports paying their way?  I understand they are not.  Looking through this, I find a whole series of statistics about the number of people visiting the airports. The more people the better, so long as the taxpayer has not to give any subvention to these people visiting the airports and enjoying their amenities. I want to find out what State money is involved in each of the three airports and in the Second Shannon Industrial Estate, and whether the airports are paying their way.  I mean that in the commercial sense the Minister spoke about in connection with harbours&mdash;that the airports should be run in accordance with ordinary commercial practice, meeting all their charges, including interest on capital and a dividend for outside people who are subscribers.</P>
    <P>In a simple matter such as airports, surely it should be possible to find out whether in this year or last year they paid their way, whether they met their expenses and paid the State to some degree.</P>
    <P>During the year, a person who is now a banker in this country and who was at one time a civil servant <Col N="993" /> attached to the Department of Industry and Commerce when that Department had charge of the air lines made a contribution to the <i>Irish Banking Review,</i> issue of December, 1963.  It is a very lengthy article and well written as one would expect from the person who wrote it but I would take the summary as given by the newspapers. The <i>Irish Times</i> of 1st January, 1964, gives the heading: &ldquo;Benefits from State-sponsored concerns belong to community&rdquo;, with a subheading: &ldquo;Banking chief praises companies&rdquo;. The <i>Irish Independent</i> is more cryptic in its heading which is: &ldquo;Profitability of two companies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I take the summary given in the <i>Irish Times</i> when, after identifying the person who wrote it, they put it in this form:</P>
    <P>The State-sponsored Irish shipping and airline concerns belong to the community, which provided the capital to establish them.  The idea of paying out a dividend of x per cent on the capital was utterly remote from the minds of those who conceived and established these concerns.</P>
    <P>I think that is a fair statement of the views of this person and if the idea of paying a dividend was utterly remote from the minds of these people, I cannot understand the phrase used by the present Taoiseach when speaking to this House on the Transport Bill of 1959.  There had been a good deal of discussion, particularly about Aerlínte, and the Taoiseach gave reasons why Aerlínte would continue to get the same percentage of the total number of passengers flying over the North Atlantic as they were getting at that time.  He said:</P>
    <P>First of all, the number who want to travel to Ireland will be the same percentage in future as it has been in the past, and, of that number, Aerlínte will get the same percentage as it has got up to this.  Is that not a reasonably conservative basis of estimation and, on it, the experts available to the board of management of this company have calculated that they will make a substantial cash profit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="994" /> At that stage, Deputy Dillon asked: &ldquo;On existing fares?&rdquo; and the Taoiseach replied: &ldquo;Jet aircraft&rdquo; and Deputy Dillon again asked: &ldquo;On existing fares?&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
    <P>Let me now try to clear up any misunderstanding that may exist about the information available concerning the outcome of Aerlínte operations to date.</P>
    <P>Then he speaks of provisional estimates given to him of revenues and expenditures for the first year, and in column 1308 of 15th July, 1959, he says:</P>
    <P>The experience of every airline shows that it takes three years to get a new service &ldquo;out of the red&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At the bottom of column 1308, he goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The accountants and experts of the company sat down in advance to calculate what the receipts and outlay would be.  Up to the present they have been shown to be extraordinarily accurate.  I was at one time disposed to contest the reliability of their estimation.  I have certainly withdrawn from that position.  They have shown themselves to be able to forecast these matters with considerable skill and accuracy.  It is these same experts who, projecting their calculations into the future upon the assumptions I have given the Dáil, have given us this expectation of a cash profit which will enable them, over some periods, to repay these initial deficits and then commence to earn profits.  These calculations assume the complete writing off of the investment in the aircraft in a period of ten years.  There has been reference here to the Dáil providing money and to taxpayers supporting this service.  All we are asking the Dáil to do now is to change the law which says that Aer Rianta must not have more than £2 million in share capital so that, in future, Aer Rianta will be permitted to have £10 million in share capital.  I have not even said, because it has not yet been decided, that that share capital <Col N="995" /> will be provided by the Minister for Finance.  There is certainly no suggestion of asking the taxpayer to contribute anything to the development of this service.  The expectation is that the company will, as its service grows, be able to repay the deficits on the earlier years and clear these items out of their accounts, ultimately paying a dividend upon the moneys invested in it.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that last phrase: &ldquo;Ultimately paying a dividend upon the moneys invested in it.&rdquo;  That was the Taoiseach speaking in 1959, but in December of 1963 the chairman of the National Bank says that the idea of paying out a dividend on the capital was utterly remote from the minds of those who advised the Taoiseach.  If the article in the <i>Banking Review</i> is correct, that statement made by the Taoiseach is based on a false premise. That statement was that this undertaking would be for a few years in the red and that then it would get out of it and pay a dividend.</P>
    <P>I should complete that quotation of the Taoiseach.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the development of the country and the benefits which this service can secure for the country as a whole, I think we should contemplate a position in which any funds that may become available to it out of its own resources will be used to develop its services rather than to remunerate the investment.  I can, however, appreciate that if the Minister for Finance finds the whole, or any part, of the capital he may take a very different view.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach then spoke of capital, the purchase of aircraft, a rather substantial item for the training of crews, and of spares.  He said quite definitely that there was going to be no borrowing from the Government or the State, that in the end the deficit would be wiped out and that there would be a dividend paid on the money invested.</P>
    <P>I know well that the article I have quoted as written in 1963 was written when, whatever the expectations of <Col N="996" /> 1959 had been, they were found to be falsified.  Events had shown that it was not possible for the State to get any return on its capital investment and there was then this attempt in 1963 to read the mind of the Department of Industry and Commerce as to what they would have said if they had known what the years between would have shown up.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>It was a misleading of the public. The Taoiseach may have spoken in terms of expectation but in 1963 it was definitely stated by this person who had been an official of the Department of Industry and Commerce that it was utterly remote from the minds of those who advised the Minister that there would be any return on the capital.  I should have quoted another phrase used in the article in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 1st January of this year after making the statement which I have already quoted:</P>
    <P>Capital provided for these companies was not provided primarily as an investment for the purpose of earning a remunerative cash return.  Indeed, the capitalist who makes an investment for this purpose would not have invested a shilling in any of these companies at their inception.</P>
    <P>I do not know if that is a result of what I have said earlier on the matter. The Minister speaks of Bord na Móna. Again, we have the Minister's notes which were circulated to Deputies.  A lot of information is given in the notes but the pivotal point as to whether Bord na Móna are paying their way or not remains obscure. On page 11 of his statement, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>The probable financial result of Bord na Móna's operations will be a small surplus after all charges have been met.</P>
    <P>That is the entire statement about the financial details of Bord na Móna given by the Minister this afternoon. In the explanatory notes, on page 28, it is stated that the Board had a net profit on the 1963-64 operations of £264,991.  However, the debit balance given in the profit and loss account <Col N="997" /> for 31st March, 1964, is £293,000. There has been an overall loss of £900,000 as a result of the bad harvest of 1958.  The fact is that there was a debit balance this year of £293,000, and yet the Minister this afternoon said that the probable financial result of the Board's operations will be a small surplus after all charges have been met.  On the other hand, this explanatory document circulated to Deputies gives an entirely different picture&mdash;a debit balance of more than a quarter of a million pounds.</P>
    <P>The notes circulated to Deputies give figures of revenue, production, depreciation, interest and capital repayments, surplus, <i>et cetera</i>.  Then they go into figures for the development of Bord na Móna.  When I spoke on Bord na Móna last year or the year before, I had the statement of Mr. Lalor, the accountant, who agreed that Bord na Móna were carrying a very big sum of unremunerated capital which had been put by for future development. He was speaking in optimistic terms of the future.  Then there is a statement about a sum of £250,000 for interest repayments for which no provision had been made.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister is in a position to tell the House now what money the State has advanced.  I am calling it an advance in the hope that there will be some repayment.  The Dáil should be given these figures so that we can consider them and arrive at a reasonably accurate estimate for the benefit of the public.  I ask the Minister to let us have the figures necessary to consider this Estimate in the proper way.</P>
    <P>The State has provided moneys for the development of Bord na Móna. That is not a criticism of Bord na Móna: many of these companies have to be started by loans&mdash;they had to get grants, mainly repayable grants &mdash;which the taxpayers had to bear in respect of charges.  In 1964, surely it is possible to go back over the years and get calculations as to the moneys advanced by the State to Bord na Móna.  Some part of these moneys I have no doubt has been repaid. How much?  How much is outstanding? What is the provision in the Board's accounts?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="998" /> I want that information because it is the only way to get this Estimate properly considered.  What has the State to pay on the average for the moneys the State had to borrow to advance to Bord na Móna?  How far do Bord na Móna go to make provision for repayment?  Is that in accord with the levy the State has to make on the citizens in order to repay those who lent the money in the first instance?  I am trying to get all this put on the basis of a phrase I picked up in the Minister's statement on page 8 in respect of harbours.  He said that normally all harbours should be operated as commercial undertakings and that development, maintenance and so on should be financed on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>Can we take that as a standard for State companies?  Perhaps after consideration of those matters, we can say we shall forgive a certain amount of the financing but let the company start off at a particular time.  We have come to that conclusion in respect of CIE: we have come to the conclusion that some of these bodies must be regarded as social services.  I am afraid more and more of our State-sponsored bodies are moving into that area.</P>
    <P>Anyway, the House should get the chance of saying which of these concerns should be kept going.  At least there should be notional accounts on the basis that they will be operated as commercial undertakings.  If any of these concerns had to go to the public for money, they would have to pay something for interest on capital or else they would have to say to the shareholders: &ldquo;We cannot declare any dividends on the share capital in certain years but the time will come when we will be able to pay dividends&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In regard to State-sponsored companies, the public are entitled to know, through us, what the situation is.  The Dáil can then be asked to come to a conclusion in regard to the future of certain companies.  In the 15-page statement of the Minister there is nothing to help us to come to such a conclusion.  Here and there in the notes circulated to Deputies, figures and financial results are given where it is <Col N="999" /> possible to provide a clear picture of financial results.  If it is possible to give a clear overall picture in respect of one, surely it should be possible to do it in all cases.</P>
    <P>There is a statement that the ESB hope for a surplus.  On what framework is that term used?  As far as I remember, the Acts setting up the ESB provided that the ESB were not allowed to make a surplus.  Naturally they could not be expected to forecast with accuracy what expenditure would be in any year&mdash;whether there would be expensive hydro-electrical development or whether there would be turfpowered development or something of the sort.  Always, the understanding was that certainly their target should be to make sufficient money only to pay their expenses, including, of course, remuneration of capital.  When the word &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; is used, and it is used in connection with a sum like £600,000, I wonder what has to be taken off that £600,000 because if over two years there was an average of £600,000, I feel the terms of the original legislation are not being carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to deal with one or two facets of the Estimate and I will be as brief as possible.  I notice at page 8 of the Minister's brief he refers to the question of a grant of £175,000 being earmarked to cover works in progress or to commence shortly in Drogheda harbour.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on that when replying.  If my memory serves me correctly, about four or five years ago, a sum of £352,000 was allocated for work on Drogheda harbour.  Since that time, apart from a considerable amount of exploration work which has been done up and down the river Boyne, no work has been done there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the growing importance of the ports is reflected in the country's export trade which increased from £174 million in 1962 to £196 million in 1963.  I am sure the Minister is aware that at Drogheda harbour, as in the case of some other ports, the tonnage in and out of the port has been dropping.  Whether or not that is because the harbour is not <Col N="1000" /> as easily accessible as it was previously, I do not know.  Perhaps the Minister might comment on that.  I should like the Minister to let me know, if at all possible, what has happened the original grant.  Has it been expended and, if so, how has it been expended? Is this an additional sum of money now being granted or is it a revised sum of money which will be granted now or what has the exploration work which has been carried out cost the taxpayer?</P>
    <P>I am rather disappointed in regard to the table showing how energy was supplied that hydro-electricity still appears at only 8 per cent of the national usage, turf, 30 per cent; oil, 36 per cent and coal, 26 per cent.  I had hoped it would be possible to fill in the national grid with energy from hydro-electricity or from native fuel. Despite the comment made by the previous speaker I know that Bord na Móna are making an excellent attempt to produce turf as cheaply as possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the coal used, what is the situation in Arigna?  Is it true that only a limited amount&mdash;I think it is 60,000 tons&mdash;can be taken by the ESB from suppliers in Arigna?  If that is so, is it also true that one firm supplies the biggest part of that coal? Is it true that somebody with a rather tenuous connection with the Government has got a contract for the supply of coal from Arigna to the ESB? Perhaps the Minister might let me know what is the position about that, if he can.</P>
    <P>With regard to tourism, again, I am rather sceptical about the figures being given by the Department.  We always get figures put down as if they came from the Bible.  If they are put down in the Minister's brief, then they must be true.  I do not agree that the figures compiled can be as accurate as the Minister claims they are.  I believe that there has been a big increase in tourism but I would again like to point out that the mistake appears to be continuing that somebody who lives abroad for economic reasons and who returns home on a holiday is a tourist. I do not agree that such a person is a tourist.  A person who was born in Ireland and who has gone abroad and <Col N="1001" /> returns on holiday should not be treated as if he were a tourist and should not be included in the number that Bord Fáilte have brought into the country by dint of selling the country to them.  Such a person would have come in any case.</P>
    <P>Again, the accent is on a type of accommodation which is not the right type.  I understand that it is extremely difficult to get registration for small hotels.  I know one hotel on which a considerable amount of money has been spent recently on reorganisation and reconstruction work and the proprietors have been told by Bord Fáilte that because of the fact that they have not got a bar they do not come within the scope and that the hotel can no longer continue as a hotel.</P>
    <P>As one of those people who have no interest in bars as such I feel that it should not be a prerequisite that there is a bar in a hotel in order to be registered as a hotel.  It is most unfair that somebody should decide that a hotel that has been carried on as an excellent hotel for many years and on which a very considerable amount of money has been spent recently for the purpose of bringing it up to date, should have a bar&mdash;which in this case they cannot have&mdash;or else cannot be registered as a hotel.  That is wrong and I would ask that the regulation be changed.</P>
    <P>We still seem to think that we must cater for thousands of Americans who come here loaded with money.  I would welcome American tourists or any tourists coming here.  It does not matter where they come from.  The fact must be borne in mind, however that the majority of people who come here on holiday, apart from our own people, are the ordinary working class people from across the Channel and when they come here they spend far more money than very many people who have a thousand times more worldly goods than they possess.</P>
    <P>I happen to live close to a holiday camp which makes its own arrangements for attracting and advertising for tourists.  It does this mainly in England, Scotland and Wales.  The <Col N="1002" /> people who come there are very decent people who seem to enjoy their holiday and who spend money freely.  That has not been the experience with the majority of people who come from farther afield.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a considerable amount of data in his opening speech. In order to try to capitalise on our tourist attractions, we must approach the question of tourism in a different way.  The Minister has referred to the large grants available for major tourist resorts.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of it or not but it is a fact that because of the money being made available to major tourist resorts the smaller tourist resorts are dropping behind.  Recently I had an experience in what may be considered a minor tourist resort.  The local golf club at Bettystown went to considerable expense in replacing the club house and providing every type of accommodation, not only for residents but for the many hundreds of people who come to the area during the summer.  When the club applied for a grant to Bord Fáilte they were politely told that the money was not available, that the question would be considered but it was not thought very likely that they would get a grant for the work being carried out.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the area is developing and attracts a considerable number of tourists, who come to the Bettystown, Laytown, and Mornington area, without counting the town of Drogheda or the Butlin's Camp nearby, and the fact that all the people there who are interested in golfing are catered for at Bettystown, Bord Fáilte should have given a grant to this very progressive body.  That is a personal view.</P>
    <P>If the Board confine their grants to major resorts, surely the Minister must be aware that over the years a big gulf will develop between the major resorts and those which are now of medium size but which will eventually taper off because of the fact that they are not able to secure the necessary money to develop properly.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

    <P>NOTE 1: Capital works carried out at the Sanatorium were financed by way of loan and without assistance from Exchequer or Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>
    <P>NOTE 2: Capital expenditure by the health authority on the Sanatorium and adjacent District Hospital during the past 12 financial years covered the provision of a central heating and hot water system for both hospitals and the erection of a common boiler-house and water softening plant.  Separate figures are not available for the portion of the expenditure which related solely to the Sanatorium but the health authority have indicated that it would be reasonable to assume that about 50% of the outlay was referable to the Sanatorium.  The information given in the table above regarding estimated capital expenditure by the health authority has been based on this assumption.</P>
    <P>NOTE 3: The Exchequer recoups 50% of allowable revenue expenditure on recognised health services.  The difference between the amounts shown in columns (4) and (5) of above table for certain years is accounted for by loan charges which are not recoupable by the Exchequer and which were borne by the health authority itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a reputable trade union submitted an advertisement to the three Dublin daily newspapers in which it was suggested that if a certain grade of workers joined the trade union, it would be possible for that trade union to have applied to these workers the <Col N="1009" /> terms of the national wage agreement made earlier in the year.  Would he not regard the refusal to accept the advertisement as tantamount to being a restrictive trade practice and would he not, therefore, reconsider the reply he has just given and ensure, if necessary by legislation, that <i>bona fide</i> advertisements will be accepted?</P>

      <P>I have no knowledge of the facts just mentioned by the Deputy but newspapers have had for a very long time the right at common law to accept or refuse advertisements submitted to them.  That right has been recognised for a variety of reasons, including the difficulties that may be occasioned by the possibility of defamation actions, etc.  I have no function in regard to the acceptance or rejection by newspapers of advertisements as they see fit themselves and I see no reason why I should assume such functions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers.  The measure of compensation for loss or damage to the logs in question is for the courts to decide and is not a matter in which I have any function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that by his action and that of the Department this merchant was put out of business completely, that his losses are very heavy and that he is now practically destitute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the personal circumstances of the man referred to by the Deputy, but, as the Deputy is aware, every country in the world organises control of essential raw materials for the public benefit and in particular for the benefit of native industries.  In regard to the export of logs suitable for manufacture into veneer, there has been a control exercised over such export for over a quarter of a century for the protection of Irish workers and of Irish industry. In so far as licences are issued from time to time, these are licences which may be withdrawn at any stage, having regard to the capacity of the home industry to cut these logs into veneer. I am informed that the Irish industry has not less than three factories who are engaged on this work and who are doing it as well as any firm in any other part of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that the court found otherwise, that a decree was given for malfeasance, for a badly done job. While it is true that protection is necessary for Irish industry, protection <Col N="1011" /> is also necessary for the native Irish.  This is an Irish citizen.  Companies were established here to do this work and they did it so inefficiently that it put this Irish citizen and his workers out of employment.  That was due solely to the Minister's withdrawal of the permit this man had to export logs for reimportation.  When reimported there were a large number of employees engaged in the trade.  Is the Minister further aware that prior to the withdrawal of the permit, this man was very wealthy and wasted all his goods trying to utilise the materials he got from the so-called Irish firms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The court case to which the Deputy has referred concerned a particular consignment of logs which the person concerned as plaintiff claimed were damaged by the company who processed the logs.  Compensation was given in respect of the damage done to the logs by the firm but there was also a decree in favour of that firm in respect of a counter claim they lodged against this person. That was a case concerning a particular consignment.  I understand the Irish mills are now equipped to process these logs as efficiently as any concern in any part of the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the company that was doing this processing for him, when he took the action against them, went out of business and sold to another company?  It is this company which is processing the material but this man is not now in a position to purchase the logs.  That is why I am asking the Minister if he is not satisfied that on the facts this man is entitled to compensation to enable him to recover his trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take these two questions together.</P>
      <P>The matters raised in the questions relate to the day-to-day business activities of a commercial firm in which I do not interfere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a bit thick for the Minister to describe this as a private commercial firm when even he admitted in connection with his Estimate within the past few days that there was a substantial amount of the taxpayers' money invested in it?  In view of what is alleged to have happened, will the Minister not cause an investigation to be set up to ensure <Col N="1013" /> there will not be any further abuse of Irish workers, or Dundalk workers as happened in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the circumstances that have given rise to these two questions but I do not think they are circumstances in which I ought to interfere.  They are matters for the Irish Industrial Engineering Company and the German firm with which they had negotiations about the establishment of a location for manufacturing in Dundalk.  I see no reason why I should interfere because of the eventualities that have occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>But this is not purely day-to-day administration in the accepted sense.  This is a case where six Dundalk men who had been offered jobs in Arklow were promised that they would be employed in Dundalk Engineering Works after a period of training in Germany.  They went to Germany and their training was cut short by the breach of contract between the Dundalk Engineering Works and the German firm.  As a result of that they lost the jobs they could have taken up in Arklow, and apart from that, they were deprived of moneys due to them by reason of their training. I think the Minister must be concerned about this in that he, as representative of the Irish taxpayer, has a considerable amount of money invested in this firm.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the reason why, in the case of a recent appointment of a postman in Milestone, Thurles, County Tipperary, a temporary postman who had given three months satisfactory service, who lives in a labourer's cottage, and who has nine children under age and two others in temporary employment, was rejected as not being the most suitable applicant for the permanent post; and if he will state exactly the criteria which are used to ascertain who is the most suitable candidate for such a post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The vacancy for an auxiliary postman at Milestone, Thurles, was filled in the usual way from a list of employment exchange nominees and the man selected was the most suitable qualified person.  It would be contrary to practice to furnish any information regarding the claims or qualifications of applicants as this would entail disclosing information obtained in confidence about these persons.</P>
      <P>The requirements for appointment as auxiliary postman are that the applicant must, in general, be between 18 and 65 years of age, be in good health, live within a three mile radius of the office of employment, be at least 5' 2&rdquo; in height, possess a good character and a reasonable standard of education and, in the case of a Gaeltacht office, have a good knowledge of Irish.

Is the Minister aware of the anxiety and uneasiness which prevails in this area as a result of the <Col N="1016" /> Department not appointing this man to the permanent post when it became vacant?  Would he not, even at this late hour, take the necessary steps to see that justice is done by providing this man with some kind of employment in the area?</P>

      <P>The normal machinery for filling these vacancies was followed in detail in this case.  As I said, nominations were sought in the usual way from the employment exchange and the most suitable man selected.  There can be no question of displacing anybody.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be looking at it in the wrong way.  This happens time and time again all over the place in different spheres.  A vacancy arises and before the full machinery for an appointment can be operated, it is necessary that the job be carried on.  Somebody is put in on a temporary basis and then the post is filled in the normal way through the appropriate machinery.  That is what happened here.  The person employed in the temporary capacity did not succeed when the full machinery of nomination and interview and so on was operated.</P>

Nominations were subsequently sought from the employment exchange.  The persons nominated were interviewed and an appointment was made to the vacancy from the list of nominees.</P>
      <P>The temporary substitute had previous intermittent service totalling 113 days over a period of six years.  His service was satisfactory.  The man appointed to the vacancy had no previous experience but such experience is not essential for auxiliary postman appointments.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the person referred to is totally disabled owing to service. His application for a disability pension under the Army Pensions Act, 1927, was rejected in 1928 because the disability in respect of which he claimed was not attributable to service and the Military Service Registration Board found, in connection with his application for a wound pension under the Army Pensions Act, 1932, that he did not receive any wound or injury while engaged in military service.</P>
      <P>He is in receipt of a pension at the rate of £107 15. 11. per annum under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, and he has, since 5th May, 1953, been in receipt of a special allowance under the Army Pensions Acts which is currently payable at the rate of £87. 0. 0. per annum.  He is 66 years old, unmarried and he lives with his brother to whom a special allowance under the Army Pensions Acts is payable at the rate of £74 0. 0. per annum and who is, in addition, in receipt of a pension under the Old Age Pensions Acts at the rate of 44s. per week.  The income of the household from public funds is, therefore, more than £383 per annum and this will be subject to an increase in accordance with this year's Budget provisions for increases in pensions.  If the person to whom the question relates, and others similarly circumstanced, are in need of medical attention, such attention is of course available to them under the provisions of the Health Acts and it is not proposed to convert the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, into a hospital or home for such cases.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe need not worry because I shall not be long.  There are one or two matters with regard to Shannon Airport and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company in this Estimate in which I am particularly interested and upon which I should like to make a few comments.  I note in the Minister's speech that the total number of passengers handled in the year ended 31st March, 1964, decreased by nine per cent and the number of landings decreased by 19 per cent.  There is, however, a bright side to the picture because the number of terminal passengers embarking and disembarking increased by 16 per cent.  With regard to freight traffic I note that in the first five months of this year, the total freight, 6,750 tons, is the same as the figure last year.  It is quite obvious from these figures that a considerable amount of work still remains to be done and we must make an all-out effort to generate more passenger and freight traffic through Shannon.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of passenger traffic, I expressed a view about two years ago on this Estimate&mdash;a view which I have consistently held&mdash;that one of the means of ensuring and promoting increased passenger traffic through Shannon was by developing the tourist potential of the Shannon area.  I include in that the west and south-west of Ireland.  I advocated that the Shannon Development Company should pay more attention to the promotion of tourism and I am very glad to see from the Minister's speech that in fact over the past two years or so, the company has been giving increased attention to tourism.</P>
      <P>On page 7 of his speech the Minister refers to the company's promotional activities and says that these:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... are designed to promote tourism generally and, particularly, to spread the benefits of increased tourism earnings throughout the <Col N="1025" /> west of Ireland where tourism forms an important part of the regional economy.</P>
    <P>I am a little worried about that.  He refers to the west of Ireland and I hope that SFADCO&mdash;as the Shannon Free Airport Development Company is called&mdash;will not confine its activities solely to developing tourism in the west of Ireland.  I do not want to be parochial and I know that the company is not confining its activities to the west of Ireland and my fears may be completely groundless, but I was a little worried when I saw the reference only to the west of Ireland as there is a colossal potential in the south-west as well.  I said two years ago, and I still hold, that the development of the tourist potential in the west and south-west is the surest way of promoting further passenger traffic through Shannon Airport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The south-west was meant to be included.  It was really due to an error in what I wrote that it was not included.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I suspected that it was implied but I thought I should seek an assurance on the matter.  As one who has been in close touch with the Shannon Development Company in regard to the promotion of tourism, particularly in regard to developing angling in the Shannon area, I feel I should bring to the Minister's notice a number of difficulties which we encountered there. One is the lack of a scheduled service between Shannon and Britain and the continent, but particularly Britain.  This is a very serious handicap.  If one attempts to organise groups of anglers to come to Limerick and Clare, they have for the most part to come in through Dublin.  There may be a delay at Dublin before they can get a connection at Shannon, but even if there is an immediate connection, the additional cost is considerable.  I have investigated this matter and I found that for a group of four people coming on a fishing holiday to Castleconnell, near Limerick city, it would be cheaper to hire a self-drive car in Dublin and drive down, rather than get a connection from Dublin to Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" /> I was particularly interested in a newspaper report published a month or six weeks ago which referred to an application by BEA for permission to operate scheduled services into Shannon. At the time I asked the Minister a question about this application and he told me it was being considered by IATA and that the application had not yet reached his office.  If BEA were to introduce scheduled services to Shannon direct from Britain, it would give a tremendous impetus to the promotion of tourism and lead to greater traffic through Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Development Company's activities in the promotion of tourism have been successful.  The Bunratty Castle project has definitely been an outstanding gimmick and is paying very big dividends.  I note that work on the folk park project, as an extension to Bunratty Castle, is proceeding satisfactorily.  This will be an additional help in attracting tourism but I want to emphasise again the real scope for development lies in developing the natural potentials of this area. The most important of these is undoubtedly angling because there are in County Clare numerous lakes and in County Limerick on the River Shannon and other rivers there are outstanding angling facilities.  In Britain, there is colossal interest in and demand for this type of holiday and it would seem that it is a matter of exploiting this potential but up to now, while certain efforts have been made, an all-out effort has not been made.</P>
    <P>There is, too, the question of hunting, for which there is tremendous scope, particularly in County Limerick, and there is also a good deal of shooting. With these aspects developed, and with direct services from London, Manchester and Liverpool and other areas of Britain to Shannon, the passenger traffic through Shanon Airport could be expanded considerably.  On the question of the efforts made by the Shannon Development Company to promote tourism, I should like to express my appreciation to the company's tourist officials for the co-operation they have given me and the enthusiastic manner in which they have followed up any suggestions made to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> A scheme is now being finalised, or may have been finalised, to bring parties to different angling centres on the river Shannon and on the lakes in the area, and in 1965 we hope that there will be regular charter flights for anglers into Shannon.  While a lot of brickbats have been thrown at CIE during the last few weeks, I should like to pay tribute to the efforts they are making in Britain to promote tourism.  I saw these last January when I was on a tour of Britain.  I was very impressed by the efforts being made and particularly in the new scheme which is now in operation, the Golden Holiday scheme, because of the fact that a weekly charter flight from Manchester is coming into Shannon.  From inquiries I made I discovered that the bookings, even though it is only the first year, have been very good.  This emphasises the point I have been making in regard to the absence of direct flights from various centres in London being a big handicap.  I hope that the success of this charter scheme from Manchester this year will encourage a much greater expansion on the same lines next year.</P>
    <P>When the Industrial Estate at Shannon was being established, one of the main aims was that it would generate freight traffic to counteract the loss of passenger traffic but unfortunately while the Industrial Estate has generated a certain amount of freight traffic, it has not lived up to our expectations in that regard.  I think it was this time last year, when a special Bill was being discussed to grant extra money to the Shannon Development Company, I made a point and I think the Minister referred to it afterwards when replying.  The time has come now when we will have to be more selective in the type of industry we sanction for Shannon Airport.  In other words, there are certain industries there at the moment the products of which do not lend themselves to air transport because of the fact that they are bulky, and so on.  The diamond industry is really suitable.  Here we have small packages of high value which are ideally suited to air transport.  Other industries, such as steel, would not be <Col N="1028" /> economic for air transport.  I feel we will have to be more selective in our type of industry.</P>
    <P>Another point which has often been advocated in the House, and which has a large measure of support in the Limerick-Clare area, is that perhaps it might be better if the Shannon Development Company sphere of operations were extended to include the region from Ennis to Limerick city.  There are, in fact, industries at Ennis and Limerick which are utilising air transport for their products. In other words, it is not necessary really to have industry located right on the tarmac.  Places in reasonable proximity to the airport can provide air freight traffic, too.  I think the firm which is giving most business to Shannon Airport is one which is situated at Ennis.</P>
    <P>A welcome development at Shannon in recent months has been the formation of two new air companies which will, as far as I understand, engage in freight business.  Within the past week or two, we had an American airline utilising Shannon.  I think it was Tiger Line.  I would say in all sincerity that, while over the past four or five years, doubts have often been expressed about the future of Shannon, and most of us had doubts, the future of Shannon is looking bright.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with the views expressed by Deputy Tully regarding the direction in which we should aim our tourist promotion activities.  Like him, I feel that too much emphasis has been placed on one particular type of tourist.  I agree with him there is a vast potential market among the ordinary working people in Britain. For the past couple of years, these people have been coming here in growing numbers.  But there is one particular type of holiday which we can offer, as I have already said in speaking about the tourist effort in Shannon, that is, the holiday for which there is a tremendous demand in Britain, the angling holiday.  I know the Inland Fisheries Trust was established by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture to develop inland fisheries.  We have also in Bord Fáilte officials who are concerned with the promotion of angling.  I have found <Col N="1029" /> in my efforts to promote angling in Limerick that there is a lack of coordination and enough emphasis is not being laid by Bord Fáilte on this particular type of holiday.</P>
    <P>The Inland Fisheries Trust is concerned with amenities, stocking of rivers, and so on, but, as far as I know, there is only one official employed in this country by Bord Fáilte in the development of angling.  I asked the Minister a question about two months ago in order to get definite information on this.  The activities of the official in Bord Fáilte engaged on this work would include, in addition to angling, such things as hunting and shooting.  In Great Britain, where practically 90 per cent of the ordinary working population have fishing as a hobby, Bord Fáilte have only one official covering the whole country.  If this is so, then it is quite clear that Bord Fáilte are not aware at all of the potential market in Britain.  I am convinced, from the ten days I spent in Britain in January, where I visited a number of angling clubs and travel agents, that a minimum of eight full-time officers could be gainfully employed in Great Britain promoting angling holidays to Ireland, and at least four men could be employed full-time here developing the various centres.  I sincerely hope that a serious effort will be made to exploit this undoubtedly vast potential.</P>
    <P>On the question of developing this type of tourist traffic among the ordinary middle-class people, Deputy Tully referred to the lack of accommodation. This is undoubtedly true. The lack of suitable guesthouses and the small hotel type of accommodation is a very big drawback.  As Deputy Tully said, to qualify for a grant it is necessary to have a minimum sized hotel, that is, with ten bedrooms, and it must be licensed.  If we are to develop this type of tourist traffic, and undoubtedly if we are to develop angling holidays, we will have to review this whole question of grants.  I have said before that I am convinced that anyone who can provide a minimum of five bedrooms, half the present provision, should be eligible for a grant.  There are certain centres in <Col N="1030" /> Limerick and Clare with first-class fishing facilities but no accommodation, and there is no incentive at the moment for people to provide accommodation. Instead of concentrating on putting money into luxury hotels, which undoubtedly have reached saturation point, we should provide this type of accommodation which is so necessary, and for which there is a big demand. The previous English ambassador, Sir Ian Maclennan, said the ordinary British tourist did not want luxury-type accommodation, but small hotels with a more intimate atmosphere, and guesthouses.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the increases in pensions which have been given to certain categories of CIE pensioners who retired since 1956.  This matter was discussed in a special motion in the Dáil last November.  Certain increases have been granted to those people, but, in my opinion, the increases were absolutely ridiculous.  I do not want to go into it at length, because every aspect of the problem was covered in the debate last November. I have with me a letter from the Secretary of the Limerick CIE Pensioners Association which I received this morning.  He puts the matter in a nutshell when he says:</P>
    <P>We are shocked by the proposed miserable increase in the pensions. ...  As you are aware we have been agitating for a just deal for 3½ years, and this is the result.  What an insult to decent men, who in their working life did so much for their country.</P>
    <P>Something like 1,000 CIE pensioners are in receipt of pensions of 12/- a week.  I understand their pensions have been increased to £1 per week. On the other hand, those in receipt of £1 per week do not seem to be getting any increase.  There is a certain amount of confusion about the actual amounts of the increases and I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify the position.  The pensioners are completely dissatisfied and I think this is a miserable effort to do justice to those people, most of whom are over 70 years of age, and many of whom are over 75 years of age.  The differential is still being maintained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to a few matters, and I hope the Minister will look into them.  The Minister referred to the authority he gave Bord Fáilte to set up what are now called regional tourist companies.  The Irish Tourist Association is now in the process of being dissolved and these regional companies are to take over the work hitherto done by the ITA, and to help tourism generally.</P>
      <P>Some time ago in the Dáil, reference was made to the formation of those companies and it was pointed out&mdash;I joined in the protest&mdash;that it was wrong to finalise the articles of association of those regional tourist companies without consulting the local authorities who would be expected to give grants.  No consultations took place between the regional tourist company for Dublin and Dublin Corporation. In the past, Dublin Corporation have given grants of approximately £5,000 to the ITA.  Everyone will admit that if Dublin Corporation were to give grants of £10,000 or £15,000 to this regional company, they would be a great help to them and would represent a substantial part of their income.</P>
      <P>We are unanimous on this matter in Dublin Corporation.  We were sent a copy of the articles of association, and some of us read them through quite minutely, and we found, as you would find in some legal document for a peculiar kind of insurance company, in the smallest print possible, away on its own, that Dublin Corporation may nominate three members to be directors of this company, but that they will never qualify to become candidates for the chairmanship.  In other words, Bord Fáilte are laying down in these articles of association that in regard to these regional tourist groups public representatives are to be relegated to the position of being second-rate citizens.  We have written to Bord Fáilte about this, and we have not even had the courtesy of an acknowledgment of our letter from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year we voted some £5,000 for tourism, but we have withheld payment and we will withhold it until that <Col N="1032" /> situation has been corrected.  If it is not corrected, I can tell the Minister on behalf of the full membership of Dublin Corporation that we will seek other ways of helping tourism in the city of Dublin, and we will ignore this company.  We recognise the value of tourism for the whole country, and particularly for Dublin city.  Tourism means additional business for our business institutions.  We want to have active representation on that body.  We want our representative to help in the formation of policy and come back to the Corporation and try to get as big a grant as possible from us.</P>
    <P>We have not seen the articles of association for other regions but there is a suggestion that for every £500 a local authority give to a regional company, they will be entitled to a member. That would mean that if they gave £1,000, they would be entitled to two representatives, and so on.  But we in Dublin, whether we give £1,500 or £15,000 are still stuck with this maximum of three members who have no right ever to present themselves before their body for election as president or chairman of the body.  I want the Minister to take note of this.  It is an insult to any elected representative of any local authority.</P>
    <P>I think I heard some reference to the articles of association being the same all over.  I am sure that when the local authorities find what is in this article to which I have referred, they also will resent it very much and refuse to co-operate until public elected representatives are given at least equal standing with the handpicked members who are being included up to the present&mdash; handpicked by whom?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I shall get general agreement from the House that what I am expressing is only reasonable and fair.  It is ridiculous that that board should regard itself as a dictator over the elected representatives who in time, will be getting for them, or these regions, the bulk of their income.  I hope the Minister will look into this.  I see that he takes responsibility for the <Col N="1033" /> setting-up of these regions.  I am sure this particular article has not been brought to his attention because I am sure he would not agree with it.</P>
      <P>Another thing, and I hope I have the agreement of all those of us who are in the House at the moment, concerns a recent controversy organised by Bord Fáilte in connection with the canal&mdash;but it was a controversy organised by Bord Fáilte against another public body, the Dublin Corporation. I should like the Minister to find out why it was that at no time did Bord Fáilte seek to discuss this matter with the Dublin Corporation before going forth in their organised protest.  They may have had good reasons for the lines they were thinking on; we may have had good reasons for the lines we were thinking on.  At least, however, they should have contacted the Dublin Corporation and sought, with their officials, some kind of an inquiry into what they were thinking of and what the others were thinking of, instead of trying to bring about what might be called a war between Bord Fáilte, on the one hand, and Dublin Corporation on the other. This kind of conduct will have to be stopped and Bord Fáilte officials, from the top down, will have to realise that if they are not civil servants, they are at least semi-civil servants and should represent the public properly.</P>
      <P>Many years ago, I expressed in this House the hope that our national air company would seriously consider, and as soon as possible, the bringing of air freight rates from this country to other countries to such a level as would enable air freight business to be developed.  I know, and I have been told, that Aer Rianta cannot, of its own, fix the commodity freight rate below what other companies do as a result of the IATA arrangements. However, we have to recognise that we have a potential for exporting a vast amount of perishable goods which could be exported in large quantities if the freight rate or the commodity rate were made commensurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous speaker quite rightly pointed out that if you are dealing with diamonds, you can afford to pay whatever freight rate is demanded because <Col N="1034" /> it is a small parcel of highly valuable goods but it is another matter if you are dealing with other commodities. I know from my investigations abroad, particularly in America, that we could develop a trade in fresh meat if we had a reasonable commodity rate for it.  We could develop an important trade in smoked and fresh salmon if we had an appropriate commodity rate for it.  I hope the Minister will discuss this matter with the air company and that the air company will be instructed to try to force it to an issue at the next conference of IATA, if they are bound to it, as they appear to be, in such a manner as to have no independence whatever.</P>
    <P>I remember, some ten years ago, taking up this matter with a foreign airline.  That foreign airline was quite prepared to appear at a meeting of the IATA and to put forward a proposal to reduce air freight on certain items. To my amazement, when it was a case of Irish goods for export being affected, Aer Lingus, before they had even reestablished their transatlantic airline, objected.  I cannot understand that outlook.  I said on one occasion here, and I say again, that this airline which is highly successful, which gives magnificent employment and which is doing magnificent work, must not forget that it is here to serve the nation and that it is not the nation that has to serve the airline.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help but feel, in so far as CIE is concerned, that the Minister is more than anxious to get away from the problems that surround CIE.  I do not blame him in many ways.  In a matter of this kind, anyhow, I think the Minister should have been bold enough to acknowledge and extend his appreciation of the progress that has been made within CIE in so far as the tours services are concerned.  Undoubtedly, CIE has made great progress in that field in the interests of tourism.  I have often said to myself that if the same efficiency were shown in providing reasonable bus services for the people of Dublin, we should have very little to grouse about. Having said that, I would entreat the Minister to have a serious look at the <Col N="1035" /> bus position in Dublin and the cost of fares.  Without a doubt, the tendency now is for CIE, as a national concern, to price itself out of the carrying services.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the progress made with British Railways on car ferry services.  That is something which I think we must all appreciate.  It is a step in the right direction.  I am disappointed to find that he is not yet in a position to say what exactly is or will be the progress in relation to services on the B &amp; I Line.  There is a great need there for improvement, particularly in relation to the transport of passengers, apart from anything else.</P>
      <P>I know this matter has been adverted to before but we seem to be in a difficulty in that regard.  Deputy Briscoe, towards the end of his speech, referred to air ferry rates and he was at a loss to understand why we, as a nation, through the medium of Aer Lingus, could not introduce a fairer and more attractive system of car freight rates. I am at a loss also to understand that. I can recognise the Minister's difficulty in dealing with foreign shipping companies, such as the B and I and British Railways, but I cannot understand why we cannot get on with the job much better through the medium of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta.</P>
      <P>Much has already been said about accommodation for tourists.  We should take stock and recognise that the type of accommodation some people dream about, particularly the Bord Fáilte officials, is not the type of accommodation desired in this country, either by visitors or by the people living in the country.  We should get away from the idea of foreignising or Americanising our hotels.  People come here to find us as we are.  They do not expect to find us dressed up.  There is far too much of that going on at the moment.  It is high time Bord Fáilte ceased planning for elaborate hotels.  Sometimes when the hotels are established, faults are found and these are explained by saying the architect did not allow for the provision of certain facilities within the establishments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> Deputy Briscoe also adverted to the regional tourist organisations.  The Minister should take a serious look at these organisations.  He must take into consideration that these bodies have actually replaced the Irish Tourist Association.  The Irish Tourist Association was brought into existence as a result of efforts, throughout the country, of people who had a serious interest in tourism.  In the main, the moneys for this were obtained from local councils.  Now, in the establishment of these new regional organisations, the efforts which were made in the past seem to have been forgotten. The people who decided on these new regional organisations are acting in a dictatorial manner, different from the way tourist associations should act.</P>
    <P>The situation in Dublin is very clear in that regard.  Apart from Dublin Corporation being withdrawn from these organisations, there are many other organisations who could help in the regional organisations.  How were the people selected for these organisations? Who decided how they would qualify?  I think I am safe in saying that there are a considerable number of people in the organisation who never took a prominent part in the promotion of tourism in Dublin, never mind throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is very discouraging that the organised trade union movement has also been ignored in the formation of these bodies throughout the country. An arrangement was made for them to have a representative on the Dublin organisation.  This was changed without telling them what it was all about.  They just said: &ldquo;There will be one, whether you like it or not,&rdquo; and that is exactly the situation, as far as the Dublin Corporation are concerned. Dublin Corporation would expect to be one of the main contributors to this regional committee.  You can hardly expect members of Dublin Corporation who are interested in tourism willy nilly to go along without prior consultation, and provide money for this new body.  It has been inferred, not only in this House, but outside, that this tends to bring about another situation, that is, that Dublin may go out on its own.  We have too many people <Col N="1037" /> going out on their own and it is important to have some semblance of unity in matters of this sort.  There is certainly misunderstanding in this.</P>
    <P>I believe Bord Fáilte, who made these decisions, should be asked to explain themselves and have another look at how this whole development of tourism will be carried out.  I agree with the idea of full-time Irish tourist associations but I do not agree with the manner in which they have been set up.  All the people who are genuinely concerned with tourism should be allowed a voice in this matter.  We should not be ashamed to admit we have made a mistake in a matter of this kind.  I do not for one moment believe the Minister was on the spot in connection with it.  I now ask him to have another look at it.</P>
    <P>When speaking about tourism, we must have a look at staff training. Bord Fáilte has set up a body through the Council of Education for the training of staff.  That body has been selected from all types of interests.  We must realise, in order to get results from such a body, that money is necessary.  I ask the Minister to have another look, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, at the amount of money offered. At the moment agreement has not been reached on getting money from the interested bodies within the industry. No arrangements have been made for the organisation of employers or workers to contribute in their way towards this training scheme.  <i>The Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> has said that we must double our tourist income by 1970.  We cannot do that unless we have trained and competent staff.  I hope the Minister will consult with Bord Fáilte and arrange that the Council of Education will be given more money for this work, having regard to the value of tourism to us.</P>
    <P>We should try to create some liaison with the Department of Health to ensure that not only in catering circles, but right through the country, there will be an insistence on the importance of hygiene so that people will not get a bad impression.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to canals in Dublin.  I agree with him there should have been prior consultation with Bord <Col N="1038" /> Fáilte and the officials and representatives of Dublin Corporation before anything was done to discontinue the use of these canals.  I also want this to be understood.  Dublin Corporation were not consulted with regard to saving, or not saving, the canals.  The members had different views, but I, personally, believe that the canals should have been saved.  We are not the only country which has found that there is a tremendous tourist value in the development of canals.  Quite apart from that, there are many people in Dublin who like to walk along the canals.  Most of these people who are unable to get to the seaside, find great pleasure in doing so.</P>
    <P>Coming back to Bord Fáilte, like the Civil Service and Dublin Corporation, they sometimes become the subject of music hall jokes.  People talk about red tape.  In view of the fact that Bord Fáilte are responsible for bringing people to this country and seeing they are satisfied, they, above all, must show there is an absence of red tape within their organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in the strange position of agreeing with Deputy Briscoe.  At the end of his speech, the Minister referred to the regional tourist boards.  This was a great conception, on which the Minister is to be complimented.  Its financing and promotion was a good idea. Various groups of people throughout the country held meetings, elected chairmen, and were told that, eventually, so many people would be elected representatives on this board. But, suddenly, with a good deal of the hidden hand behind it, all these people discovered that the representatives were handpicked.  I should like to know by whom.  The previous speaker told us they were picked because they had some knowledge of tourism.  I know a lot of them and I do not think they have any idea of tourism; but I know a good number of them are members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is a shame to spoil a great conception by this kind of action.  The Minister told us that in 1965 the board of directors will be elected on a proportional and democratic basis.</P>

      <P>No influence whatever was used by me in the appointment of these committees, and no political direction, either direct or indirect, was given in relation to them.

      <P>I would not like to hurt the two unfortunate men I have in mind.  Maybe the Minister was influenced by one of his Deputies.</P>
      <P>I shall quote now from the Dáil Debates of 15th March, 1962.  I shall not even name the Deputy.  Perhaps he is the kind of man the Minister regards as a tourist expert.  He did not agree with the Minister building luxury hotels.  He said:</P>
      <P>My experience of visiting hotels is that there are too many porters and pages and too much swank in them.  Unless a person is armed with a bagful of golf clubs, he does not get the attention that is often provided for snobbish foreigners who come here to sneer at our way of life</P>
      <P>Maybe that is the kind of person the Minister wants to put on these boards. They would put a fence around the country and not leave anybody in.  I agree with Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Mullen that the Minister should look at this.  The Minister is a great man for losing goodwill.  He will lose an enormous amount of goodwill from the local authorities, especially Dublin Corporation, if he antagonises the people prepared to vote handsome sums every year.  They are paying the piper and they have a right to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am thankful to the Minister for his speech and for the notes he circulated to us some time ago.  I have only a simple idea of running business.  It is on the basis of the ordinary profit and loss account&mdash;you either make a profit or loss.  But the Minister has an extraordinary <Col N="1040" /> way of presenting the financial results&mdash;sometimes it is the commercial results&mdash;of CIE, Irish Shipping, Aer Lingus, Aerlínte, the Shannon Free Airport Development company and the airports.  I shall start at Shannon.  We are provided with traffic statistics for the three airports, but the Minister does not tell us how much they are losing.</P>

      <P>I do not think it would be any good.  I have tried to reason with the Minister for several days.  He is a most unreasonable man. He will not tell us.  Now we are told to look back and find the answers to someone's Parliamentary Questions over the past weeks.  That was the way we were treated this morning. Whenever a Minister came in here and read a brief, a copy was supplied to the Opposition Party.  The Minister read his brief and read orders which, he said, had been placed on the Table of the House.  He should have given some notice of that beforehand and have supplied us with them.  No other <Col N="1041" /> Minister ever did this.  I do not know what the orders were.  I could hardly hear the Minister, who just raced along.</P>

      <P>We Deputies are harried with requests from our constituents for one thing or another.  It was good enough for us to know that the Bill for CIE was before the House this morning and that the Estimate for Transport and Power would follow it. I was under the impression, innocent man that I am, that that is what we would be dealing with.</P>
      <P>The Minister shows what he calls the commercial results of these companies. I should like to ask him one question about the commercial results of CIE which we have not got yet because the report has not been published. The Minister says that when we ask questions about CIE on this Vote, he will answer them and I am taking advantage of that to ask him is it a fact that CIE gets a rebate of tax on diesel oil used in its road passenger vehicles.  If that is a fact, will the Minister tell us how much he got back last year?  This is a hidden subsidy for CIE and these hidden subsidies are running into millions nowadays.</P>
      <P>The Minister expressed satisfaction that Bord na Móna is about breaking level.  That is good, but we should have the whole truth.  The whole truth is that there is another secret subsidy in operation in Bord na Móna about which the Minister did not tell us anything. I am informed that the ESB purchase turf from Bord na Móna for the turf-fired stations.  When I was told that, I said to my informant that we all knew that and he asked me did we know that they were getting a very good price for it.  Would the Minister tell us what is the price paid for turf by the ESB to Bord na Móna; how that price is calculated; is it by contract, by the ton or by the cubic yard? I also want to know how does the price measure up to the price of sales to commercial companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1042" /> There is another question I have been putting to the Minister for the past seven or eight months and which he has not answered in the House.  He gives us a figure of £445,000 as the cost of buses, but a reputable Dublin paper, the <i>Evening Herald,</i> on 3rd June, 1964 has a headline: &ldquo;CIE to pay £900,000 for new buses.&rdquo;  I would like the Minister to correct that and tell us what the real figure is.  Four months ago, I asked the Minister about the purchase of buses and the question was disallowed.  I put it down in another form and the question was disallowed.  Again I put it down in another form and for the third time, it was disallowed.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister if we had purchased buses which were over the legal length allowed in this country and the Minister would not answer me. The length of a bus that could legally travel the Irish roads last October and November was 30 feet.  Without this House being notified, and behind closed doors in the Department of Local Government, the Minister or CIE asked the Minister for Local Government to make the legal length of a bus for the Irish roads 36 feet.  I was shocked by that.  I was convinced that the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Transport and Power believed in the campaign for safety on the roads, but judging by what Deputy Ryan was recently told in the House about the number of accidents that happened to Ministers' cars, I came to the conclusion that these Ministers do not give a damn about the safety of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Here we find the Minister responsible for CIE making our roads more dangerous and then refusing to answer questions about them.  This practice of the Minister in refusing to answer in this House is a very dangerous one. We do not ask him to answer questions about the day-to-day operations of CIE but we do ask him to tell us something about matters, the cost of which would come to anything between £50,000 and £200,000.</P>
    <P>We put a Bill through the House this morning that will involve a great deal of money.  I approve of that <Col N="1043" /> because we have to look after the people who lost through the failure of the Equitable Insurance Company, but if any of us had asked questions about that matter, I am sure we would have been told that the Minister had no responsibility.  The Minister should take more cognisance of the members of this House and of the Parliamentary Questions put down to him, should investigate what has been said in these questions and answer them.  I have kept a file of my Parliamentary Questions and I have the satisfaction of saying that, with the exception of about two per cent of those addressed to the Minister for Transport and Power, every one of them was justified.  It is this matter of ignoring public representatives that has got the Minister into his present position with regard to the regional tourist boards.  He has kept away from the elected representatives of the people, whether in this House or in the county councils.  The sooner the Minister makes up his mind to consult the local people, the better, and if he had done that in years past, he would not have the headaches he has now.</P>
    <P>I want to know how much the airports have lost.  I know they have lost a good deal.</P>

      <P>Sometimes I wonder who influences the Minister in relation to actions taken by some of the companies for which he is supposed to be responsible.  Sometimes I think it is his officials.  I have discovered that the officials in the Minister's Department were against the building of ships in the middle of a shipping slump.  That apparently did not matter a damn.  Irish Shipping went on and built ships and we find a substantial loss in their accounts.  I wonder whether the amount we are writing off in connection with these ships is sufficient.</P>
      <P>The Minister says in his statement that the results in Irish Shipping were considerably better than in the previous year, although earlier he had said the position was far from satisfactory. We are told the company had an operating surplus of £445,000 but, after providing an amount of £1 million for depreciation and so forth, there was a commercial loss of £556,000.  We are told the improvement was due to the temporary increase in freight rates in 1963.  The Minister apparently welcomed the situation that the loss was only £500,000.  That was not so bad, but £3,000 could not be lost by CIE in my constituency.</P>
      <P>A sum of £190,000 has been provided for grants towards harbour improvement.  I agree that is only commonsense, but further down in his statement, the Minister said this:</P>
      <P>The Government's <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> assumes that normally all harbours should be operated as commercial undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about CIE?  Of course many harbours in Ireland could never pay, but the Minister is pumping money into them.  No private individual, no investment company, no bank, would put a £10 note into any of them with a hope of getting any dividends.  Earlier today I had a brush with the Minister about the cross-Channel passenger services. <Col N="1045" /> What services?  It is all Holyhead to Dún Laoghaire, Holyhead to the North Wall.  They shove the passengers into these boats to trample each other to death.  When a person calls to see one of the Tourist Board personnel in any office in England, he will be told to embark at Holyhead. They never say: &ldquo;Would you like to go to Rosslare or to Cork or to Waterford?&rdquo; Of course it is never through Waterford since the Minister's predecessor, the present Taoiseach, abolished the Waterford Harbour Commissioners.</P>
    <P>We lost the passenger service to Waterford.  I asked the Minister last week a Parliamentary Question about Waterford.  I asked him if anything was happening between British Railways and CIE on the matter of a passenger service to Waterford.  He told me he had no complaints.  I did not ask him if he had complaints.  I asked him if there were any negotiations going on.  I know there are: yet the Minister did not see fit to tell the House.</P>
    <P>At page 12 of his statement, the Minister says that he will endeavour to answer any Deputy who wishes to raise questions concerning road or rail transport.  Will the Minister give an undertaking that if we put down reasonable Parliamentary Questions on policy, not day-to-day administration, he will answer them?</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the subvention to Bord Fáilte is being increased.  They are doing great work and I have no complaint except about the manner in which the regional associations were set up.  I join with other Deputies in pointing out that a great number of tourists coming here would like to stay in boarding houses.  I can only commend the Minister and his Department on the building of luxury hotels and the rebuilding of existing ones. They are a national asset.  However, the Minister tells us that a significant new feature of Bord Fáilte operations is the provision of grants for guesthouses with not less than ten bedrooms. I submit the accommodation should be reduced to six bedrooms and the premises would still be much bigger than a private house.  The Board's inspectors could visit the premises and <Col N="1046" /> satisfy themselves before sanctioning the grant.</P>
    <P>These small boarding houses could become a great asset to the tourist industry.  During the Waterford Festival, the Committee compiled a list of boarding houses.  I pinned one of them on my public office wall and had many inquiries, not just one or two.  That is a kind of accommodation tourists are looking for.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat a statement I made on a previous occasion.  The Minister said there has been a drive to get people to visit the western areas.  There is no need for that.  There are many people going to the western areas. They are doing all right in the western areas.  It would be worth while to draw the attention of the Minister, Bord Fáilte and people concerned with tourists and with advertising this country abroad, to the south-eastern areas.</P>
    <P>I get <i>Irish Travel</i> every month.  I am agreeably surprised if there are pictures of places in the south-east, apart from Cashel.  We are told about the wonderful fishing in the west.  Tipperary, Kilkenny, Wexford and Waterford are not mentioned at all.  There is as much beauty there as there is in any part of the country.  As far as fishing is concerned, there are more noble rivers in these counties than there are anywhere else&mdash;the Suir, the Barrow, the Nore, the Slaney, the Blackwater&mdash;all salmon and trout rivers.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to hunting. In these counties, there is available real hunting.  Some of these much vaunted, publicised and photographed hunts just have the right name and have had one or two songs written about them.  I mentioned this in the House three years ago and will mention it again.  I went to a meet with a friend of mine who had hunted a good deal and had ridden everything but a National winner.  I asked him what did he think of the particular hunting country concerned, about which he had heard so much.  He said: &ldquo;I would ride over it on a bicycle,&rdquo; and he could.</P>
    <P>As far as seafishing is concerned, it <Col N="1047" /> is kept a secret that there is a fine harbour in Waterford, and drying beds for boats and that there are great fishermen there and fishing nets for game fishing.  We do not get the break we should get in Bord Fáilte handouts.</P>
    <P>It is good to refer to ancient history. When the ancient Gaels came from Meath to Waterford, the Déisí, they called Waterford the Harbour of the Sun.  I do not know how they knew because at that time there were not meteorological stations all over the country.  They did know because the records show that the greatest number of hours of sunshine in this country occur every year in the south-east, in the vicinity of that Harbour of the Sun, and that that part of the country has the lowest rainfall.  I have never seen that adverted to in a brochure issued by Bord Fáilte.  I hope the Minister and his advisers will get in touch with the Meteorological Office and confirm what I have said.</P>
    <P>When the railways were run by people who wanted to make a profit, both in Ireland and in England, they issued week-end tickets, sometimes operative from Friday evening to Monday night or Tuesday morning. The Minister should take up this matter with British Railways.  British Railways were noted for this practice. A passenger could get a week-end ticket which would take him from any part of England to any resort in Ireland, especially in the off-season, May, June, July and September.  The same applied in Ireland.  Week-end tickets were available, on which a person could travel from Waterford to Galway or to Ballybunion.  There appears to be no initiative in CIE in regard to these matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister has something to do with freight rates.  The bullock represents the biggest business in this country.  The carriage of bullocks to the market or fair or to the port is a very important feature of the national economy.  It appears to me that nobody in an official position has got into communication with CIE with a view to having a conference with British <Col N="1048" /> Railways and the shipping companies to bring about a reduction in cross-channel freight rates.  The cost of sending a bullock from Ballinasloe to Norwich or from Limerick to Birken-head is a frightful imposition.  The Livestock Dealers Association are protesting about these rates.  Apart from them, nobody seems to bother about the matter.</P>
    <P>If it were a case of some crackpot industry that had been subsidised to the hilt, half the Government Deputies would be roaring about it and Ministers would be protesting that they would see that something would be done about it.  These high freight rates represent a penal tax on agriculture. There is no use in the Minister saying he has no function in the matter.  It is his duty to investigate it and to meet his counterpart on the other side, or have his officers meet their counterparts on the other side, with a view to having these rates reduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look into the possibility of strengthening his arm and, instead of losing half a million pounds carrying foreign cargoes in Irish ships that are the property of Irish Shipping and the Irish people, consider the possibility of converting the ships into livestock carriers.  Alternatively, he could suggest to the people on the other side that if they are not reasonable, the Minister will be forced to do this.</P>
    <P>The Minister has invited questions from this side of the House.  I want the Minister to answer two questions. First, what is the total amount of rebate of duty allowed on fuel, diesel oil, used in CIE road passenger vehicles?  Secondly, what is the price charged by Bord na Móna to the ESB for the turf they buy, whether it is by the ton or by the cubic yard, and what is the price charged for the same turf to commercial interests?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to offer a word of congratulation to the Minister on introducing this Estimate, which covers a very wide field and deals with transport, tourism, fuel, power and other matters which affect all of us throughout the country.  It is a fine <Col N="1049" /> experience to be here to listen to the Minister reporting the continued progress being made in providing the nation with these vital services.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of criticism, mostly unfair criticism, of CIE.  This criticism has been levelled not alone against the chairman but against the representative Board, including a trade union leader, and the staff.  It is injurious to the morale of the staff to have such charges of incompetence and inefficiency made here. I do not regard CIE as incompetent or inefficient.  I travel mainly by bus in the Dublin city district and have met nothing but kindness and courtesy from all levels of the staff I have had occasion to meet.</P>
      <P>Most of the difficulties of CIE are due to the expanding economy of this country.  They have had to contend with the advance of motor transport and many of the statements made by responsible people elected to this House will not do the organisation any good.  We must recognise that CIE has to contend with changing modern trends.  I hope we shall see an end to that type of unfair criticism which the Opposition have levelled against an organisation which provides such fine services throughout the country and employs so many people.</P>
      <P>I should like, however, to make a brief reference to the Dublin city bus services.  The Minister recently indicated that CIE propose to undertake a reorganisation of the Dublin city bus services.  There is no doubt there is need for improvement there and I hope the details of the reorganisation scheme will soon be implemented.  I note the ESB is making continued progress.  On a previous occasion, I mentioned here the charges made on old age pensioners.  As one in touch with the conditions of old age pensioners residing in Corporation housing areas and in flats, I know their difficulties in trying to meet the high charges levied by the ESB.  Now that that organisation is a profit-making concern, I would ask the Minister to use his influence to give some concession to that very deserving small section of our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join in the protest made by <Col N="1050" /> Deputy Briscoe in relation to the suggested reorganisation of the Dublin regional council for tourism.  It is a pity the matter was handled in the way it was and I hope the Minister will use his influence to bring about an improvement in relations between the sponsors of that organisation, Bord Fáilte, and Dublin Corporation.  What is needed is a recognition of each other's position in relation to a particular problem and the need for confidence on both sides in order to resolve the matter of promoting tourism in Dublin.  I know Dublin Corporation feel very strongly in this matter. Deputy Briscoe referred earlier to the controversy between Bord Fáilte and the Corporation over the Grand Canal.  This could have been avoided by consultation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to learn the Minister is of opinion that within three years the survey of the rural electrification system which has not yet been linked up will be completed and that by that time the work will be well on the way to completion. However, I note with dismay that he suggests that in a large number of cases the rates will be at the standard rate and, in other cases, at slightly above the standard rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to remind the Minister and the Government that, generally speaking, these areas not yet linked up are in the poorer areas of the country and for the Minister and the Government to decide that a standard rate shall apply to them is most unfair and unreasonable. I suggest to the Minister, to the Government and to the ESB that when they are within striking distance of completing this project of bringing light and power to all parts of the rural areas, they should not place obstacles in the way by saying that I shall have to pay more than my neighbour for the installation of electricity. Therefore, I suggest that it is only reasonable and right that the Minister should say to the ESB that they should instal the supply without any increase in the standard charge and, on the contrary, in certain cases, it could be much below the standard charge.  Life, in remote rural areas, in ordinary circumstances, in the best of <Col N="1051" /> conditions, is never easy and the provision of electricity would do much to assist the people there.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, there was a motion here relating to CIE pensioners.  The Minister told us there was a Commission sitting and when they had reported, the question of what might be done could be decided.  I should like to know what progress has been made in that matter and what are the Minister's intentions regarding these pensioners.  I do not want to repeat what Deputy T. O'Donnell has already said but there is very grave hardship involved for these men and the Minister and the Government should avail of the earliest opportunity of rectifying it.  I should be glad to know what steps he is taking to bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay the House but I want to mention our canals and inland waterways.  It is of very great importance to the midlands that the waterways should be kept open and the Minister and the Government should at the earliest opportunity state positively and definitely that it is their intention to maintain the canals and keep the waterways open to the sea. There is a type of tourism there which is a valuable asset.  The coarse fishing and the associated activities can be a source of great revenue.  Even if that were not so, the canals have a certain amenity value which I think the Government should take care to preserve for our people.</P>
    <P>Since the Estimate was last before the House, one of the most active members of the Inland Waterways Committee, Harry Rice, passed to his reward.  To him, this was the most important matter in the world.  I am sure he was right and I ask the Minister to refer to this matter in replying.</P>
    <P>There are many other problems connected with transport to which I should like to refer, but there is one connected with long-distance travel which is particularly terrifying.  It arises when leaving Dublin or coming into it when cars pile up behind heavily-laden CIE or other lorries.  This situation is a real menace because the lorries hold <Col N="1052" /> up a whole line of cars; nobody can pass, and when you come to a village where the 30-mile limit applies, you are practically stationary and the train becomes longer.  The patience of drivers is strained and they are inclined to pass and the risk of accidents is increased.  This is a very grave problem.  The transfer of heavy rail traffic and carriage of goods from the railways to the roads constitutes a menace to the ordinary road-user and I believe something must be done to eliminate it.  Recently, on several occasions I have been held up for as much as 25 miles.  At night, it is physically impossible to pass at all. You must simply stay in the queue because if you do not, you will never reach your journey's end but will meet your final end.</P>

      <P>I shall only make a few remarks in isolation as regards the canal system.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;both from the point of view of scenic amenities and coarse fishing which the previous speaker mentioned.  There is another reason why I should like to see the canals maintained.  When they were cleaned and efficient, they carried a considerable volume of water to Dublin city.  Admittedly, in normal times, that water went to waste and flowed into the sea but it is valuable to a city to have such reserves of water, particularly in cases of emergency.  Originally, I raised this matter from a defence point of view before there was any question, I think, of closing the canals and I should now like to urge that and other considerations on the Minister as reasons against closing the canals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see no valid reason for failing to maintain them, unless it should be proved that the cost is utterly prohibitive, but I think much of the cost would be recouped by the organisation <Col N="1053" /> and development of boat traffic on the Shannon as a tourist amenity.  That is all I wish to say on this Estimate but I did not want to let the opportunity pass without pressing that view on the Minister, even though it is not a view which all my colleagues in the House would share.</P>
    <P>There is the perennial question of Dublin traffic and I should like to ask the Minister just this: with the increasing pressure of suburban traffic on Dublin bus services, is there any possibility that existing suburban rail services could be developed and increased, particularly on the north side?</P>
    <P>The loops and halts are still available. I do not know what the economics of the problem are, but, having regard to some of the statements made earlier in relation to the Pacemaker Report and the reason for the balance as between length of line kept open and length of line closed, is there any possibility of suburban rail services being further developed?  That would mean some of the halts would have to be reopened to take the pressure off the buses on those traffic routes running parallel to the railways.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer briefly to two matters.  First, I understand the Minister has not got available to him in his Department qualified engineers, other than airport engineers, to offer him technical advice.  If that is so, then I urge him to remedy the position, because, in dealing with some of the semi-State bodies with which he has to deal, clearly matters of a technical nature come up for decision.  I can visualise a situation in which there might be a conflict between semi-State bodies on technical matters and it seems to me essential that the Minister should, in those circumstances, have independent and well-qualified engineering advice available to him in his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter to which I wish to refer is a very large subject but I intend to deal only briefly with it.  I refer to the question of parliamentary control of semi-State bodies.  Recently in this House we have heard a good <Col N="1054" /> deal about this.  I suggested at one stage that the Opposition were misdirecting their fire on this point on the Transport Bill.  This is a problem which, as I said before, is agitating democracies everywhere.  As far as this country is concerned, I am not satisfied that the institutions we have give us sufficient parliamentary control over our semi-State bodies.  I do not think there is any substance really in the complaints that have been made that the Minister has not been answering questions in relation to these bodies. That is not the way to deal with this problem at all.</P>
    <P>These bodies were formed primarily because private enterprise could not or would not do the work which had to be done.  The Civil Service system was such that it was incapable of carrying out commercial activity.  These semi-State bodies are, therefore, a hybrid organisation and the system that works in the Civil Service or in ordinary commercial enterprises is not suitable for them.  What we have to ensure, first of all, is that we give these bodies sufficient freedom to operate on a commercial basis, having, at the same time, sufficient control to ensure that, if these bodies engage in activities or take decisions of which Parliament does not approve, it can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>It might be worth our while to consider the setting up of a number of parliamentary committees, consisting of members of both Houses, the function of which would be to review the working of a particular State body. Let me stress that it would be a matter of review.  That committee should not be confined in its inquiries to major policy decisions but should be allowed to inquire into what is now referred to as day-to-day administration.  I feel rather strongly on this matter because I have seen things happen in recent years and decisions taken by some semi-State bodies, which were clearly unjust, and there seemed to be no remedy.</P>
    <P>The Minister has no control because these are matters of day-to-day administration and, since the Minister has no control, nobody else has.  In the <Col N="1055" /> case of a public company, the shareholders have the right annually to question the directors and make them answerable for their activities.  Under our present system, we have not got that remedy for dealing with these semi-State bodies.  There is one semi-State body, over which the Minister has no control, but I refer to it solely in order to illustrate the principle: within the past year, that body has engaged in activities quite contrary to anything that would be desired by either the Government or the Opposition here.  It has actually used moneys available to it for purposes which I think could not be justified by any member of this House and there is no method of controlling this kind of activity.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not got responsibility for the particular body to which I refer.  I am merely endeavouring to illustrate the principle which, I think, does concern the Minister since he has responsibility for a number of semi-State bodies.  The principle applies to all semi-State bodies.  We must achieve some better method of control.  I personally am not satisfied with the present method.  I do not think the methods urged by the Opposition are an answer to the problem.  I would welcome some form of inquiry into the problem.  I do not think anybody can be satisfied with the present position.  Neither has anybody a really satisfactory answer to it.  I do not suggest my proposal is a foolproof answer.  I refer to the matter <Col N="1056" /> because I feel it should receive some attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am greatly intrigued by Deputy Colley's revelations and we shall all await with eagerness the next chapter of his revelations.  If I know of some injustice being done by a semi-State body, I do not know that I would not find a means of invoking the powers of this House to put it right. Injustice should not lightly be tolerated.</P>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister now to four or five matters.  I want to join, first of all, with those who have already spoken on behalf of the canals.  An enterprising public servant, and I do not mean that in any disrespectful way, believes the canals should be used for the accommodation of a municipal sewer.  I want to urge on the Minister for Transport and Power that the canals of this city are not only a utilitarian asset for the possible transport of traffic but they are a great civic amenity, and it would be a disaster from the point of view of the city to allow them to be filled in for the accommodation of a municipal sewer.  If my information is right, so ardent is this advocate of the sewer for his plan that he is quite concerned to establish that a large part of the city cannot exist without the sewer and that it is impossible to put the sewer anywhere except in the canal.</P>
      <P>I want to urge on the Minister that he should adopt Deputy Colley's suggestion and arm himself with a competent engineer with whom he can confront this ardent public servant, for whose zeal I have nothing but the greatest admiration.  But, lest he carry conviction to the Minister's unsophisticated mind that there is nowhere to put the sewer except in the canal, and bury it there, I urge him to take Deputy Colley's advice, get a good engineer and confront this ardent advocate with him.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
