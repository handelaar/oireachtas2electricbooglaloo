      <P>The National Industrial Economic Council, in its recent interim report on the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It is essential that all who are in a position to influence the level and behaviour of industrial activity should be involved in the formulation and revision of the detailed targets within the framework of the Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A series of discussions, between the <Col N="2" /> Government Departments concerned and representatives of the principal industries, regarding the targets of the Programme have been in progress for some time past.  It is understood that the National Industrial Economic Council has been reviewing the arrangements for these discussions to consider whether they need extension or revision and to ensure that they will proceed as expeditiously as possible. Any recommendations made by the Council on these matters will be favourably considered.</P>
    <P>The object of these discussions is to agree projections, up to 1970, of levels of output and exports for individual industries in line with the general industrial aims of the Programme and to pinpoint any difficulties which may arise in achieving these levels, so that appropriate policies may be formulated to overcome such difficulties.  The Council will be kept advised of the results of these discussions and will <Col N="3" /> have the opportunity of making any recommendations it considers desirable on problems arising from them.</P>

      <P>The remuneration of clerical officers employed in the local service has recently been the subject of arbitration proceedings.  The arbitrator's findings were for the introduction of revised scales of pay differentiated on a sex basis.  The only formal proposal from the Waterford Health Authority in relation to this matter is a proposal received a week ago for the application to clerical officers employed by the authority of the revised scales <Col N="6" /> recommended by the arbitrator.  This proposal is being considered.</P>
      <P>I should mention that the proposal was accompanied by an intimation that the health authority had, by resolution, provided the necessary money and adopted the revised male scale for female officers as well.

My functions extend only to the minority who are employed in the unified health authorities and in mental hospitals.  I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to take unilateral action on an isolated proposal which would have the effect of upsetting the salary scale which applies on a national basis to a large body of staff in respect of the majority of whom I am not the appropriate Minister.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 27, 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the press announcement in the matter made by the General Manager of Aerlinte Éireann a few days ago.  That announcement stated that delivery positions had been reserved by Aerlinte for two American supersonic aircraft on payment of a deposit refundable should the company decide not to enter into a contract with the approved American manufacturer.  It was indicated in the announcement that the company had neither sought nor secured the approval of the Government for the purchase of supersonic aircraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that estimates of the cost of the US supersonic aircraft will not be available until it has been decided what type of aircraft will be constructed.  If and when the company seek my approval for the purchase of supersonic aircraft, very careful consideration will have to be given to the proposal, including consideration of what contribution, if any, would be <Col N="19" /> made towards the purchase price by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>While the provision of funds for the purchase of additional equipment by the air companies is one for the Government and the Oireachtas, the actual choice of equipment is a matter for the company.  I would not consider it desirable that the question of the type of plane should be a matter of discussion in Dáil Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated in replies to previous similar questions, CIE do not publish separate accounts for different areas of the country.  However, in a report on Internal Transport which has been prepared by CIE it is calculated that for the year ended 31st March, 1962, the Dublin city bus services as a whole contributed a cross-subsidy to other sections of CIE of the order of £380,000.  The report also indicates that, of a total of 79 bus routes in Dublin, 35 operated at a loss and eight more are only marginally profitable.</P>
      <P>The report also estimates that the operation of the Dublin suburban rail services as a separate entity would entail losses of the order of £500,000 per annum but actual losses on these lines under the present arrangements are not calculated in the report.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that Dublin passenger bus services contribute a subsidy in the region of £380,000 to the national transport concern.  If this is the case, will the Minister, before he permits CIE to increase bus fares, ensure that that profit of £380,000 is used to pay the extra wages and that CIE will no longer fleece the Dublin public in order to subsidise other transport services?</P>

      <P>I have already indicated that there is no fleecing of the Dublin public in relation to the fares charged.  The only comparison we can make is with the fares charged in other cities by similar types of transport.  No excessive charge is imposed by CIE on Dublin bus travellers.  The Deputy should be aware of the fact that about half the total of the people employed by CIE are in the Dublin area.  He should also have regard to the fact that there is a considerable loss on Dublin suburban rail services, despite the changes made in the past five years.  If he adds the whole lot up, he can make no suggestion that the Dublin public are being fleeced.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his question on 7th November, 1963 (Dáil Debates Volume 205, Column 1168) indicating that it was intended to publish these particulars in the annual report of An Foras Tionscal. While I do not think it desirable that details should be furnished prior to the presentation of the report to both Houses, the position as at 29th February, 1964, was that 106 applications had been approved representing a grant allocation of £2,892,511 and a total capital investment of £16,524,315.</P>

      <P>In the case of buildings other than State buildings, the responsibility for ensuring the provision of adequate fire-fighting equipment in potentially dangerous buildings is one for the fire brigade authority.  A general review of fire service organisation is being undertaken at present and considerable progress has been made. The Fire Standards Committee have completed their consideration of revised Fire Protection Standards and it is expected that they will be available at an early date.  In conjunction with the issue of the new Standards I intend to ask fire brigade authorities to carry out fresh surveys of all buildings whose condition or use could be regarded as constituting a special fire hazard.  These surveys will include a review of the adequacy of fire-fighting equipment.  In the meantime specific steps have been taken towards increasing public consciousness of major fire hazards and fire precaution measures.</P>

      <P>Claims to unemployment benefit are decided by officers statutorily appointed for the purpose.  Before deciding the claim referred to by the Deputy, the deciding officer concerned considered it necessary to refer for investigation certain matters affecting the title of the claimant. These were, first, a question as to whether certain recent insurance contributions paid in respect of the claimant and on which his requalification for benefit depended were valid contributions, and secondly, a question as to the extent of a part-time occupation in which he was engaged on his own account.  The need for inquiry on these two scores resulted in some prolongation of the time required for the disposal of the case.  All inquiries have now been completed and payment of all the benefit due to the claimant has been made.</P>

      <P>The current season's land settlement programme, which has been gathering momentum in recent months, is now approaching its peak and will continue at this level for some weeks to come.

For that reason, statistics on the lines requested, if compiled as of now, would be very quickly out of date.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the recent increase was to bring the pension of all teachers who had retired on or before 31st December, 1959, up to the level of teachers who retired with the benefit of the scale of salary which operated from the 1st January, 1960.  This applied in every case where increases previously given were not such as to have brought the pension above the January, 1960 level.  The date of training was not a factor in determining the increase.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 69 and 70 together and to circulate with the Official Report a statement giving the information requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Following is the Statement:</P>
      <P Just="Center">STATEMENT OF PROGRESS MADE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES (EDUCATION SCHOLARSHIPS) (AMENDMENTS) ACT, 1961</P>
      <P>Under Section 4 of the Act the State is empowered to give grants to Local Authorities on the following basis:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Financial Year</i>
      </P>
      <P>1963-64&mdash;equivalent of the produce in the rates of 1d. in the £1 or one-half of the Local Authority's expenditure whichever is the less:</P>
      <P>1964-65&mdash;equivalent of 2d. in the £1 or one-half of the expenditure whichever is the less:</P>
      <P>1965-66&mdash;equivalent of 3½d. in the £1 provided the Local Authority contributes 3d. in the £1 or one-half of the expenditure whichever is the less.</P>
      <P>1966-67&mdash;equivalent of 5d. in the £1 provided the Local Authority contributes 4d. in the £1 or one-half of the expenditure, whichever is the less.</P>
      <P>In accordance with Section 4 of the Act, the State grants are payable in arrears i.e. the State grant in respect of the expenditure incurred by Local Authorities in the year 1962-63 being payable in the financial year 1963-64.</P>
      <P>All County and Borough Councils qualified for the maximum grant in the financial year 1963-64.  It is estimated that all Councils with the exception of Cork County Council will qualify for the maximum grant in the financial year 1964-65.  In the case of that County Council it is estimated that their total expenditure in the year 1963-64 will be £13,950 of which the State grant will be £6,975.  It is estimated that this will be the equivalent of the produce of 1.33d. in the £1.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 72 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>The person in question is alleged to have received injuries on 25 Meitheamh, 1961.  Inquiries regarding the matter were initiated at the end of the following month after it came to the notice of the military authorities that he was a patient in a civilian hospital.</P>
      <P>In the context of an application which the person made for compensation, inquiries were completed in Meitheamh, 1963.  As the alleged injuries have been the subject of such an application I am not prepared to state the nature of the inquiries nor the names of the persons involved therein.</P>
      <P>The person was medically examined when he presented himself for annual training in 1961 and was not found to be suffering from any injury.  As I stated in reply to previous questions by the Deputy, I have no evidence that the person was injured in the course of training and accordingly compensation cannot be paid to him.</P>

      <Col N="45" /> The seating capacity of the lorry referred to is 30 persons and there were 30 persons in it on the occasion in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that this person reported sick while on annual training in the year in which he was found not to be suffering from any medical defect when he first applied for training?  Is it not a fact that he was confined to bed while on training? Is it not a fact that his bags had to be carried from Gormanston to the station because he was unable, through physical injury, to carry them, and is it not about time the Department acknowledged that this man received his injuries while on annual training and compensated him accordingly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not recall that he told me in this House on another occasion that this man was in sickbay while on his annual training? Would the Minister state upon what date inquiries were made to ascertain whether or not there were <Col N="46" /> more than 30 men in the rear of the lorry when it proceeded back from Croke Park to Gormanston?  I am informed there were several men in excess of 30 in the back of the lorry on that day and that that is why the man received his injuries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,170,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964, for Primary Education, including National School Teachers' Superannuation, etc.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to meet the cost of increases in salaries and other grants to teachers in classification national schools and increases in grants to capitation national schools.  These increases arise from the implementation of (a) the findings of the Arbitration Board for National Teachers and (b) agreed recommendations of the National Teachers' Conciliation Council, on claims for increased salaries and other grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Arbitration Board met on certain dates in April and May, 1963. The board's findings were accepted by the Government and as a result revised scales of salary and capitation <Col N="68" /> grants were introduced with effect from 1st April, 1963, involving additional annual cost estimated at £700,000.</P>
    <P>Following the acceptance by the Ministers for Education and Finance of recommendations of the National Teachers' Conciliation Council at meetings held in November and December, 1963, further increases in salaries of national teachers and in grants to capitation schools became operative from 1st September, 1963, and Children's Allowances payable to national teachers were increased as from 1st April, 1963.  To meet these further increases, an additional £450,000 is needed in the present financial year.</P>
    <P>A further sum of £20,000 is needed to meet increased superannuation awards resulting from the increased salaries.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964, for Vocational Education including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate is required to enable a grant of £3,000 to be made to Macra na Tuaithe to enable it to maintain and extend its activities in relation to training, directing and providing general education for the young members of the clubs founded and fostered by it.  In 1958, the Kellogg Foundation, having considered the work being done by this organisation, agreed to allow a grant of £30,000 over five years from that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" /> This support accordingly came to an end in May last but Macra na Tuaithe had, in anticipation of this loss of income, by that time approached industrialists throughout the country to guarantee annual subscriptions to it for a period of five years from that date. By this means they secured a guaranteed annual income of about £4,000 over the five-year period.  The scope of their proposed activity over the next five-year period will however, cost more than this sum and in 1963-4 the deficit is estimated at about £3,000.</P>
    <P>After careful consideration of a request from Macra na Tuaithe for a grant in aid of their educational activities, it was decided that a grant-in-aid of £3,000 was necessary in the present year to enable it to continue its valuable work and that the necessary authority should be sought by way of a supplementary estimate from Dáil Éireann to enable such payment to be made.  The payment of a further grant-in-aid in the financial year 1964-65 is being provided for in the appropriate subhead of the Vote for Vocational Education for that year.</P>

In the present session, such courses are planned or completed in Ballybay, Killeshandra, Killarney, Sligo, Roscommon, Gorey, Athenry, Leighlinbridge, East Clare and Drimoleague. About 145 people have already received instruction in these courses since September, 1963.  A residential six day course on youth work is held in Gormanston Castle in July each year.  Attendance includes vocational teachers, community people, national teachers and so on.  A junior leadership course for older club members is held in An Grianán each year for 50 teenagers.  There are home decoration projects which are supervised in four to six counties each year and domestic science teachers work closely with Macra.</P>
      <P>As well, about 250 boys each year cultivate beet plots as projects by special arrangement with the Sugar Company and 200 boys and girls write essays in English and Irish for prizes as part of the scheme to encourage literary effort in Macra na Tuaithe.

The Kellogg Foundation considered it worthy of support to the extent of £30,000 a year.  That came to an end last May and, therefore, the organisation were going ahead with the projects on hand without adequate finance.  They went to various Irish industrialists and got contributions from them.  These people were obviously impressed by the work done and were satisfied to give money towards it.  What I am giving meets the gap between what they got on a <Col N="71" /> voluntary basis and the total expenditure involved.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £11,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964, for Grants-in-Aid to Universities and Colleges and to the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate provides for the making of a grant of £11,000 in aid of the College of Pharmacy in the present financial year.</P>
      <P>An application for State aid for the College was received from the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland who have pointed out that rapid and extensive developments in Pharmacy over the last 20 years have led to the lengthening and the intensification of the training courses for pharmacists in all advanced countries.  In line with developments in other countries the Society introduced a full-time two-year course in 1952 and, later, as from 1961-62 a three-year degree course by arrangement with University College, Dublin.</P>
      <P>The first-year students of the College for the three-year degree course attend full-time at University College, Dublin, where they follow the first-year science course.  The second and third years leading to the B.Sc.(Pharm.) degree are spent in the College of Pharmacy. The College of Pharmacy recoups University College, Dublin, for the provision of teaching and technical facilities for the second and third-year courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> The first third-year course commenced in the College of Pharmacy in October last and additional facilities by way of equipment and a greater number of qualified staff had to be made available as a matter of urgency. While, pending receipt of the report from the Commission on Higher Education, it would not be appropriate to take final decisions in relation to the arrangements to be made for pharmaceutical education in Ireland, it was considered proper to extend to the Pharmaceutical Society, on a temporary basis, such State assistance as was necessary to enable them to initiate and carry through the third-year course as planned.  The amount of State aid estimated to be required in this connection in the present financial year is £11,000.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £185,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> The provisions for An Foras Tionscal under the Industrial Grants Acts and the Undeveloped Areas Acts in the Vote for 1963-64 for Subhead J.2 (Industrial Grants Acts) and Subhead J.3 (Re-equipment and Expansion Grants) were, respectively, £1,600,000 and £250,000.  In the event, this has proved to be inadequate.  Up to 3rd February, 1964, expenditure has amounted to £1,008,000 under Subhead J.2 and £124,500 under Subhead J.3 and it is anticipated that further payments on approved projects amounting to £752,000 under Subhead J.2 and £250,000 under Subhead J.3 will arise before 31st March, 1964.</P>
    <P>The necessity for seeking additional funds at this stage is due in part to the unusual difficulties inherent in framing annual estimates of expenditure by An Foras Tionscal.  As will be appreciated, it is difficult to time with any degree of precision the various operations involved in the establishment of an industrial undertaking, such as company formation, site acquisition and clearance, provision of the balance of capital, erection of premises and purchase of plant.  At any of these stages unforeseen changes may arise which are influenced by factors completely out of the control of An Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <P>The increase in the estimated expenditure under Subhead J.2 reflects also the success of the promotional programme undertaken by the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>Total net commitments incurred up to 31st December, 1963, by the Industrial Development Authority under the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, and by An Foras Tionscal under the Industrial Grants Acts, 1959 to 1963, amount to £6,942,000 of which £2,453,643 has been paid leaving a balance of £4,488,357.  Grants paid to date in the current financial year amount to £1,008,000 and it is expected that further payments to the end of the year will amount to £752,000 making a total of £1,760,000 in grant payments for the year.</P>
    <P>Up to 31st December, 1963, grants had been approved by An Foras Tionscal under the Industrial Grants <Col N="74" /> Act, 1956, and the Industrial Grants Acts, 1959-1963, for 82 undertakings. Eight of these projects have however now been deferred indefinitely.  Of the 74 undertakings which are now proceeding 40 are already in production, building of the factories has commenced in 18 cases and a further 16 undertakings are at various stages with their arrangements for setting up the industries.  These undertakings represent a total capital investment, including grants, of £29 million and at full production it is estimated that these 74 undertakings will afford employment to a total of approximately 16,000 workers&mdash;10,500 male and 5,500 female.  A most important feature has been the extent to which projects related to the export trade are being developed.  With two exceptions, all of the 74 undertakings will manufacture entirely or mainly for sale in export markets.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the special legislation providing for the making of grants for the enlargement or adaptation of industrial undertakings was enacted only on 20th February, 1963, and it was not, of course, possible at the time to attempt any calculated estimate of the sum required for funds for An Foras Tionscal under this Subhead J.3.  Payments to date amount to £124,500 and it is expected that further expenditure of £250,000 will arise before the end of the financial year.  This total expenditure relates to 22 applications for special grants. As at 31st December, 1963, 244 other applications had been received.</P>
    <P>I think it is reasonable to say that these figures indicate that the response to this special grants legislation has not been altogether disappointing but I am not yet quite satisfied that the urgent need for adaptation to meet conditions of freer trade is being fully felt by our industrialists or that there is a sufficient realisation of the fact that these special grants will not be available after 31st March, 1965.  The economic disadvantage of operating under unsuitable conditions, even from the narrow context of the firm concerned, should not need to be stressed and I would urge a general awareness of the <Col N="75" /> efforts of the Government to build up the economy and viability of our existing industries.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of the whole grants scheme to which I feel I should refer is the question of responsibility for the reaching of decisions on grant applications.  Judging by the representations which I and my colleagues in the Government receive from time to time, it is evident that there is some confusion, even among Deputies, on this point.  I wish to stress that the reaching of a decision on applications to An Foras Tionscal is solely a matter for the board of that body.  An Foras was established by statute as the sole authority to examine and take decisions on such applications and there can, therefore, be no ministerial intervention in connection with the discharge by the board of their functions in relation to the administration of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that the total amount of £285,000 in this Estimate is being offset by £100,000, an expected saving on another Subhead of the Vote.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend that the House should approve of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister explained, this Supplementary Estimate is necessary to provide additional funds for grants administered by An Foras Tionscal.  It is satisfactory to note that the scheme is being availed of, although there are many firms who have not yet availed of the grant facilities. In that connection, it might be worth the trouble involved to have circulars issued, either by An Foras Tionscal or directly by the Department, to all industries, notifying them of the grant facilities which are available and directing their attention to the possible advantages involved in seeking readaptation and re-equipment grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note from the Minister's statement that these grants will not be paid after 1965 and I should like to know why a time-limit is imposed.  It is obvious that there is some urgency in the <Col N="76" /> matter and it is quite possible that for a variety of reasons certain firms might wish to avail of these grants at a later stage and, in view of the programme of tariff reductions laid down under the EEC whereby the rhythm of tariff reductions will be fully effective by 1970, it seems to me that there would be some advantage in affording facilities for availing of these grants after 1965.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the EFTA countries have published a timetable for reducing tariffs and protection amongst themselves to take effect by 1966.  It always seemed to me that that was merely an effort to get a jump ahead of the EEC countries.  Whether that target is ultimately reached, only time will tell.  However, so far as we are concerned, our original estimate here was based on the timetable laid down in the EEC programme and, on the assumption that we still intend to follow that programme, it seems to me that 1970 is a more practical aim than the immediate one of 1966.</P>
    <P>In his concluding remarks, the Minister has expressed once again the conditions under which grants are made and the fact that these grants are decided on by an Foras Tionscal independently of the Minister.  That aspect of the matter requires to be emphasised for more reasons than one.  In that connection, it seems to me that some firms or individuals have the impression that firms with foreign connections get some sort of preferential treatment.  I do not think that that is so, but whatever reason or reasons, a number of firms here have the impression that if a firm or company has outside participation, either capital or capital and technicians, it appears to be more welcome than a firm that is entirely Irish.</P>
    <P>That impression may be due to the considerable efforts made over the years to attract external capital here. I believe that that policy is sound, that it is wise to attract external capital and to attract external technicians and people with know-how.  It is a policy that has been supported by all sides of the House and one which has had support from different Governments.  At the same time, the <Col N="77" /> fact that that has been done may have been responsible to some extent for creating the impression, in certain quarters at any rate, that preferential treatment was being given or, if not preferential treatment, that an easier approach faces those with outside capital or outside know-how.</P>
    <P>I believe it is important to make clear the basis on which grants are issued or awarded and, in addition, that the general policy behind the issue of grants should be clearly known and understood and that the general facts in relation to the issue of grants should be available to all who are interested in applying for them or, in the case of firms who may be interested, that the terms on which grants may be made or refused should be clearly understood.</P>
    <P>The policy of providing industrial grants has undoubtedly justified itself. There has been a very substantial expansion in the development of industrial concerns that have been the subject of grants.  The general incentive created by industrial grants and by tax remissions on exports has undoubtedly justified the confidence of those who introduced them initially.  I have on previous occasions adverted to the views expressed by Professor Carter, the Jevons Professor of Political Economy at Queen's University, Belfast. He expressed the view some years ago that the biggest technical factor in industrial expansion here was the tax remission on exports.  That and the industrial grants were all part of the same policy of providing the maximum possible incentives not merely for industrial expansion and consequential expansion in employment but for providing incentives for the expansion of exports because there is a general recognition and appreciation that the size of the home market is relatively limited and if industry is to expand and develop, we must continually expand export potential and increase industrial exports.</P>
    <P>In the present climate of economic opinion in Europe, particularly, and in more recent times, with the aims under the Kennedy round of tariff reductions, it is obvious that we face keener competition <Col N="78" /> and if our industrialists are to overcome the disadvantages which the country has compared with some other countries that have highly industrialised economies and uninterrupted industrial tradition, then it is obvious that the incentives provided by grants and the remissions or tax reliefs on exports are necessary if that drive and initiative and the aims which are recognised as worthwhile in the provision not merely of industrial or general economic expansion but also of providing increased employment, are realised.</P>
    <P>These grants have provided assistance where needed and have afforded those concerned, who have already availed of them, an opportunity for expansion and re-equipment and, in some cases, initial development, to the advantage not only of the concerns themselves but of all employed directly or indirectly by them.  We are glad this expansion has taken place and the Supplementary Estimate we are now considering is an indication that the progress already made is likely to continue.</P>

      <P>In considering this Supplementary Estimate, it is no harm to recall that if this Government had their way, Ireland would now be a full member of EEC.  We would be up to our necks in this Community. The grants mentioned in the Estimate are available to put us into a position to compete in that Community.  We would thank our lucky stars that this gamble&mdash;that is all I can describe it as&mdash;by the mastermind did not come off.  The suggestion by the Taoiseach made here and abroad was that Ireland was fully fitted to compete on equal terms with the existing members of the Common Market.  We know now from the examination which has been carried out since those rash statements were made by the Taoiseach and the present Minister, that this is not so.  In comparison with those European countries, we are like an invalid competing with a trained professional athlete.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to discuss the Common Market.  I am making an opening statement bearing on the reasons why these grants are available.  These grants for helping new industry and for the re-adaptation or enlarging of existing industries are to help this country to prepare for the Common Market membership which the Government hope to achieve.  I mention this so that we may realise what brought about this urgency of the year 1965 as the target by which date these grants would cease to operate.  I shall not go any further into it except to say that the CIO reports show that the arguments put forward by the Government were wrong.  Their whole case for admission was wrong and we should be thankful that this preparatory stage is still available to Irish industry and I hope, for the sake of the people, that industrialists will take advantage of the very generous offers made to private enterprise in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>The first comment I wish to make on the Estimate itself is the lack of mention by the Minister of what will happen the workers who are disemployed as a result of these adaptation grants which he is now giving.  The Minister hopes to be able to spend by the end of the financial year no less than £400,000.  I hope I am right in the figure.  He has already earmarked £124,000 for adaptation grants and he contemplates that a further expenditure of £250,000 will arise before the end of the financial year.  Approximately £400,000 is being given to 22 firms which are known and, perhaps, a number of others, to enable them to enlarge, perhaps, their existing concerns and, in respect of a considerable number of them, to adapt existing factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister available the number of workers in those 22 concerns he has mentioned who will be disemployed or have been disemployed in the past 12 months?  It is very significant that we have not heard a word yet from the two major Parties who have spoken on this Supplementary Estimate <Col N="80" /> about the welfare of the workers whose livelihood is at stake as a result of these grants.  It is a pretty grim situation to find that the workers as taxpayers are now being asked to subscribe, or hand over through the machinery of the House, £400,000 which will possibly mean that they will lose their jobs in the next few months.</P>
    <P>I want to make clear that the Labour Party are fully in favour of the most modern methods of industrial expansion and the use of the most up-to-date equipment and machinery, but the Labour Party do not subscribe to the view that machinery and adaptation of industry must get priority over the welfare of the workers.  If the taxpayers' money is to be paid out to help private enterprise retool, re-equip and adapt itself for European competition, we must ensure that the welfare of the workers in these industrial concerns will not be jeopardised as a result.</P>
    <P>We have not had a word from the Minister as to what is the situation regarding the welfare of these workers. On a number of occasions over the past 12 months, the Minister has been questioned as to what progress has been made in the working out of a scheme to compensate, retrain or resettle workers who become redundant as a result of the implementation of these adaptation schemes.  So far, we have had no indication of a firm nature from the Minister that any decision has been made with regard to the retraining of the workers who have, in many instances, already lost their employment.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that what we are going to see is a gradual release of workers from various concerns as adaptation takes place, a gradual release of workers, a few now and a few again. This discharge of the workers will have a gradual growth and will not therefore become an embarrassing problem, either for the Government or the employers or, in many instances, the trade unions who have a responsibility to the workers, a responsibility to which many of them have failed to live up.  We in this House cannot allow Irish capital and the taxpayers' money to be expended <i>ad lib</i>, in the giving of <Col N="81" /> grants to private enterprise firms to adapt themselves, unless we have a guarantee that in the process of that adaptation, the workers will not lose their jobs or that, if they do, alternative employment will be guaranteed to them.  Before there is any agreement on this issue of a Supplementary Estimate for adaptation grants, we want to know the situation with regard to employment in these concerns.</P>
    <P>Some months ago I questioned a grant of £55,000 to a certain industrial concern that makes chewing gum not many miles from this city.  I suggested that an adaptation grant or an enlargement grant of £55,000 was being given to this concern to enable it to adapt itself to the export market. When I raised that question here, Deputy Briscoe, and I hope he will come in here today, saw fit to make a personal explanation to the House in which he charged me with suggesting that this factory was about to lay off workers as a result of getting that grant.  He said that instead of laying off workers, the intention was to increase the number of workers.  I should like to ask the Minister and Deputy Briscoe, as a director of that company, what is the latest information they have with regard to the employment situation in that bubble-gum factory.</P>
    <P>We want to make sure that if the money of the Irish people is to be handed out in such a generous fashion to these private enterprise concerns, the boys and girls working in them will not be told that they are being laid off.  They are told that they are being laid off for some time but that it is hoped to take them back as soon as possible.  Then, after two or three months, they are told that there may be employment for them in six weeks time.  The result has been that many girls have gone to England, knowing well that the firm has no intention of re-employing them.  These are the people to whom this House is now being asked to give substantial grants.</P>
    <P>Whose interests are at stake?  Is it the interests of the directors of these concerns who want to make their big dividends or is it the interests of the workers that are at stake?  I want the <Col N="82" /> Minister to answer that question because if we are to give £400,000 between now and the end of March to be expended on adaptation, it will only be given on the ground that every individual who loses his job through these adaptation schemes will be compensated, given employment elsewhere or re-trained.  We shall have to get a guarantee that the workers will be safeguarded in their employment.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to indicate the locality in which the majority of these 22 applicants are&mdash;whether they are located in the Dublin area, the Cork area or if a percentage of them are in the west.  I should like some information as to the 74 concerns he referred to, 40 of which, he said, are already in production.  I should like to know what proportion of these 40 are situated in the undeveloped areas, how many of them are in the west of Ireland, Kerry, Clare, Donegal, Monaghan or Cavan?  Experience so far has proved that the alteration in the law which permits An Foras Tionscal to give more attractive grants to the eastern counties has also caused a big reduction in industrial development in the west.</P>
    <P>Industrial development in the west under An Foras Tionscal was not very encouraging at any time but since similar grants are now available in the east, whatever development was taking place in the west under An Foras Tionscal has ceased.  We have had the example, for instance, in Boyle in County Roscommon, of very strong efforts being made by a local development association.  Every possible effort that could be made was made by an energetic group of citizens to bring an industry to the town.  They met officials of An Foras Tionscal and of the Industrial Development Authority and asked them for assistance to set up an industry in Boyle.  They were told that these bodies could do nothing to help them unless the people in Boyle were able to suggest what the industry should be.  Is that not a case of putting the cart before the horse? Surely if we have an area in the west which needs State aid, advice and guidance, the people there should not be told: &ldquo;It is up to you to get <Col N="83" /> the industry and then we in Foras Tionscal and the IDA will examine into it and if we think it is suitable, we will give the promoters a grant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have the sad situation which now obtains in every little town in the west where there is a chamber of commerce or a development association of one kind or another, that they are tripping over each other to get to the door of the German Legation or some other legation and advertising in every European paper looking for private <i>entrepreneurs</i> in Europe to come to Boyle, Charlestown or Tubbercurry. &ldquo;Come to us in your thousands if you have any type of industrial trading in Europe and we are prepared to give you a céad míle fáilte.&rdquo;  That is no way to depend on industries being developed.  That kind of haphazard development, in my opinion, is disastrous. One town may be lucky enough to get somebody it can depend on but the next town may get applications from the biggest chancers in Europe. The result is that when a project is turned down, there is a feeling of despair in the area among those who initiated it and also among the workers who had hoped to get work.</P>
    <P>The initiative in these cases must come from the State and the best possible way is for the State to step in where private enterprise has failed.  I shall not develop that point any further. We are handing out these grants without any true pattern of industrial development being established.  There is no true picture disclosed of how industry is being developed.  There is no such thing as picking one area and deciding we will concentrate here on heavy industry and hope that we will attract into the towns nearby lighter industries which may depend on the major one for their advancement. There is no planning in that regard.  All we do is hand out grants to these people, without any control afterwards as to whether they will stay for five years or for ten years or, having employed juvenile or female labour, they will not fold their tents and disappear overnight.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise when he answers questions in this House to the <Col N="84" /> effect that he has no function in securing or saying that an industry will be placed in a certain locality that he is not carrying out his responsibility to the people.  He has a function and a responsibility to the people.  There is no question of washing his hands and saying: &ldquo;I am prepared to help private enterprise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Private enterprise, for 40 years, has been given the chance and has been exhorted, enticed and encouraged in every way possible by the Minister and this Government and other Governments to go into areas which today are fast being denuded of their population. When private enterprise has failed over that period to bring about the necessary stabilisation in population by giving industrial employment, why do the Government and the Minister not waken up to the fact that the Government must take it up in light of that failure?  I do not know for how many years that has been said in this House and all we hear from the Minister and the Government is an exclamation of horror&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall not dispute your word, Sir.  I may have enlarged the scope slightly but I was bringing it in under my question as to what proportion of the 40 new projects which are in operation are situated in the areas to which I have referred. That is the only way I can bring it within the rules of order.  I should be very interested if the Minister could tell me that even out of the 40, 30 per cent of the money which is being made available will be spent in what were known as the underdeveloped or congested areas.  If he could tell us that 30 per cent of these projects were in the west, we would not feel too unhappy. I should like him to enlarge on that.  On the other matter, I hope the Minister will make clear what is the position in regard to the 22 applications which are before him for special grants for adaptation.  What guarantees are available from the 22 applicants that the workers they <Col N="85" /> employ at present will be guaranteed alternative employment elsewhere if they are not kept on in their existing jobs, or given opportunities for re-training so that they will be able to take up some other occupation, or given compensation?  Before the Minister is given this £400,000, he will have to answer for the welfare of the workers to whom I have referred.</P>

      <P>I was very interested to hear some of the points made by Deputy McQuillan.  Unfortunately, when he came to the most interesting part, he said he would not pursue it any further.  Listening to Deputy McQuillan, I tried to visualise the situation that would arise if instead of the practice which he says exists to-day&mdash;that of various towns, large and small, advertising on their own in European papers and endeavouring to attract industry&mdash;the officials of An Foras Tionscal, the Industrial Development Authority or of the Department of Industry and Commerce controlled this whole matter and decided that this industry will go to this town, this industry will go to that town, but that town will get nothing. I wonder would Deputy McQuillan be prepared to accept such a decision in regard say, to the town of Boyle.  If he found that Boyle was getting no industry by virtue of a decision of servants of this State, would he be prepared to accept that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would Deputy McQuillan accept this decision?  The position now is that there is every opportunity for such a town to get an industry but the situation could arise, and must arise in regard to any town under Deputy McQuillan's suggestion, that it will not get an industry because of a decision made in Dublin. If one had to choose, I would prefer to choose the present position.  Every town in rural Ireland cannot hope to get a new industry within, say, the next ten years.  There has to be only a small number which would benefit. If that is to happen, I should prefer to see the decision being made on the basis of economic reasons, arrived at by the people who are investing <Col N="86" /> money, or based on a contributory factor, namely the initiative and devotion to their cause by the local people, rather than have the decision made by some faceless officials here in Dublin.  Deputy McQuillan is, I think, carried away by theory.  He has not visualised, perhaps, how this theory would work out in practice.  I did not rise simply to cross swords with Deputy McQuillan.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy McQuillan and I can pursue it on the main Estimate then.  It is a very interesting subject.  The Minister announced that the amount estimated for industrial grants had not proved enough.  That is a very good sign of the development of our economy.  We can be well satisfied, I think, that in general the money spent by the State by way of industrial grants has been money well spent.  We have had some failures, but the percentage is very small.  The Taoiseach said at a very early stage of this campaign that we could expect to have some failures.  If we were to ensure that grants were given only to firms we were certain would succeed, then we might save ourselves certain losses, but we would also very effectively ensure that the economy of the country would not be developed as it has been developed and thousands of workers who are in employment today would be idle.  The approach must be one of reasonable prudence but not overdone caution.  We need more money for these grants and that is a very welcome sign indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one relatively small matter, as far as the House is concerned, but it is an important matter from the point of view of individuals.  It is a matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  It has come to my notice that certain firms which have availed of industrial grants&mdash; Deputy McQuillan may be interested to know that some are located west of the Shannon&mdash;have employed foreign architects, foreign quantity surveyors and foreign engineers.  They have brought in plans and even materials from abroad.  I am not sure of the extent to which they have imported materials but there were instances in which Irish materials could have been used and were not used.  Except in exceptional circumstances, we should insist that, if the State is providing the generous assistance it does provide, our people get all the benefit they can from the building of factories and the development of factories.  Our architects, quantity surveyors and engineers <Col N="88" /> should benefit.  In odd cases there may be justification for departing from this practice, but they would be very unusual cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to our general policy in regard to industrial grants and the development of industries. What I have to say now may seem elementary, but I believe it is worthy of repetition and cannot be impressed often enough on our people. The object of the Government, of any Government in this day and age, is to increase the employment opportunities available to our people and to ensure that such employment yields a reasonable standard of living.  It is obvious that we cannot hope to have any increased employment provided by agriculture outside of some phenomenal development in horticulture.  That is a possibility, but it is only a possibility. Like every industrialised country in the world, we find that the tendency is for employment created by agriculture to decrease.  It follows, therefore, that we must depend on industry to provide increased employment.</P>
    <P>We know that, in regard to most commodities, the home market is saturated.  It follows logically, therefore, that our expansion must be directed towards industrial development geared for an export market. That is, as I say, elementary, but it bears repetition.  It is something we should always have in mind, particularly when we hear complaints, as we have on occasions, about the amount of money spent in encouraging foreigners to set up industries here and the amount lost to the State by virtue of tax concessions in relation to exports.  It is easy to criticise, but, when criticising, one should remember the basic and elementary economic fact that the extent to which we wish to increase employment can be measured by the extent to which we direct our efforts to securing the setting up of more industries designed to serve an export market.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have been fairly successful in this regard, more successful than many people thought we could be, or perhaps hoped we could be.  We have, however, a long way to go.  Having secured an export market, <Col N="89" /> it does not follow we will hold it unless we continue all the time at full stretch. As far as the House is concerned, the feeling, I think, would be to urge the Minister on to further efforts along the lines he has been following in the past and the adaptation grants are a logical development of acceptance of the facts I have mentioned.  If we want to survive, not to mention expanding, we are obliged to ensure that our industries are capable of competing in the markets of Europe and the world. Some of our industries have proved very successful and have set a headline for others of our industries.  However, when I hear the kind of complaints we have been hearing from Deputy McQuillan in regard to the adaptation grants, although I do not say he is entirely out of line in his complaints&mdash;his concern for the workers who may be affected in their jobs is certainly admirable&mdash;I wonder if he is not pressing his concern to such an extent that he is losing sight of the reality of the situation.  I do not know what the figures are but I am quite satisfied that there must be many thousands of our workers who are today depending entirely for their employment on our success in exporting industrial products.  Therefore anything that tends to make us less competitive directly threatens the employment of these people.</P>
    <P>One must keep a sense of perspective about this and if one finds that our industries cannot compete unless they are given these adaptation grants and use them effectively, then it is reasonable that we should push these grants, even if one of the consequences is that in some cases workers will be laid off.  The best guarantee we can give to workers who may be in danger of becoming redundant as a result of the more efficient organisation of our industry is our effort to ensure that our industries are as effective as we can make them.  Unless we can do that, we cannot ensure employment for any of our workers in industry.  In so far as we can make our industries efficient, we can provide employment not only for our existing workers but for more workers, as we have done in recent years.</P>
    <P>The number of industrial workers is <Col N="90" /> growing steadily and the employment they are getting is good employment but this is not happening just by chance.  This is happening because our efforts are directed towards ensuring that our industries are being made efficient and it is being made possible for them to compete on the export market.  If we fail to do that, the employment of thousands of workers is threatened.  For that reason, I repeat that the best guarantee for our workers is the knowledge that the Government are doing everything possible to ensure that our industrial concerns are competitive.</P>

      <P>While I agree with the Minister's statement in his brief introductory speech that it is difficult at times with any degree of precision to present an annual Estimate that is close to the demand that may subsequently arise, I want to know from the Minister whether this Supplementary Estimate has been inflated in any way by increased costs that have arisen since the annual Estimate was introduced. Is this Estimate designed specifically for new undertakings which were not provided for in the annual Estimate or have increased costs an impact on this, the danger to which Deputy Colley adverted when he referred to what would arise in the event of Irish industry becoming less able to face present-day competition in the export market.</P>
      <P>The Minister might give us an idea what he envisages in that respect because some leaders of commerce throughout the country have expressed their opinions of the impact upon their industries of the retrospective corporation profits tax imposed in last year's Budget and of spiralling costs in other respects.  During these weeks, the local authorities are all presented with formidable demands in regard to rates and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is also an obligation on the Government in the pursuit of their policy not to aggravate the difficulties which many people who are giving good employment have to meet and have to surmount.  In that respect the Minister need not be so irascible or so sensitive.  He has an opportunity of replying and I am surely entitled to make these observations, subject to the control of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have got a <Col N="92" /> reply after the Minister cooled down. The Minister in page two of his speech gave credit to the Industrial Grants Act of 1956.  The House will recall that the leader of his Government assured us when that Bill was being introduced that, were he to obtain control at any time, he would see it was brought to an end.  Now we have the conversion of his successor in the Department of Industry and Commerce who has paid tribute to the developments that have taken place in the country in consequence of that Act.  I give credit to the Minister and the Party for having adopted it and having expanded some of its provisions.</P>
      <P>We are very glad the Minister has included in his statement a reference to the fact that he has no influence in the siting of industries.  When some of the people behind him go down the country, they express other views.  It is reminiscent of the statement of ex-Deputy Boland after he left the Department of Lands that never at any time could the Minister influence the operations of the Land Commission. It is well, therefore, to have this on record.</P>
      <P>I recall distinctly that when the whole approach to an industrial development was examined by another Government and when it was decided by way of tax exemption, by way of substantial grant, to encourage industrialists to come in from abroad, powers were given to the Industrial Development Authority so that no industrialist, either native born or coming from outside, would be hamstrung in regard to the location of industry.  It should be left completely in the hands of An Foras Tionscal to determine where an industry has the best chance of survival.  Some years have elapsed since 1956.  The Control of Manufactures Act was deliberately enshrined in our legislation to prohibit the investment of capital from outside in Irish industry.  The Act has operated for a quarter of a century and for a long number of years, members of this Party referred to the unfairness of that Act.  There were the depths to which people sank in order to circumvent the conditions of that Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister refers to 22 projects.  Do they include a grant for the accelerated freeze-drying factory to be located at Bandon?  If so, what about his undertaking on an earlier occasion that in the event of development in that town and vicinity, he would include Bandon in the undeveloped areas so as to qualify for a maximum grant?  Is it the Minister's intention to redeem that undertaking and to sanction to that industry the maximum grant?</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the difficulties of old-established industries relative to the easement of import duties.  He is aware of one industry in particular in this connection.  I know he will give all his attention to the matter and will take such action as will be necessary to preserve employment in it.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan and another Deputy referred to potential employees in industry.  The Minister should immediately consult the Minister for Local Government relative to housing for workers in some industries.  As recently as the past week, an old-established firm close to Cork city has had difficulty in relation to transporting workers considerable distance. We cannot export many thousands of our people, as has happened in recent years, and expect to have a pool of labour available for an expanding industry.  Antediluvian regulations apply in the Department of Local Government to the housing of such workers.  The legislation should be revised as soon as possible so as to permit local authorities to avail of maximum grants and to proceed with this housing which is an absolute factor in securing the best types of employees for an expanding industry. Before the Minister introduces his main Estimate, we trust the headaches of so many individuals relative to the position of the Equitable Insurance Company will be cured, as was promised.</P>

      <P>I shall be brief, especially as the Chair seems to have ruled out of order any reference to the location or direction of industry. I am sure that matter can more fully and more appropriately be dealt with on the main Estimate.  My views on it are not in conflict&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have misunderstood the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. My views are not in conflict with those expressed by Deputy McQuillan. The Minister has a broad idea of my views on that matter.  I do not think there is anything wrong with the Government making efforts to ensure that various parts of the country are equipped in the matter of industry. They have done that in many cases. In their first piece of legislation dealing with assisting industry, the Undeveloped Areas Act, the Government, without specifying that an industry would be located in this or that city, in this town or that village, provided for an increase in assistance so as to encourage industry in a certain part of the country. They did not give a specific direction, but there was a general direction to those who wanted to establish industries in the country to go across the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decide what harbours are to be developed.  I grant that they get expert advice, but they decide whether the harbour to be developed should be in Galway, Cork, Wexford or Wicklow.  They have reference to all the recommendations of their advisers before they decide which harbour should be developed.  In the establishment of semi-State industries, the Government naturally decided where the industry is to be established.  I do not know what induced them to have the sugar factories located in Thurles, Carlow, Mallow and Tuam.  Originally it may not have been so, but now it is true that the four factories are situated <Col N="96" /> in centres where beet is generally grown.  But was it necessary to have a factory built in Thurles instead of Nenagh, in Mallow instead of Mitchelstown, in Tuam instead of Galway or Athlone?</P>
    <P>I could go a little further in relation to the reports of the Committee on Industrial Organisation.  They recommended the establishment of industrial zones.  It would not be private enterprise that would decide where these zones would be located: naturally, it would be the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Government.  The CIO saw nothing wrong in that.  There were representatives of employers and workers on that committee and they saw nothing at all wrong with the establishment of zones in which industries would be developed, by private enterprise or by the State.</P>
    <P>I do not see anything wrong with encouraging private enterprise to go to certain parts of the country for the establishment of industries.  It would be impossible, and undoubtedly unfair, to suggest to the Minister that he should say to the potential founder of an industry: &ldquo;If you do not go to Tralee, we will not give you a loan&rdquo;, or:&ldquo;If you do not go to some town in Donegal or Tipperary or Wexford, you will not get a grant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I do not see any objection to any Government agency, or the Minister, encouraging people to go to areas where there are resources available, especially in the matter of workers.  The Minister does not have to go to the length of catching the industrialist by the scruff of the neck and saying: &ldquo;You must go there.&rdquo; He can encourage the industrialist to go to a place where it has been established there has been unemployment and general uneconomic conditions over the years.</P>
    <P>It has been said that private enterprise is the best judge as to whether or not an industry will survive in a particular area.  However, I repeat that I do not think they should have a final say.  The Minister has given us figures of the millions of pounds that have been invested by way of loan and grant in new industries.  Surely, if we give those loans and grants there should be <Col N="97" /> some say by the Government, through the Minister and his agencies, as to the location of new industries.</P>
    <P>On page 2 of his statement, the Minister says that the total capital investment in such undertakings has reached £29 million.  He says that at full production it is estimated the undertakings will afford employment to a total of approximately 16,000 workers.  I should like to know from the Minister if he thinks the investment was worth while, taking into consideration the numbers who are employed. The figure may be described as excellent, fair or very bad.  I am not in a position to judge, but I should like the Minister, when he comes to deal with the main Estimate, to tell us whether or not the employment of 16,000 workers is good value for the capital invested not so much by private industries but by the State itself and by the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>The figures given about employment and the establishment of new industries are always very patchy and vague. Recently I asked the Minister about newly established industries and I was supplied with a list that went into page after page.  They were described as industrial undertakings or the extension of businesses.  By comparison with the number of pages, the employment could not be said to be considerable.</P>
    <P>In the matter of giving financial assistance to the establishment of industry, one of the principal factors should be the amount of employment to be given.  I agree it is important that we should increase industrial production, but much more important are the number of people who are expected to benefit from it, those who will be employed.  The Minister should ensure to a far greater extent that the number employed will be one of the big factors he will consider in giving financial facilities to those who come from abroad to establish industries.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat surprised that the Minister did not mention the various reports issued by the CIO.  That committee were charged with the task of examining various industries to see how they would fare under Common Market conditions and what they should do to prepare and equip themselves <Col N="98" /> for such conditions.  On page 3 of his statement, the Minister says he is not quite satisfied that the urgent need for adaptation to meet conditions of freer trade is being fully felt by our industrialists.</P>
    <P>I am glad he sees that now.  From the Labour benches, and particularly by the late Deputy Norton, this aspect was stressed and stressed again during the past two or three years&mdash;the urgent need for the preparation of Irish industry for participation in the Common Market and for the implementation of the recommendations of the CIO in this respect.  According to what the Minister now says, it seems the time is running out for many of the industries which we had expected to survive under conditions of freer trade.</P>
    <P>The Government say they are giving generous assistance by way of adaptation and re-equipment grants.  During the past two years, we have been asking the pertinent question as to what would happen if industries did not avail of assistance offered by the Government: what would the Government do if the industrialists said: &ldquo;What difference does it make?  We will be sold out of the market, we will be out-traded&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he is not satisfied that the urgent need for adaptation is being fully felt by our industrialists.  I have always believed that in such a situation, stronger Government action is needed.  There are tens of thousands of workers depending on the simple decision of one man in an industry or of seven or eight directors as to whether or not the industry concerned will meet what we have been calling the Common Market challenge.</P>
    <P>The grants will not be available after 31st March, 1965.  That is only 13 months away.  Up to date the Committee on Industrial Organisation has made a survey of about 20 industries, and only in respect of very few of them could they say that these industries would survive without having to do anything.  One such industry was the printing industry.  The consensus of opinion there was that not only would it survive but that it might even thrive in Common Market conditions.  But the same story was not told in respect of <Col N="99" /> other industries, heavier industries than the printing industry.  The CIO made certain recommendations about adaptation and re-equipment.  These grants will not be available in 13 months' time, yet many of these industries are doing nothing, or at least we have not any evidence they are doing anything to meet the recommendations made which were accepted by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that by the end of this year, he will be committed to the tune of £375,000.  Perhaps he would be able to tell me in respect of what industries these grants are being paid. I do not want to know the actual names; and if the nature of the industry would identify it, I agree he might not be able to mention it here. But if it is in respect of leather, cotton, rayon and woollens, or whatever it is, he should say it in order to give encouragement to the workers engaged in those industries, to let them know that efforts are being made in respect of these industries and that there is no great prospect of these industries flopping and their being rendered unemployed.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan referred to one of the most frustrating things about this whole business.  We are acting as if we were members of the European Economic Community, but we are not deriving any advantage from the Community. Naturally, we cannot because we are not members.  Yet we are stripping ourselves of the protection we have enjoyed for such a long time.  In January, 1963, we stripped ourselves of 10 per cent, and in January, 1964, of another 10 per cent.  I do not know what the future pattern will be, but it will be becoming more and more severe all the time.  For that reason we should say to private enterprise: &ldquo;You had better be up and doing&rdquo; and, if they are not, we say to the Government: &ldquo;You had better be up and doing.&rdquo;  I think it was Deputy Colley who said that if adaptation and re-equipment means men will be rendered unemployed, it is important but it is not the most important aspect because, if by adaptation and re-equipment production is increased, then that is the <Col N="100" /> main thing.  He may be right to some extent.  In regard to adaptation and re-equipment, in the Common Market countries there is a scheme of compensation. I do not know if men have been rendered unemployed because of new methods or adaptation in any of our industries.  If they have, I want to ask the Minister have we yet evolved any scheme whereby redundant workers would be either compensated or trained for some other employment. These are very pertinent questions on this Estimate and I should be obliged if the Minister could, as far as possible, answer some of them.</P>

      <P>The importance of this Estimate makes it imperative for those of us interested in the undeveloped areas to intervene. Some of the speakers on the other side prefer to be critical&mdash;possibly just for the sake of being so&mdash;without being constructive.  I wish to express the greatest possible admiration for the success which has attended the Minister's effort in regard to industrial grants generally. His introductory statement was most encouraging indeed.  The only fault those of us from the western seaboard can find with it is that we should like a greater share of the industries, and it is with that matter I should like to concern myself principally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan's reasoning in regard to the need for making immediate provision for redundancy does not make sense to me.  If we make a serious effort to preserve industry and to ensure that it can survive world competition, surely we are doing a good job for the people employed in industry?  To say we are actually asking the people to vote money to render themselves redundant is, therefore, contradictory.  If in the course of an industry becoming more efficient and gearing itself to meet more competition some workers are rendered redundant, the natural thing to expect is that the increased output will absorb those workers.  I know of concerns that have virtually doubled their output in recent years but have not doubled the number employed.  I know a very efficient industry in Donegal with a big export <Col N="101" /> business.  In the last four or five years they have virtually doubled their exports but have not increased very much the number of people employed.  That is the pattern we may expect as a result of adaptation programmes to meet foreign competition and freer trade.  No matter how you look at it, when you put a firm in a position to compete, you put it in a position to continue to provide employment for its workers.  That is a better outlook for the workers concerned than the fear of having the industry closed because of foreign competition.  I prefer to look at that side of the picture than the likelihood of some workers being rendered redundant.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan tried to attack our whole system of industry and take credit for some of the industries set up here.  I do not want to start recriminations but it is most refreshing for those of us on this side of the House to hear Fine Gael referring to the success of industry here.  We have come a long way.  It is not long ago since we were criticised for imposing tariffs to enable our little industries to gain their feet. We were told we had workshops in backyards and we were calling them factories.  I heard the present Leader of the main Opposition say that Fianna Fáil had gone so daft about industry that if they put Aspros on a string, they would call it an industry. Those days are gone.  We have brought industry to the stage where we have defeated the greatest pessimists&mdash;and there were many of them&mdash;and have proved that we can do the job as well as anybody, and better in many cases.</P>
    <P>That is how far we have come and it is the result of an industrial drive which commenced not so many years ago and which faced opposition, not abroad, but at home, when Irish money was induced into these industries, just because they were given protection in the home market, which was a rather limited market but sufficient to get the necessary nucleus of industry on its feet.  The stage has been reached when today we can talk about the Common Market and about competing with big industrial concerns, a position we never would have reached but for protection given when <Col N="102" /> it was needed.  We are in a position now to talk about reducing that protection, about going into conditions of freer trade and bringing up our efficiency.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan accused us that we are not in the Common Market and that we would not have been able to compete had we got in when we had applied.  That is all nonsense. It is a question of what adjustment in the rate of tariffs we will have to accept at the time of our admission.  We should make use of the waiting period to ensure that we will be geared up to a point at which, no matter what the tariff rhythm may be, we will be fit to accept it and to compete with the other countries who will have been members long before we get in.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell on this question of the history of industry in this country.  It is a very interesting history and, as to 99 per cent., it is the history of Fianna Fáil.  There is no gainsaying that fact.  That is not what we want to glory in.  We must concentrate on the future.  We have an important part to play in the time ahead.</P>
    <P>I intervened in this debate in order, mainly, to refer to the question of undeveloped areas.  I do not agree with the Labour representatives who say the Minister should take absolute control of private enterprise and pinpoint the exact place where every or any industry should go.  Many of the industrialists with whom I have been in touch would not leave a particular area, irrespective of the grants they may get in another area.  Others may not be too concerned and may be prepared to go further out to the western seaboard.  Indeed, a few industrialists have been found to be prepared to go into Donegal. Naturally, every Deputy is interested in his own constituency.</P>
    <P>I should like to impress upon the Minister publicly what I have tried to impress upon him, and with which he has agreed, privately, that Donegal does present unusual problems in so far as industrialisation is concerned.  It does require some special treatment.  While Donegal is picking up an occasional worthwhile industry, it cannot expect <Col N="103" /> a boom such as will be experienced in Cork, Dublin or the larger towns in or around the province of Leinster. Donegal is virtually isolated from the rest of the Twenty-Six counties.  Particular attention should be paid to contacts with six counties industrial concerns for the purpose of development in Donegal.</P>
    <P>There is one thing which the Minister could do in relation to the western seaboard and Donegal in particular, namely, to consider extensions of State-sponsored enterprises.  In that respect the Government can to a great extent give directives as to the location of an industry.  There are a number of important semi-State bodies, such as Bord na Móna, Cement Limited, the Irish Sugar Company.  The Forestry Division of the Department of Lands could also play an important part in relation to undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna is based mainly in the midlands where large tracts of bog are available.  The midland bogs are most favourably situated from the point of view of distribution for the home market.  That area of bog cannot last indefinitely.  There are in Donegal some of the largest tracts of virgin bog that remain in Ireland.  We should like to see an extension of the activities of Bord na Móna into Donegal.  There is already one very excellent centre in the Glenties area.  The quality of the bog and of the available labour is second to none.  We consider that the time has come for the development by Bord na Mona of the areas in Donegal that have been surveyed.  Naturally, the areas where there is sufficient virgin bog available will receive prior consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very important industry and, if I may remark, the Minister is greatly concerned with industrial Development and Government policy generally.  The question of Cement Ltd. is one that I should not <Col N="104" /> like to discuss at length but it is an industry that has made rapid progress and has reached a very high stage of development.  I am very interested to know that they have acquired in Donegal a considerable amount of limestone land and I hope that at some stage there may be developments.  The sooner the better because the area concerned is particularly badly in need of an industry.</P>
      <P>I have also referred to forestry projects. The Minister may tell me that he has nothing to do with forestry but one cannot help referring to a matter which is capable of future development. I refer to pulp production.  In Donegal, there are some of the largest forests in Ireland, many of which have now reached maturity and will be in the near future, if not right now, available for commercial purposes.  That is an industry that may not be developed by private enterprise.  It may be too big for private enterprise.  I think it is worth while giving a hint to the Minister.</P>
      <P>No doubt, claims are made for various areas and a better case can be made for many areas than can be made for the western seaboard, for various reasons.  The question of climate must be considered.  That question must be examined in connection with the development of the western seaboard. I refer to all the amenities that workers expect when they set up in a particular area.  Schools, secondary schools, universities, technical schools, all these facilities and amenities are very much centred in and around the cities. Housing accommodation sometimes proves a problem, too.  I think, if we are to make a real effort with regard to the western seaboard, it might be worth while considering a development somewhat on the lines of the development at Shannon Airport at the present time.  This would necessitate the provision of schools, housing and other amenities which workers require and which are not available outside the highly industrialised cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important thing is that we can talk about these things in the context of this Estimate in so far as it is most encouraging.  The number of <Col N="105" /> projects which are mooted, under way, or the actual number of inquiries in relation to industry generally is most encouraging and if we are only to benefit by the windfall from the success of the whole scheme, then we would not be doing too badly, but it is only natural that those of us who are removed from the highly industrialised centres should press at every possible opportunity to ensure that we get a share of everything that is going.</P>
    <P>I listened at Question Time today to the comments about the bus charges in Dublin and about Dublin having to subsidise transport elsewhere. If Dublin is comprised of the people from the various counties, who are attracted by the bright lights here, and are taking part in what is a worldwide cult at the moment, of leaving the rural areas and going to the cities, where there is transport and all the amenities they expect to have, they cannot expect to acquire them at the expense of rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>If they are to prosper and have these benefits, then at least we must expect that they will pay for them.  There were complaints today about the price of meat but our farmers have to sell the beef. Thank God, they get a better price today than they ever got before.  We do not want the industrialised areas complaining because they have to pay more for their beef.  The farmers are doing well.  If the people prefer to rush into the industrialised centres, then they should be prepared to pay the rural areas for what they produce. That is one angle on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rose to say only a few words on this question of decentralisation.  I know the difficulties connected with it. They are not easy to overcome.  You cannot just tell any industrialist who comes along: &ldquo;You will get a grant but you must go to a particular town.&rdquo;  This whole question of siting factories and locating industries is a difficult problem.  If we site a factory in one village, the neighbouring village is not satisfied.  They must get one, too. <Col N="106" /> It would require a factory in every village and town in Ireland.  Even that would not satisfy everybody.</P>
    <P>The rising standards of living, which are more and more affecting the uneconomic holders on the western seaboard, are tending to a greater amount of surplus labour in those areas.  Every improvement in the standards of living makes it more difficult for the uneconomic holder to maintain any decent standard.  That means a greater surplus labour in those areas, which is being absorbed to a great extent by our own towns at the moment.  It would be much more desirable if the industries could be brought to the areas where labour is available.  That is one of the things which the western seaboard has to offer as against the cities.</P>
    <P>This matter has been mentioned by some Deputies who referred to the town development committees which are advertising free sites and all facilities and amenities.  There is in every town an active development committee offering a free site for a factory; yet you will get many concerns who would prefer to come in and pay £17,000 or £18,000 for a site in an industrial area rather than go to the area where these sites would be available for much less, and in fact, in many cases, free.  That is only natural. It is one of the problems we will always have to face.  But there are quite a number of industries which are suited to the western seaboard and the more of them that can be pushed out in that direction, the better will it be for the general position of industry in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I want to say, in conclusion, we have reached a stage which, at one time, we would have been very happy to visualise.  I remember the days when we first went into the manufacture of particular goods and the shopkeepers sold them with an apology.  They said: &ldquo;All we can give you now is stuff made in Ireland.  It is not much good but it is the best we can do.  If we buy other goods, we have to pay a high tariff&rdquo;.  There was a hard core of people who, for patriotic reasons, were prepared to stand over, and advocate, <Col N="107" /> the sale of Irish goods, but they were in the minority for a very long time. That day has passed and we have reached the stage now where we are able to go to other countries and buy our own goods, which are superior to those produced in those which, for a long time, have been industrialised and have been held up as paragons of manufacturing perfection.  I congratulate the Minister on his short introductory speech, which is full of hope for the future and is most encouraging for every Deputy.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind the party opposite that we did not condemn.  We were constructive in our criticism and have always been so. Let me remind those on the opposite benches of what they once called &ldquo;white elephants&rdquo; when they were established in this country.  Mind you, the greatest compliment they could pay to this side of the House is to continue to establish a lot more of those white elephants.  Elephants never forget and we are not going to let the Minister forget either.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on continuing, and accepting, the policy, as outlined and introduced by Deputy Sweetman, when as Minister for Finance, he introduced the incentives for the establishment of industries here in 1956.  I can bear out that since these incentives were given in my own town, industries have been established. I have seen some of these industries, in places throughout this country, opened with a flourish and big promises and big contributions by the State.  I should like to know what the Minister intends to do about these promises. They are something like the election promises, which I heard in Cork, that the industries were to give employment to 700 in places where only 200 are employed.  Mind you, some of the Ministers were at the same table and broke bread with those people.  They enjoyed the headlines which appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;the hundreds which were to be employed in all those industries. I can give the Minister more details of this later.</P>

      <P>The Minister will get them in due course.  I do not think the Ceann Comhairle would allow me to go into it now and if I did, the Minister might be sorry.  The danger I see in foreign-based industries is that the parent industry will only give surplus orders to their firm in this country. Is it not true that if there is a recession, the first to suffer will be the Irish-based industries?  Will the Minister say otherwise?  I take it his silence is the answer.</P>
      <P>I think greater grants and incentives should be given to old established local industries and that would go a long way towards helping to increase our industrial output.  Let us not depend too much on foreigners.  It is bad enough to have them buying land from under our feet without controlling our paypackets as well.  We have many of these so-called factories. I see them around.  They just employ little girls of 14, who leave school, and as soon as they reach 16 they are dismissed.  Something should be done about giving grants to these people. This type of child labour should be stamped out.</P>

We should be very proud of our people who have invested their money in Irish industry and I am certain that they have as good a sense of fair play and decency and honesty as they have of efficiency.  If Deputy Coogan looks up the statistics, he will find our industrialists compare favourably with any others in Europe as employers or as decent men giving good living conditions.  Sending out a slander like that on our own country to the four ends of the earth is damnable and inexcusable and Deputy Coogan should be ashamed of himself.</P>

      <P>A few years ago, there were no industries here when Fianna Fáil courageously tackled the Herculean task.  I have often thought that the Taoiseach, if he never did anything else but revive Irish industries, had accomplished an enormous task that would give him a place of merit forever in the minds of the Irish people. I hope Deputy Coogan will learn sense. If he wants to make propaganda or desires political kudos, I hope he will find some other way instead of trying to smash our industries and insult those who have put money into them.</P>

      <P>I have heard that old story many times.  I congratulate the Minister on the magnificent job he has done.  If Deputy Coogan or anybody else will take the trouble to look up the statistics, he will find that expansion in industry is something to be noted, and not alone noted, but to be proud of.  The Minister has given us very good service and anybody who approaches him will meet one of nature's gentlemen who will guide them as far as he possibly can and help and encourage them to invest more money in Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No investment I know is as safe as Irish industry today.  Thank God for that.  The country was as denuded of industry at one time as it was of forests and of course, this affected the national economy to a very great extent.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention and that of the Industrial Development Authority to one simple matter concerning the undeveloped areas.  Deputy Coogan comes from such an area.  They benefit very substantially but other areas that richly deserve consideration are not covered by the Undeveloped Areas Act.  I would suggest to the Minister that at this stage he should extend <Col N="112" /> the provisions of the Undeveloped Areas Act to every other part of the country where industries are needed and especially would I ask him to consider towns like Tipperary, Fethard, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir.  These are towns that in former days got good business because there were army garrisons in them but now they have no substitute.  There are many such places in South Tipperary and West Waterford and I would ask the Industrial Development Authority to give more consideration to them.</P>
    <P>I would ask especially on behalf of Tipperary town that gave so much in the fight for independence.  No fewer than 85 of my comrades gave their lives, many houses were burned and hundreds were jailed, all for the industrial revival in this country because these men did not die for a name. They died for something else because they knew that this country needed industries if it was going to keep its people.  Some of them lie buried in quick-lime and some of them are buried in Tipperary town itself but I would ask the Minister to think of the sacrifices they made and give Tipperary town the wherewithal to keep its population.  There is one industry there which is quite good but it is not able to give employment to all the people.</P>

In many other of our towns, we now have industries giving good employment and good conditions.  We have to thank the Fianna Fáil Government for that and we decry any attempt to belittle that achievement.  We hear from the Minister that there are prospects that in the near future new industries will rise in this country.  We know that cannot happen overnight and we know there will have to be full investigation as to whether such industries are in the interests of the nation's economy.  We know there are a few <Col N="113" /> fly-by-nights but we also know that we gave them the knock on many occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a special appeal to the Minister for areas that have not yet received any benefit from the industrial revival.  There is the town of Tallow in County Waterford which is a town with a good population.  The town of Lismore is crying out for an industry and there they have a plentiful supply of water which would be very useful to industry. There is also the town of Cappoquin and these three towns are crying out to participate in the industrial revival.  The people of these towns <Col N="114" /> are sincere and honest people and if given an opportunity they would contribute to the industrial revival in no small way.</P>
      <P>There are many items still imported by us which could be produced in this country.  I am sure the Minister has these matters under examination frequently. I would ask him and the Industrial Development Authority to consider South Tipperary and West Waterford for the near future.  We have been told that there is good land in these places.  That is quite true but people are unemployed because of mechanisation and we must have industrial development to absorb that surplus.  If we do not have industrial development, emigration will begin again in the next few years so that it all depends on the Minister and his Department whether we will ever again have an exodus.  I am sure we will not because the Minister is following in the footsteps of his great predecessor, the Taoiseach, and I hope he will not allow my appeal to him to fall on deaf ears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a tragedy to hear a Deputy try to belittle the efforts being made towards the industrialisation of our country, to belittle the efforts of Irish labour and to describe factories as sweatshops.  Any industry in this country is far from being a sweatshop and no suggestions to that effect should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own country is a shining example of the results of the efforts by the Minister and the Government to increase employment through industrialisation. Within the past five years, we have established ten industries which employ 1,500 people and overall wages are over £5 million a year.  Five million pounds had a very big impact on the financial position of Kerry and the people are very grateful for the opportunities they have received.  The establishment of the Liebherr factory in Killarney is proof of the ability of any industry in this country, and of Irish labour, to meet competition from outside.  The greater part of their steel requirements is imported from Glasgow. Sheffield and other parts of Britain, and is purchased at a higher price than the home price in Britain. <Col N="115" /> It is brought to Killarney, manufactured into the finished product and exported again to Britain.  They are also able to sell their product in many parts of the world.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan referred to the employment of child labour.  If he examined the labour position in most of these factories, he would get a picture of the employment system and of how people are started in employment.  In the case of the Liebherr factory, many young lads are taken in as apprentices from 15 to 18.  They are trained in all the operations necessary and during that period they receive £3 a week. After that, they go into full employment and on to the full scale of wages. I know three young lads, one of whom is getting £18 a week, the second, £21 and the third £30.  The third lad is taken to Liverpool and to many other places to help erect the factory's cranes.  Those are the people whom Deputy Coogan is endeavouring to decry and to say that their factories are sweatshops and to talk about the employment of child labour is all wrong.  The young people must be trained somewhere and from what I know of those industries, youngsters must be put through a schooling period.  I assume that is what Deputy Coogan is really referring to.  If he is not, I cannot see any foundation in fact for the statement he made.</P>
    <P>We have a further five projects under way in Kerry which will employ some 300 people at an estimated wage bill of £100,000.  We have a further three in the offing, which we hope will also develop.  This scheme of incentives to industrialists from outside to come into undeveloped areas is one of the best schemes we have developed. Increasing wages and better social conditions have to a large extent compelled people in the backward areas to leave their homes.  If we can get industries into these areas so that they can get a little more money, they will be quite happy to remain in those areas and contribute whatever abilities they have to the good of the community at large.</P>
    <P>I visited several German towns last September and I was amazed at the <Col N="116" /> large number of industrialists who were interested in coming to this country.  They all said that if we were in the Common Market, they would come immediately.  Many of them thought that they could not wait until the Common Market was fully established and that they should come in any case.  There are very many who are interested in coming and any statements made in this House should be guarded and tend towards inducing those people to come here.  There are many light industries which would employ anything from 50 to 100 people and which would be ideally suited to our small villages and these should get every encouragement from every Deputy.  We should all do our best to get them in here.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to one matter.  Some extra incentive should be given to attract those people to the Gaeltacht areas. They are the poorest and the most backward areas and the people in them are the hardest hit at present.  Their numbers are rapidly dwindling because many of the younger people are getting out and the older people are being left.  Some system of development within or near these areas is necessary and I would ask the Minister to devise a further incentive scheme to induce these people to go into such areas.  Every natural resource that we have, particularly in those areas, should be developed.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Brennan, referred to Bord na Móna. There is a considerable amount of employment being given in the Cahirciveen-Ballinskelligs area and it might be worthwhile trying to establish a briquette factory there.  The country is looking for that type of material and it might be very well worthwhile to use up every possible bit of our natural resources.</P>
    <P>Another industry that would be of immense value to the country, if properly developed, is the whiskey export industry.  It is strange that with the large Irish population there is in the United States of America, our export of whiskey should have such little impact.  Development of a whiskey export industry would have very beneficial <Col N="117" /> reprcussions on our agricultural industry.  If private enterprise is not prepared to expand, then the Government should set up a semi-State body to develop the whiskey industry.  Some distilleries actually closed down in the past 20 years.  That seems a pity, to say the least of it.  Because of the impact on agriculture, any expansion of the whiskey industry would be of benefit to our people in general.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the very substantial grants to induce outside industrialists to establish themselves here.  We have been very fortunate in my county and I hope we shall see many more of them coming in.  We assure them of every facility. They are good employers, decent people and good mixers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan referred to promises made in Cork.  I am rather amazed that anyone on the opposite benches should refer to Cork.  The people there gave their decision in no uncertain terms. They indicated clearly the path they want the nation to tread.  They indicated clearly that they want the nation to continue its forward march.  I trust the Minister will accept&mdash;I am sure he will&mdash;the verdict of the people of Cork that industrialisation must be pushed ahead and employment found for all our people.  Industrial development must be pushed to the maximum. We have only a short number of years, I think, befort industrial production all over the world reaches its peak.  Deputy Coogan should re-examine the allegations he made about factories employing child labour and operating as sweatshops.  He should make himself fully aware of the facts in the different industries.  He should, above all, accept the advice of the people of Cork, so clearly indicated to him.  I met Deputy Coogan in Cork.  The people there have indicated that they want the nation to keep on the forward march and go ahead with the development of the country for the benefit of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possibly inevitable that in a debate like this, dealing with industry, Deputies' remarks should range over a very wide field.  In many cases, as the Chair <Col N="118" /> pointed out, some of the remarks were irrevelant.  I do not blame Deputies for that, but, time is short, and I shall, therefore, try to keep myself to the matters strictly to be discussed in this Supplementary Estimate.  They are two in number&mdash;the re-equipment and expansion grants and the industrial grants under the Industrial Grants Act.  The purpose of the introduction of the Supplementary Estimate was because there was an underestimation of the amount required under those two headings.  The Undeveloped Areas Act grants are not in question here at all.  The money voted was found to be ample in the circumstances of that particular Act.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Grants Act, as the House is aware, applies to what might be called the eastern half of the country, that part of the country outside the undeveloped areas.  In the course of my reply I may refer to one or two matters outside the strict limits in order to answer points raised by Deputies.  Deputy Cosgrave raised the point with regard to why the adaptation grants scheme would be in operation only up to 31st March, 1965.  This scheme was introduced under the Industrial Grants Act, 1963, just a year ago, and I said at that time that the scheme would be short lived for two reasons&mdash;the first being in order to bring home to industrialists the need for urgency in availing of these grants and, secondly, in order to ensure that any improvements they would carry out would be fully effective by the time we could contemplate meeting the fuller impacts of freer trade.</P>
      <P>In many cases it could take about two years from the time a grant is applied for under this adaptation and expansion scheme before the results of the application of the grant could be fully effective.  If grants under this scheme extended beyond 1965, then it might be possible that the industries concerned would not have made themselves fully competitive in free trade conditions.  That, therefore, is the reason for the urgency and for the limitation of the operation of this part of the Industrial Grants Act, 1963, to 31st March of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> Initially, I expressed my disappointment with the extent to which the Act was being availed of.  There was, perhaps, an understandable falling off in view of the failure of the British application for membership of the Common Market.  As a result of exhortations by the Government, and a realisation of the position by industrialists, the rate of applications for grants increased considerably in the meantime.  The realisation was, of course, that, irrespective of our becoming a member of the European Economic Community, there was a very definite and accelerated movement towards freer trade within the EEC bloc, within EFTA and, indeed, throughout the world.  It was realised that we could not isolate ourselves from this movement. We certainly could not insulate ourselves against the effects of the movement.  It was important, therefore, and still is, for industrialists to take every step open to them to ensure that their methods of operation will be as efficient, and their products as competitive, as they can possibly make them in the intervening years.</P>
    <P>I was very glad that Deputy Cosgrave mentioned, in a constructive and objective way, the suggestion that there was anything in our grants legislation especially favouring foreigners. I spoke at some length when I was introducing the 1963 Bills to the House, and before that too on a number of occasions, on this illusion, and it is only an illusion, and I gave particulars.  I want to assure the House again that there is no notice outside the offices of An Foras Tionscal that says: &ldquo;No Irish need apply&rdquo;.  The figures I gave a year ago will indicate what the true position is and I would have hoped it would have been sufficient then to indicate to the Deputies who believe otherwise that Irish nationals are treated as well as, and I think we can claim better than, those people from other countries who come to An Foras Tionscal looking for industrial grants.  I quote from columns 248-249, volume 203, of the Official Report of 28th May, 1963, where I said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" /> As at 31st December last, 67 grants had been approved under the Industrial Grants Act.  The number of promotions sponsored by foreign promoters was 33 and by Irish promoters 28 and six projects had joint Irish and foreign participation.</P>
    <P>That was roughly fifty-fifty.  I continue the quotation:</P>
    <P>Under the Undeveloped Areas Act, 123 grants were approved up to 31st December, 1962, the number of promotions sponsored by foreign promoters was 59; by Irish promoters, 58 and there were six projects with joint Irish and foreign participation.</P>
    <P>These figures prove without equivocation that allegations to the effect that foreigners are favoured by An Foras Tionscal are completely unfounded. The pattern has continued in that way since then.</P>
    <P>The next important relevant point raised was that by Deputy McQuillan when he asked whether the effect of the adaptation grants would be to reduce employment.  As I told the House, I do not in any way decide these grant applications, nor do I influence them.  I do, however, keep in touch with An Foras Tionscal in relation to all their grant decisions.  I have been watching particularly adaptation grant decisions and in most cases the stated effect of the adaptation carried out by the company with the assistance of this grant and with their own capital investment as well has been actually to increase employment. In some cases, the effect was to maintain employment.  The purpose of these grants is mainly to make these industries more competitive and the long-term effect of them will be to increase the employment given.  There is no truth in the suggestion that the overall pattern will be to create a net reduction in employment.  The contrary is the case.</P>

      <P>If what the Minister says is true, it will not be necessary to have these grants from EEC made available in Ireland.  The men <Col N="121" /> are being kept in employment and in fact more have been employed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have just said does not in any way conflict with the effect of the reports of the Committee on Industrial Organisation.  There were 26 individual industries surveyed and in many cases the Committee on Industrial Organisation said that, provided the industries concerned carried out the measures of adaptation and other measures that were recommended by the Committee, there was no reason why a reduction in employment should take place.  The Committee on Industrial Organisation said that with the adaptation measures carried out, there was a possibility in some cases and even perhaps the likelihood in a few cases of a reduction in employment. What I have said is that as regards most of the cases where adaptation grants have been applied, the likelihood is that employment will be increased.</P>
      <P>May I say in passing that the Deputy's reference to a firm in County Kildare as having applied for an adaptation grant which had the effect of reducing employment was dealt with by Deputy Briscoe in the House and I do not propose to pursue that?  In any event I think it would do no service to our promotional programme in industry to discuss in detail in this House the activities of individual firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the position altered since Deputy Briscoe spoke in the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information that the effect of an adaptation grant in that industry was to reduce employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of directing industries to particular areas, that, too, was examined by the Committee on Industrial Organisation and they recommended that consideration be given to the establishment of industrial zones so that the inducements now being given by the Government could be given to industries establishing themselves within these areas.  They did not recommend it as something that ought to be done but as something that ought to be examined.  That <Col N="122" /> is, of course, being examined, as was stated in the first publication on the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>It is not an easy thing to direct industry to a particular place.  The system we have at present is that the Government provide the inducements, create the climate in which industry can establish itself and thrive.  It is for the promoters to select the area best suited to the success of their industry.  Neither the Industrial Development Authority nor An Foras Tionscal direct people to particular areas.  The contrary is also true, notwithstanding suggestions that are often made, that neither the Industrial Development Authority nor An Foras Tionscal divert people away from particular areas.  No industrialist, coming to these bodies to discuss a project, in the first instance, and to apply for a grant, in the second instance, is influenced in any way by those bodies as to where they ought to set up their industry.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Deputy O'Sullivan, who is not here now, that the policy of attracting foreign investments to this country was influenced in no way by the Industrial Grants Act of 1956. The concept of industrial grants was first introduced into our legislation in 1952 in the Undeveloped Areas Act. Immediately after and as a result of the passing of this Act, there came a number of inquiries from foreigners and later a number of investments by foreigners in Irish industry.  The 1956 Industrial Grants Act simply applied the facilities of industrial grants to the other part of the country outside the undeveloped areas but limited the amount of the grant in each case to £50,000 and also to new industries. The Taoiseach criticised that Act at the time as not going far enough and the results of its operation proved he was right.  The Industrial Grants Act has been amended twice since and the facilities given under it have been extended in many important respects.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much else of relevance to the debate that I have not mentioned.  However, in relation to what Deputy Colley said about employing foreign architects, by and <Col N="123" /> large, the grants given by An Foras Tionscal are availed of by industrialists who employ Irish contractors and Irish architects.  In some cases they employ their own architects but they are encouraged by An Foras Tionscal in every way not only to employ Irish contractors and Irish professional personnel in the building industry but to use as far as possible Irish materials, and that has been the experience of An Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <P>There was a mention of what we are doing in relation to re-employment, re-training, and redundancy.  At present, a report from a committee set up to deal especially with that subject is being examined.  When the proper time comes, action will be taken by the Government on the recommendations in that report.</P>
    <P>I regret I have not had any more time to answer all the points raised by Deputies but I think I have answered the principal ones.</P>

      <P>I received a notification from the Chair, as did some other Deputies who had their names to amendments, that my amendment was ruled out of order because it would impose a charge on State funds.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill, the congested areas are those already prescribed by law.  The Deputy will find them in the Second Schedule to the Bill.  They comprise: Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo; the portion of the county of Clare comprising the former rural districts of Ballyvaughan, Ennistymon, Kilrush, Scariff, Tulla and Killadysert; and the portion of West Cork comprising the former rural districts of Bantry, Castletown, Schull and Skibbereen.  These were laid down under the 1909 Land Act.  As the Deputy appreciates, there is a section <Col N="133" /> enabling the Minister to bring in, in addition to these already defined congested areas, a declaration that any part of the country is a congested area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of the congested areas does not differ from the former definition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not from the congested districts as they are defined by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that, apart from the districts to which he has referred, there are other great pockets of congestion which are equally as congested as those defined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very reason for another section in the Bill to enable the Minister to bring in any portion as a congested area.  For the first time, that is being written into our law.  We felt that, outside the existing congested districts as defined, there are pockets of congestion in different parts of the country.  That is why we have this section giving power to the Minister from time to time to schedule any further pocket of congestion outside the areas set out in the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister see any danger in this definition that the provisions of the Bill and of the Land Acts generally will be directed towards the acquisition of land in the congested areas as such rather than in the areas outside the congested areas where the land is really available?  I think the present method whereby the Minister is enabled to define what a congested area is and has discretion as regards the type of land is a most unsatisfactory method of dealing with the definition of congestion.  That should be widened to include the congested areas in every county and it should be decided at a certain stage what a congested area is.  Let every county where there is congestion be so described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4, subsection (2), sets out more or less, but in a very loose way, how the Minister will <Col N="134" /> define a congested area.  The Minister is going to take into account the size of holding and the type of farming to be carried on.  What would be the Minister's reaction to an area which was once an area of smallholdings&mdash; and, in fact, still is&mdash;but where the majority of the smallholders have now vacated their houses and locked them up?  Should the Minister not take that fact into account&mdash;that the majority of holdings in an area are either derelict or vacant because they are too small to keep a family or the owners are in England or America, some of them perhaps hoping to come back and resettle after they have earned some money?  I do not think it is sufficient to take into account the size of the holding only.  That could be very misleading. An area could be called a deserted area when, in fact, it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>What will the Minister require before him to make an order declaring a new congested area?  From my experience, there are pockets of great congestion in every county, even in Meath.  On what information will the Minister make an order declaring a congested area?  Will he give us some more information in relation to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true, as Deputy Flanagan has suggested, that there are probably congested areas to be found in every county in Ireland.  I have no doubt that if one went into the highways and byways, one could get the odd village or area in which there is congestion.  But there must be an order of priority; first things must come first.  That is why I adopted the definition of congested areas from the 1909 Act to start off with.  These are the areas of the most intense congestion we have, the areas which were down through the years regarded by all and sundry, even in the old Congested Districts Board days, as being the areas of most intense congestion and the areas that should first be dealt with from the point of view of giving relief to those who live there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the counties outside those specified here are concerned, I have no doubt that when this section comes to be discussed I shall have many <Col N="135" /> Deputies from different parts of the House asking that their counties be included.  It is as well for me to anticipate this argument by giving the reasoning I am giving now.  Under this Bill, many things will happen which did not happen previously.  We have the new type of holding to which we aspire, the new type of division, the new provision in respect of pockets of congestion enabling people to solve their own congestion and so forth.  It is only in the working out of this Bill that the Land Commission officials will get the necessary experience to enable them to advise the Minister as to what areas must be brought in step by step.  It will take some time, for instance, to build up the necessary organisation and staff to deal with the provisions I am asking the House to enable the Land Commission to bring into force under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I thought that the best way of dealing with this matter&mdash;and certainly it is quite obvious to the Deputies who are familiar with this problem&mdash;was to start with the areas where we know there is intense congestion, the areas that always were regarded as the congested areas, and, from time to time, as the Land Commission get geared for the job to enable them to advise the Minister, to bring in another pocket of congestion in any particular county in accordance with the experience that they may derive.</P>
    <P>The point was raised by Deputy Blowick about deserted houses on holdings that the Land Commission have already dealt with.  The answer is that any holding that is not up to the new standard, whether they got additions before from the Land Commission or not or whether they were re-arranged before by the Land Commission or not, will come in under this Bill and if these people are within the distance qualification of land to be divided they are entitled to get an addition or to be considered for an addition.</P>
    <P>In many cases, particularly a number of years ago, the Land Commission, depending upon what land was available, were bringing people up to perhaps £4 or £5 valuation and then <Col N="136" /> vesting the holdings and writing them off and, as Deputy Blowick well knows, once they were vested and once there had been a re-arrangement scheme you had no business coming to the Land Commission for improvement works or anything else.  They regarded themselves as having finished with that area, townland or village.</P>
    <P>In many of these cases, by present day standards, those units are completely uneconomic.  It is true that in respect of some of them the people have gone.  One of the purposes of this Bill is to stabilise the rural population that is on the land and in the congested areas where there are these deserted or vacant holdings&mdash;there are other sections of this Bill that deal with this very point&mdash;they are going to be taken over to try to build up the land structure for the people left in these congested areas.  Whether, as I have said, they had already got Land Commission additions or not, the aim is, in so far as the land that is available goes, to bring them up to the new concept of a family farm in this day and age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask only one question.  In the definitions section for the definition of &ldquo;congested area&rdquo; one is referred to section 4 and the Minister has told us that the Second Schedule contains the congested areas &mdash;Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, parts of Clare and parts of West Cork.  I am informed by the Minister that these were scheduled as congested areas in 1909.  Does the Minister see any case, or has he any evidence before him to show, that any of these places need not now be deemed to be a congested area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Big parts of some of them, for instance, Sligo and Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Sligo and Roscommon, yes.  I gather that areas that are in congested areas have preference in the allocation of land.  Surely if there were a congested area in, say, Offaly or Meath or some place like that it would be unfair that somebody in part of, say, Mayo, in what is now not considered a congested area, would get <Col N="137" /> preference over somebody living in a congested area in Laois, Offaly or Meath?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Corish will consider the vast section of our seaboard that is comprised in this Schedule I think he will do some rethinking on this question.  There is the whole of Donegal, the whole of Galway, the whole of Kerry, the whole of Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon and the whole of Sligo as well as portions of Clare and portions of West Cork. That comprises a very big stretch of our country and these are the areas in which the intense congestion is.</P>
      <P>One of the main purposes of these sections is to give priority to these counties on the question of migration because in many of these counties you still have the hard core of intense congestion that the Land Commission or even their predecessors, the Congested Districts Board, failed to solve. The easier jobs have been dealt with. The estates that were easier of re-arrangement have been dealt with. As I have been pointing out, most of those that were easily solved have already been dealt with and in the main the rundale estates that are left in these congested counties are the hard core of the congestion.  There are cases which have proved, in fact, to be insoluble up to the moment for one reason or another mainly, perhaps, because the people either would not agree to a scheme or would not agree to migrate out of these areas, and so on.</P>
      <P>There are some powers being taken in this Bill by way of inducement to try to solve this hard core of rundale estates and it is only in the counties mentioned in the Schedule to this Bill, as far as my knowledge goes, that there are rundale estates left in this country, only in these intensely congested counties, and I am sure if Deputies think about this matter they will agree that in the order of priority of things these must be dealt with first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is power being taken for the first time here to schedule congested areas in any part of the country and it is the intention, at all events, of the Land Commission that immediately they get near to the job their officials <Col N="138" /> will report to them, no matter in what county they are working, if there is a pocket of congestion.  They will report to them to have it scheduled and they propose to bring this in or advise the Minister to bring this in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Corish's point was that even in the listed congested counties in the Second Schedule there would be areas, some large, some small, that are comfortable or well off and, even though in a congested county, could scarcely be described as congested areas.  Such areas do exist and Deputy Corish's fear was that simply because a county was listed as a congested county these comfortable or well off areas, whatever you like to call them, within the congested counties, would get preference or priority and still another slice of the cake, regardless of congestion in non-listed counties.  Is that the point?  I think the Minister missed Deputy Corish's point.  I put it that it is a very cogent one, in this connection at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was anxious to hear from the Minister.  He did tell us that these congested districts were defined in 1909.  Does it not speak badly for the Land Commission that the same congestion exists in these areas in 1964 as existed in 1909? Further, is it not possible that the Government of the time may have had reasons for leaving out certain areas which were congested areas but in respect of which there was sufficient pull at the time to bring them out of the scope of congested areas?  Further, the Minister must agree that in parts of Wicklow, parts of Monaghan and parts of Laois, as well as other areas, there is equally as great congestion as exists in the counties outlined in the Second Schedule.</P>
      <P>That is why I feel that the time has come for complete reconsideration of the congested areas.  There are many districts which can be described as congested areas.  Steps should be taken to see that they are given the same treatment under this Bill as will be given to the areas already defined as congested areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something <Col N="139" /> which I think could have been done in the Bill and perhaps the Minister could consider it.  Deputy Corish pointed out that whole counties put down here are described as being congested districts.  It is true that many portions of these counties are not congested. As a matter of fact, we find areas in East Donegal with land as good as, if not better, than we find in County Meath, and the same applies to other counties &mdash; perhaps, Galway and Mayo.  Should opportunity not have been taken to do what has been done here with Clare and West Cork, to put down portions of these counties rather than have the whole county designated?  In Meath, for instance, we have Meath Hill, Drumconrath, Newcastle, Oldcastle &mdash; the Minister knows that area &mdash; where many farmers are trying to exist on very small farms.  All the land they have is an acre here and two acres somewhere else.  It is scattered all over the place.  That would be comparable with the position in the real congested areas.  Occasionally, the Department take the people out and give them a transfer holding somewhere else.  I think an attempt should be made by the Land Commission to designate all congested areas in the country, and take out of the congested districts the areas not so congested.</P>
      <P>That is one point, but there is a second point, and I wonder has the Minister given any consideration to it. As we all know, hundreds of people have been brought from outside the county into County Meath.  The first group of people who came, actually the first 200 or 300, came to farms of around 15 to 20 acres, some of which is pretty bad land.  Where do they stand in relation to congests in the areas they came from?  They have now neighbouring farms of 40 to 45 acres.</P>

      <P>It would be hard to designate them as congests because Meath is not included in the Bill.  It is a dangerous situation and I think the Minister should take cognisance of it.  The position is that we have the <Col N="140" /> local smallholders who were there when those people were brought in first and who did not get any additional holding.  There is a feeling of unrest among those people and the Minister might as well know that, in Meath, the ideal holding is one of 40 to 45 acres.  Endeavours should be made to achieve this whenever land becomes available in the area.  The early migrants and the smallholders, who were there at the time, instead of getting an increased viable holding, might now find that further congests might be brought to that area.  I think that is the main objection to the Bill. The result will be that those people will still be left in a semi-congested condition.  I do not know whether the Minister can do anything about this, but I seriously suggest that he should look at it.  If something is not done about it, the last situation could be much worse than the first.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to say if there is any objection from this point of view to dealing with the matter on the basis suggested by Deputy Tully.  That was the suggestion I was about to make to the Minister.  I think the Minister might take it for granted that there is no Deputy on any side of the House who wants to see any of those old-time congested districts, if you like to call them that, taken out of the legislation. I think everyone recognises that in all of these old-time congested districts congestion still exists.  The Minister indicated, in reply to Deputy Corish, that in some of them the congestion is now appreciably less than it was and it would seem to me, if you like, a more modern approach to this question, if the Minister were not simply to accept the 1909 definition but if he were to look at the matter from the point of view of the realities of the situation as in 1964.  I think he would be doing a good day's work to come into the House with a new list of scheduled areas which would be realistic, having regard to the 1964 situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point which was first put by Deputy Corish, and then by Deputy Blowick, is, I think, the fear that exists under the definition as it stands at the <Col N="141" /> moment.  Anyone in the areas set out in the Second Schedule would, <i>prima facie,</i> seem to be entitled to more favourable consideration, to put it that way, no matter in what part of a particular county he lives, as against a person living in another county which is not in the scheduled list.  It may be that the Minister's reply to that will be that it is not scheduled now, but under paragraph (b) of section 4, he has power to add it.  Most Deputies would feel happier if the Minister's approach were to try to give us in this Bill a 1964 definition of congested districts, basing it more or less on the last two portions of the Second Schedule.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall just look down this list quickly.  Apparently the Minister in this Bill has only found congests in places like Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, a portion of County Clare and a portion of West Cork.  The rest of the country is completely disregarded and no proper recognition is given to the fact that there are many congested areas throughout the Twenty-Six Counties apart from the places mentioned. It is very painful for a number of small farmers in County Dublin or, indeed, in many other places when they see a large estate taken over by the Irish Land Commission and when the question of distributing that land is being considered the congests are <Col N="142" /> selected from the areas specified in the Bill.  They are given special priorities.</P>
      <P>There is a remarkable difference in the conditions available to persons removed from any of the specified places when it comes to the payment of rents and the conditions under which they hold their farms.  The other congests will be at a very great disadvantage if they do not come from some of these places.  Presumably the cost of purchasing the holdings into which these people are put is met by the taxpayers generally in every county but when it comes to the question of equal rights, only a specified number of citizens will get the privileges available under this Bill as listed in the Second Schedule.</P>
      <P>That is why I think the Minister, when considering amendments, should bring in one to ensure that smallholders, wherever they reside, will have equal rights regarding the distribution of holdings.  I have seen holdings taken over in County Dublin and given to migrants, while at the same time small farmers who know how to use the land in that area and know the conditions there, did not get any relief or assistance, although they were convenient to these large estates which were being divided by the Land Commission and could have used them to great advantage.  If a privilege is being given to people who are not resident within a short distance of these estates, at least a proportion of the estate should be made available to small farmers residing near them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises in that after getting the kick they got, I do not think the Minister should take them very seriously.  Whatever he might do or has done, at least his actions are to be much preferred to those of the Opposition who did nothing when they had a chance to do something.  Down in front of me is the former Minister for <Col N="143" /> Lands, Deputy Blowick.  I do not want to say anything dirty about him.  I shall let him go.  He never did anything when he was Minister.  I hope the present Minister, who comes from within a few miles of Deputy Blowick's native place, will long continue on the course he has now charted for himself.  If he does, he will do something worthwhile, not only for the West of Ireland but for the country in general.</P>
      <P>If anybody is to improve the land position, he must take drastic steps. The situation is completely unnatural. It is none of our making.  A situation was created years ago by foreign tyrants which we must undo.  They took drastic measures to chase us out of the midlands.  I do not happen to be one of those who came from the midlands.  I came from the north to fight against the British, unlike some of those who ran away from the midlands. If we are to rectify the position, we must send back to the midlands those who were chased out of it, whether we or they like it.  We must restore the balance.  We have a very low population in the midlands where there is the best land not only in Ireland but probably in the world.  It is rather amazing to hear somebody speak of Roscommon as a county which should be classified as a place where there is congestion. Many of the people in Roscommon have three holdings and are making no use of them and the sooner they are taken from them, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true that Roscommon is a congested area and neither is it true that only the Atlantic areas are congested. There are other areas just as much entitled to consideration as areas in Mayo, Galway and Kerry.  Very serious opposition has been met by people who have come from the west into the midlands but if you go into any town there and ask any trader who is his best customer, you will find it is the man who came in from the west. I often go out of my way to see these people and I have yet to find one man who has come up from the west and has failed.  Those who try to denigrate the people from the west are not honest or fair.  As a matter of fact, those who come from the west are, <Col N="144" /> and always have been, an example to the midland people and it is a pity the midland people would not follow their example.  If they did, they would soon become prosperous.</P>
    <P>We know what goes on.  Those people have land and by all kind of stratagems have succeeded in holding it.  That is not fair.  Any man who has 200 acres at present deserves to be dealt with.  I would allow a lazy midland man to have 200 acres but after that it is time to deal with him.  Those people do nothing with their land but spend their time at race meetings, weddings probably, funerals, dog-tracks and so on.  They have the effrontery to look down on the people from the west.  I say to the Minister the more people he will take from the west and the quicker he takes them, the better for the country generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be technical about this Bill but I suggest that many of the arguments or points that have been made could more suitably be discussed on sections 4, 5 and 12 rather than at this stage.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Blowick said, I did misunderstand Deputy Corish.  There is no question in this Bill of people in the congested areas having such a priority as would affect the Land Commission's work in non-congested areas. The purpose of section 4 is to define the areas to which section 5 relates. That is the loan scheme to help people to solve their own congestion problems. Section 7 is also relevant because that is the section under which future annuitants, outside the congested areas, will not get the benefit of the 50 per cent reduction.  But the ordinary Land Commission work in the non-congested counties will still continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no intention, as some Deputies would appear to think, that the work of the Land Commission should close down or be confined to the congested areas.  What Deputy Rooney states, that migrants are brought in and local congests ignored, is news to me.  From my experience as Minister for Lands, I cannot accept that it is so. All local congests within the distance limits laid down are considered before <Col N="145" /> any migrants are brought in.  In the division of an estate, the general rule is that, first, all old employees who are displaced must be dealt with; then the immediate congests within the distance limits are dealt with; and then, if any land is left over, the migrants are brought in.</P>
    <P>Standards have changed.  I found one rule in the Land Commission relating to the west of Ireland that when anyone acquired a valuation of £10, he was regarded as having an economic holding.  That day is now gone.  The standard practice of the Land Commission is the practice to which I have referred, that within the limit distance laid down, within a mile today&mdash;in former years, it went further&mdash;and according to the standards laid down for what was then called an uneconomic holding, suitable local congests are satisfied before bringing in migrants.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that you can find a very wide difference in the type of people living around an estate. Some of them may have a small piece of land and others have avocations or jobs.  It may well be that one applicant within the limit distance laid down is known to the Land Commission as an unsuitable person to whom to give land but, by and large, the practice which still obtains is that migrants are brought into these counties only after the needs of the local congests have been dealt with.</P>

      <P>On further sections of this Bill, Deputy Tully and others will be arguing as to what is an uneconomic holding.  Deputy Tully feels that people who have got an allotment of land with a labourer's cottage should get some land.  He would be happy with that if they got it at the expense of people from my part of the country. Deputy Flanagan would go further <Col N="146" /> and give land to all the landless men in the country, to all the deserving applicants.</P>

      <P>If we had enough land to go around, every Deputy would be glad to give land to everybody who deserves it, but our land is a limited quantity and we must have some system of priority as to those to whom we shall give it.  What I want to emphasise it that the purpose of section 4 is to define the areas to which section 5 applies.  This is a new enabling power under which the Land Commission can make a loan to a man so that he can solve his own congestion problem. That does not only apply to people in the congested areas.  My reply to Deputy Tully is that in due course we shall come to a section enabling the Minister to schedule any place as a congested area and once that is done, all these powers will apply to the new congested areas.</P>
      <P>That is a fair enough answer to the comments that have been made.  When I come to these sections, this matter will be debated at much greater length, but, as far as Land Commission intentions are concerned, the same work for the relief of congestion in the counties not scheduled under this Bill or the 1909 Act will go on.  They will deal with the congestion they find there, with the exception of the provisions of sections 4 and 5 of the Bill now before the House.</P>
      <P>The whole point of this Bill is to try to relieve congestion in the seaboard counties which, as Deputy Leneghan points out, is partly due to our history, to the Cromwellian dictum of: &ldquo;To Hell or to Connacht&rdquo;, and partly to the imbalance of population in our country.  Primarily, there is the question of rearranging our land structure to enable our people competitively to produce on the land in this day and age.  That is the primary objective of this Bill.  In places where there is rundale, two or three people may have to be taken out of it because that is the only way in which viable holdings can be arranged.</P>

I presume the Bill will be passed between now and summer and does the Minister hope to be in a position to give the House and the country a complete picture of the new areas which he proposes to declare congested districts? We all agree that there are parts of Monaghan, Wicklow, Laois and Carlow in which there is as great congestion as in any place defined in the 1909 Act.  Can the Minister assure us that before the end of the present year, the Land Commission will be able to present us, with some degree of accuracy, with an up-to-date picture of the situation?</P>

      <P>A number of places are mentioned here, such as Donegal, Galway, Laois and Mayo.  Everybody knows that Galway has very many large estates and farms but apparently every part of the county, whether it is the congested districts or the areas in which there are large estates, will have smallholders who will be entitled to get the advantage of this arrangement of paying only 50 per cent compared with those who must pay 100 per cent <Col N="148" /> of the rent.  If we are to live up to the purpose of this Bill, congested areas should be defined and we should not just include a whole county like Galway, which is the third or fourth largest county in Ireland, and say that anybody who comes out of that county will have an advantage over the smallholders of, say, North County Dublin.  There are scores of small farmers in Rush, County Dublin, living on six acres of land given to them by the Land Commission and when one sees these other people being given up to 45 acres, one wonders why a start should not be made in north County Dublin to relieve congestion.  We should be more specific in our definition of congested areas.  There are districts in Galway and in Mayo which are congested but in the Schedule the whole county is included and the advantages are available to anybody resident in any part of the whole county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to deal with the congestion problem.  To my mind, this problem has become aggravated very much and is now less easy of solution, due to modern decisions.  About 12 years ago there was an estimate of the maximum acreage of land which at any time could become available for the relief of congestion.  Side by side with that was the figure for congests.  There was not a hope even then of ever arriving at the stage at which we could relieve congestion 100 per cent. While the number of congests may have gone down, the decision now is to increase the allocation of land in order to make an economic holding and instead of bringing these congests up to 20 acres, it is now intended to have a 40 to 50 acre holding, if possible. That means that the holdings which would be available for the relief of congestion and the number of congests remains static.  That is a problem I see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the easiest type of congestion has been solved; in other words, those who are prepared to move have moved and those who want to stay where they are for various reasons have been left.  I think that we <Col N="149" /> should have another look at this.  If those people want to stay where they are, that is a problem in itself.  Their reasons for wanting to stay are many and varied.  They have the benefits of the social welfare code; they have the benefits of living along the coast and of the fishing industry; and they have the benefit of turbary, of lower rating and of lower valuation, all of which they are not prepared to sacrifice by going to other parts of the country where many of these benefits are not available.  In that event and having the overall picture of more production from our land, and better land usage, should we not consider local people around the estates which are to be divided?  Some people call these landless men; some call them conacre farmers; while I would call them the local users of land and whether they have small bits of their own or not they should be considered.  It is wrong to view this problem of congestion in the same way as it was viewed 15 or 20 years ago, and especially as it was viewed in 1909.</P>

We are creating two different classes of people who get land, those in the congested areas and those outside.  The Minister is now going to define the areas.  It must have been a very difficult position at all times because we all know that seeking land by land division is like taking a ticket in the Sweep because there is just not enough to go round. If we are to create a first-class and a second-class ticket at the whim and will of the Minister, I have the feeling that we shall be creating a political situation.

The other point is that there are pockets of congestion in the middle of County Meath or County Kildare and in places where one would imagine there would be no such areas as congested areas.  There are tiny pockets in townlands where congestion is very severe.  Because of the local economy that builds up, there is not the practice, when one needs help, as there is elsewhere of, say, going to work for the county council, even if one has a small farm as in the west, or it is not, shall we say, condoned here by the powers-that-be, apart from the farmers themselves.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I am surprised by some aspects of this discussion.  The Minister directs us to a definition at the beginning of the Bill and, when we look at that definition, we find it is a global, geographical list, drawn up in 1909, embracing, as it must, of necessity, congested and non-congested areas.  It looks as if the Minister purposely, or otherwise, did not do his homework.  Surely it should be an easy matter for him to provide the House with a list of congested areas all over the country?  They are available in the Land Commission. They are available parish by parish. It should be a simple matter for the Minister to give a list for the whole country instead of taking unto himself the power of scheduling an area, for reasons which he, and he alone, may know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears now that if people in the congested areas will have two advantages over those outside them.  First, they will have financial advantages and, secondly, the reduction in the annuities.  I gather from the Minister <Col N="151" /> that they will have no specific advantages over the congests in the nonscheduled areas from the point of view of priority in the allocation of land. If they had, it would be highly objectionable. In my constituency, we have quite an amount of congestion.  That may not appear to be the position to the average Dubliner or the person from the midlands who regards Tipperary as a very good county. It has its good areas but all around Thurles, parts of North Tipperary, certain areas in Waterford, the Nire Valley, the Glen of Aherlow, we have large areas of congestion.  I should not like to think this Bill was framed in such fashion as to ensure a species of partition for the purpose of giving some preferential treatment to those west of the Shannon as against those living under equally difficult conditions in my county and other counties.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give me an assurance, at any rate, that he is not attempting to solve the congestion on the western seaboard at the expense of congests all over the rest of the country.  I have every sympathy with the people along the western seaboard but my first loyalty is to my own constituents.  There must be some measure of justice in this.  Because the Minister comes from the west, I trust he does not feel that that gives him the right to solve the problems in his own and neighbouring counties at the expense of the midlands, the eastern part of the country and the south.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now quite clear to me how wise I was in lifting the definition of congested areas out of the 1909 Act.  It is quite obvious from some of the comments by Deputies on the opposite benches that they are quite prepared to attribute some fantastic and political motives to the provision of some of the sections in this Bill.  Had I not taken the definition in the 1909 Act, had I tried to define such areas myself, I can well imagine the arguments I should have heard here and the points raised by the Deputies opposite.</P>
      <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan asked me if I could define congested areas in a year's time, or two years' time, or when, in point of time.  I could give the Deputy a legal definition right here and now.  I can lift it from the Constitution: I would say the whole of Ireland, its islands and territorial waters.  I am sure there is some congestion somewhere in every single county.  The point is that the intensely congested counties that are scheduled under this Bill are the areas which the people who examined this problem down through the years have agreed should be dealt with first in order of national priority.  From my own knowledge of the counties set out in the Schedule, I have no doubt at all that there is a much more intense congestion problem in these counties than there is in any other part of Ireland. I have no doubt at all about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only in these counties we have a rundale problem, a type of congestion created by intermixed holdings with different people owning every second or third field.  These conditions do not obtain in other counties.  The scheduling of a congested area under this Bill, which will be done by ministerial order&mdash;we shall be asking the House to give us that power&mdash;will be done on the report of the Land Commission inspectors.  This is a matter with which the inspectors are competent to deal.  They make these reports about congestion regularly in the ordinary course of their work.  There is not a county in which the Land Commission are not doing work of one kind or another.  I could not, and neither could my officials, determine <Col N="153" /> these congested areas <i>in vacuo</i>, just picking out at random a number of congested areas.</P>
    <P>This is a job that will have to be done very carefully and meticulously. It will have to be related to up-to-date conditions.  As I pointed out, there were particular standards, 30, 40 and 50 years ago, with regard to what comprised an economic holding.  Today, there are different standards; we are aiming now at what we call the family farm.  In many cases in which schemes of rearrangement took place in the past, the units are, by modern standards, unrealistic.  Times have changed and this is a matter that must be assessed in the light of conditions existing from 1964 onwards.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of getting the Land Commission geared to put into force the new powers for which we are asking in this Bill, both in and outside the congested areas.  That will take some time but they will get instructions and they will go ahead and compile in each county the areas they consider should be scheduled as a congested pocket under this Bill. Once they have done that, the Minister, whoever he may be, will undoubtedly exercise the power I am taking under this Bill to schedule the congested area.  Then the people of that area, be it large or small, will be entitled to the benefit of this Bill, just as if that portion of their county were going into this Schedule.</P>
    <P>The main difference between the counties outside the Schedule of this Bill and the congested counties is the application of sections 4 and 5 of this Bill, the sections that deal with a loan of money that is here provided for the man who solves his own congestion problem by migrating.  Apart from these two sections of the Bill, the people outside the congested counties will be entitled to the same help from the Land Commission as they are already getting.  There is no order of priority being established. The Land Commission, as they are in a position to do so, will be compiling these registers of areas that should be scheduled under this Bill.  This is the first time that such a power was taken <Col N="154" /> in any Land Bill brought before this House.</P>
    <P>I foresaw that somebody would allege that this power might be used for political purposes by some Minister. Notwithstanding that, I felt that if I did not propose that such a power should be there for a Minister for Lands to schedule a particular area, I would be faced probably with amendments from many Deputies asking that their county be included in the Schedule to this Bill as a congested area.  It would be impracticable to do so because I am satisfied, as I have already said, that there are pockets in many counties on the east coast as well as on the west coast in which there are congests.  From a practical point of view, thinking of the necessary increase of staff in order to operate this Bill and thinking of how much they can take on at a time, I believe the only solution is to take the power here and let the Minister be advised, as the Land Commission officials in their operations throughout the country are able to decide and advise, that a particular townland, parish or other portion of any county should be scheduled.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies raised the point as to how we would define an area to which this section would be applied so as to include it with the congested districts. It is a very simple matter where there is in any townland or in any county a pocket of congestion.  Where the land units do not measure up to the family farm we now envisage, and where there are a number of landowners, these smaller units would, I am sure, be suggested to the Minister for inclusion under this section as a congested area.</P>
    <P>I can well visualise that in different counties as the work proceeds, it will take a considerable time for the divisional inspector and the inspector in charge of the local men to make up their minds as to whether certain townlands in their county should be scheduled as a congested area.  On the other hand, I believe that within the next 18 months, once this Bill becomes law, I shall have some recommendations that different counties be scheduled and I can assure the House that where such a recommendation <Col N="155" /> comes, if it can be implemented, it will give me great personal pleasure to schedule those areas recommended as coming within the four walls of this Bill.</P>
    <P>However, scheduling a townland or a congested area outside of what is in this Bill entails further planning on the part of the Land Commission.  It may well be that in regard to some areas that are scheduled, it will be necessary to move tenants out of that area.  Again we are up against the question of priority.  There are only a limited number of migrant holdings available.  I would say that taking good years with bad, it works out at an average of about 100 migrants a year throughout the country and, of course, the more areas that are scheduled, the greater will be the demand on the pool of land available for migration.  However, immediately the Land Commission are in a position to do so, they will get instructions as soon as may be to notify the Minister if there are portions in their bailiwicks they would suggest should be scheduled under the Bill.  In so far as we can do so and have the staff to do it, the Land Commission will take all these areas in the different counties outside the areas that are included in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Minister but I put a question to him about certain areas that are absolutely dotted with small registered holdings but which are not inhabited.  I take it what the Minister will do is to ask inspectors to report on certain areas or consider representations by Deputies, county councillors and others who suggest that a certain area is, in their opinion, congested and should be scheduled.  Subsection (2) of section 4 says:</P>
      <P>When making an order under subsection (1) of this section, the Minister shall have regard to the size of the holdings, the quality of the land and the type or types of farming carried on in the area to be declared a congested area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot generalise about the size of holdings <i>per se.</i> It depends very largely on the type and quality of the land and the location of the land.  Deputy Rooney rather amused me by his talk about the terrible plight of small farmers on six acres of land in County Dublin.  I assume he has in mind some of what I call the merchant prince farmers of Rush, Lusk and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who are sitting on goldmines right beside a very lucrative market in Dublin city.  Four, five, six or eight acres of land there would be as good as and possibly better than 150 acres of land in the part of the country from which I come.  One cannot generalise on acreage <i>per se,</i> without taking into consideration the type of land and its location in relation to a market.  What would be an economic unit, say, in Lusk or Rush would certainly be anything but an economic unit on the island of Achill, in Ballycroy, or some of those remote places in the west.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick spoke about the definition in section 4 (2).  The size of the holding, the quality of the land and the type or types of farming carried out are what are in mind.  I do not know what Deputy Blowick has in mind when he mentions vacated holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>My worry is that you might get a Land Commission inspector wasting his time on an area where land division would produce very little good effect.  Take, for instance, a thinly populated area in relation to which, on paper, he could show he was justified simply because the area was full of small but vacated holdings.  I think the Minister knows the type of area I am referring to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="157" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand now.  That is primarily a matter of administration. If I were Minister and got reports of this kind and saw that some inspector was engaged in the type of work mentioned by Deputy Blowick, I should certainly ask the Land Commission to put a stop to it quickly and lively.  Under the new and additional work and worry the Land Commission staff will have as a result of this Bill, I suppose that to say they will have a full-time job is the understatement of the year.  If they are fully to exercise the powers given here to try to induce the recalcitrant landholders who hold up division schemes and to try to induce the old people to take pensions and give up their holdings in order to put through the rearrangement schemes contemplated, they will have plenty to do without wasting their time in the way Deputy Blowick suggests.</P>
      <P>That brings up a matter that will no doubt be argued again on another section of this Bill.  To anticipate this, because I have no doubt I shall have it from many sides of the House before the Committee Stage is finished, the order of priority of the division of land and who will get land is a matter of administration.  The classes who will get land are neither being widened nor contracted in any way under the provisions of this Bill.  I know from experience that there is a special problem in Donegal.  Indeed, Donegal people are unique by virtue of the fact that you will not get people from West Donegal to migrate to East Donegal and they generally take a very poor view of asking them to migrate out of Donegal at all.  That is their privilege.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a system in Donegal, as Deputy P. O'Donnell knows, under which, by tradition, many people down through the years take lettings of land, maybe an acre or two, for the purpose of producing seed potatoes. Indeed, down through the years there, even young fellows, I understand, for pocket money, take an acre or two by way of letting to produce seed potatoes or some other crop.  There is a position in Donegal that does not obtain, I think, in most other counties but at the same time you will find <Col N="158" /> some deserving landless men in every part of this country.</P>
    <P>The very same case has been made to me by Deputies representing dairying counties where men with no land take land and milk a number of cows and have farm machinery.  Perhaps there are not so many of that type outside Donegal who make their livelihood in this way.  There is a special problem in this way.  Once the Land Commission extend their practice of the order of priorities which already exists, once we widen that and bring in landless men&mdash;they are quite entitled under the existing law to give land to these people &mdash; we can give landless men land and, in fact, have done so but they must necessarily come down to the bottom of the list.</P>
    <P>The very first purpose of the Congested Districts Board and the Land Commission was the relief of congestion, that is, the relief of the people in the land slums of this country, people on uneconomic units of land, and that must continue to be so. Reasonable Deputies will still see the wisdom of the policy that while we have all these congests in the country, they must, in so far as is possible, be dealt with first and they must have what I would call the first priority on the land pool that is available.</P>
    <P>If I may anticipate the argument just touched on by Deputy Blowick&mdash;I have no doubt other Deputies representing other parts of the country will make the same case, that landless men should be considered&mdash;the short answer is that there is nothing in this Bill to prevent landless men from getting land if it is there for them.  That is purely a matter of administration, a matter of the priorities established by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Whenever the Estimate for the Department of Lands comes before the House, Deputies can make their case and can argue to extend or to change the order of priorities that now exists and to change the practice that now exists.  This Bill does not affect the position, one way or the other, as to who will be given land. I would ask Deputies not to waste the time of the House in arguing <Col N="159" /> something which is not in the Bill and does not arise at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question in relation to the peculiar type of land user that has been going on and has become known as the Lagan Valley system?  Does the Minister envisage that any part of the Bill will change or upset that system, or does he consider it desirable to do so?  The Minister knows the system I refer to and which Deputy Cunningham referred to&mdash;conacring under a system that is not employed in any other part of the country. When I was Minister for Lands I made the experiment of taking up some of the land that had been conacred in that valley for years and years to find that those who had been conacring it and were willing to pay high prices for it would not take a present of the land from the Land Commission.  I must say it dumb-founded me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I know we have this Lagan Valley system, and I might say the system in Donegal has given me considerable worry because I have found that where the Land Commission have taken land, they had, in fact, to provide for people who were traditionally taking lettings and there was no place for these people to find land, once the Land Commission had moved in.  This is the problem peculiar to Donegal; in fact, it is widespread in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no other county in Ireland that has produced the same type of problem.  I do not see any easy answer to it for the reasons I have given.  Again, it is a question of internal policy for the Land Commission whether or not they should try to devise some special set of rules to meet the circumstances thrown up by the Donegal people.  I have given the matter some thought but have not yet got anybody in my Department who <Col N="160" /> has been able to come up with what I would call a satisfactory solution to the particular problem we have in Donegal.  Generally speaking, I do not think we have what has been termed the Lagan Valley problem in any other part of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that in every county there are cases of people who have been taking small portions of estates for tillage and for the grazing of a cow or a few cattle for upwards of 20 years who have been dispossessed by the Land Commission, their stock turned out on the road and given no land whatever. Surely that situation is widespread.</P>

They mostly live in labourers' cottages and you will find as many as three or four members of a family taking plots. In the old days, it was for flax; now it is for seed potatoes, and sometimes ware potatoes and seed oats.  I would be sorry to see these men victimised by this Bill and I am glad to see the Minister is conscious of their position. It would be a tragedy were he not, because those people might become dispossessed of the lands they have been taking on conacre under the 11-month system.</P>
      <P>What happens is that farmers in Donegal let out portions of their farms for rotation tilling.  A farmer who traditionally produces root crops and who is himself not anxious to go into seed or grain crops, will let out portions of his farm, not simply to procure money from the letting but in order that the land may be rotated.  He does not do it himself&mdash;the conacre men do it for him.</P>

      <P>The fact is that there is prevalent in this country ideas regarding the influences that might be brought to bear relative to land which may be available for division and the subsequent dividing of it.  It is only rarely do the occasions arise in which some frank, honest statement is made relative to the operation of the Land Commission. I can recall with pleasure the occasion on which Deputy Gerald Boland, having retired from the office of Minister for Lands, made clear in this House how he regarded that position.  He felt it was due to the country as a whole to realise the impartiality of the Land Commission and their staff.  Here we are giving powers to the Minister which, if not abused, nevertheless, can create and will create an impression in the minds of gullible people that there are influences that can be brought to bear politically on the political head of the Ministry the Minister now occupies.</P>
      <P>This is a very serious departure.  No matter how it may be presented as being a logical way of dealing with this problem, nevertheless, there is no doubt that the opinion will be held, and held strongly, by numerous people in a weak position that there can be influence brought to bear, because section 4 provides that the Minister may from time to time make an order declaring such an area to be a congested area.  Who are the people who will assist the Minister in determining the areas to be scheduled?  What process will be followed?  By whose recommendation will the Minister be influenced on the decision he will ultimately take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred by intervention to the fact that he was conscious of the limitation on the pool of land available to those seeking allotment.  It is rather belated for him to express concern <Col N="164" /> at the limitation on the pool of land available.  Much water has flowed under the bridge since it was first brought to his notice that the pool of land available was being rapidly reduced by the purchase of land by foreigners.  For a long time a very deaf ear was turned to the demands of the people up and down the country who wanted to have some control over the position that land, which could have been made available to the congests about whom we are expressing so much sympathy, was no longer available.  The people view with alarm the amount of land not alone passing out of the hands of the Land Commission but out of the hands of Irish nationals.</P>

We are dealing now with the definition section.  It does not give any power to the Minister for Lands at all.  It only assigns certain meanings to certain words.

I was glad to hear from the Minister that he is now <Col N="165" /> prepared to make a list and a map of congested areas all over the country, so that the people resident in those areas may be considered congests within a limited meaning and not within the meaning of the Second Schedule.  In the Second Schedule the Minister mentioned portion of County Clare.  He was able to pick out portion of Clare instead of putting down the whole county.  Possibly, that is the kind of district he will pick out in the various congested areas throughout the country.  Similarly, instead of putting down the whole of County Cork, or even the western portion of it, he selected certain districts there.  There, again, is an example of where he has put the microscope on areas that were to get special facilities.</P>

I am quite sure that if this section were not in the Bill Deputy O'Sullivan and a number of his colleagues would insist on a section like it going into the Bill to enable the congestion problem in any particular county or area to be brought in and, conversely, I am quite sure that if Deputy O'Sullivan put down an amendment to take away this power from the Minister for Lands he would not get a dozen Deputies to support him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like <Col N="168" /> to ask the Minister what objection he has to the laying of the rules and regulations made under this section before each House of the Oireachtas? I feel that a matter of such great importance as, say, the making of an order declaring any particular district to be a congested area or, indeed, any order made under this Bill should be placed before each House of the Oireachtas.  The House would be interested to know what objection the Minister might have to that course.  I strongly recommend that the Minister should consider placing these rules and regulations before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that section 3 of the Land Act, 1933, empowers the Minister for Lands with the concurrence of a Committee consisting of the Judicial Commissioner, the Secretary of the Land Commission and a Lay Commissioner, after consultation with the President of the Incorporated Law Society, to make rules.  There is no provision in the 1933 Act for the laying of these rules when made before the Houses of the Oireachtas nor is there any provision in this Bill for the laying of such rules before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Minister is also aware that section 3 of the 1933 Land Act provides that the Secretary of the Department of Lands, as having a special position distinct from the other Commissioners on the Rules Committee, represents the Civil Service side and a Civil Service outlook and that section 3 of the 1933 Act emphasises the undesirability of having the Secretary as a Commissioner, as he is intended to hold a view different from the rest of his fellow Commissioners.</P>
      <P>That is why I feel that in this Bill there should be provision for the laying of the various rules and regulations by the Minister before the Houses of the Oireachtas for the purpose of giving Deputies notice and information which is very often difficult to obtain when these rules and regulations are not laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I highly recommend to the Minister that in an effort to secure speedy passage of the Bill and co-operation <Col N="169" /> from all sides he might meet us on some point.  Our request that the rules he makes be laid before each House of the Oireachtas is, indeed, a very reasonable one and I, therefore, recommend it to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot accede in this instance to the Deputy's request although I can assure him that any submission or argument that is made in the course of the debate on this Bill that I consider would improve the Bill or would be workable will get my wholehearted consideration.</P>
      <P>In certain statutes powers are taken to create rules that need not be laid on the Table of the House.  As I am sure the Deputy is well aware, the only effect of laying rules on the Table of the House, as we call it here, is to enable Deputies to put down a motion within 21 days.  The only practical effect of providing that any statutory rules be laid on the Table of both Houses, as I have explained to the House, is this procedural motion that Deputies can table to amend or annul within 21 days, or whatever the specified time is, under our rules of procedure here.</P>
      <P>Now the very same procedure is available, in a different way, to Deputies by way of motion where the particular statute does not prescribe that they must be laid on the Table of the House.  Under this section, Deputies can put down a motion criticising the rule or calling for its revocation or amendment.  Deputies will have that right under the ordinary rules of debate in this House.  The only real argument, I suppose, that would be suggested by some Deputies is that rules might be made and, because they are not laid on the Table of the House, may be in existence for some time, without coming to the notice of Deputies.  If there is anything wrong with the rules, knowing how close Deputies are in touch with their Dáil work and their constituents, which will be made and which will affect a constituent in a local area, I am quite sure we shall hear about it quick and lively from the Deputy concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some rules&mdash;for instance, <Col N="170" /> the Land Bond Order&mdash;which must be laid on the Table of the House.  It is envisaged that these regulations will be on questions of procedure, on technical matters of finance that must be dealt with inter-Departmentally by the Land Commission and the Minister for Finance.  With regard to the particular rule, to which Deputy Flanagan referred under the 1933 Act, questions of procedure and the rule-making authority, I can assure Deputies that it is a very good job it has not been laid on the Table of the House.</P>
    <P>I have been, and my people have been, quite a long time trying to hammer out new legal machinery for the Land Commission.  I had to negotiate with the Incorporated Law Society and we had several meetings to try to hammer out a workable procedure, a procedure that would be acceptable to them on behalf of the legal profession.  It went on for a very long time.  We have, in fact, achieved agreement.  Some new rules have been made in agreement with them and with those others concerned, including the rule-making authority itself.  If I have to come back in here, and Deputies knock this down, agreement having been reached, I am afraid we will never reach finality on that point at all.</P>
    <P>What is contemplated here are rules of procedure, not technical matters or finance, and these may have to change from time to time, depending on different circumstances, maybe until money is available for a particular job, and so on.  I think it would be a cumbersome procedure, for what is envisaged here, if we had to come to the House and lay the rules on the Table of the House.  I think the real answer to what Deputy Flanagan has in mind is that we have a satisfactory procedure in regard to rules which may be made under this section in that Deputies have a right to put down a motion to amend, annul or criticise them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said if the document went before the House, it might be knocked by the House and all his trouble would have gone for nothing.  Surely that is suggesting that the agreement reached is one which would not be accepted by the House and the only way to get away with it is to let nobody know about it? I am afraid I have to agree with Deputy Flanagan that it is a rather peculiar thing that the documents are not laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is no point in the Minister saying that Deputies can put down a motion objecting to them. How will any of us know that those rules have been brought in, in order to bring in a motion within the statutory period?  While people down the country, whom we represent, would very soon, when they hear about them, bring them to our notice, if we do not hear of them, how will the people down the country hear of them within 21 days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister, even if it does mean extra inconvenience to the Land Commission, to place those documents before the Houses, so that Deputies, who are supposed to be making laws, will know what is in them, and, if necessary, can object to them.  The Minister, having the power of the Government behind him, might have very little fear about having them knocked down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at Deputy Tully's argument.  What he is trying to do is to knock the Incorporated Law Society, the trade union of the legal profession.  As the Deputy knows, it is one thing to desire to put something into operation, but, unless those concerned, are prepared to cooperate and work to achieve that end, I would be wasting my time trying to <Col N="172" /> put it over on them without having their agreement to operate it.  The quick answer to the Deputy, and indeed to Deputy Blowick, is that these statutory rules must be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> They are there for anybody desiring to see them.  Any Deputy who is interested enough is entitled to get a copy of them.  The real test is that if these rules, in any way, affect Deputies' constituents, and it is given as a reason that under the rule or under the law, this or that cannot be done, I am quite sure that, quick and lively, we should have a Motion in this House to knock the particular rule or to amend it.</P>
      <P>The position is that these rules are published and are available for those who want them.  In so far as it might be desirable to have them circulated to Deputies, the suggestion appeals to me but I should not like to give an undertaking to the House, without considering the implications of it.  I have given an undertaking to look into the matter between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he was surprised I said what I did.  In trade union matters, the official must go back to the members with his proposals. The Minister is trying to get through his trade union without letting its members know what has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make this point to the Minister.  If the circulation of the rules to Deputies and Senators is difficult, surely it would not be too much to ask that Deputies and Senators get a note in the ordinary way saying that rules are being made under section 3 of the Land Act, 1964, and that they were available in the Government Publication Sales Office? The Minister mentioned that the rules are published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> but how many Deputies and Senators bother their head reading it?  Special application has to be made to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a suggestion I should like to make to the Minister.  The Minister is aware of the existence of the Seanad Select Committee on Statutory Instruments and if the rules and regulations were placed before that Committee, they <Col N="173" /> could, at least, be examined by them for the limited purposes for which such a Committee is set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>These rules would be subjected to the same scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If these rules are subjected to the same examination as under the 1933 Act, there would not be any danger.  That Committee, which is a Select Committee of the Seanad, would, at least, be given an opportunity of examining all the rules and regulations.</P>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister's suggestion that a motion should be put down here for the purpose of annulling or amending any Order would not be practicable. First, it would be very difficult for a Deputy or a Party to put down a motion, if unaware that such a rule or regulation existed.  The Seanad Select Committee on Statutory Instruments should at least be given an opportunity of examining all these regulations under this Bill when it becomes an Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is legislation by reference and if the Deputy reads section 2, he will see that it refers back in the same way to the procedure under section 3 of the 1933 Act which means that they are subject to the same scrutiny by the committee set out in that section.  Regarding Deputy Blowick's point, Deputies will appreciate that there is another Minister and another Department concerned under subsection (2) of this section and I could not, here and now, without considering the implication of having these things circulated, give an undertaking that they will be circulated.  But I repeat that I shall look into the point and see, after consideration, if it is feasible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>If the rules have been agreed on between the authorities and have become law and are available for sale in the Government Publications Sales Office, surely two lines on an ordinary slip of paper to be distributed to Deputies in the ordinary way with their post, would meet the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I think that <Col N="174" /> would be desirable, just to bring the matter to the notice of Deputies, but if any of these rules affected an individual in any part of the country and particularly affected a constituent of Deputy Flanagan, I can visualise the Order Paper we would have here from the question point of view, leaving out motions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the case that every Deputy would want to put down a motion, or indeed any Deputy, to annul or alter a rule because I think such a thing has never happened in the history of this House and would be most unlikely to happen in this case.  I am simply talking for the purpose of trying to ensure that Deputies who are desirous of getting such information should get it.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I take it that when these regulations have been published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, what will appear will merely be a notice that they have been made and that a Deputy may apply to the General Office and get a copy.  Submission of a notice of motion in regard to these rules and regulations would seem a very dilatory method of handling the matter.  A notice of motion may be on the Order Paper for months and in the meantime the grievance will continue.  Would it not be more expeditious if, as Deputy Flanagan suggested, an order were laid before the House that would come under the 21 days' clause?</P>

      <P>Not for internal reasons, as I said.  I have pointed out there are two Ministers concerned and in these rules we are dealing with a situation that may change very frequently. Changes may have to be made between the Department of Finance and the Department of Lands, and it would be cumbersome and would slow things up if they had to come here every time some slight change was being made and put it before the House.  I am pointing out that there is this procedure whereby Deputies can put down a motion to annul, amend or revoke the rules made.  The only effect of providing that the rules should be <Col N="175" /> laid on the Table is, as I have said, that it brings the fact of making the rules to the Deputies' attention.  I may be able to adopt the suggestion by Deputy Blowick that Deputies be notified when these rules are made.  I think that meets many of the fears or criticisms voiced by Deputy Flanagan.</P>

      <P>What is the Minister's objection to the rule or regulation being placed on the Table of the House, so that the 21 days' provision may operate?  All the Minister has said is that it is a matter for two Departments and that everything that comes before the House has to be subject to annulment under the 21 days' regulation.  But that is not the case at all.  Deputies will not come in and annul everything put before them but at least they want an opportunity of debating the matter, something that Deputy Leneghan does not believe in. That shows his mentality; we might as well stay away as be here if that were the situation.  Otherwise, it seems the only opportunity the House would have of debating something that many Deputies would disagree with, might be lost.  The Minister says we can put down a motion.  He knows perfectly well that if you try to get something annulled under the 21 days' clause, you get priority and you get an opportunity of debating it, whereas a motion may be two or three years before it comes up.  To my knowledge there is a motion down for Private Members' Time about whiskey distilleries which is three years there now.  It is only <Col N="176" /> nonsense for the Minister to tell us that it is perfectly easy to deal with in the way he suggests.  That is untrue.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Minister made a point that he has to consider another Department and that is a difficult thing in laying these rules before the House.  Surely that applies to many Bills where it is accepted that the rules and the regulations made under them are laid before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The matters to be dealt with in these rules are solely to prescribe matters of form, in the main, and as far as I know, this type of rule was never made the subject of the provision of being compulsorily laid on the Table of the House, as it is called.  These rules will prescribe certain forms and regulations under this Bill after consultation with the Department of Finance and the Department of Lands and their respective Ministers from time to time.  These matters must change occasionally and it would be impracticable for every change required in one of these rules, after the discussions have concluded between the Departments, to have to come and lay them on the Table of the House.</P>
      <P>I gave an instance a few moments ago to Deputy Tully where, under one rule-making authority, certain rules and the existing law that we had prescribed were changed and it was only possible to do that after very considerable negotiation and getting agreement with outside people.  Perhaps I gave a rather extreme instance.  It may be unwise to assume that the House would &ldquo;knock&rdquo; a sensible agreement but that could happen if it had to come here.  Deputies would not be as familiar with the matters involved in this case as I would be, or with the reasons for having to go a certain distance to achieve a measure of agreement and co-operation between these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for the very same reason that I am convinced it is desirable to have this section in this particular way.  At the moment I cannot see any real objection to the suggestion made by Deputy Blowick that Deputies should <Col N="177" /> be notified when rules are made under this section but I want to think about it and examine the implications of it before making the promise firmly to the House.  However, unless I find something to the contrary, I would give an undertaking on the Report Stage to adopt this suggestion.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> One would think the Minister was giving something away to Deputy Blowick but we all know that we can get these rules and regulations by writing to the General Office.  In this Bill the Minister is taking powers greater than the powers taken by any of his predecessors and, therefore, we feel obliged to exercise as much control and restraint on these powers as we can.  For that reason, and in the spirit of good democracy, we are anxious that any rules and regulations made under this section should be laid on the Table of the House so that every Deputy may see them.  Surely the Minister is not being reasonable when he half infers that somebody will rush in to try to block these rules and regulations.  Most Deputies are reasonable people and are as anxious as the Minister is to make this a good Bill. It is in that spirit of making it a good Bill that we are anxious that the rules and regulations made under it will be available to every Deputy.  That is good practice and the coy way in which the Minister tried to get away with the idea that he is giving away something when we could get these rules and regulations by writing into the General Office is no good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not here for the purpose of throwing out any giveaways. I am here to try to do a practical job.  Part of the Bill is designed to cut away the red tape that we have under the existing law and Deputy Hogan, by his suggestion here, would simply be adding more red tape that could well clog the machine.  This section is nothing new.  It is nothing new to have a section that does not provide for laying the rules under it on the Table of the House.  There are several statutes that contain sections in the same form as this where the rules, <Col N="178" /> for particular reasons, are designed for domestic consumption, for prescribing certain procedures and forms.</P>
      <P>In fact, this very section refers to section 3 of the 1933 Land Act and rules made under that section have not to be laid on the Table of the House. There is no innovation in the bringing in of a section prescribing the making of rules without having them laid on the Table of the House.  While I can think over the matter between this and the Report Stage, I do not see what difficulty any reasonable Deputy could have about letting the section go through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, this is an innovation.  The Minister had already said that this is the first time a Minister has taken such powers. It is quite understandable, where certain powers are delegated to the Land Commission, that there would be agreement in the House not to have every decision placed before the House. However, here the Minister is asking for political responsibility relative to administration and he wants these powers without being required to give to Deputies the information which is so necessary to ensure that the Minister or his successors will not abuse the powers he is now asking the House to confer upon him.  This cannot be compared to any of the previous Land Acts because this is the first time the House is being asked to confer such powers upon the political head of the Department.</P>

      <P>What I said in my Second Reading speech, as the Deputy well knows, is that for the first time we are writing into the law that the congested areas can be extended by order of the Minister for Lands. However, this section has nothing whatever to do with the Minister. It is a section by reference to section 3 of the Land Act of 1933 and the rules to be made under this section are subject to the same scrutiny by the same statutory authority as provided by law under section 3 of the 1933 Act.  This section gives me no more power one way or the other than was given to any other Minister for Lands in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister when he declares so vehemently that there is nothing new in the decision with regard to regulations he makes under this Bill.  The 1933 Act is there and the Minister is continuing what is in that Act, as far as the submission of rules and regulations are concerned.  As far as any democratic institution is concerned, the statement by the Minister should be a reflection on the people who sat in the House when the 1933 Act was going through because they did not do their job.</P>
      <P>This House goes to a great deal of trouble in examining and dealing with the measures that come before it. Every Deputy gives the benefit of his advice and knowledge to the Minister and his Department and then the Minister and his officials come along and decide that where the technical and legal machinery which are necessary to implement the wishes of the House are concerned, that machinery and the necessary rules and regulations will not be disclosed to the people who passed the legislation.  To me, that is nonsensical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister is in favour of seeing that this House is made aware of any changes that may be made and that he is in a bit of a spot as far as his colleague, the Minister for Finance, is concerned.  I can appreciate the difficulty that he cannot speak for him but let us face it: the real reason why this information regarding the rules, etc., has not been made available is that the faceless bureaucrats in the background do not want to be bothered or worried or annoyed by Deputies.  That is it in a nutshell.  I know, and other Deputies who take an interest in legislation which affects their constituencies know, that it is hard enough to deal with your normal work, without having to go searching and probing for information that should be laid on the Table of the House.  It is an insult to the people who elected Deputies to have them told that they will not be given the rules of procedure, that this is something in the background for the legal fraternity, or the Incorporated Law Society, to work out between them.  If a Deputy <Col N="180" /> asks is it to be handed out in this House, he is told it cannot be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not tolerate that kind of advice.  I think he does take the view that rules and regulations, arising from an enactment of this House, should automatically be made available to Deputies.  I should also like to ask the Minister where his colleague, the Minister for Finance, comes in.  Subsection (1) of section 2, states in brackets &ldquo;other than provisions relating to land purchase finance&rdquo;. Is the Minister for Finance given power in this to strangle&mdash;I will put it that way&mdash;provisions of this Bill when it is passed?  Is there any great significance in the fact that the Minister for Finance appears in the background so early on as a restraining influence on the Minister for Lands who is anxious to do his job as far as the land problem is concerned?</P>

      <P>I have not got such a short memory as the Deputy thinks. Do not provoke me into giving chapter and verse.  No Minister of State can give any undertaking on behalf of a colleague without consulting him.  It may well be that having examined this matter, I shall find there is no real objection to meeting the wishes of the House.  I am much more concerned with another aspect.  I am much more concerned with making and having a flexible legal machine when we have finished with this Bill in this House.  I am far more concerned with every section we have here and many of them have been deliberately drafted <Col N="181" /> for the purpose of giving us flexibility. I should like Deputies to appreciate how impossible it is if the Land Commission and the Minister for Lands are put in a legal straitjacket when dealing with the congestion problem or dealing with the multitudinous duties the Land Commission are supposed to carry out if they are to be effective.</P>

Let me say, in reply to those Deputies who are arguing that this proposal is a matter of principle, and that the rules should be laid on the Table of the House, that I am far more concerned, whatever the practical difficulties may be as between the Department of Lands and the Department of Finance, with finding this proposition a clog on the machine I am trying to devise.  As Deputies who have had ministerial experience know, if you are going to have a series of consultations between the civil servants in the different Departments and the matter has then to be laid on the Table of the House, you must have a Government meeting and the matter must be decided on at a Government meeting.  With all that red tape if things are to be held up and there are to be delays and if every time a line of that must be changed we have to start off again with consultations between the Departments and have to go through what I call red tape&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister for External Affairs needs no recommendation from Deputy O'Sullivan or any other Deputy.  I would be far more concerned with that aspect of this matter than I would be with renewing any undertaking to Deputy Blowick <Col N="182" /> or going the whole hog and amending this section in the way suggested.  However, as I say, I shall go into that aspect.</P>
      <P>Coming to that part of subsection (1) to which Deputy McQuillan referred &mdash;&ldquo;other than provisions relating to land purchase finance&rdquo;&mdash;that is the regular provision in regard to all Departments.  Outside of coming to this House to provide the £5 million in land bonds, that is where every Minister for Lands is dependent on and must be dependent on the Minister for Finance and his Government colleagues at Budget time in regard to the amount of money to be made available to his Department.  Indeed, I could remind the House how, at a certain stage in the history of this country, the Land Commission became starved under certain sections of even the existing law, in particular in regard to the 1950 Act which enabled the Land Commission, in certain limited circumstances, to purchase land by public auction, and how when the war came along they were provided for a while with some ridiculous sum&mdash; speaking from recollection, I think it was something under £20,000&mdash;which was wiped out altogether when the financial shoe started to pinch those concerned with the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>It is true to state that as far as cash purchases and other finances outside the land bonds are concerned&mdash;and of course we have to have consultation about the issue of land bonds but we are taking power to raise the ceiling to enable us to create these&mdash;and the money provided for the other Land Commission development works, including a very big part of my annual Estimate for Land Commission improvement of estates&mdash;which costs a lot of money&mdash;it depends in all instances on what the Minister for Lands is able to persuade the Minister for Finance and his colleagues to provide at Budget time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That limitation was always there.  It must be there because, whatever Government may be in office, they must have regard to a certain order of priorities and to making provision from taxation for those priorities. Control by the Department of Finance <Col N="183" /> must be there for every State Department. This will not, as Deputy McQuillan implied, limit the Land Commission in any way.  The new provisions in this Bill for such things as self-migration, pensions, and so forth, will cost money and operations by the Land Commission will, therefore, cost much more in the future than they have done in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that if these orders were to be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas a great deal of red or green tape would be involved.  The orders would have to go before the Government, and so on.  Are we to take it that, if an order does not come before the Houses of the Oireachtas, then, by implication, the matter can be dealt with by one of the Minister's officials sanctioning the making of an order, and the whole matter will be finalised without being scrutinised by anybody?</P>
      <P>That seems to have been the general theme of the Minister's statements. Perhaps I am reading more into the Minister's remarks than he actually meant but, on two occasions, at least, the Minister stressed the need for&mdash; will he forgive me using this word?&mdash; secrecy in dealing with these matters, because otherwise the cat would be out of the bag, and something would go wrong.  I know I am mixing my metaphors, but I am sure the Minister understands what I mean.  If the matter is put before the Houses of the Oireachtas, then everybody who is entitled to know about it will know about it.  If it is not put before the Houses of the Oireachtas, then everything will be very much easier and we are to assume that it can be dealt with in some way which is not, in fact, the right way.  If I have taken the Minister up wrong, perhaps he will put me right, but that is the idea I got from his statement.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister ask the Minister for Finance if he will agree to that?  I think it is the only fair and equitable thing to do.  The Oireachtas should know what regulations are being made. I agree with what Deputy Hogan said. Whatever about the 1933 Act, or any other Act, the Minister will get more power under this Act than any Minister for Lands has had in the past. That may be right or it may be wrong but, right or wrong, the root of the matter is that the elected representatives should have the right to challenge. I could not agree more with Deputy McQuillan.  It should not be decisions by officials behind the scene.  I appreciate officials take a great many decisions in this country but it should be possible for elected representatives to challenge these decisions if we think they are wrong.  To say we will obstruct and hold up for purely frivolous reasons is just so much nonsense.  Unless the Minister can assure the House that he will suggest to the Minister for Finance that these regulations should be placed before Dáil Éireann I personally could not subscribe to this provision.

      <P>I just want to put Deputy Esmonde's mind at rest.  The Government are not at loggerheads. Let me quote once more section 3 of the Land Act of 1933:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, with the concurrence of a majority of a committee consisting of the Judicial Commissioner, the Secretary of the Land Commission, and a Lay Commissioner appointed for the purpose by the Minister and after consultation with the President of the Incorporated Law Society, make rules for carrying into effect the provisions (other than provisions relating to land purchase finance) of the Land Purchase Acts including this Act (except Part II thereof) and in this Act the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; means prescribed by such rules.</P>
      <P>Now, let me quote once more subsection (1) of section 2:</P>
      <P>The power of making rules conferred by subsections (1) and (2) of section 3 of the Land Act, 1933, shall extend to and be exercisable for making rules for carrying into effect the provisions (other than provisions relating to land purchase finance) of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rules made under this section must go through the procedure prescribed by section 3 of the 1933 Land Act.  Far from these rules being something that nobody knows anything about, they must be examined by and have the concurrence of the Judicial Commissioner, who is a judge of the High Court, the Secretary of the Land Commission, and a Lay Commissioner appointed for that purpose by the Minister, and the President of the Incorporated Law Society must also be consulted.  It should be clear to Deputies that this is nothing new or revolutionary.  This is the procedure laid down by this House, in its wisdom, way back in 1933; it is being continued in operation in this Bill.  There is also a provision that the rules must be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> In my experience over 25 years, the only effect I ever noticed <Col N="186" /> of this provision governing the laying of rules on the Table of the House was that it brought the matter to the attention of Deputies.  I did not undertake to Deputy Blowick, as Deputy Esmonde suggested, that I would accept an amendment for the purpose of providing that these rules should be laid on the Table of the House.  What I did say was that I would examine the matter, and if I saw no objection in principle to the suggestion, that when we made rules under this section, in addition to publishing these rules in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, a notice would go to Deputies notifying them that such rules were being made.  I know quite well, as do other Deputies, that if some rule is made here that in any way affects a constituent of any Deputy, the Minister for Lands, whoever he may be, will very quickly be questioned about it in the House and under our procedure here, if it is something the Deputy considers serious, he will table a motion to annul or amend the rule.</P>

I see no reason not to meet Deputy Blowick's suggestions but while I cannot state this authoritatively at this stage, I have a recollection that I had decided that it would be a delaying factor having to go through the procedure of having these rules laid on the Table of the House.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> On a point of information, the Minister <Col N="187" /> has told us that the rules and regulations will be considered by the judicial commissioner of the Land Commission, a lay commissioner, the Secretary of the Land Commission and the President of the Incorporated Law Society, four very esteemed men, I am sure, although I do not know any of them. He has also told us that laying these regulations before the House will involve a lot of what he calls green tape. Will he tell the green Deputy what this green tape involves?</P>

I can assure Deputies that I have a genuine fear that by amending this section we might be running into a procedure that would delay the work of my Department.

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again in regard to interference by the Minister for Finance, the Minister rightly pointed out on the previous section that the final decision in regard to the amount of money being made available to the Minister for Lands will be made by his colleagues, and particularly by the Minister for Finance.  That power is simply a decision of policy as to whether a certain sum of money should or should not be made available to the Minister.  What I want to establish now is how far into the workings of the Land Commission the hand of the Department of Finance penetrates. If it is on this question of the <Col N="188" /> amount of money to be made available it is quite understandable that the Department of Finance would have some kind of rein but it would be disastrous to have further penetration by the Minister for Finance into the Department of Lands as a restraining influence on a section that has already held itself under severe restraint as far as expenditure and work are concerned.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister also to clarify for the House whether it is a fact that the Land Commission cannot now be blamed for the large amount of congestion existing in the country today.  Whatever Governments have been in power have failed to make the money available; in other words, according to this Minister, the different Ministers for Finance have had the decision all through the years as to what money the Land Commission could spend.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that section 3 deals with money for administrative expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 refers to the &ldquo;payments made and expenses incurred by the Minister and by the Land Commission in giving effect to this Act&rdquo;.  Apart from expenses, it refers to the payments made by the Minister.  It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>and in the administration thereof shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words the Minister for Finance can say to the Minister for Lands on this question of the relief of congestion: &ldquo;Do nothing about it&rdquo; and immediately the Land Commission become the cockshot in the public eye, and everybody outside says the Land Commission are doing nothing. The Minister would be doing a good day's work by explaining quite clearly that the Government and all Governments we have had since I came into the House, since 1948, must now bear the responsibility for the small amount of work done towards solving the problem in the areas in the Schedule <Col N="189" /> to this Bill, namely, the congested areas.  In other words, if there were a Government with the interest of congests at heart who made the money available, this Bill might not be necessary at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the usual section that goes into every Bill passing through this House to make financial provision for its implementation.  It is true to say that any Minister for Lands or for that matter, any Minister for anything in this State, is depending upon his colleagues in the Government and the Minister for Finance to provide him with the necessary money to run his Department.  As Deputies will know, each Minister must present his proposals to the Minister for Finance before Budget time and have agreement reached on the programme and on the amount of money it is estimated will be needed to give effect to it. There is nobody naïve enough in this day and age to believe that any Government or any Minister, and particularly the Minister for Lands, has some kind of Santa Claus over in Merrion Street who provides him with money any time he wants it.</P>
      <P>The amount of money that will be provided for under this Bill and to give effect to it must be agreed upon by the Minister for Finance of the day and by the Government of the day. The Minister for Finance must know and have agreement among his colleagues on the amount to be allowed for the running of the Land Commission under the different heads set out in the Book of Estimates so that he can come along to this House with his Budget and the Book of Estimates and the provisions for the taxation that is necessary to meet that demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While no doubt we shall have Deputies such as Deputy McQuillan to preach the doctrine that an unlimited amount of money should be provided for this purpose under this section, the Deputy is not the first to go into the division lobbies to vote against taxation if he thinks it is popular with his constituents in Roscommon.  It is the easiest thing in the world to preach here the wisdom of providing unlimited money for the purpose of the relief of congestion and at the same <Col N="190" /> time to go back to the boys and to say in effect: &ldquo;I voted against the 2d. on the cigarettes or the 1d. on the pint.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Each Government, considering their financial position with their Minister for Finance in any year, must decide as a Government&mdash;and this is where the collective responsibility referred to tonight comes in&mdash;what should be available in the order of priority of things for the land congestion problem and for any of the other problems which different Ministers of State have. In so far as our recent Budgets and Estimates in this House have been going, a very substantial amount of money has been provided year by year, and debated by the House, for the purpose of dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>There is also a limiting factor inasmuch as the Land Commission themselves must be geared to deal with an expansion of their activities in different areas.</P>
    <P>To give a specific instance, we find now, in this particular year, that there are many migrants' holdings which will not be ready because the Land Commission have not been able to have the necessary buildings completed in time. You have all this&mdash;the amount of work that must be gone through and the amount of investigation that must be gone through by the outdoor staff of the Land Commission inspectorate&mdash; and that puts a limit on the amount of money that is capable of being expended in any particular year.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will complain on other sections about my proposal to take a short-cut towards the acquisition of land.  Some of these provisions I know will probably be strongly debated in this House but, on the intake side of the Land Commission machine, there are tons and tons of green tape that must be eliminated if we are to get on with the job in a fairly reasonable time and there is not all that amount of land on the market in any specific year in respect of the amount of money that the Land Commission might have available for that purpose.</P>
    <P>In many of these cases it takes, under existing procedure, maybe three, four or five years through the different processes of law that are there <Col N="191" /> from the point at which the Land Commission start towards the acquisition of an estate until the job is finally finished before Judge Teevan and the Appeal Tribunal.  It is not so simple as Deputy McQuillan would suggest that some Minister for Lands, having been given unlimited money, could go out and acquire all the land in just one year.</P>
    <P>In my experience as Minister for Lands, there has been a constant and steady intake of land under the existing machinery and sufficient money has been provided for it under the provisions for the relief of congestion. Under this Bill, there are a number of sections which Deputies will well appreciate will involve the Land Commission in very high expenditure in addition to their existing programme. The amount to be made available must depend in any year on what the Government of the day decide they can afford to devote to this problem. The Government have authorised the introduction of this Bill and, accordingly, Deputies must assume that it is the Government's intention to implement the provisions in the different sections and to provide the money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister for Lands be at liberty to make use of the money provided in this section to increase the scale of farmyard enterprise in an uneconomic holding by providing up-to-date and adequate buildings and in this way make an uneconomic holding a viable holding? So far, apparently the Government and the Land Commission have appeared to think that the only way to make an economic holding is to give the holder an extra amount of land or money to buy additional land. It is felt that the problem of uneconomic holdings could be solved in another way in many cases.  Could this money, therefore, be used for that purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little confused. I could not follow the Minister's line of reasoning.  He said the Land Commission were not able to get enough land because the pool of land was getting smaller and it was more difficult <Col N="192" /> to acquire land and he said that in any case the Land Commission were not able to relieve the congestion as fast as they would like because they had not the money to erect the buildings. These statements appear to be contradictory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I said our migration programme this year was slowed down because we could not get houses built &mdash;not because of lack of money but because there is such a building boom in the country that we find it difficult to get contractors to build the houses which we require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have agreed with an awful lot of what the Minister said but that is an extraordinary statement and the Minister should know as well as I do that it is an awful lot of cod. Every time we run into trouble about not carrying out a task we always say there is a shortage of labour.  If it is not a shortage of money it is a shortage of labour.  The Minister has built a number of houses in County Meath and he knows he can get as many as he wants built there over the next twelve months.  All he has to do is to provide the money.  Furthermore, perhaps the Minister would tell us when he resumes the reason why estates have been held for up to seven or eight years.  Are we now getting the correct reason&mdash;that either you cannot get men to build the houses or you have not the money to pay them, anyway?</P>
