      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Finance, including the Paymaster-General's Office.</P>
      <P>This group of Estimates was allowed through the Dáil without discussion last July on the Taoiseach undertaking that an opportunity for debate would be afforded later in the session.  The group comprises a number of Estimates in the Book of Estimates and I have only to say a word about the size of the Finance Estimate itself.  The original Estimate for 1962-63 was £351,460 and a token Supplementary Estimate was taken this time last year, or somewhat before this, but in similar circumstances to those in which we are taking this Estimate now.  That meant that the total Estimate for 1962-63 was £351,470.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year's total is £365,270, a net increase of £13,810 on the original Estimate for last year.  That is made up as follows: £7,290 for salaries, wages and allowances; £6,570 for remuneration of banks, management of <Col N="1241" /> Government stocks&mdash;Subhead B&mdash;and travelling and other expenses, £200. That would give an increase of £14,060 but there is a saving of £250 because the appropriation - in - aid increased by that amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>This is a token Estimate raised for the purpose, as the Minister said, of providing the House with an opportunity of discussing last year's Estimate.  This is one of the Estimates which were passed <i>in globo</i> at the end of the last session.  It deals exclusively with the administration of the Department of Finance and ordinarily is not made the subject of much discussion in the absence of any exceptional change in it.  From what the Minister has told us today and bearing in mind that we are dealing not with an Estimate for the coming year but one for the year 1963-64, I have no matter to raise in this regard that cannot more suitably be raised on the Estimate for the Office of the Minister for the coming year.</P>
      <P>At the moment we are in the dilemma that is is by no means certain who will be answering for that and all I can say in regard to this Estimate is that if we are accepting responsibility for the next one, we shall be glad to furnish the Minister with any information he may then require on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £150,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964 for Grants to Local Authorities in Relief of Rates on Agricultural Land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original Estimate for this year, 1963-64, was £8,816,000 and the amount now requested is £150,000 which will make the revised Estimate <Col N="1242" /> total £8,966,000.  When the Estimate was being prepared, before this time last year, it was prepared on the basis of an estimated increase of about four per cent in local authority rates in 1963-64.  Here was that Estimate in November 1962, and the Department of Local Government were asked to have a look again at it in February, 1963.  They said they saw no reason to change their figure.  Provision for that amount was accordingly made in the Estimate, that is, on the basis of a four per cent increase in rates.  The actual rates struck represented an increase of six per cent approximately on the previous year instead of the estimated four per cent.</P>
    <P>Claims received from the county councils have, therefore, been higher than were provided for in the Estimate. It is calculated now that the amount which will be payable will be £8,966,000.  But that, of course, is subject to verification by the county councils.  I can, therefore give only an estimate: I cannot give a firm figure. I am asking the Dáil for an additional £150,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The occasion of this Estimate highlights the wellnigh desperate situation which is developing in the country in regard to rates in general but with special reference, of course, to the rates on agricultural land.  I noticed last week that when the Taoiseach was speaking in the House, he said he now recognised that this situation was wellnigh desperate and that the Government were wrestling with it with a view to finding some entirely new basis of rate collection as they felt the burden on the agricultural industry was becoming intolerable. Last year, as the Minister told us, the Department of Local Government forecast an increase of four per cent. They were 33? per cent below what actually happened.  Instead of going up by four per cent, the rates went up by six per cent.  Has the Minister any information of what the rates are likely to do in the coming year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told by colleagues who are members of local authorities throughout the country that in some counties rates are likely to go up by 8/- in the £ on the present level obtaining and in <Col N="1243" /> other counties, by 5/- in the £.  I understand that, in the municipality here, they have gone up by 4/- in the £ but that has no relevance to the Estimate we are here considering which relates exclusively, I think, to agricultural land.</P>
    <P>What do the Government expect farmers to do?  We are faced with the fact that they are getting the same prices for milk, wheat and pigs and that they are getting approximately the same price for sheep as they were getting three or four years ago.  I am glad to see that the price of cattle is firm.  I hope that will continue to be so, though these are critical days. Those of us who are familiar with the cattle trade know that cattle prices tend to rise up to the end of February and then very often fall back.  It is a source of satisfaction to see the Trade Agreement of 1948 still operating effectively to keep the price of store cattle strong and firm.  The announcement that we are to restore the guaranteed price for barley to the level at which it stood in 1957 is poor consolation for farmers who have faced steep increases in rates every year and who are now faced with record rate increases.</P>
    <P>But there is a still grimmer aspect of this situation.  I am informed that the rate increases now recommended to the finance committees of the local authorities are designed to finance the increased charges which will come in course of payment by the local authorities in respect of their institutions' increased expenses precipitated by the operation of the turnover tax. It makes no provision for the increased cost the local authorities will have to bear out of the rates in implementing the 12 per cent increase in wages and salaries which has been ordained by the employer-trade union agreement made consequent on the imposition of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>When you think of a farmer, battling along as best he can, who is paying a labouring man or maybe two and meeting an increase in the weekly wages of £1 apiece in respect of each of them and who then has to meet the increase of six per cent last year and <Col N="1244" /> the increase of something like ten per cent this year which is coming, and who is required to live on the prices which have remained virtually static for the past five or six years, is it any wonder Fianna Fáil announce that they contemplate shifting 60,000 farmers off the land before 1970?  I wonder if this House ever asked itself what the country will look like if we strip a large part of the agricultural land of Ireland of its population?  It will alter the whole picture of the society in which we have all grown up and of which we have, looking around the world, every reason to be proud. I certainly reject most emphatically the thesis that it is a desirable thing virtually to put an end to tenant proprietorship in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the actual grant from the Exchequer designed to relieve the farmer of £25 valuation and other farmers in respect of the first £25 of their valuation.  The Minister told us today he consulted the Department of Local Government last year and that they advised him that the rates would go up by four per cent, whereas, in fact, they went up by six per cent.  We may anticipate that in the year ahead they will go up ten to 15 per cent.  It is true to say that if you take an increase of 5/- in the £ in Roscommon and 8/-in <Col N="1245" /> Donegal, before any provision is made for the ninth round of wages, it will represent an increase of something in the order of ten per cent or more in rates next year.  I simply do not know where it is to come from. I see the Deputy from North Mayo smiling benignly down on me and I hope he will intervene to tell us what his judgment is in this matter.</P>
      <P>I feel bound to warn the Minister that my experience in Monaghan is that the farmers are pretty near the end of their tether.  This increased burden further diminishes the margin they have between their incomes and their outgoings and if that margin is further contracted, they simply cannot survive.  I suggest to the Minister that this Estimate throws into high relief the acuteness of the rate problem that confronts us and that this, I suggest, would be an appropriate time to tell the House whether any progress has been made in the consideration which the Taoiseach announced the Government felt constrained to give to the whole rates structure, in view, as he himself said, of the growing burden they represented on the farmers.  It is not a problem which is easy of solution but you can keep piling up straw on a camel's back until ultimately you reach the last and irrevocable straw. Surely the Minister for Finance realises that if after the six per cent in respect of this year, for which he has increased his contribution from the Exchequer, there is added to that ten per cent or 15 per cent in the coming year the situation for the Treasury may be rendered even more difficult than it is already, but the situation of the individual farmer who has to pay the balance of rates will be made virtually desperate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel the time is overdue for the Government&mdash;whatever Government are in office&mdash;to carry out a complete overhaul of this question of aids to the farming community, whether that aid is to be by way of relief from the burden of rates or through production incentives.  The present situation cannot be tolerated much longer.  This blanket distribution, if I could so describe it, of funds to <Col N="1246" /> farmers of all categories is an unsatisfactory way to give what are described as reliefs to that section of the community. Taking the scheme which is in operation, the Minister, I am sure, will recollect that certain action taken by farmers over the past two years forced the Government to increase the amount of money for the relief of the rates burden.  It was due to a great extent to the protest marches which were organised throughout the country that we had an increase in the allowances in the past couple of years by the Department of Finance.  What I want to emphasise is that no matter what pressure has been brought to bear on the Government, and no matter what the increase in grants may be, the position is negatived by the increased demand on the local authorities for further services resulting in an increase in the rates generally in every local authority area.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon suggested that in certain local authorities the estimated increase in rates this year is in the region of 8/- in the £.  That is a perfectly accurate figure which he has given and if we take the increase in the relief given in this Supplementary Estimate, we find it will go no distance towards offsetting the increased demand on the farming community by the various local authorities.  I feel that the general public outside the farming communities have an idea, when they see an Estimate of this nature, that the farmers are being spoonfed or pampered, and people in towns are able to point out that they have to bear the full burden of rates, whereas the farming community are relieved to a certain extent.  I do not think that is quite fair, particularly to the small farmer.  There is relief of two-thirds of the valuation up to the first £20 but this amount is a negligible sum to many farmers.  It is only when you get into the £100 valuation category that you begin to see how beneficial is this allowance under the agriculture grants. Instead of helping the small farmer by taking the burden of rates off him altogether, we are actually, in many instances, under these blanket type grants, helping the inefficient, the lazy and the incompetent farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> It has come to the stage when the maximum production will have to be procured from the land.  It is an accepted fact that the small farmer under £25 valuation has to produce the maximum that his land will give in order to exist.  What is the position in regard to the larger farmers and those whose holdings extend to 1,000 acres? Are we getting the proper return from these farmers?  Are those lands producing the maximum amount which is desirable and necessary in order to reach the targets which the Government have laid down to be achieved by 1970?  I do not think so.  I do not think the majority of the large holdings are producing up to even 50 per cent of their capacity at the moment.</P>
    <P>In cases where there is this lack of production and failure to produce from the lands, we should not be giving grants.  There is, I think, a very strong case for an examination into the type of production and the work done by the large farmers before they get one penny relief in rates.  There is need for more production from the land where the large farmer is concerned and, instead of relief from rates, there should be a system of sur-rate in order to force the large farmer, who has a responsibility to the community, to produce from the land, or else persuade him to sell that land to the Land Commission.  These are aspects which will have to be examined very soon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said Fianna Fáil were aiming to strip a large part of the country of its agricultural population, of its small farmers; that, of course, is what is happening.  There is no incentive to the small farmer, and this type of grant will not help the small farmer.  Now, while I agree with Deputy Dillon as to what is happening, the fact remains that we must face the situation; that is the policy common to all the countries in EEC&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Governments are playing up to the farming Lobbies. The Governments in these two countries are afraid of the farming Lobbies to a certain extent.  There are arrangements under the Treaty of Rome for inducing a large proportion of small farmers out of farming and into industry.

      <P>We should be fighting tooth and nail to retain the maximum number of small holders. This type of agricultural grant is of no benefit to the small farmer.  In fact, the small farmer is put to the pin of his collar, and will be in the coming year, when the increased demand for rates is made on him.  Other sections in the rural areas will also be hit.  This whole problem will have to be faced.  The Taoiseach has stated he is prepared to have this matter examined.  That is the type of promise that is thrown out before a general election.  The examination may not take place for years.  We may wait for years before anything is done. When the problem does come to be examined, we will have to ensure that the small holder is completely <Col N="1249" /> exempted from rates.  There must be complete derating for the small farmer up to a certain valuation.  After that, we must have production incentives. They can apply to all categories of farmers.  The production incentive is essential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he can hardly expect much thanks from the small farmers when he produces a Supplementary Estimate of this nature.  The position today is that 11,000 farmers have a valuation between them of £2,250,000. Those 11,000 represent three per cent of the holdings and that three per cent of the holdings with a valuation of £2,250,000 have a greater valuation than 70 per cent of the small farmers combined.  If we could get an analysis from the Minister of what proportion of this money goes to the small farmers under £20 valuation and what percentage goes to the category with a valuation of £2,250,000 between them, we would have, I think, a rather interesting breakdown.  It is only when we break down the distribution of this money that we will find how much better it could be spent, how much more attractive the grants could be made to the farming community from the incentive point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that it is necessary for the Minister to have special legislation in order to do that.  Perhaps it is.  The Ceann Comhairle is in a better position to judge at the moment than I am.  If the Minister could alter the basis on which this money is distributed, he would do an excellent job for agriculture without having to increase the overall amount of money available to him for distribution. I suppose it is too much to ask the Minister to consider the <Col N="1250" /> alternative suggestion made to him. The breaking point has been reached in rural Ireland as far as rates are concerned.  I am speaking as a member of a local authority.  I do not know what will happen before the end of March when the new rate is struck.  The allowance given here, because of the type of distribution in operation, will not help the farming community to any significant degree at all in easing the burden of rates. The Minister will have to think up some further means of alleviating this urgent problem before very long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this is of great assistance to the farmers.  Deputy Dillon paints a gloomy picture when he is in Opposition and says the farmers are being badly treated by Fianna Fáil.  I do not agree with that.  He said it is only by chance that the price of cattle is so good.  The fact is the price was never so good.  Deputy Dillon should keep silent about wheat.  The price the farmers are getting for their wheat now is very good.  It is not the price that kills the farmer.  It is the climate.  Feeding barley has been increased by 2/- a barrel.  We have had a promise from the Minister for Agriculture that the price of bacon will be increased.  That will be a help to the small farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McQuillan that the small farmer is not in a position to benefit by the grants.  He uses only very little lime and manure whereas the big man uses 20 times as much.  I am a member of a local authority in an area where there is a large increase in rates. I should like to know how these difficulties are to be overcome.  There are councillors who want new roads here and new roads there.  They cannot be created without increases somewhere. In North Tipperary, <i>culs-de-sac</i> have been taken over by the local authority.  The people living in these <i>culs-de-sac</i> want them rolled and tarred.  It takes money to do that.  That will put up the rates and is there agreement on the increase?  When extra money is needed and Estimates are introduced in this House, they are not received too well by some people here.  At the moment <Col N="1251" /> the farmers are not doing too badly. As regards the small farmers, the hardworking tillage farmers, what they are saying at the present time, and they are saying it in Kildare in the by-election is: &ldquo;We are doing all right and we want to be left alone.&rdquo;  They will be thankful for this increase in agricultural grants which is intended to help them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the Minister's statement when introducing this Supplementary Estimate, the farmers are not really receiving any extra benefit.  The last speaker implied that the Minister is introducing the Estimate for the purpose of increasing the benefits payable to farmers.  He is not.  This is only a bookkeeping Estimate because the rates have gone up considerably more than was anticipated by the Government.</P>
      <P>It is not that the Government had not been warned about that.  It had been repeatedly pointed out to them from these benches that there was no alternative to a rise in rates as a result of the policy they were pursuing. It is quite evident that the increase in rates that has taken place is largely due to the fiscal policy of the Government and of the Minister who is introducing a Supplementary Estimate for £150,000 to offset these bookkeeping deficiencies.</P>
      <P>There is no benefit, good, bad or indifferent, in this for big farmers, medium farmers or small farmers.  If the Minister intended to make any change, to introduce any extra reliefs, it would have been announced in the answer to a question which I put down yesterday to the Minister for Local Government.  I asked the Minister yesterday if he would increase the rate relief for employment on farms to ensure greater employment and to offset the heavy rate increases which farmers have to meet.  Here is the answer:</P>
      <P>This is one of many matters relating to rate relief on agricultural land which is at present under active consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we are on the subject of rates, <Col N="1252" /> perhaps the Minister who is directly responsible for looking for the extra money from this House to deal with rates will give some indication as to what extra reliefs the Government intend to give the farmers.  It is extraordinary that the Minister for Finance in introducing this Supplementary Estimate had not a word to say on that.  I should like the Minister to indicate whether he is considering increasing the amount of rate relief on farms, no matter what size they are.</P>
    <P>It is important that farmers should be given rate relief in respect of employment.  Are there any plans for increasing this relief which is £17 and which has been static over the past ten years?  Are there any other schemes for increasing reliefs to farmers?  All these increases have been static.  Apart from the increase given in the Budget before last, there have been no increased reliefs for those who have to bear the burden of rates.  All the speakers, with the exception of the last speaker, referred to the fact that charges are increasing all the time.  In this country we depend for our fiscal return, for the equation of our Budget, and so on, on what the farmers can produce.  The heavier the burden that lies on them, the less the production will be and the more often the Minister will have to come back to this House with Supplementary Estimates trying to clear up the mess.</P>
    <P>There is no other reason why the Minister has introduced a Supplementary Estimate here this afternoon except that the Government and those who advise him have completely misjudged the situation.  At the beginning of this year, the Government estimated, with all the facts available, with all the inside knowledge of expert advisers, that there would be a four per cent increase in the rates.  Deputy Dillon has very aptly said it is now revealed that there is an increase of 33? per cent on what they estimated.  Somebody had done some muddled thinking or else it goes to prove another thing which I have always maintained, that policy conducted in this country is thought out in a theoretical manner without any practical approach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> Deputy McQuillan said that it is policy in other countries to take people off the land.  That is not the policy of the EEC.  It is recognised in many countries, as it should be recognised here, that it will not be possible to retain as many people on small holdings as heretofore.  Of course, they are striving for a better standard of living. For that reason, the EEC countries and every other country with an agricultural economy as its basis, which is practically every country in the world, have realised that in order to retain the people on the land and give them a better standard of living, they must give them some other form of assistance. For that reason, there have been in all these countries remissions of taxation, many reliefs to the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>Along with that, far from siphoning people off the land, they have endeavoured to keep them on the land, if only in part-time employment. They have endeavoured to keep the small holdings as they are, contrary to this Government's policy which appears to be to wipe out the small holdings and compound them into other holdings.  That is not the European policy or that of any other country in the world.  Other countries have accepted the fact that they have to provide a better standard of living and they are going about it in a different way altogether from that of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I regret to have to tell the Minister for Finance that the very fact that he has come here this afternoon as Minister responsible for the financial policy of this Government proves that they have no policy to deal with the changing situation on the land. They have no policy to deal with the rising overhead charges, to equate conditions of farmers with those of the rest of the community.  That is what is fundamentally wrong with the policy of this Government.  The sooner they accept the fact that what the man who lives on the land produces is the backbone of our economy, the better.  He should be given a fair deal and brought into line with other sections of the community. There is no use in the Government's <Col N="1254" /> talking about a five-year plan or about expanding our economy when they will not go to the root of the problem which exists not only in the west of Ireland&mdash;it is more acute and more severe in the west of Ireland and in Kerry, West Cork and such areas &mdash; but also in other places as well.</P>
    <P>We cannot expect the agricultural community to go on enjoying the same standard of living and having the same remuneration and return as they have had all along.  Those engaged in industries are able to increase their charges, but the agricultural community are depressed all the time.  There is no use in the Minister chucking them a bone, if he is chucking them a bone.  I think he is chucking them nothing.  As I said, this Estimate is to clean up the financial muddle that has been created by him as the fiscal controller of the Government's policy.  So long as we go on with that muddled sort of policy, we will get nowhere, and we will never have a stable, sound, profitable agricultural economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fanning referred to agricultural prices and said the agricultural community were thriving, prosperous and happy.  I wonder would he care to say that on a public platform outside the House?  What this country wants is stability.  It is only a couple of months since cattle were £5 5s. and £5 10s. a cwt.  At present there is a bigger demand for cattle because of difficulties in the Argentine, which could have been foreseen by the Government if there had been any forward thinking at all.  The export of cattle from the Argentine is less than it was, due to a rising population pressure which is likely to continue.  Therefore, there is a slightly better demand for cattle than there was heretofore.  The price of cattle has rocketed to £7 a cwt., but there is no guarantee for the farmer, big or small, that that price will be maintained.  There is nothing enshrined in the Government's policy to maintain it.  The same is true of pigs.</P>

      <P>I do not think the farmer will be very much influenced if he is told by one side that he is better off, and by the other that he is not.  He will make up his own mind.  I do not want to pursue that argument.  The speeches of Deputy Dillon and Deputy McQuillan were directed principally towards the farmer's ability to pay increased rates.  I want to make it quite clear that the rates for the year 1963-64 on farm land and buildings, in the aggregate, were lower than they were in 1957-58.  So far, anyway, the farmer has no complaint in the matter of rates.  I am not sure if I will be able to say the same thing next year, and he may have some complaint if the fact I state now does not apply next year.  For this year, it does apply.</P>

      <P>I cannot say that because the Deputy may say that one individual farmer paid more.  There are many individual farmers who paid less this year.  The aggregate rates paid by the farmers in 1963-64 were lower than they were in 1957-58.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have gone up higher than the estimate, but the aggregate of rates paid by farmers on land and buildings in 1957-58 was £7,500,000.  This year it is £7,300,000, so that actually it is £200,000 less than in 1957-58.  I might say also in connection with this matter that on examining figures some time ago, I found that the three items which concerned farmers very much in their costs were feeding stuffs, fertilisers and seeds combined.  They were also lower in the present year than in 1957-58. Therefore, the farmers' costs in their businesses are not up.  The farmer has increased costs like every other householder&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>However, that was the position.  Deputies will know that even if prices of certain items have gone up, the facts I have given still hold.  One commodity Deputy Dillon mentioned was milk.  If you take that individual item, it must be remembered that as compared with 1957-58, the price of milk is higher and the yield is significantly higher.  If we take the milk producer, therefore, we can say that as a farmer, he is better off than in 1957-58. Wages are admittedly higher but wages, as we all realise and agree, are a very difficult problem for the farmer. At the same time, no Deputy would dare to say they are high enough.  It is a problem that has to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I have not got the Estimate for next year yet.  There is a provisional Estimate which can be deduced, if I might use the term, from the Vote on Account, which is based on a six per cent increase in rates.  There is a good lot of talk about the small farmer disappearing.  The Government have done everything they possibly can for the small farmer.  We have devised a good number of schemes for him.  The House will realise it is not easy to produce schemes.  If any Deputy in the Opposition benches &mdash; Deputy McQuillan has spoken very fluently on this&mdash;would suggest a scheme helpful to the small farmer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The farmers are getting grants as well for reclamation and for many other things.  We, as a Government, have produced many schemes for small farmers and hope we may be able to keep them on the land.  In that hope, we are prepared to consider any other scheme which may be of help.  As Deputies are aware, we would value a committee in each county, with officers and others closely in touch with small farmers, who could see the schemes working and who could suggest other means that might be useful to small farmers in the west of Ireland and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>We have provided the funds for helping agriculture as far, I can truthfully say, as this country can afford.  We might stretch a point and go further than we can afford if a good scheme presented itself.</P>

    <P>On the other hand, I do not see what can be gained by saying that the Government have ordered these people to leave the land.  It is not true.  Neither is it true to say the Government hope they will leave the land.  We have tried to make our <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> a realistic document.  This trend of rural depopulation holds not alone here but in every other country.  Ours is a realistic Estimate. It is not an order from the Government, not even a hope.  It is only a realistic estimate of what is likely to occur.  Having got that realistic estimate of migration from the land, the Programme tries to make provision <Col N="1260" /> for the absorption of those people into other ways of living.  As far as I and other members of the Government are concerned, it is our sincere hope that this estimate will not be realised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £50,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964, for certain Miscellaneous Expenses, including certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>Until now the Racing Board have been able to finance their work for the improvement of horse racing and horse breeding from the proceeds of the levy on bookmakers in respect of course bets and the deduction from totalisator stakes.</P>
      <P>After meeting administrative expenses and ordinary taxation, the funds collected in this way are applied by the Board mainly to increase prize money; to subsidise the carriage of horses; to finance the costs of the Photo-finish, Photo Patrol and Dope Detection Units operated by the Stewards of the Turf Club and to improve stands, buildings and race courses.</P>
      <P>The money put into the industry by the Board has increased substantially over the past few years.  In the year ended 31st December, 1962&mdash;the latest for which published accounts are available&mdash;payments amounted to some £326,000.  Of this figure, contributions towards prize money accounted for £246,000 and payments towards carriage of horses for £50,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bearing in mind the fillip which the horse-racing industry in Britain would derive from the recent establishment there of the Horse-race Levy Board, the Racing Board felt that still further increases in prize money, etc., were needed if Irish racing was not to deteriorate seriously in comparison <Col N="1261" /> with British standards and if owners and trainers were not to be attracted away from this country to the disadvantage of the industry and of the economy generally.  The Board were satisfied that it would not be practicable to raise the extra money needed by means of an increase in the levy on bookmakers or in the deduction from tote stakes because they apprehended that a reduction in the volume of betting would ensue from such measures.  The Board, therefore, approached me in November, 1962, with a proposal for direct State assistance.</P>
    <P>Before a final decision was reached on this proposal, the turnover tax introduced a new factor into the situation. Indeed, during the debate on last year's Finance Bill, Deputy Cosgrave put forward an amendment designed, he explained, to exempt course betting from the new tax.  I indicated why I felt unable to accept the amendment but at the same time I told the Deputy that I intended to meet members of the Racing Board and that, if they convinced me that the tax would have an adverse effect on horse racing, I would be very sympathetic to their problem.</P>
    <P>In the discussion with the Racing Board which followed, the members held strongly that the Board would have to bear the turnover tax in respect both of betting on the course with bookmakers and on the tote in the belief that, if it were attempted to pass on the tax, attendances at race meetings would fall.  Given the Board's expert knowledge in this field I felt constrained at the time to accept their opinion that they would have to bear the tax out of their own funds.  As events are now shaping, it may be that it will in the future be possible to take a less pessimistic view.  On-course betting increased in volume last November and December as compared with the corresponding period in earlier years and both betting and attendances are bound to reflect in the future the increase in money incomes which is at present taking place.</P>
    <P>It is clear, however, that the position whereby the Board bears the tax <Col N="1262" /> is now depleting the funds available for the Board's activities.  In fact, a deficit is already expected for 1963 on ordinary account and without reckoning turnover tax.</P>
    <P>Having taken account of all the circumstances, I have come to the conclusion that I have no alternative but to supplement the Board's finances by means of the £50,000 asked for in this Supplementary Estimate so that there will be no impairment of their capacity to continue to carry out the important functions allotted to them in promoting the bloodstock industry which is such a valuable item in our national economy.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the House accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this Supplementary Estimate is to exempt racecourse betting from the impact of the turnover tax.  I think the Minister is right to do this.  I think the whole principle of the turnover tax is crazy, primarily because it bears so unjustly on the people who have to buy food, fuel and clothing but also because of the economic argument that it gravely endangers a number of important export industries in so far as it operates to increase their costs.  You find yourself in this dilemma.  If you accept that it is fair and just to levy a turnover tax on bread, flour, butter, tea, sugar, and children's boots and clothes, and the very turf and coal that goes into the fire or the range, it sounds terribly unfair to solemnly exempt racecourse betting from the impact of the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This society will not function, this State cannot survive, if we cannot sell a sufficiency of our production abroad to pay for our imports.  The indiscriminate operation of this tax is throwing up one anomaly after another.  Recently I saw a list issued by the Revenue Commissioners which had been agreed by them&mdash;and I hasten to say that the Revenue Commissioners adopted a most constructive and helpful attitude&mdash;with the Hardware and Allied Traders' Association.  I think the list comprises nearly 200 items in a hardware shop which are exempt from the turnover tax.  You could make exactly the same kind of <Col N="1263" /> fantastic anomaly of exempting from turnover tax streptomycin, or some other expensive drug, that you give to a horse or a pig, while requiring a harassed parent to pay the turnover tax if she is buying it for her child. Yet, I think there is much to be said for sparing farmers, who are already put to the pin of their collar, from the impact of this tax.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the specific proposal here.  Are we in this House to vote to exempt bookies' bets on the racecourse from the turnover tax when we insist on the mother of ten paying it on her children's boots and shoes, not to speak of her food?  On balance, I think, yes.  I hope we will be able to get rid of this tax altogether but its indiscriminate application is, I say, not only anomalous but unjust. But, <i>ad interim,</i> I think it would be a great mistake to take £50,000 off the Racing Board's resources in view of the fact that they have applied their resources imaginatively and effectively to maintain the status of our bloodstock industry.  The bloodstock industry is a very valuable industry.  It creates a great deal of employment and earns a great deal of money which is vital to finance the volume of imports coming into this country at the present time. It is an industry which is becoming more and more desperately competitive every year.  There is not the slightest doubt that if we are to maintain our position in the bloodstock world, we must have racing here on a scale to maintain our position in the world as a source of bloodstock breeding.</P>
    <P>It is manifest that both France and Great Britain, who are our principal competitors, are very anxious to wrest that position from us and unless we can maintain racecourses, and much more important, maintain the supply of money for our classic races, the Irish classic races could cease to compare in significance with classic races in France and Great Britain, which would react, possibly fatally, to the detriment of the livestock industry of this country.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have any interest in this industry&mdash;I do not claim to <Col N="1264" /> be an authority on horse flesh or racing, but I am interested in it from its economic potential to the country as a whole&mdash;have observed with satisfaction that a great many substantial industrial concerns offer their help by sponsoring races.  Those not familiar with the situation and who may marvel at the fact that firms adopt this type of advertising ought to recognise how useful this channel of advertising is to this most important industry.  If we welcome, as we certainly should, the advertising activities of wealthy firms in sponsoring racing, for precisely the same reason we should welcome the Minister's decision in this regard to relieve the Racing Board of this imposition so that they can make their contribution to what is really the same thing as sponsoring a classic race which would compare with other classic races in France and Great Britain.  If we fail to do this or if we put the Racing Board in a position in which they are no longer able to do so, then we might do the bloodstock industry of this country a very desperate injury which in a relatively short time might become irreparable.</P>
    <P>I rarely praise the Minister for Finance but in this case I think he was right to admit he was wrong.  It is silly if you make a mistake to stick your heels in the ground and refuse to listen to remonstrance or protestation and say what is done cannot be undone.  I say he was right in his decision on this matter but I think everyone of us here must feel considerable concern and dismay that we should relieve horseracing and bets from the impact of the turnover tax while we maintain it on the essentials of food, fuel and clothing of our people.  I would find it extremely difficult, if I were Minister for Finance, to come to the Dáil and confront the House with such a proposal. Happily, I am in a position now that I can endorse it because I believe I will be in a position to remove that anomaly and to ensure that this turnover tax will no longer bear on the food, fuel and clothing of our people.</P>
    <P>In that conviction I approve the <Col N="1265" /> proposal to remove this impost of £50,000 from the Racing Board, this proposal to reverse the decision originally taken to reduce their resources by this sum.  I approve it because I am convinced that the restoration of this £50,000 to the Racing Board will be used imaginatively and constructively for the promotion and protection of an industry vital to the country, which is becoming more and more competitive with the passing of every year and which could easily be squeezed out by those who would be glad to see it disappear in order that the bloodstock industries of their own countries could benefit thereby.  It is only those who have some familiarity with the circumstances and background of this industry who can probably fully appreciate the reasons for this concession.  But, with that knowledge, and in the light of the hopes I make bold to entertain, I am prepared to approve the proposal put forward by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is to relieve a very wealthy section of the community&mdash; the betting public who attend race meetings&mdash;of the burden of paying 2½ per cent turnover tax on their amusement.  How crazy can this Government get?  There are no grounds whatever for suggesting at this stage that the bloodstock industry is in jeopardy if the turnover tax is imposed on racecourse betting.  It is an insult to say of such a wealthy industry that, unless the turnover tax on course betting is removed, it is God help the future of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an interesting story concerning how this Supplementary Estimate came about.  The Minister was less than frank with the House in not giving the true story of this bit of political blackmail.  Recently, the racing committees in a number of towns were informed that the race meetings in their towns were to be cancelled.  These towns included Wexford, the Minister's area; Roscommon, my own area; Kilbeggan, Clonmel and Dundalk.  The racing committees were informed that the situation was very unhealthy as far as expense was concerned and the <Col N="1266" /> Board could no longer afford to subsidise racing at these centres.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the Racing Board had no intention of cancelling those meetings.  But they used this threat to these towns as a lever to obtain this £50,000 the Minister is giving the Board.  I know that when the Committee in Roscommon were informed there was to be an end to the subsidy there, there was a hullabaloo by those interested in racing.  The same applied in Wexford.  The screws were put on the Minister himself, as I know well. There was a protest in Clonmel and the same applied in Kilbeggan and Dundalk.  Now we find that, although the Racing Board said there could be no appeal, the decision is reversed and the subsidies are to continue to be given to these five centres.  What happened was that the Board got a guarantee from the Minister that the turnover tax would not be applied to course betting.  That was the bargain. That was agreed to by the Minister and the Board reversed their decision to put an end to the meetings in these towns.</P>
    <P>I, too, would like to see the bloodstock industry in a healthy state and see our exports in that field expand. However, I will not be put in the position of being told I am jeopardising the future of the industry by suggesting it is outrageous for the Government to exempt racecourse betting from the turnover tax when the necessaries of life are being taxed.  The Minister for Lands is on record in this House and outside it as saying that when the new Land Bill came in, and so far as land acquisition was concerned, he was going to get after those farmers who spent all their time going around to race meetings and who did not farm their lands.  But these are the gentlemen who are being facilitated today by this Supplementary Estimate.  This Estimate is to enable them go round to race meetings in their big Mercedes.  Instead of taxing luxuries, this Government are exempting luxuries and taxing necessaries.  Nobody could describe betting at racecourses as anything but a luxury. When there is a race meeting down the country it is not safe to be on the <Col N="1267" /> roads with the stream of traffic passing &mdash;all the big cars of the people who seem to go from one race meeting to another.  Their pastime is being exempted from the turnover tax.  It is disgraceful, and I wonder if the public realise what is happening in this regard. It is hard to credit that the Government could have their list of priorities so mixed up.</P>
    <P>The case made by the Racing Board for the cutting off of the subsidy to these provincial courses was based on the grounds that the income available to the Board was insufficient to allow them help the centres concerned.  But this is very significant: when the Board stated they were going to cut out the subsidy for the Roscommon course, they said at the same time that, even though the day's racing at Roscommon would be ended, they would provide a day's racing in some other part of the country.  There was not to be any reduction in the number of those meetings.  The idea was that the Racing Board would threaten to close down the meetings at Wexford, Mullingar and Kilbeggan but that they would put on extra meetings at Baldoyle, Leopardstown and other places nearer Dublin.</P>
    <P>The argument put forward by them was that they could not afford to subsidise the rural race meetings.  If a trainer in Limerick wanted to send a horse to the Roscommon meeting, the Racing Board subsidised the transport of the horse from Limerick to Roscommon.  The idea put forward was that they could not afford to do that any longer but do not forget that by putting on the extra races at Baldoyle or Leopardstown, they were going to have to subsidise the same Limerick trainer to send the same horse to Baldoyle or Leopardstown.</P>
    <P>It is absolute blackmail on the part of the Racing Board to say that they will hit the rural race meetings, unless they are exempted from the turnover tax but they got away with it.  They said to themselves that there would be a howl from the members of the public who attended these racing <Col N="1268" /> meetings and that pressure would be brought to bear on the Government. I know that was so.  When word came to my constituency that the meeting in Roscommon was to get the axe, I protested and I also suggested that the Parliamentary Secretary for the constituency should be made aware of the situation and that any influence which he might be able to bring to bear should be roped in also.  It was only at that stage that we realised that the Minister himself was under fire in his own constituency because Wexford was another of the meetings to get the axe.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Racing Board utilised this threat of closing down the provincial meetings for no other purpose than to obtain exemption from turnover tax on racecourse betting.  I suggest that a Government who allowed that to happen when they would not exempt the necessaries of life from that turnover tax deserve what I believe they will get before to-morrow night is out.  The only trouble is that the public are not sufficiently well aware of what is going on and what is being exempted from the tax.  I hope that it is not too late before the polling booths close this evening to persuade the people, no matter what they may think about the different Parties, that a party who exempt luxuries and tax the necessaries of life are not fit to govern.</P>
    <P>Can we describe a race meeting as anything but a luxury?  Racing is a recreation and betting at race meetings is a luxury and a recreation.  I am not going to believe that the money taken in tax on racecourse betting is going to mean the difference between disaster and survival for our bloodstock industry. I could not accept that view.  If it is necessary to have high stakes for particular race meetings in this country, let us not suggest that it is necessary to get that money through racecourse betting alone.  We have had the examples set by a number of private firms who have contributed stake money for these races.  I assume that those firms are writing off that contribution in a form of advertising and that they will be exempted from income <Col N="1269" /> tax for their activity in this regard.</P>
    <P>I shall not name the particular races which we know are carrying substantial rewards given by various firms in this country but we know there are quite a few.  Have these firms not got it both ways?  Have they not got the advertising value, a form of publicity in that the name of the firm is carried by the race, and are they not also getting an exemption from income tax by the fact that they are spending this money on advertising?</P>

I would be inclined to give incentives in that way if we want to aid this industry but I do not think that the general public, many of whom are not interested in betting, should now be asked to pay additional taxation for what those who are interested in betting should be paying. That is what is wrong.  I believe the Minister has lost all sense of responsibility to the general public.  He is now saddling them with an impost of £50,000 in order to save the people who go to the races at Baldoyle or Mullingar or Leopardstown from the effects of the turnover tax.  I do not believe that is right.</P>

It was one of the things not considered before they brought in the turnover tax and they now find themselves faced with the situation as explained by Deputy Dillon and Deputy McQuillan.  As a result, they have to come in here with another Supplementary Estimate.  I would be quite satisfied that it is necessary for them to have the Estimate because if these race meetings were to be closed down, it would strike an irreparable blow at the horse-breeding industry here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next month we will have the Cheltenham Gold Cup and we have two famous horses racing in it.  One of these horses was bred and trained in Ireland and the other was bred in Ireland.  It is at the small country race <Col N="1270" /> meetings here that we train the horses which make Irish bloodstock famous all over the world. I am surprised that when this whole matter was being thought out, some consideration was not given to facts such as these.  It is really a matter of the Racing Board finding its funds depleted.  They had to do something and they withdrew the subsidy from these meetings.  The only thing the Minister could do was to introduce a Supplementary Estimate as he has done.  I hope that already grave damage has not been done, in that many of these companies concerned with these local meetings had to come together and go into liquidation and then at the eleventh hour, the Minister comes with a Supplementary Estimate which I hope will enable the situation to be rectified.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention any of the racecourses to which Deputy McQuillan referred.  I would be particularly interested in Wexford which I think would require particular consideration as a comparatively new meeting in existence for only six or seven years.  It hardly had time to get on its feet when it was faced with the situation of the subsidy being withdrawn and the only thing they could expect from the Racing Board was, we understand, that they would still be paid photo-finish expenses and some small Tote grant.  I should like the Minister to assure us that he has a guarantee from the Racing Board that the moneys that are being voted for them are subject to the re-establishment of these local race meetings in different parts of the country, thus preserving the encouragement of breeding that has been there throughout the years and that has reacted so favourably on Irish horseflesh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon was probably entitled to say that I was acknowledging my mistake in imposing this tax but I must remind the House that I had some misgivings about it when it was going through.  I told Deputy Cosgrave that I should be meeting the Racing Board to discuss the matter with them.  Twelve months earlier, they had told me they were <Col N="1271" /> very much afraid they could not carry on without State assistance.  At that time I suggested to them putting a higher levy on course betting and on the Tote.  They told me they had considered that carefully and had concluded that it would be impossible, that they would lose more than they would gain.  I knew what their mind was before the turnover tax was definitely decided on here when Deputy Cosgrave raised the matter.</P>
      <P>When the Racing Board came to see me, they expressed the same opinion when I suggested we should allow the Revenue Commissioners to impose a tax on course betting and on the Tote. They again said they thought they would lose very substantially in revenue and would prefer to leave things as they were and actually pay the turnover tax themselves.  That, of course, is done by the 2½ per cent on course betting which goes as turnover tax and racing gets nothing out of it. At that time when I met the Racing Board before Christmas, I was rather impressed by their arguments but since then I find that income from course betting and the Tote has been increasing fairly substantially over the past year.  I intend to meet the Racing Board again to put it to them that, as far as I can see, there would be no great danger in imposing a higher levy on course and Tote betting, and make some suitable arrangement with them with regard to a subvention for their own increased expenses.  It might be a sort of deal where we would get our turnover tax and they would get more by way of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did meet the Racing Board and I did agree to recoup them more than the tax because they had asked for a subvention before the turnover tax came along.  There is something here &mdash;not very much, I admit&mdash;more than the turnover tax.  That was over and done with before I heard of the small courses being notified by the Racing Board that they could no longer give them a subsidy.  Deputy McQuillan thinks I did some peddling in the matter.  I suppose every man looks at it from the point of view of what he would do if he were in the other man's <Col N="1272" /> place.  There was no peddling whatever. I told the Racing Board what I was thinking.  I received a deputation from the small courses.  They told me they were prepared to do certain things, such as reduce the level of stakes and, I think, cut out the carriage of horses because they claim most of the horses came from their own county.</P>

      <P>They suggested that.  I am not saying it was a definite promise.  They suggested meeting the Racing Board halfway as it were.  I conveyed their suggestions to the Racing Board and the reply I got was that the Racing Board could not agree to some of those things.  They did not want stakes reduced and would prefer to drop the matter altogether&mdash; which they did.  I do not know for how long.  Deputy Esmonde says he hopes I got an undertaking but I got no undertaking and so far as I am concerned, if they came along tomorrow and said they were dropping the small courses again, I could not say they had made any promises to me.</P>

      <Col N="1279" /> The purpose of this amendment is to resolve certain doubts which exist at present regarding the effect, in relation to registered land, of the vesting orders and certain other instruments made by the Land Commission under the Land Purchase Acts.  The Registration of Title Acts provide that the register shall be conclusive evidence of the title of an owner as appearing thereon and that a transfer of registered land shall not be effective until it is completed by registration. On the other hand, the relevant provisions of the Land Purchase Acts declare that a vesting order shall be effectual to vest land in the Land Commission or other person named therein.  The Land Commission is required to apply for registration of an order as soon as may be after it is made, but the Acts clearly do not envisage that the actual vesting of the land should be dependent on registration or that it should be capable of being defeated by the prior registration of a transferee for value.</P>

      <P>In page 33, to delete lines 45 and 46 and the words &ldquo;may be&rdquo;, in line 47 and substitute the following paragraphs:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  transfer or charge the said land or create a lien thereon by deposit of the land certificate (or, where that person is the Land Commission, exercise any other rights of ownership, including enforcement of the right to vacant possession), or</P>
      <P>(b)  transfer or charge the said charge or create a lien thereon by deposit of the certificate of charge,&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before section 107, but in Part III, <Col N="1281" /> to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Searches and Priority</P>
    <P>(1)  Any entry in, or index to, a register and any registry map may be inspected by any person at such times and on such conditions as may be prescribed.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any person may apply to the Registrar to make an official search in a register or registry map and to issue a certificate of the result of the search.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is of some importance.  The purpose of this amendment is to write into the Bill the principle that the registers are open to inspection by the public.  This principle was introduced in 1892 and it is an important feature of the system.  I consider that the principle is sufficiently important to warrant our declaring it in statutory form in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>Before section 107, but in Part III, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where the Registrar is satisfied that the person to whom a certificate of the result of an official search is issued has entered into a contract to purchase, take a lease of, or lend money on the security of a charge on, the land to which the certificate relates, the Registrar shall, at the request of that person, make an entry in the register in the prescribed form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  In any such case, an application for registration of the instrument to complete the contract shall, provided the application is in order and is delivered at the central office within a period of fourteen days <Col N="1282" /> after the date of issue of the certificate, rank in priority before any other application for registration made in respect of the land within that period.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an important innovation also. We hope by this amendment to provide a simple and foolproof method of official search by which purchases of registered land can be completed with absolute safety and without the need for personal attendance at the Land Registry.  The system which I am proposing will accord to purchasers a priority period of 14 days within which the transactions may be completed and registered.  In effect, an official search under the new section will not only reveal the existing state of the registered title but will also predetermine what the state of the title will be when the purchaser applies for registration.</P>

    <P>We are deleting something here because we were never quite sure why it was put in in the first place and nobody seems to be able to find out. The section deals with the powers of the Registration of Title Rules Committee to make general rules for the carrying into effect of the objects of the proposed Act.  The paragraph we propose to delete by this amendment refers to circumstances under which payment of solicitors' costs or fees may be remitted.  The rules have <Col N="1284" /> never dealt with the question of remission of costs and fees and nobody seems to be quite clear how they could, or in what circumstances they should, be remitted.  As far as one can see the paragraph is unnecessary and it is, therefore, being omitted.</P>

      <P>A slightly different situation arises here because there are some provisions in this Bill which may be somewhat controversial.  We indicated on the Second Stage that we are in agreement with the general principle of providing extradition machinery but there may be some controversial matters to be raised.  On the whole.  I think the best way to transact our Parliamentary business would be to recognise the fact that there is an election proceeding today, throw our hats at it, and adopt in regard to this Bill the same <Col N="1285" /> procedure as we adopted in regard to the other.  I am, however, bound to say to the Minister that this, unlike the previous Bill, is one on which there may be a clash of interests in respect of certain sections.  I am not inviting the Minister now to adopt this course on the same basis as I invited him to adopt it on the Registration of Title Bill, which I regard as a purely technical measure and one for technical discussion.  Here, there might be a different principle in respect of certain sections, but I would recommend to the Minister and the House that we should adopt the same procedure, deal with the ministerial amendments and recommit the others.</P>

There may, perhaps, be a fundamental approach on certain sections of this Bill and the view we take is that it is such a very important measure the same line of approach should be adopted as was adopted on the previous Bill.  I should also like to say that I cannot understand why a measure of this importance was introduced today when an Estimate, for instance, could have been brought before the House.  The Estimate for Health comes on tomorrow.  Why could that not have been brought on today? Perhaps the Government might have done themselves a good day's work if they had the Minister for Health inside this House today during the election instead of outside it.</P>

Franco is a Head of State and I have no doubt Spain will be one country with which we will have an extradition treaty.  Franco is a dictator. He is there by force, certainly not by the free will of the Spanish people.  We know how he got there. We know there are people who, if they want power, will use the only means they have to get it.

    <P>
      <Col N="1239" /> The index numbers for the Dublin District and for the twenty-three industrial occupations relate to the beginning of the year and are based on wage-rates as settled by collective agreements etc.  The General Index for Transport is based on weekly rates, average wage rates for a week in February being used for passenger road service employees and for a week in March in the case of railway employees.  The agricultural wage index numbers are based on the minimum weekly rates payable to adult male agricultural workers under the Agricultural Wages (Minimum Rates) Orders and relate to the month of July.  The information for 1964 is not yet available.</P>
    <P>There has, over the period, been a fairly considerable &ldquo;wage-drift&rdquo;, in that earnings have increased more rapidly than basic wage rates.</P>
    <P>The following set of indices of average weekly earnings of industrial workers in Transportable Goods industries to base October, 1953=100, when compared with the previous table, gives an indication of the extent of this phenomenon:</P>
