      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the information requested by the Deputy in so far as it is available.</P>
      <P>The Official Import List does not contain separate classifications for demersal fish apart from plaice (fresh, chilled or frozen), smoked coley and tusk and smoked cod.  It is believed, however, that demersal varieties account for most of the imports in the other categories covered by the statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Steps have already been taken to reconstitute this Association as a corporate body under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961.  I have certified, under section 8 of the Act, that it is a body to which the Act applies and a meeting of the Association has been called for the 25th instant, to pass the necessary resolution for the winding up of the company.  When the resolution has been passed, the Association will have been a corporate body within the meaning of the Act but it will be necessary to make an establishment order.  It is intended that the establishment order will make provision for a superannuation scheme for the staff of the Association, as contemplated in Section 4 of the Act.  While the principles of such a scheme have been settled in consultation with the Minister for Local Government, the drafting of the detailed provisions may delay the making of the order for some weeks.</P>

      <P>A proposal to create an office of deputy matron at St. Kevin's Hospital was submitted by the Dublin Health Authority to my Department on 11th July, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approved complement of senior supervisory nursing staff at this institution is a matron and six assistant matrons.  The Health Authority's proposal involved a departure from the existing staffing arrangements approved for local authority general hospitals and, as such, required examination. <Col N="1082" /> I am now satisfied that there is need for the creation of this new post at St. Kevin's Hospital and the necessary approval is being conveyed to the health authority.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy's questions refer to the South Tipperary constituency which comprises (1) all but a small portion of the administrative area of Tipperary (SR) County Council and (2) the western portion of the Waterford Health Authority area. The information given in the reply relates to the areas comprising the constituency and is in respect of a current date.</P>
      <P>The information given in reply to question No. 4 relates to the arrangements made by health authorities following the issue of a circular letter from my Department in September, 1961, which reminded health authorities that they are empowered to supply drugs and medicines, free of charge, under Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, to persons, who because of the financial hardship involved, are unable to meet the cost of these items, even though they do not hold medical cards.</P>
      <P>I understand that Question No. 5 refers to the scheme for the supply of hearing aids to health authority patients through the National Organisation for Rehabilitation, which commenced in 1963.</P>

Not alone is the picture he paints not true but it is utterly unrealisable as anybody connected with the bacon business knows.  Gammons which are part of the Wiltshire side, go through the same form of curing as the rest of the side and it is immaterial whether the pressure at which the brine is pumped into the gammon is 60 lbs. or more per square inch because it must be at least five days in the pickling tank and four draining afterwards, and if the pressure is not higher in the injection stage, it will absorb more of the pickle while in the curing tank.</P>

It was stated that the county council at their meeting of 30th September, 1963, had consented to the creation of the additional office.  The local authority's proposal of 22nd January, 1964, for the appointment of a person to the newly created office was sanctioned by me on 6th February, 1964.  The information furnished by the local authority indicated that the <Col N="1100" /> appointment was being made on the results of a competition held in August, 1963, which was open to the qualified officers of local authorities generally, including the staff of Laois County Council.  The person appointed was the next person in order of merit available from the results of that competition and he was certified by the local authority to be possessed of all the qualifications for appointment.</P>

      <P>I am aware that owing to depreciation in the market value of fixed interest stocks, moneys invested by direction of the High Court have in some instances, when subsequently realised, fallen substantially short of the original investment.

      <P>The amount involved would be very considerable.  I do not think there would be anything like the amount required left in the Funds of Suitors.  I agree it is very unfortunate that these people should suffer losses in this way but I do not think anybody can be blamed.  When the High Court directed the investment of the funds in particular stocks, these stocks were regarded by everybody at that time as giltedged.  Subsequently, developments proved that that assumption was incorrect.  Unfortunately, the persons concerned have had to bear the loss.  I do not think this can arise again because, since the passing of the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, the court has much greater discretion about the stocks in which to invest these funds.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision in the Registry of Deeds Acts for cancelling a memorial or withdrawing <Col N="1112" /> it from the Registry.  An inconvenient consequence of this is that memorials of mortgages remain on the register after the mortgages have been discharged. In so far as mortgages in favour of building societies are concerned an effort was made to remedy this situation in the Building Societies Act, 1874.  Section 42 of that Act provides that, when moneys secured by a mortgage have been repaid, the building society may endorse on the mortgage deed, or annex thereto, a receipt for the mortgage money.  The receipt operates to discharge the mortgage and to vest the mortgaged estate in the person entitled to the equity of redemption.  The section directs the Registrar of Deeds, on the production of the receipt verified on oath by any person, to make a note on the entry of the mortgage to the effect that it has been satisfied.  A negative search against the mortgagor must, therefore, disclose not only the entry of the mortgage but also the note of its satisfaction. This, of course, operates to the advantage of the applicant for the search and of the owner of the lands, while not adversely affecting the building society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill was foreshadowed in the Programme of Law Reform published in 1962.  The law regulating the trade of pawnbroking is contained basically in two statutes of Grattan's Parliament, and it is remarkable that, apart from some minor amendments, the law has remained untouched by the legislature for so long.  The statutes of 1786 and 1788 were, in fact, the first attempt of the Irish legislature to regulate the trade of pawnbroking here.  Before 1786 the usury laws then in force made it unlawful to charge more than 6 per cent per annum for the loan of money, however small the loan or great the trouble connected with it.  No doubt this made it difficult, if not impracticable, to carry on the trade of pawnbroking for small loans in an open and lawful manner. The Act of 1786 made it lawful for pawnbrokers to charge from twenty five to thirty per cent per annum.  This is evidenced in particular by section 17 of the Act, which provided that nothing in the Act &ldquo;should extend or be construed to extend to any person who should lend money at the rate of six per cent per annum only.&rdquo; Hence any pawnbroker who was satisfied with six per cent&mdash;and it must be assumed that even then there were very few&mdash;escaped the restrictions of the statute altogether.  This is still the law, but the case for repealing it without re-enactment in the present Bill will not, I feel, have to be argued very strongly to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of discussing the Bill now before us, I am prompted to assume that most Deputies will not be altogether unfamiliar with the intricacies of pawnbroking practice and procedure and that they will have little difficulty in understanding, for example, some of the peculiar terms used in the trade.  I would even hope that some may, indeed, have experienced <Col N="1117" /> the excitement of tracing their pawn through the sale book in the hope that its sale might have produced an &ldquo;overplus&rdquo;.  I trust, however, that such Deputies will bear with me if, for the benefit of the less experienced Deputies, I summarise the principles involved in the regulation of the pawnbroking trade by statute.</P>
    <P>There are, first of all, two classes of pawning, namely, those that come within the Pawnbroking Acts and those that do not.  The Acts apply at present where the loan does not exceed £10, and the pawnee is a pawnbroker within the statutory definition.  In all other cases the contract is governed by the general law.  However, we are only concerned here with pawning within the scope of the Pawnbroking Acts.</P>
    <P>The reasons for regulating smaller pawning transactions by statute may be stated briefly as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) to ensure that the pawner is given a ticket which will readily identify his property:</P>
    <P>(2) to vest the right to redeem the pledge in the person producing the ticket:</P>
    <P>(3) to enable the pawnbroker to make a specified charge for the ticket and, before releasing the goods on repayment of loan, to demand a maximum scale of interest in lieu of all other charges of handling, storing and insuring the pledge:</P>
    <P>(4) to make it lawful for the pawnbroker to realise the sum lent together with the interest due by the sale of the pledge at the end of a specified period if the pledge is not redeemed:</P>
    <P>(5) to oblige the pawnbroker to pay to the pawner on demand any surplus, termed overplus in the Acts, which the unredeemed pledge may have produced on sale, after deducting the amount of the loan and all lawful charges due; and</P>
    <P>(6) to ensure that the sale of unredeemed pledges is effected through public auction.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill before us is to have the statute law governing <Col N="1118" /> pawnbroking restated in a single modern statute.  Opportunity is being taken, however, to effect a number of amendments designed chiefly to simplify the law and make it suitable to modern needs.  A modest increase in pawnbroking charges is also being provided for to compensate for the substantial increases that have taken place over the years in the cost of conducting a pawnbroking business.  I shall deal in more detail in a moment with a number of the more important amendments proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It may be held by some that pawnbroking is dying out and that nothing should be done to keep it alive.  I do not accept this view.  Pawnbrokers have provided a very useful service to the community in the past.  It is true that the statistics available reveal a steady decline over recent years in the demand for the services offered by pawnbrokers&mdash;a decline which reflects the general improvement in the level of wages and employment and the expansion of credit facilities in other directions.  Despite these improvements, however, I believe there will still be room for the special loan facilities provided by pawnbrokers.  These facilities can be made all the more efficient and the interests of pawners better protected if the law governing pawnbroking is simplified and brought up to date, as the Bill proposes to do.</P>
    <P>The first amendment to which I should like to refer is contained in section 3 of the Bill.  As I have said, the existing statute law governs pawning transactions in which the loan does not exceed £10, and this limit has remained unchanged since 1788.  Having regard to the changes in money values that have since taken place, the Government consider it desirable that all pawning transactions not exceeding £50 should be brought within the scope of the statute.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the licensing of pawnbrokers.  The present requirements of the law in regard to licensing are detailed in paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 of the explanatory memorandum. It will be clear to Deputies that many of these requirements have <Col N="1119" /> long since become obsolete and that it is desirable to abolish them in favour of more modern procedures.  In addition, there is no reason for not applying uniform procedures to the Dublin and provincial pawnbrokers and abolishing the present differentiation. Section 8 of the Bill provides, therefore, that a pawnbroker should be required only to obtain a licence for each premises at which he carries on business.  This licence will be renewable annually and will be granted by the Revenue Commissioners on payment of the appropriate duty to be fixed by the Minister for Finance in the Finance Act and on presentation of a certificate of suitability from the District Court for which provision is made in section 10.</P>
    <P>In considering the grant or otherwise of a certificate of suitability, it is proposed that the District Court should have regard, amongst other things, to the character of the applicant, the suitability of his premises and the kind of business, if any, in which the applicant is already engaged.  A right of appeal to the Circuit Court against refusal by the District Court to grant the certificate of suitability is also being provided.</P>
    <P>The changes proposed in licensing procedure will have the effect of abolishing the duty of £92 6s. 2d. which each pawnbroker carrying on business within the Dublin Metropolitan Police District is now obliged to pay each year to the local authority. This duty, which is in addition to the present excise duty of £7 10s. 0d. was originally imposed by a local Act of 1804 which applied the duty to defraying the charges of preserving the peace within the city of Dublin.  There can be no case for continuing the payment of this duty to the local authority. Indeed it is noteworthy that its abolition was recommended as far back as 1868 in the report of a Commission of Inquiry into the pawnbroking laws. The loss of revenue to the local authorities will not be significant, £1,200 in the case of the Dublin Corporation and £92 6s. 2d. in the case of the Corporation of Dun Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> The Government's proposals regarding pawnbroking charges are contained in Section 20 of and the Fifth Schedule to the Bill.  They are discussed in relation to the existing lawful charges in detail in paragraph 25 of the Explanatory Memorandum.  The Government have accepted the representations of the Irish Pawnbrokers' Association that the present lawful charges, which have remained unchanged since 1825, are now inadequate and should be increased to provide some compensation for the substantial increases that have since taken place in the costs of conducting a pawnbroking business.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland rates of interest were increased in 1954.  Up to then they had been identical with the rates allowed here.  In the case of Britain, a slight increase was allowed in 1922 on the old 1872 rates.  A further increase in British charges was granted in an Act of 1960, which, although reverting to pre-1922 interest rates, provided for the first time for a &ldquo;valuation&rdquo; charge of 2d. per five shillings, limited, however, to loans of £5 or under.  Having considered the merits of raising the interest rates, as was done in Northern Ireland or of following the method adopted in Britain in 1960, the Government came to the conclusion that the introduction here of a &ldquo;valuation&rdquo; or &ldquo;service&rdquo; fee, would be the most appropriate method of meeting the higher costs of conducting pawnbroking business.  A new fee, described as a valuation fee, of 2d. on each five shillings or part of five shillings of a loan is, therefore, being provided for in Part III of the Fifth Schedule.  The fee will be chargeable only on loans not exceeding £10.  In the case of loans over £10, special contracts will be allowed, which I shall deal with separately later on.</P>
    <P>The proposals in regard to certain other lawful charges provide some modification of the present charges in favour of the pawner.  The supplementary interest fee of ½d. on loans not exceeding 18/- is being abolished. At this point, I must apologise if Deputies have been misled by the information given in the explanatory memorandum concerning this particular fee.  The fee chargeable is in fact <Col N="1121" /> a halfpenny for a loan of any amount not exceeding 18/- and not a halfpenny for each 2/- of such loan, as is stated in paragraph 25 (1) (b) of the memorandum.  A standard charge of 2d. is being provided for pawn-tickets, and this will replace the existing charge of 1d. to 4d., according to the amount of the loan.  The formula for the calculation of interest in respect of loan periods of less than a month after the first month is also being modified in favour of the pawner.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill will also amend the existing redemption period, that is to say, the period during which pledges remain redeemable and may not be disposed of by a pawnbroker. At present the period runs from six months to 12 months, according to the amount of the loan.  The Government have accepted the representations of the Irish Pawnbrokers' Association that the present redemption period is too long and operates in many cases to the detriment of both the pawner and the pawnbroker.  Since 1960, pawnbrokers in Britain are not required to keep pledges longer than six months. The proposal in section 21 of the Bill represents a compromise between the British provision and our existing law. While the redemption period is being reduced to six months generally, provision is being made for an extension not exceeding a further period of six months if interest due is paid within the original redemption period. Moreover, the more valuable pledges, that is to say, articles of gold, silver etc., are provided for specially and must be retained by the pawnbroker for a period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of the disposal of unredeemed pledges, in other words, pledges remaining unredeemed at the end of the redemption period.  As I stated earlier, the law requires that all unredeemed pledges be sold by public auction.  However, this is not being observed outside the Dublin area, for the reasons stated in paragraph 35 of the explanatory memorandum, which also sets out the obsolete nature of some of the provisions now governing the disposal of unredeemed pledges.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland, the law was <Col N="1122" /> amended in 1954 and in effect unredeemed pledges now become the pawnbrokers' own property and may be disposed of as they think fit.  In Britain, unredeemed pledges pawned for £2 or less become the pawnbroker's own property; but all other pledges must be sold by public auction, though pawnbrokers are free to select any auctioneer for this purpose.</P>
    <P>It is considered that the pawners' interests would best be served by continuing the general requirement of having unredeemed pledges sold by auction through auctioneers specially nominated for the purpose by the Minister for Justice and this is proposed in Sections 29 and 30 of the Bill.  However, in order to provide some relief to pawnbrokers from the rigorous requirements of the present law, at least in the case of the less important transactions, Section 29 includes a provision on the lines of the British provision excluding pledges pawned for £2 or under from the general requirement of sale by public auction.  The relief will not, however, extend to pledges of gold, silver, etc., pawned for £2 or under, which will continue to be disposed of by public auction.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Bill is an entirely new provision and meets very strong representations made by the Irish Pawnbrokers' Association that pawnbrokers here be allowed to enter into special contracts as they are in Britain. In Britain, the law allows a pawnbroker to make a special contract with a pawner where the loan exceeds £5, but he must deliver to the pawner a special pawn-ticket specifying the terms of the contract, a duplicate of which must be signed by the pawner at the same time.  A special contract is within the provisions of the Pawnbrokers Acts, except in so far as the provisions are excluded by the terms of the special contract itself.  The need for special contract arises, in the main, where large or very valuable articles are offered in pawn, such as furniture, cars, etc., involving special storing and insurance arrangements, which in turn warrant special terms.  While the Association's representations have been accepted it is proposed that the provision <Col N="1123" /> for special contract will operate only where the loan exceeds £10.</P>
    <P>These are the more important amendments proposed in the Bill and I hope that what I have said gives the House a fair outline of the scope of the measure.  I also hope that the marginal notes inserted on the Bill itself and the detailed Explanatory Memorandum will be of assistance to Deputies.  The Bill has been discussed with the Irish Pawnbrokers' Association and a number of minor amendments will be introduced at Committee Stage to meet representations made.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, I think no one will object to this Bill.  As the Minister has indicated, it is a considerable number of years since anyone had a look at the law regulating pawnbroking business and practice.  The House will probably agree that the Bill is necessary, that it is worthwhile bringing it in, but my own feeling is that there are very many other aspects of the law reform programme which might have been given priority.  For example, the proposals that exist in relation to the Wills Act would be a matter of considerably greater and more urgent importance than a Bill of this kind. However, I am mentioning that not as an objection to the Bill before us but simply as a reminder to the Minister that there are a number of matters in his Department still to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated, quite correctly, that pawnbroking in this country is, to some extent at any rate, a dying business.  I have not got the type of personal experience of which the Minister spoke in dealing with pawnbrokers but I certainly appreciate that for quite a considerable section of our people in the city of Dublin, pawnbrokers do provide an extremely useful service, and a useful service of a simple sort which enables poor people to raise a loan with a minimum amount of red tape and in the certainty that the article they are giving to the pawnbroker by way of pledge can be redeemed.  It is, therefore, <Col N="1124" /> desirable that both from the point of view of the pawnbroker and the point of view of the pawner, legislation should be brought up to date.</P>
    <P>Most of the matters which will arise on the discussion of this Bill are matters which are more appropriate to the Committee Stage.  The House will have been interested to discover from the explanatory memorandum issued with the Bill that in relation to some functions, at any rate, the Minister is the successor of the Lord Lieutenant. I am rather disappointed, however, that in relation to those functions which are connected with the appointment of auctioneers to dispose of unredeemed pledges, the Minister did not take this opportunity to put out of the way of temptation the political patronage aspect of this matter.</P>
    <P>I see no reason at all why the auctioneers to be appointed for the auctioning off of unredeemed pledges should not be appointed either by the Pawnbrokers' Association or by the Auctioneers' Association.  There may have been some reason in the days of the Lord Lieutenant why it was felt necessary that he should have a hand in the appointment of auctioneers for this purpose.  I do not see any reason for it today.  The only purpose of preserving that power of appointment and vesting it in the Minister for Justice is the possibility of political patronage. The Minister will agree with me in this, that many people are cynical about political affairs and political life today because they suspect at times, I think quite wrongly, that there is too much political patronage in operation in this country.  It is a great pity the Minister did not take the opportunity presented to him by the introduction of this Bill of dissociating himself from what I call the political patronage aspect of the appointment of these auctioneers.</P>
    <P>At the time when it was considered necessary under the laws passed in the 1700s to appoint auctioneers for this purpose, the auctioneering business was not to any extent as well organised or as well regulated as it is today.  There is now a governing body, the Auctioneers' Association.  The auctioneering business is regulated by <Col N="1125" /> Act of Parliament.  There is the requirement for auctioneers, before they can set up in the auctioneering business, that they will maintain a bond in the High Court.  In those circumstances, the Legislature should have some confidence in the governing body of the Auctioneers' Association and should invite them to make these appointments.  If that does not satisfy the Minister, there is in existence a Pawnbrokers' Association and I would suggest, as an alternative, that he might invite them to make the nomination or at least to make suggestions with regard to it.</P>
    <P>The other matters I wish to raise are more detailed and would be more appropriate for Committee discussion but the Minister might be able to give his views on them.  I cannot understand why in this Bill it is not possible to set out a definite commencing date on which the Act is to come into operation. It is set out in section 1 of the Bill that the Act will come into operation on such day as may be fixed by order of the Minister.  Generally speaking, I do not think it is desirable that the operation of legislation passed by the Oireachtas should depend on ministerial order.  It puts the Minister into a position to decide whether or not legislation passed by this House and passed by the Seanad will be operated at all.</P>
    <P>I know that in some cases such as, for example, the recent Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, where complicated regulations of one kind or another have to be made, it is necessary to provide for the coming into operation of the Act by ministerial order.  No one can say with any certainty when the necessary groundwork by way of making regulations, and so on, will be completed but in this Bill it does not seem to me to be at all necessary to have it depending on ministerial order.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely clear either why, in the part of this Bill dealing with pledges which have been destroyed or damaged by fire, the total obligation placed on the pawnbroker in those circumstances is simply to pay half the amount lent on the article.  It would seem to me appropriate that if a person <Col N="1126" /> pledges an article, he should get back the value of the article from the pawnbroker.  Obviously allowance must be made for the amount which he has already received on loan, but I think the Minister will agree with me that when an article is pawned, it is unlikely that it is taken at its intrinsic value.  There is provision in this Bill for a valuation to be made, but I am not at all clear as to whether it is to be taken as the market value or the intrinsic value of the article.  It may be that the provision which the Minister has written into this Bill is the fairest method of dealing with it, but I should like him to have another look at it.</P>
    <P>There are some provisions in Part IV of the bill which seem to place an undue burden on pawnbrokers.  For example, under section 35 where they have been notified by the Garda of stolen property, they are required to &ldquo;take all reasonable steps to detain any person offering or showing such property&rdquo;&mdash;that is property which they think might fall within the description of stolen property which has been notified to them by the Garda.  Subsection (3) of Section 35 provides that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A pawnbroker who fails to comply with a requirement of subsection (2) of this section shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;  I do not know what is intended by the phrase: &ldquo;shall take all reasonable steps to detain el&rdquo; but it does seem to imply&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it would be governed by the relative physical proportions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the point to which I was coming.  It does seem to imply that a pawnbroker will be required to use physical force to detain a person, and it may be that the pawnbroker will not be of a physique which would enable him to do that with any show of confidence, but if he does not make an effort, according to the Bill, he is committing an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the same type of provision in sections 36 and 37.  The marginal note to section 37 is: &ldquo;Duty of pawnbroker in certain suspicious circumstances&rdquo;, and the section goes on to <Col N="1127" /> say what the suspicious circumstances are.  Again, in subsection (2) it is provided that &ldquo;the pawnbroker shall immediately report the circumstances to a member of the Garda Síochána at the nearest Garda Síochána station and shall take all reasonable steps to detain the person and seize the article or pawn-ticket and to deliver the person and the article or pawn-ticket as soon as practicable into the custody of a member of the Garda Síochána.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There again we have a situation in which the pawnbroker is required to take physical action to detain a person. I think that is a little hard on the pawnbroker.  The Minister will appreciate that there is not any provision in legislation at the moment for paying compensation to people who go to the assistance of the Garda Síochána, or for paying compensation to people, such as pawnbrokers, who under this legislation have the onus placed on them of taking some physical action to implement the law.  If they are hurt, or injured, or suffer loss or damage, in endeavouring to carry out this legislation, there is no provision in this Bill, or in any Act I know of, which would enable them to claim compensation for the loss, or damage, or injury which may be occasioned to them.  I think the Minister would do well to look at those sections again.</P>
    <P>Apart from those remarks, I do not think I have anything to say in regard to this Bill.  It may be necessary to suggest some amendments on Committee Stage.  The Minister indicated that he intends to introduce amendments on Committee Stage.  A similar situation arose in connection with another Bill introduced by the Minister recently when he came into the House with the Bill and, on Second Reading, said that he proposed amending it this way or that way on Committee Stage.  It would make it easier all round if the Minister would hold his fire until the amendments are ready and incorporated in the Bill.  It would certainly make discussion here easier.</P>

      <P>I suppose one could easily find oneself ruled out of <Col N="1128" /> order if one tried to trace any relevance between this pedestrian discussion and what is transpiring at the present moment in other parts of the country but, at the same time, there seems to be some association of ideas. Listening to Deputy O'Higgins, I was struck by his reference to the auctioning of unredeemed pledges, and by his reference to political patronage. Even in a matter of this kind, which is ideal on a day such as this for discussion in a House, in which attendance is sparse, there is an important undercurrent which concerns us all. However, it is unfortunate that political Parties had no claim on those pledges in years gone by or they might have benefited by inspection of pawnbrokers' registers.</P>

      <P>It is obviously a measuring-stick, if you like, of the social progress that has been made in the past 40 years so far as the people are concerned.  I should imagine the people who make most use of pawnshops nowadays are not the same kind of people as had perforce to make use of them in their heyday, but people who can be seen furtively entering very respectable jewellery shops, which do not display the three brass balls outside, in order to carry out the business <Col N="1129" /> of pledging goods of that kind.  The pawnshops which formerly depended upon the tenement areas have been slowly disappearing for want of business. That is socially good, but, at the same time, I suppose it does not augur well for those engaged in the pawnbroking business, or those whom they employ.  It strikes me the Minister is doing a good thing in trying to simplify and bring up to date the law in this matter.  There was, I think, an official &mdash;I do not know if there is any reference to him in the Bill&mdash;associated with this business of pawnbroking called a City Marshal, if I am not mistaken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is agreed that this pawnbroking business is a dying business.  As has just been said, it is a good thing to see that the use of this particular method of raising loans for short periods appears to be disappearing because of the much improved conditions of the people who previously had been taking advantage of it.  I notice particularly the disappearance of one category, those who were thrown on the pawnbroker for immediate relief, that is, the type of person who, having pawned or pledged some item, goes to somebody else to borrow the amount of money necessary to redeem the pledge.  In many cases it used to be somebody pawning his Sunday suit until wages day came around, taking it out for a day or two and then bringing it back <Col N="1130" /> again.  It is good to see that it is now recognised that the improvement in the standard of living of our people and greater security in their employment has brought about that development which has had its reaction on the pawnbroking business as a whole.</P>
      <P>There is one section of the Bill to which I should like the Minister to give some further thought.  It has been slightly referred to by Deputy M. J. O'Higgins.  The pawnbroker generally does not give the full value of the article sought to be pledged for a loan.  In fact, I agree with Deputy M. J. O'Higgins that it is much lower than its value.  We come to this part of the Bill which tries to regulate for the benefit of the person who has borrowed on that item pledged and is not able to redeem it.  If the article is not redeemed within the period, it is then sold by auction and, according to the Act, the pawnbroker is supposed to keep the amount of money he lent, plus a reasonable amount of interest, and any surplus should go back to the original owner.  But the trouble is that it is suggested&mdash;only when claimed by the owner.  How is the owner to know? I think the pawnbroker should keep the name and address carefully on his books and the person who originally pledged the item should be notified.  If then there is no response, the surplus should be handed to some Government Department or public custodian and kept by the State for a certain period of time.  Many poor people may have left the country intending to come back after a certain period but have stayed away longer and consequently the article is lost to them.  The same applies to the value of the pledged item which may be damaged or lost in fire.  I think there should be some safeguard for those who are affected in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy M. J. O'Higgins mentioned another aspect, that is, the duty of the pawnbroker, when he is suspicious that the article pledged with him for a loan may have been stolen, regarding the precautions he must take.  Again, I want to draw the Minister's attention to the difference between a person offering stolen property to a pawnbroker and to a jewellery firm who has <Col N="1131" /> displayed in its window a notice that it buys gold, and so forth.  In the case of a known pawnbroker accepting goods which are later discovered to have been stolen, he is liable to very severe punishment and penalties, because he has to prove that when he bought these items, he was not suspicious of their having been stolen and gave full value for them.  Where it can be proved that the value given was such that the purchaser must have known there was something wrong about the transaction, he could find himself in Mountjoy for having bought stolen property.  He should have known by the price quoted by the person offering it that there was good ground for suspicion.  As regards the pawnbroker, I think some new thought should be given to that part too, because it is known that over the years quite an amount of stolen property has been pledged with pawnbrokers but pledged by the person with full knowledge that he was not going to pay back the money but had got rid of the article which he had come by and which was not his own.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to give the matter some further thought.</P>
    <P>Generally, I think the measure is non-contentious but certain amendments are due, but as time goes on, notwithstanding the fact that certain people will go out of business and be unemployed as a result, I hope to see the day when the need for pawnbroking transactions will have long been forgotten.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, as Deputy M. J. O'Higgins pointed out, has brought in this legislation at a time when, as the Minister assured us, there does not appear to be any great need for it, and at a time when, as far as we know, there is other legislation which could be of value to the community, were it introduced and passed through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existence of the pawnbroker's establishment and its continued existence, even though in reduced numbers, is, I think, a criticism of society, because while the Minister's general approach to the Bill seems to suggest that the pawnbroker's establishment <Col N="1132" /> was a useful outlet for the young blood in temporary financial difficulties, in fact the bulk of the people using these establishments still are unfortunate working-class mothers who are in serious need of absolute essentials. Therefore, I think the existence of the pawnbroker's establishment in a country at all is an implicit criticism of the society in which there is the need for that type of institution.</P>
    <P>This makes it quite clear that the stop-gap charity organisations which are usually found in a society such as ours have not answered the needs of families in financial distress.  You find the mother on the Monday or the Tuesday&mdash;this is my experience in my constituency&mdash;unable to pay the electric light bill or the bill for food or clothes for the children.  She has to try to find the money by pawning essential goods&mdash;blankets and clothing or anything of that sort that might be taken by the pawnbroker.</P>
    <P>This is not a criticism of pawnbrokers themselves, because as has been said, they provide a useful service, but a service which nobody should find himself in need of.  The fact that there has been a drop in the number of such establishments in this country has been used here, as it has in England, as proof that there has developed a greater measure of affluence in our society and that because of that, there is less need for this sort of credit.  However, certainly so far as we are concerned, while there has been a reduction&mdash;the Minister says the number has been reduced considerably&mdash;I do not think we should take too much credit or become too complacent because whatever may be true about other countries, it is true here that one of the ways in which we have reached this relative affluence is by the forced emigration of hundreds of thousands of people.  Let them stay in the country and we will probably find there is still a great need for pawnbroking at the level at which it was 40 years ago.  Like so many of the superficial improvements in our society, I think this one could be shown in its own way to be merely superficial.</P>
    <P>Taking the general suggestion of <Col N="1133" /> the advance in affluence here, the disappearance of the pawnbroker should be taken together with the appearance in our society, over the past 20 years in particular, of hire-purchase transactions.  Here we have a new type of pawnbroking, if you like to call it that.  Here the person is still in serious need of ready money that he can lay his hands on quickly for the provision of necessaries or of articles which are now becoming necessaries.  Therefore, I think it is premature for the Minister and Deputy Briscoe to claim that it is this emergence of our affluent society that has led to the virtual disappearance of the pawnbroker, because 80 per cent to 90 per cent of our people are still living on borrowed money&mdash;furnishing their houses on borrowed money, driving around in cars bought with borrowed money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that in my opening statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, there is still a very high content of that type of living in our society.  It really amounts to this: while there has been a virtual disappearance of the small credit facilities the pawnbroker afforded, there are still tremendous credit facilities on which the average family can draw, has to draw on in order to live in moderate comfort in our type of society.</P>
      <P>Still, I think it is wrong that so many families do find it necessary to use the pawnbroker's establishment. It is essentially a sordid substitute for social justice and our people should not be placed in this position.  I think the Minister, in bringing in this type of legislation is tacitly accepting the continued existence of this kind of establishment in our society for some considerable time to come.  If he were satisfied that there was to be a continued expansion in our economy, our affluence, then he would not find it necessary to confront the House at this time with this amendment to antiquated legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few points in the Bill itself about which I should like to question the Minister.  Section 9 provides that a pawnbroker may <Col N="1134" /> transfer his licence to another person. If a pawnbroker is guilty of any offence, if he is convicted in the courts, is this a way in which he can transfer his business and continue to do business under the name of his wife, or son, or some other eligible person, and in that way invalidate the decision of the court that he should cease to be a pawnbroker?</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the reasons for the objection to an auctioneer as a pawnbroker, and indeed the problem in relation to bookmakers.  <i>Prima facie</i>, I can see there is an objection to a pawnbroker having a bookmaker's establishment or a public house in the same building as the pawnbroking establishment, but is there any objection to his holding a licence for a public house or a bookmaker's licence in respect of different establishments?</P>
    <P>In regard to the provision of a certificate for the removal of the onerous provisions under section 10, what has the Minister in mind, or is there any fixed sum in mind in regard to proof of a person's financial stability?  The section says the person has to satisfy the court that he is financially stable.  What roughly is the figure, or how does one satisfy the court that one is a person of financial stability?</P>
    <P>There is another small point.  Why has the Minister changed the age, in section 19, from 14 to 16, of a person who can pawn?  How is a person in the business to tell that a person is either 14 or 16?  Can the pawnbroker ask for a birth certificate, or what mechanism is to be employed to carry out this provision?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the subsection dealing with the person who appears to be intoxicated, what is the pawnbroker to do in that situation? The Minister knows well the trouble the Minister for Local Government has had in regard to the definition of a drunken driver.  Is there any point putting in a provision of that kind where the pawnbroker might say &ldquo;I did not think he was drunk&rdquo; or &ldquo;I smelled drink from him but el&rdquo;? Is there any point putting in a section like this which would be very difficult for either side to prove in court, particularly if the person was not charged at the time he was alleged to be intoxicated?</P>
      <P>In regard to the auctioneer, why is it the Minister must nominate an auctioneer for the sale of the pledged goods?  Why is the alternative suggested by Deputy O'Higgins not acceptable to the Minister?  In regard to the taking of stolen property, it always seems to me to be a very difficult matter from the point of view of the pawnbroker.  How is he to show he did not know a certain object was stolen property?  In regard to the list supplied by the Garda of stolen property or property fraudulently come by, would it be a defence for the pawnbroker to say that, since the object did not appear on the list, he could not have known it was stolen?  For that reason, would he be free of a charge that he had received stolen goods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to section 37, I join with Deputy O'Higgins in asking what would be responsible steps for a pawnbroker to take in attempting to stop somebody who he believes is attempting to pawn something stolen.  Would &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo; merely mean saying: &ldquo;Stay there a moment; I will be back&rdquo;, while he goes out and rings up the Guards?  Or would it mean <Col N="1136" /> saying: &ldquo;You must not move until I get a Guard&rdquo; and, if the person says: &ldquo;I am going anyway&rdquo;, is he to throw himself at the person?  Assuming the average pawnbroker probably would take the first choice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The proposals in the Bill will bring the law relating to pawnbroking up to date and make a number of changes which have already been adverted to and which are necessary in view of the very considerable changes which have occurred since the two Acts under which pawnbrokers operate were enacted.  Indeed, I suppose it is an interesting matter to reflect on that very few businesses are at present conducted under legislation passed in the <Col N="1137" /> pre-union Parliament known as Grattan's Parliament.  Both of the Acts under which pawnbrokers operate now are nearly two hundred years in existence.  Undoubtedly, many changes have occurred in the meantime in values and so on, as well as the changes in more recent times which have had an effect on the volume of business conducted by pawnbrokers.  The changed pattern of life and the very substantial growth of hire-purchase have certainly absorbed some of the activities formerly undertaken by pawnbrokers. At the same time, pawnbrokers render a service and provide arrangements which satisfy the needs of certain categories in the community.  Therefore, the law should be amended and the amendments proposed in this Bill go a considerable distance towards meeting present day needs.</P>
      <P>I noted from the Minister's introductory speech that he had received representations and suggestions from the Pawnbrokers Association and that he proposed to incorporate these suggestions&mdash;or some of them, at any rate &mdash;in amendments for the Committee Stage.  If I might suggest it, it would help if the Minister's amendments were circulated as soon as they are ready so that those of us who contemplate amendments may decide whether the amendments proposed by the Minister meet the views which have been expressed to us.</P>

      <P>The matters of importance in this measure have already been referred to.  I agree with the views expressed here that any licenced auctioneer ought to be free to conduct a sale if he so desires.  I think the wording of this section in the Bill is open to some objection, in so far as it may be the cause of embarrassment to the Minister that he should have the responsibility of selecting a particular auctioneer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand, the practice in the trade is that so far as Dublin is concerned there are only two auctioneers who conduct pawnbrokers' sales.  I imagine it unlikely that, even though <Col N="1138" /> the opportunity is made available to auctioneers to apply for it, because of the peculiarities of the trade and the tradition that has grown up, any other auctioneer would be interested.  At the same time, I believe it desirable that once auctioneers are licensed&mdash;and of course in this we have the fact that auctioneers operate only because they are licensed under the Auctioneers Acts and have satisfied the courts it should be open to them to engage in it before licences are issued to them.  The changes and conditions laid down for pawnbrokers seem generally satisfactory. There are, however, certain matters in the Schedules as well as in some of the sections which probably require amendment.</P>
    <P>In Section 19, there is a provision that a pawnbroker shall not purchase or take in pawn or exchange the pawnticket issued by him or by another pawnbroker.  I understand it is the unwritten code of the trade that a pawnbroker does not purchase the ticket of another pawnbroker.  In Section 21, there is a provision that watches, say, up to £2 in value should be kept for six months.  An expensive stainless steel watch need not be kept whereas a rolled gold or gilt watch must be kept.  I understand from those with experience in the trade that a cheap watch, if kept for a long period, could deteriorate rapidly.  That might require some amendment.</P>
    <P>Under the old Acts, fees were determined and in this case I think fees should be determined so that a pawnbroker will know his liability.  Possibly some portion of the fee might be paid by the public or those who pawn. There is a provision in Section 32 in regard to sales and it seems to me there may be some confusion between the system which operates here and that which operates in Britain.  I understand the system here is that each pawnbroker has a complete sale: in Britain, the practice is to have a mixed sale and an auctioneer may have a sale from two or more pawnbrokers.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of discussion on Section 35 and the section might require further consideration so <Col N="1139" /> that there will be no doubt about the responsibility of a pawnbroker and the extent to which he may be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, but most people know the significance of them. In the Schedules, certain changes are suggested, including some regarding printing.  I feel that the alterations may impose too great a burden on pawnbrokers.  Formerly train tickets carried rather excessive provisions on the back and in some cases even sections of the Acts or references to them.  Nowadays that seems to be done away with: the bye-laws are laid down and published at the principal stations or the head office and if anybody wants to refer to them, he can do so there.  In the past certain requirements might have been necessary, but if the main points are written at the bottom of the ticket and a number put on each ticket, that should suffice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A suggestion has been made that the name of the pawner and his address should appear on the ticket. Quite a number who do business with pawnbrokers, I understand, object to that and to any suggestion that their identity could be divulged.  As the Third Schedule is drafted, it suggests a pawnbroker should have one type of ticket for loans up to £10 and another <Col N="1140" /> up to £2.  I understand there is a difficulty in this, that it would mean two lots of tickets as well as two lists of numbers and day books.  Those who are qualified to speak on it say the existing practice is the only workable one&mdash;to use consecutive numbers.  Apparently, if an article is pawned and subsequently redeemed and re-pawned or re-pledged, the practice is to write out a new ticket; it does not merely mean changing the date and continuing the same ticket. Any other system, it is said, causes confusion and difficulty.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Fifth Schedule, I note from the Minister's remarks that certain changes are proposed because I gather that there is some error in the way it is worded and that the interest may be excessive.  It has been suggested to me in regard to the proviso in 2(b) that seven days grace should be provided instead of three and that it would be more satisfactory; and also that the idea of a half month is not workable and that in fact it would involve farthings.  We have had enough discussion about farthings recently and the scarcity of that coin not to re-embark on it.  The statutory declaration in Part 2 of the Sixth Schedule might also require changes, including the date, description and the amount as well as some of the wording of the Seventh Schedule which may not be necessary.  Amendment is also desirable there.  Subject to these remarks and to any discussion on the Committee Stage, the proposed changes should bring the law up to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to see that in general the Bill is welcome in principle to most Deputies.  Most of the points that have been raised and most of the questions asked can be left over to the Committee Stage.  In that regard I can without hesitation give an assurance that we shall endeavour to facilitate Deputies to the greatest possible extent in regard to amendments. I will not say that this legislation is two hundred years overdue but it is two hundred years since there has been any legislation in this country on this subject and in that context I think we would be justified in taking our time <Col N="1141" /> over this Bill.  There will be no attempt on my part to rush it and I hope to be able to give Deputies plenty of time between the Committee Stage, for instance, and the Report Stage to consider whatever amendments I shall be putting down and to afford them an opportunity of putting down their own amendments.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne referred to the inferences to be drawn from the fact that the pawnbroking trade is still in existence and that we deem it necessary to legislate for its continuance and existence.  I do not think we can make too much of this aspect of the Bill.  I pointed out in my opening remarks that there has been a decline in the pawnbroking trade and in the number of pawnbroking businesses and that I felt that this decline was due to two major factors.  On the one hand, I think it is due in some measure at least to the improved standard of living, better income levels and social services of one sort or another.  It is also true, of course, that it is due to a large extent to the introduction in modern times of other forms of credit facilities of which hire-purchase is probably the most important.  It would require investigation by a skilled sociologist to establish what the social implications of the decline in the pawnbroking trade really were. The fact is, however, that the number of pawnbrokers and the volume of business they do are declining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be of interest to Deputies to know that the average amount of loans is somewhere between 17/- and 22/-and the average period of pawning is between four and six weeks.  These figures, I must say, are Dublin figures exclusively but whether that is of any particular significance in regard to this question of the social implications of the falling off in pawnbroking or not, I do not know, but those are the figures we have.  The average loan is about £1 and the average period of the loan is between four and six weeks. I understand also that about 75 per cent of pledges under £2 are redeemed, whereas only 25 per cent of pledges over £2 are redeemed.  As I say, it would require the skill of a sociologist to decide exactly what the social implications <Col N="1142" /> of this development are.  I think it must be admitted that to some extent it is due to an overall improvement in the wellbeing of our citizens.</P>
    <P>While I am dealing with Deputy Dr. Browne, may I also mention a point he raised about section 19?  He queried whether, indeed, there was any value in putting the sort of thing we have in section 19 into a piece of legislation.  I think there is.  First of all, we would all agree that it is desirable, for instance, that a person who is intoxicated should not be going around pawning things.  To some extent, we must try to protect him from himself.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Deputy and others that we do gain something by putting these provisions into this Bill. The pawnbrokers as such are a reputable body of law-abiding citizens. They will take seriously the fact that if they do not carry out the provisions of this section, they are committing an offence and I do not think they will lightly disregard them.  I agree with Deputy Dr. Browne that if they disregard them, it will probably be difficult to bring a prosecution but it would be possible in some circumstances to do so.  But, more important than that, the fact that these provisions are in the law governing the exercise of the particular trade, will undoubtedly have the effect of ensuring that the pawnbrokers as a body adhere to what the legislature is providing in this regard.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of Deputies have commented on the question of the pawnbroker being expected to take reasonable steps to detain any person who offers him stolen property.  As Deputy Cosgrave knows, some of the pawnbrokers are quite energetic people.  Some of them follow very energetic pursuits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  I do not think we should have any regard to their physical prowess in this matter. My own view of the meaning of this subsection is that the words &ldquo;reasonable steps to detain&rdquo; simply cover what is done at the moment.  The pawnbroker endeavours in one way or <Col N="1143" /> another to detain the person on his premises while he contacts the Garda Síochána.  Any question of physical restraint is completely out as far as I would interpret the section, but, as Deputy O'Higgins quite rightly points out, what I say here in the Dáil as to the meaning of this or any other piece of legislation does not count.</P>
      <P>That, of course, is one of the faults of the common law system which we have.  It is not possible for the court to take into account what the Legislature meant when it was passing any piece of legislation.  The courts do not have the slightest regard to what the Minister said or to what his intention was or what the House meant when it was passing a piece of legislation.  As Deputies know, on the Continent things are different.  There the courts can look at what was said when the piece of legislation was going through Parliament and can also have regard to the writings and comments of jurists and learned commentators of one type or another.</P>
      <P>We do not have that in this country and it is quite true that the courts when they come to interpret this subsection will not be the slightest bit concerned with what I have said in regard to it.  Some day we will be able to change that but it would be a pretty revolutionary change.  It is one from which I think considerable advantages would flow but there is not much point in talking about that in relation to this piece of legislation because the courts will just take the words at their face value and interpret them on that.</P>
      <P>As I say, I do not intend that there should be any element of physical restraint involved in regard to the &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo; referred to in subsection (2) and we will look at the subsection again and see whether or not some other form of words might be substituted which would convey more exactly what I, and I think most Deputies, intend in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made by a number of Deputies of the question of the Minister for Justice, for the time being, appointing auctioneers.  In my view, it is important that the Minister should retain the power to appoint these <Col N="1144" /> auctioneers.  I cannot see how anybody could ever regard there being any danger of political embarrassment or scandal of any sort arising from appointments of this nature.  I do not think any auctioneer would regard the appointment as of sufficient importance or remunerative potential to go to any great lengths to procure one.  It is important that some authority should have control over the type of person to be appointed because here the Minister is standing, as it were, in the place of the general public and he is the protector to an extent of the general public.  It is desirable that some authority&mdash;and the Minister for Justice is probably the most appropriate authority&mdash;should satisfy himself that auctioneers for this purpose should be reputable and suitable, that their premises should be suitable, and so on.  I cannot readily think of any other authority to whom we could entrust these appointments but if anybody likes to suggest somebody else, we could consider it.  Certainly, it should be somebody other than the pawnbrokers themselves.  There is always the risk, minimal though it may be, of collusion between a particular pawnbroker and an auctioneer.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins asks, on a point of principle, why the Bill could not incorporate in it the date on which it would come into operation.  There is no great reason except convenience. When the Bill comes into operation, it will necessitate the printing of a number of new forms, pawntickets and so on.  The idea is that when the Bill is passed, we shall give the pawnbrokers a period of time in which to get themselves ready for this operation.  We shall bring the act into operation, by Order, when the pawnbrokers have had an opportunity of preparing these new forms, etc.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe raised the question of notice being given to a pawner by the pawnbroker when he is proposing to dispose of pledges by auction.  That sort of system is in operation at the moment but it is a bit of a farce.  As Deputy Cosgrave rightly pointed out, a lot of people, when they go to pawn an article, do not want to give their address and indeed in many <Col N="1145" /> cases they do not want to give their own name.  Very often, pawnbrokers are given fictitious names and addresses, and we have a situation where the pawnbroker is put to the trouble and expense of sending out those notices&mdash;in a large proportion of cases to fictitious names and addresses. It is not real protection for the pawner and it is something that with an easy conscience we can do away with, particularly having regard to the provisions we have inserted in the Seventh Schedule governing the auctioning of pledges.</P>
    <P>Deputies have asked me specific questions and raised particular points. I hope they will forgive me if we leave them over to the Committee Stage because we can discuss them very fully and freely then.  If, as a result of any explanations I may give on the Committee Stage, Deputies still feel they would wish to amend particular parts of the Bill, I shall undertake very gladly to give sufficient time between Committee and Report stages for any such amendments to be put down.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Deputies who have contributed to the debate for the welcome they have given the Bill in principle.  I hope it will be given a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>Take the definition of the word &ldquo;infant&rdquo;.  According to Section 2, &ldquo;infant&rdquo; means a person under 21 years of age.  The word &ldquo;infant&rdquo; is used throughout all the sections.  Is this a serious definition when it applies up to 21 years of age? Is it a standard definition all round in all Government legislation?  Is that the reason it is being used in this?</P>

      <P>This whole question of infancy is very <Col N="1146" /> interesting.  Deputy McQuillan will probably know that under the Roman Law a person was regarded as a minor or infant until he was 25 years of age. Later on in feudal times, 20 years of age became more or less accepted to be the age at which, as it were, one reached man's estate.  In more modern times, 21 years has come to be generally regarded as the appropriate age for this purpose.  I am not sure that 16 or 17 years might not be more appropriate. Indeed, I am sure there are plenty of people who would argue that it would.  However, I feel that any attempt to reduce the age from 21 years to about 16 or 17 years would probably be strenuously resisted by the majority of parents.  On the whole, 21 years is probably the right age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does see the inconsistency in the Bill between the definition of &ldquo;infant&rdquo; and the provisions in Section 7?  It is possibly what was in Deputy McQuillan's mind.  It does seem odd that this Bill deals with the guardianship of people up to the age of 21 and at the same time and in the same Bill you solemnly amend the Wills Act to enable a person under 21 years of age to appoint a testamentary guardian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only part of it.  The whole matter is well worth examination.  If we accept that an infant is a person up to 21 years of age, then on that basis I would say that 50 per cent of the people killed in war are infants.  Take service in the Defence Forces.  If a person is over 17 years of age, he does not need the consent of his parents to join the Army.  Therefore, there is not that standard application of the word &ldquo;infant&rdquo; as meaning 21 years of age in all State services.  If a boy is 16, he may join the Army with his parents' permission.  If he is over that age, if he is 17, he does not need permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely if that practical view is being taken in the Army, there is nothing wrong with the Minister taking the view that 16 years of age is a more <Col N="1147" /> desirable and practical one, because in a number of sections the court will have power to consult the wishes of the infant with regard to his future, or perhaps in regard to his religion or his guardianship.  At what stage does the court decide to consult the infant?  There may be a difference between consulting the infant at the age of eight and consulting him&mdash; when he is still described as an infant &mdash;when he is 20 years of age.  The Minister should give us some indication of what is meant by an infant when the court consults the infant with regard to his future and what is meant by an infant in the sense of a child no longer considered dependent on an institution for his welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McQuillan in this.  It is a matter that might be considered rather more carefully.  As the Minister knows, there are Acts in which, for example, the expression &ldquo;young person&rdquo; is used as defining a person under the age of 16 and the word &ldquo;minor&rdquo; is used to relate to people generally under the age of 21.  Infants are regarded as people of tender years and in relation to the criminal legislation where the matter of intent comes in&mdash;I am thinking now of where the question of malice comes in&mdash;the law used to be that a child up to the age of seven was regarded as not being capable of malice in law.  I am not sure whether I am correct in that.  It has been extended to the age of ten or 11 but the point I want to make is that the question of age is taken into account and is taken into account in a definitive way in a number of statutes and to have this law of guardianship relate to all people under the age of 21 does give rise to certain anomalies to some of which Deputy McQuillan has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A young lad who has served for a couple of years in the Army may find himself presented with a guardian about whom he knows nothing, whom he does not want and for whom he has no respect or regard.  It is going to be very hard to enforce a guardianship in those circumstances.  I imagine <Col N="1148" /> what was in the Minister's mind&mdash;it was certainly in my mind when I read this Bill&mdash;was that generally and principally it was intended to deal with infants of more or less tender years, certainly infants who are not able to fend for themselves.  Having regard to that, possibly the Minister would consider whether or not the question of an age limit, less than 21, should be operated in connection with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Let me just say in reply to the specific question by Deputy McQuillan that I am advised that the Supreme Court decided in a case known as the Frost Case, reported in 1947, that in an application to the court dealing with the custody of an infant, the court is entitled to interview the infant, presumably at any age, and where the child is over 14 years of age the court is entitled to ask him whether or not he consents to remain where he is.  This actually concerned a boy over 14 years.  So that the court had regard to the age of 14 years as being the age at which the boy's consent apparently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Not in that case. That would be the common law and would still apply.  If any Deputy could point out any real disadvantage in the provisions of this Bill applying to a child up to the age of 21, I would certainly be prepared to have another look at it but apart from its appearing anomalous that the Bill regards a child <Col N="1149" /> as being a satisfactory subject for guardianship until the age of 21 years and at the same time enables a person under 21 to appoint a testamentary guardian, I do not see that there is any particular disadvantage.  On the basis of leaving well enough alone, and not changing the law unless you have some good reason for doing so, I am inclined to leave it at 21 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any defence for 21 years?  In relation to the health scheme, I suppose it was assumed that after 16 the child would be earning and self-sufficient or something like that, and that was the reason why the age of 16 was chosen.  Generally speaking in our society, a child after the age of 16 is earning and independent and would there not be a case for reducing it to 16 or 18 because a child would have achieved a fair measure of economic independence at that stage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but is it not better to maintain the parents' rights and responsibilities to a later age, if possible?  Is is not one of the reasons which people advance today for increased juvenile delinquency, that parents will not face up to their responsibilities, will not exercise control over their children?  If there is any validity in that argument should we by an Act of our own take away from parents their existing responsibility for infants between a lesser age and 21 years, or should we endeavour to see that parents exercise this control and responsibility up to 21 rather than to 16 or 17?  I must say I still have an open mind on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this section, I want to mention a matter I raised on Second Reading.  It seems to me this section contains some provisions which are not likely to make for family content.  The Minister, on Second Reading, referred to this Bill as being a Bill, to some extent at least, for dealing with the situation which arises from broken homes.  This section, it seems to me, contains within itself an element that could possibly give rise to discontent. It is provided in subsection (4):</P>
      <P>If the surviving parent so objects or if a testamentary guardian considers that the surviving parent is unfit to have the custody of the infant, the testamentary guardian may apply to the court for an order under this section.</P>
      <P>The testamentary guardian is being given the right under this subsection to go into court and endeavour to have the rights of the surviving parent taken away, because in clause (c) of the next subsection, it is provided that the court may:</P>
      <P>make an order that he shall act as guardian of the infant to the exclusion, so far as the court thinks proper, of the surviving parent.</P>
      <P>I think we should go very slowly, indeed, in providing legislation which will make it possible for a testamentary guardian&mdash;I say &ldquo;testamentary guardian&rdquo; though it applies to other guardians as well&mdash;to acquire rights in relation to the child superior to the rights of the surviving parent, and ones which can be enforced in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the points made by Deputy O'Higgins.  This appears to be a very complicated step.  It is essential that important natural rights should be preserved and protected.  It is quite true that these rights and responsibilities are often neglected, abused, or ignored by those in whom the rights are vested, namely, the natural father <Col N="1152" /> or natural mother of the child.  We all know very well that the circumstances under which illegitimacy arises are so complex that it is quite impossible for us to analyse them, or to dogmatise or generalise about them. In Section 3, I think it is evident the general wish is that the welfare of the infant should be the first and paramount consideration.</P>
      <P>One must take it that the natural parent is the most desirable parent. If at any time in the infant's life that natural parent is prepared to recognise his or her responsibilities, and honour them, then nobody has the right to take away these natural rights, and I do not think the courts should allow themselves to be used in order to do that.  These rights should be preserved all the time.  There is the proviso &ldquo;so far as the court thinks proper.&rdquo;  It is, of course, very difficult to argue and discuss this.  We will assume that there will be a wise judge and that he will decide, having regard to &ldquo;the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration.&rdquo; I want to ensure at no time can the natural right of the parent to guardianship of the child be taken away completely.  That would be possible under this, because it could be done as a result of an application by the testamentary guardian.  That would be undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I readily admit that this is very complicated, and that it is arguable as to what is the right thing to do.  I think we have hit on the best solution here.  We have put the surviving parent in a very superior or favourable position.  The surviving parent has merely to object to the testamentary guardian acting but the testamentary guardian has to go to court and show that the surviving parent is unfit to have custody of the child.  To that extent, the natural surviving parent is in an entirely favourable position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, as Deputy Dr. Browne rightly pointed out, when the application is made by the testamentary guardian, the court can either refuse to make an order or it can make an order establishing joint guardianship <Col N="1153" /> or&mdash;and this is the important thing&mdash; it can make an order giving the guardian rights to the exclusion of the parent to the extent the court thinks proper.  In Britain, the corresponding provision of their Guardianship Act of 1925 empowers the court to make an order simply making the testamentary guardian the sole guardian of the infant; in other words, the natural parent is stripped of his or her rights completely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this not, in effect, amount to the same thing? It is open to the court to make that order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not exactly.  The court would have regard to what is in this piece of legislation.  It is provided here that the court can order the testamentary guardian to act as guardian to the exclusion, to the extent the court thinks proper, of the surviving parent. The corresponding British order would be one making the testamentary guardian sole guardian of the infant. Guardianship, of course, includes matters other than custody.  It includes, for instance, the guardianship of the estate.  The court would have regard to that, and with reference to the wording in this Bill could very well say: &ldquo;There are certain fundamental things such as the education of the child and his upbringing, and we do not intend to interfere with the natural rights of the parent in that regard. However, we shall exclude him from the guardianship of the child in so far as the estate is concerned.&rdquo;  By this form of wording we are giving a clear indication to the court and, looking at the section as a whole, we feel, as Deputy Dr. Browne has said, that in normal circumstances the parent is the proper guardian.  However, there is also the principle that guardianship should be consistent with the welfare of the child.  There might be circumstances where the court should properly exclude the parent altogether or exclude him to some limited extent from guardianship, for instance in regard to the guardianship of the estate of the child.</P>

      <Col N="1154" /> SECTION 8.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this also on the Second Stage and I should be glad to hear further from the Minister about it.  I cannot understand why it should be necessary in subsection (2) of Section 8 to provide:</P>
      <P>When no guardian has been appointed by a deceased parent or if a guardian so appointed dies or refuses to act, the court may appoint a guardian or guardians to act jointly with the surviving parent.</P>
      <P>I can see there is a case to be made for that where a guardian has been appointed and dies or where a guardian has been appointed and refuses to act, but I cannot see what case there is to be made for bringing in this provision where no guardian has been appointed by a deceased parent and the other parent is still surviving.  In circumstances where a parent has not thought fit to appoint a guardian by will, why should we assume that was a mistake on the part of the deceased parent and bring in a provision here that the court may, in such circumstances, appoint a guardian to act jointly with the surviving parent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I dare say such a situation could arise but if that is encouraged it is not a question of bringing in legislation to assist cases where homes are broken up but of bringing in legislation which is likely to break up homes.  It is wrong that a relative or anyone like that should be encouraged to make objections to the surviving parent and automatically, on such an objection being made, that the court should have the right to appoint someone to act jointly with the surviving parent who, as Deputy Dr. Browne has rightly pointed out in discussion of the last section, is the natural guardian of the child in <Col N="1155" /> these circumstances.  I do not understand why that right or privilege should be whittled away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is considerable force in what Deputy O'Higgins says but we must provide something like this.  This is not a new provision; it was in the 1886 Act as well.  We must provide for the case where some friend of the deceased parent would consider that the surviving parent was demonstrably incapable of or unfitted for looking after the child and would be entitled to apply to the court to have a guardian appointed.  We must assume the court will be responsible in this regard and, indeed, the courts have, down the years, applied very strict rules to their behaviour in selecting guardians.  In most cases the fact that the surviving parent would be able to come into court and say the deceased parent did not think it was necessary to appoint a testamentary guardian would have a very strong bearing on the outcome of any such application. There is no doubt that people would not go lightly to the court in this type of case.  We can assume people would go to court only where they are in a position to demonstrate to the court that there were very good reasons why a guardian should be appointed.  Otherwise, they would get very short shrift in court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would Deputy O'Higgins not agree that we must provide for cases where it would be undesirable that the surviving parent should remain in control and custody of the child and that somebody should be able to act in such a situation?  If that is so, it is obvious they should be empowered to apply to the court. The court would have to have regard to the predominant rights of the surviving parent and to the fact that the deceased parent did not think it necessary when he or she was alive to appoint a testamentary guardian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the case of the <Col N="1156" /> previous section, the principle of the natural rights of persons is an important one and should be very jealously guarded in any society.  It is very hard to be the judge of the attitude and behaviour of an individual parent, the natural father or mother, and to decide whether that is the wisest guardian or the best home for that child.  It is not simply a question of providing a child with a good home, plenty of food and so on.  There are emotional values involved in the whole question which could determine the happiness of the child for the rest of its life.  Even though <i>prima facie</i> it might appear the child was living in a bad or an undesirable environment, an environment in which he was not fed or clothed properly, at the same time, emotionally it might be an ideal environment for the child, or in the words used in section 3 of the Bill, an environment which would &ldquo;regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I know there is the provision of a wise judge.  I shall not go into details, but recently we had an instance where a judge made a decision.  Fortunately we had a humane Minister for Justice in that case, but one does worry about decisions of that kind, especially as they are such complicated decisions, complicated especially by the fact that the child may appear to be well fed and clothed.  It can be said of the average child living in an institution that he is well looked after, has a roof over his head, goes to bed regularly, and gets three meals a day.  The average person would say that child is well off, better off than a nurse child.  Most nurse children are very happy children with good personalities and well integrated, although their environment might appear to be bad. In some cases it is very good, but in many cases it might appear to be bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be very slow indeed to deprive the natural parents of their rights to their own children at any time in the life of a child up to the age of 21 years.  Assuming that the parents are trying to make a home for a child, I do not think their rights should be superseded by any guardian <Col N="1157" /> appointed by the courts.  It is very difficult for the courts to assess a parent's competency to look after a child.  I speak with a certain amount of knowledge.  I do not propose to open up old bitternesses but there are cases on record in our society over the past 30 or 40 years in which a decision was taken to deprive a mother of a child, or children, on political or religious grounds.  In one case the effect on the parent was disastrous.  I do not know what the effect on the child was.  The case I have in mind was one of political prestige, which appeared to be interfered with to some extent by the behaviour of the parent, the mother, and because it was felt undesirable that that condition should continue, I shall put it like that, a certain decision was taken which I think probably was unwise.</P>
    <P>In the context of this proposal that the welfare of the infant should be the first and paramount consideration, the second consideration is the welfare and happiness of the natural parent from whom the child might be removed on what appeared to be legitimate grounds.  There should be something other than materialist grounds, or political or religious grounds.  There should be some kind of ideology which would take into account the personality of the child and his subsequent emotional life which might be seriously jeopardised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be misleading. They are new in so far as we are now giving the mother the same rights as the father always had.  The provisions in the 1886 Act applied only <Col N="1158" /> where the deceased parent was the father, and so far as we are now making the father and mother equal, they are new.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot argue this matter any more than I have done.  I agree with Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy O'Higgins that, for all sorts of reasons, it is desirable that the surviving parent should be the guardian, but we must also have regard to the fact that there could be a case where it would be desirable for the courts to step in and appoint a guardian, either for limited purposes or to exercise full rights of guardianship, either in conjunction with the surviving parent or alone.  Down through the years, the courts have exercised that power with the utmost discretion, and I feel sure we can expect that they will continue to be very slow indeed to exercise the power of appointing a guardian complementary to the surviving parent, or to his or her exclusion.</P>
      <P>Once we visualised the type of case I have mentioned arising at all, we must, I think, provide for it, and the only vehicle available to us is the courts.  I do not see any dangers arising in leaving this power with the courts. It is a power they have always had and have exercised very sparingly.  I cannot really argue beyond that point.  I do not know what Deputies would wish me to do.  Would they wish me to cut that power out altogether?</P>

The court can, if it so wishes, appoint another person as guardian of the child or minor.  In any event, it is done under the authority of the court and the court has that jurisdiction over the guardian.  Under Section 8, there is power being given to the court to appoint a guardian.  The guardian is then free from the power or jurisdiction of the court.  A complaint could be made against the guardian and the court could revoke the order and appoint another guardian, but there is not that kind of continuing supervision of the guardian.</P>

      <P>Deputy M. J. O'Higgins will realise that when this type of case comes before the High Court, the High Court will still, of its own volition, be empowered to make the child a ward of court.  We are not interfering with that inherent jurisdiction of the High Court.  A person might apply to be appointed guardian and the High Court could very well say: &ldquo;We are not accepting your application: we shall make this child a ward of court.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy M. J. O'Higgins is more or less arguing now that in all these cases where the situation I envisaged arises, the right thing to do is to make the child a ward of court.  There could be cases where it would be unnecessary to go that far.  It is a very expensive business to make a child a ward of court.  It involves all sorts of formalities relating to the administration of property, and so forth, as the Deputy knows.  There could be cases where the simple appointment of a suitable guardian by the court would be the right answer rather than going the full way and making the child a ward of court.</P>

There will be cases where it will be desirable for some relative or somebody else to say to the court, seriously and conscientiously and with full knowledge of what is involved: &ldquo;This person is not fit to be guardian of these children and I am asking you to appoint a suitable person to act with him/her or in place of him/her for limited purposes.&rdquo;  As I said, that is substantially the present law.  Nobody can say it has been abused through the centuries.  It has never given rise to any abuse or cause for complaint but it is a safety valve which we must continue to keep within the law for the odd case that will arise.</P>

      <P>I can give an instance of the type of case where a widow survives, as guardian of her infant, and the deceased husband did not appoint a testamentary guardian. Some relative of the deceased husband is satisfied in his own conscience that the surviving parent is not competent to look after the property which has been left to the infant.  I visualise a situation obtaining where that person goes to the court and says: &ldquo;I do not want to interfere with this surviving parent's right to control the education, up-bringing and the religion of the child.  These are fundamental matters which I want left, and which should be left, to the natural parent, but I do think this parent is incompetent and unfit to look after this infant's property and I want you, the court, to appoint some suitable person to act with her in the management of the estate, or, indeed, to act in the management of the estate to her exclusion.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Making the child a ward of court is a very expensive business.  The child remains a ward of court and the property can be administered only through the court.  It costs money all the time.  It may not be the thing to do in some cases: there may be cases where one of the parents has died but where it will not be necessary to do that, where the simple appointment by the court of a guardian will meet the case.  Deputies can rest assured that this is a power which we are vesting in an institution, the High Court, which has a traditional responsibility, exercised wisely and well down through the years.

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is to determine what is the paramount welfare of the child.  I am completely with the Minister in regard to the cases he visualised, but I am apprehensive about the provision of a safeguard.  The difficulty I see in the section is that in circumstances of, say, strong public opinion, the matter of the education of the child might be interpreted as implying, for the good of the child, an objection to a surviving parent deciding to educate that child in a particular philosophy.  I am not talking about the outlook or morality.  I am referring to a decision to educate the child in a particular philosophy or, say, to send it to another country, and I am asking if that is envisaged.</P>
      <P>If it is not, some care should be taken, and to that extent I would agree with some of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Dr. Browne that some safeguards are necessary.  If it is the opinion that parents' rights there should be interfered with, that is a separate matter, but supposing we accept the principle the Minister has enunciated that these things are not to be touched, then some further safeguard is needed.  These matters go to the High Court.  In effect, that is one judge.  I think this matter is of such importance that it should not be left for ultimate decision by one person. To my mind, it is one of those things that require the concurrence of more than one suitable person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had some experience of seeing how courts work and here I may say I <Col N="1166" /> do not wish to cast any reflection on the standard among judges.  However, judges are human and have points of view, and one man's conviction as to what is good for a particular child might not be in accordance with what the rest of us would consider to be the best thing for the child, particularly when it comes to such marginal matters as education and cultural activities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point. The surviving parent has rights.  I am taking the case where surviving parents, constitutionally and morally, have a particular philosophy or outlook on life which may be a minority or very unpopular philosophy.  Are those parents still to have the right to educate their children?  I do not think that right should be lightly interfered with, but on the other hand, there are circumstances in which some person deciding the future of the child may, with the utmost objectivity, honesty and sincerity bring about a situation that in the overall view might not be the best.  That does not go far enough to justify asking the Minister to nullify the provision completely.  What I would ask him is that in referring to the court, there should be at least two or three judicial persons involved.  I presume in the ordinary way there would be an appeal to the Supreme Court.  The right of appeal in any of these cases usually hinges on law, and if it is a matter of factual judgment or opinion, the High Court very seldom will intervene.</P>

      <P>I completely agree with the Minister where he is concerned for the parent who is an alcoholic or a prostitute living in a brothel.  Quite clearly, I suppose one cannot assume they are competent to raise a child.  I have in mind a particular mother, who was a wealthy mother and able to give her children a proper way of life.  Because, more or less, of the type of case cited by Deputy de Valera, because of the particular attitude at the time to education in a particular way, certain decisions were taken in respect of that family. The right of the parent&mdash;right or wrong, it is not for us to judge&mdash;was taken away from that mother.  I believe that is a right which should not be taken away, should not be interfered with.  To whatever extent the Minister can, he should safeguard that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking back over the past 30 or 40 years, we see how much ideas can <Col N="1168" /> change.  What was an anathema then is acceptable to-day.  Something which was used to break up a family &mdash;it certainly ended the happiness of the mother and jeopardised the happiness of the children&mdash;was carried out because of a particular approach at a period of time.  That danger is there.  We are completely fallible where these things are concerned. This is a right which must be preserved to the natural parents.  Whether they are going along the lines we agree with or not, they must be permitted to do that in respect of a child. This is an important right which should be jealously guarded, and I hope the Minister will come up with some sort of formula.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 11, to delete &ldquo;as to custody or maintenance&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;made under subsection (2).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is really a drafting amendment. As Deputies will see, the subsection provides for the making of orders concerning the welfare of an infant notwithstanding that the parents are residing together, but, for obvious reasons, an order made under subsection (2) as to the custody of an infant or the making of payments towards his maintenance is not to be enforceable while the parents continue to reside together.  &ldquo;Maintenance&rdquo; is, however, defined in Section 2 as including &ldquo;education&rdquo;, with the result that subsection (3) of Section 11 could be interpreted as prohibiting the enforcement of orders as to education while the parents reside together. This is not our intention, as it might happen that a parent would apply for an order as to the education of his or <Col N="1169" /> her infant without wanting to break up the family home and that it would be in the infant's interest that the order should be enforceable.  The proposed amendment is, therefore, designed to make it clear that it is only orders as to custody or payment of maintenance that will not be enforceable while the parents reside together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like a little clarification on this question of the parents of an infant applying to the court for an order.  I have in mind a case where a parent abandons or deserts a child at a particular point for a particular period and then regrets the decision.  At any time before the child reaches the age of 21, can the mother or father decide that he or she wishes to make a home for the child and take the child into the separate, additional family they have formed&mdash;adopt the child and look after the child&mdash;or are they forbidden to do that by the court because at a certain time they could be charged with abandoning or deserting the infant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it goes quite as far as that.  What we are concerned with here is the enforcement in the High Court of the parent's rights to custody of the infant.  The situation envisaged is one where the child no longer resides with the guardian.  That person applies to the court for the production of the child and its restoration to his care.  What we are doing is empowering the court not to enforce the guardian's right if it is satisfied that the applicant has abandoned or deserted the infant or for some other reason, is unfit to have the custody.  I think the answer to Deputy Dr. Browne's question is that it would depend on the circumstances prevailing at the time of the application.  If there <Col N="1170" /> had been a previous desertion and then a restoration the section would not apply.  The section would only apply where the child is no longer residing with the person applying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine the Minister has a great regard for the courts like everyone else but I do not think there is any worse atmosphere in which you could argue or discuss the welfare of a child than in the cold, analytical atmosphere of a court.  I think Sections 14, 15 and 16 could be discussed together because, as far as I am concerned, the same objection &mdash;to use that word&mdash;applies to the three; it is the same implication that the Minister has in mind in all three Sections.</P>
      <P>Some people suggest that the three Sections concerned are there as a form of punishment for an erring parent.  Whatever may be the view about punishing the parent there should be no question of taking it out of the child.  I do not know who will give evidence or from what reliable source the court will get the information that will enable it to form its decision to make an order saying: &ldquo;This woman is not entitled to have the child back.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The court may say: &ldquo;Did not that woman desert the child before?&rdquo; or: &ldquo;She was indifferent to the welfare of the child.  Under the circumstances, and on the evidence available to us, what has happened before may happen again and we refuse custody of the child to the parent.&rdquo;  That can happen although outside the court the parent may have turned over a new leaf and be an excellent parent in future.  I do not know what I can <Col N="1171" /> say on these three Sections but I think the Minister will agree that they are all on the same lines and aimed at the same objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan on the other hand cannot ask me to take this discretion away from the court.  I agree with the point that there will be cases where the court should not refuse to hand back the child but I do not think that I can take this discretion away from the court altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see what the evidence is, and I should like to know who the Minister believes will be a responsible source of information available to allow the court to form its decision.  The court is a very cold place to deal with an affair of this nature.  I have been present in a building where a number of young children have been committed to an institution and I have seen them there at 10 o'clock in the morning.  I went away on business and I happened to come back at 12 o'clock and I saw the children asleep on a bench.  I inquired what was going on and I was told the children were awaiting committal to an industrial school.  They were left there on a bench in the vicinity of the court.  I took it upon myself to send in my views to the district justice on this behaviour and I am glad to say there was no further delay.  But they had been put down to the bottom of the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has had another experience of what may happen in court, not so long ago, in regard to a mother of 12.  I shall not go into that but the danger lies there that a judge or a group of people will take the view than an institution is an excellent place.  Perhaps one of these learned men may have seen a number of young boys marching along the road and appearing perfectly happy. In fact, if those children could be placed in suitable homes I have no doubt their personalities would develop far more fully and that they would be far happier in the long run <Col N="1172" /> and better citizens of the State.  Anything in the legislation that would give preference to the institution or anything of that description over the rights of the parent is to my mind unsatisfactory and unreasonable at present.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind that those courts will deal with these cases as a professional matter. They will feel they are there to find out if a person is guilty of misconduct and neglect.  They will say: &ldquo;The evidence is there before me and I have no option but to decide as I do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister may say there is a safeguard; that they may interpret the Bill so as to have regard to the infant as of first and paramount consideration. You leave it to the discretion of the court as to the best line of action for the welfare of the infant.  I should like to know the outlook of the individual judge or member of the bench in this matter.  Some may have the idea that an approved school is an excellent training ground, while the evidence is there that the approved schools in general are not as satisfactory as the home.</P>
    <P>On that basis, I ask the Minister to reconsider these facts in regard to sections 15 and 16 particularly so that, if possible, some machinery would be set up enabling the position in regard to an individual child to be reviewed regularly so that the parent could go before a reviewing committee and make his case and if the committee conclude the child should go back, it would mean a court order to that effect could be made.  I do not know how you would word that but there should be a right of consultation and inspection in regard to the welfare of the child and the situation of a parent at the particular time when the application is made for the return of the child.</P>

      <P>Generally, I think the case put up by Deputy McQuillan is very sound and should be very sympathetically considered by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the point made by Deputy McQuillan.  The Minister must tread <Col N="1173" /> very carefully in this particular case. All our arguments, as Deputy McQuillan says, come back to the one point, that is, first of all, the welfare of the infant up to the age of 21, which is embodied in the Minister's Bill.  Nothing can override that in importance, not even the parent's happiness or any other consideration at all.</P>
      <P>One has to accept that a reasonable home, no matter how poor in circumstances, a home where there is a reasonable amount of affection or regard by the parent for the child, is infinitely superior to any institution.  That is not an attempt to derogate from the absolutely invaluable and indispensable work which the institution is doing.  I do not wish to take away from it at all, but one must remember that the most important consideration here is the parent-child relationship from the point of view of the child, forgetting about the parent for the time being, for the development of that child's personality.  That is the most important consideration.</P>
      <P>If a mother who did abandon her child through initial fear and social sanctions of one kind or another, which tend to create this atmosphere &mdash;it is our fault largely that the mother tends to abandon the child&mdash;overcomes that initial failing or weakness and then decides, or the parents decide, that they will try to make a natural home for this child, every help should be given to them to create this type of family even though it cannot be the ideal family.  Even though, probably, the initial damage will never be completely undone, to some extent some redress can be made to the child by the parent's decision to try to become a real parent and to try to keep and look after the child during the years in which it is growing up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the emphasis of the Bill should be to restore the child to the natural parent.  That is why again I agree with Deputy McQuillan that the other sections could really all be discussed together.  Anything which militates against this, such as attempting to get the mother to pay back payments, the giving to the court of the easy way out, should be avoided.  The <Col N="1174" /> average judge is a busy man.  Judges are good people.  Generally speaking, they operate as fairly as they can but they are all human and then they have the simple superficial view that I have heard from many distinguished persons: &ldquo;Look how clean, how well-fed, how well-behaved the children in an institution are,&rdquo; and nobody bothering about what happens to the child's mind or the emotional life of the child or the child's personality, which we all know begins and ends in its natural and normal development with the family.  These other children living in institutions are superficially perfectly well integrated, healthy and happy in every way but, in fact, are in some way or another emotional cripples or personality cripples of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>I have emphasised that point on a number of occasions but it is terribly important.  It is a matter which the Minister has provided for in one of his first sections.  I know he is conscious of that himself because he says that that is to dominate his Bill.  But, in each of the sections as he legislates, he should legislate in favour all the time of the return of the parent at any time up to the 21st year, if you accept that year as the year of maturity.  At any time, if a parent is going to assume his natural responsibilities, we should be delighted and facilitate him in every possible way in the interests of the child.</P>
    <P>When it comes to a decision between a lady who is an unmarried mother who comes into court and wants the child and, on the other hand, a distinguished responsible organisation or institution, the easier decision, the natural decision probably for most of us, would be to say: &ldquo;I cannot take a chance with this.  God only knows what will happen with this mother.  She has already made a mistake,&rdquo; and all that. So that the weight is against the child going back to the mother.  The weight is in favour of the child going back to the institution.  We should be very careful in this legislation to put the onus on the judge to think very deeply about it and, if he is going to send the child to the institution, he will do it against the pressure of legislation from this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputies who have said that the best place for a child is at home, that it is only as a last resort that we should contemplate the idea of a child being sent to or remaining in an institution. As Deputies will recall, we adverted to this in our discussions recently on the Adoption Bill and all of us who were concerned in that discussion were agreed that the most desirable thing in all circumstances was to have a child, preferably in its own home with the natural parents or, if that was not possible, with adoptive parents.</P>
      <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity, now that we are talking about this subject, to re-emphasise how important and desirable it is that we should have the maximum possible number of adoptions, that we could look forward to the day when our institutions would become places where children remained only for a short period of time while waiting to be adopted, that is, of course, children who are capable of being adopted.</P>
      <P>I want to re-direct the attention of Deputies to the fundamental guiding principle in this Bill which is enshrined in section 3, which is not limited in any way.  Section 3 stipulates:</P>
      <P>Where in any proceedings before any court the custody, guardianship or upbringing of an infant, or the administration of any property belonging to or held on trust for an infant, or the application of the income thereof, is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
      <P>There is no hedging there.  Those are clearcut precise words and they state the principle as strongly as it can possibly be stated.  When Deputies are worrying about sections 14, 15 and 16, the first thing I should do is to point to section 3 in this regard and then remind them that the court, when it comes to deal with cases under the later sections, would have to have full and immediate regard to this directive, this guiding principle as laid down in section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 14 is merely permissive.  It <Col N="1176" /> only authorises the court not to accede to one of these applications in particular circumstances.  Do not forget that before section 14 can even begin to apply, the parent must have abandoned or deserted the infant &ldquo;or has otherwise so conducted himself that the court should refuse to enforce his right&rdquo;&mdash;again very strong words.  We are dealing with a bad type of case here, a person who has either abandoned or deserted the child or who has otherwise so conducted himself that the court should refuse to enforce his right to custody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.  The section is there to deal with the case.  The whole idea of having these sections here is to cater for the case where a person, as Deputy Dr. Browne puts it, wishes to do penance, realises the tragic mistake he has made, wants to make amends to the child and applies to the court to be given back custody of the child.  All we are providing here is that the court need not necessarily agree to this application and shall have the right, having regard to the paramount consideration, the welfare of the child, not to grant the application.</P>
      <P>Do the Deputies see the way they are tending?  Are the Deputies asking me not to leave this permissive power with the court?  Are they asking me to say that the court in all instances shall have to accede to these applications, no matter how unsuitable they may be?</P>

      <P>I am asking the House to trust the courts in this matter and to leave them with this permissive power of refusing to accede to these applications where they think they should not be acceded to.  I realise it is important, vital and fundamental.  I realise it is desirable that the child should be with its natural parents, if at all possible.  If we can strengthen section 14 in any way, I am prepared to do that.  If, between now and Report <Col N="1177" /> Stage, Deputies want to make any suggestion about controlling the court or inserting some additional directive principles in this section, I shall consider them and be delighted to do so because I realise it is of the greatest possible importance.</P>
      <P>I should be very arrogant indeed, intellectually, if I were to suggest that my solution is better than that of anybody else.  He would be a very brave man who would attempt to set himself up as the final arbiter and judge in these matters.  I think the High Court is the ideal instrument for us to choose in this regard but I would not hesitate to establish some special type of court if that were constitutionally possible and found necessary or desirable.  I say this to indicate my agreement that this is vital, important and fundamental.  I would go very far indeed to ensure that all Deputies who are interested in the matter will be satisfied that we are doing the right thing.</P>

      <P>There is reference in the section that the court may, in its discretion, in the event of application by a mother for a child from an institution, order that the costs shall be paid, and, on top of that, the entire cost of the maintenance of the child.  Take a woman possibly in domestic service or working in some way who has an illegitimate child and cannot look after it and puts it into an institution.  It may so happen that, later on, she may marry and settle down or be in a position to take the child and wish to take the child.  A period of four or five years may be involved and this provision may be a deterrent if she has to go back and pay the costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable that, where possible, a child should be returned to its natural mother who is really the only person interested in it and who will make it her particular interest, provided she is fit and worthy to do that. <Col N="1179" /> The wording of this section rather militates against that.

It will probably be a question of putting down anything from £10 to £200 or £300.  The child would stay in the institution&mdash;which is bad not only for the parent but in the final analysis, for the child.

      <P>It seems to me that section 3 is first-class: its provisions are absolutely unexceptionable and there is no question of clarifying them. The Minister is quite right to point to them.  I believe they are counterbalanced by sections 14, 15 and 16. They are really evenly counterbalanced by these sections.  The point has been made, and it is a good one, in regard to a mother who has deserted her child.  We must bear in mind that she has done this to a considerable extent because of the stigma and because public opinion holds it is a dreadful thing&mdash;in spite of Mary Magdalen and of all the advice we are given in the Gospels&mdash;to be an unmarried mother. This lady then decides, in spite of the weight of society and in spite of the odium attached to rearing a child as an unmarried mother, that she will work hard to try to raise the money to provide an independent home for the child.  That is a very fine thing for a mother to do in the circumstances. The early neglect, the early abandonment, is completely understandable in the terms of the type of society in which the incident occurs, but it is a very fine thing that the lady at a certain time says: &ldquo;I do not care, I will have my child back.&rdquo;  She then decides to go into court, presumably a public court, and make the application, with newspaper representatives present and so on&mdash;obviously they need not comment but they can&mdash;and she has all this worry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may interrupt the Deputy, this is only the exceptional <Col N="1181" /> case.  Again, there is no reason why the parent should not apply to the health authority and get the child back. This is only where there is a dispute, where there is a refusal to give the child back and the parent goes to court on a <i>habeas corpus</i> application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have that enlightment but the general pressure on the mother is to leave the child in the institution.  She has got rid of it; it is being well cared for and she can salve her conscience that it will be brought up by a religious order and will benefit every way and be taught a trade.  All the pressure is against doing this act which I believe, and I think the Minister believes, is likely to be the first and paramount consideration as regards the welfare of the infant, as mentioned in Section 3.</P>
      <P>If she decides before the child is 21 &mdash;and the earlier the better&mdash;to look for the child and try to form a family and give the child the love and affection of the family and the attention which a child must get from a mother, then we should welcome the mother and give her every possible assistance in trying to do this very desirable thing rather than put any impediment in her way.  She has public opinion to contend with; she has to go into court, which is a frightening thing for anybody, particularly for a woman, and then she has the feeling in relation to the other section, that they might not award her the child, and then in this section she also has the feeling &ldquo;they will contest it and try to take money from me and make it impossible for me to make a home and create a family for this child&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section and the previous section militate against the mother rather than help her.  The mother should be given every encouragement to shoulder the responsibility&mdash;I have listened to this so often&mdash;of the family to the child.  I agree with that but here is a mother who is trying to take on her legitimate and natural responsibility to the child and believes we are putting impediments in her way by these provisions. Far from doing that we should encourage her in every possible way by adopting the suggestion of Deputy Sir <Col N="1182" /> Anthony Esmonde that the money costs should be limited to the very minimum, or Deputy McQuillan's suggestion that this should not be done in court but in chambers so that there will be the least possible trauma to the child and mother.  The mother at all times should be made aware that the attitude is &ldquo;if you want the child back we will gladly let you have it and we will facilitate you in every way in trying to make this child happy and in trying to make a home for yourself and the child.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are mean sections.  Section 15 is a mean section.  It appears to want to barter the child's happiness for a few pounds which the public has to pay in taxation or rates.  I cannot hear any decent human being saying: &ldquo;I resent having had to look after that child during the time it was abandoned. I want my money back from the mother&rdquo;.  That, in effect, is what the Minister is saying.  I do not think anybody wants the money back.  Most of us would wish her &ldquo;good luck&rdquo; and express the hope that she and her child would be happy and that we were glad to look after the child, as part of our responsibility as a community, during its period of isolation.  Anything that gets in the way of the reunion of the child with the parents, mother or father, should be excluded from the Bill and the Minister should stand fast on his excellent section 3.</P>

      <P>The Minister must agree that sections 14, 15 and 16 are very closely associated.  In relation to this section, we should remember that the Minister has already pointed out in section 14 that in regard to the production of the infant, where the parent applies for its custody, it is only on the grounds that the court believes the parent has abandoned or deserted the infant, or has otherwise so conducted himself, that the court can refuse the right of custody.  Then we come to section 16 and we find a provision in regard to where the parent has abandoned or deserted the infant or was unmindful of his parental duties.  If you make a comparison between the two sections you have, if you like, the powers of the court considerably <Col N="1183" /> extended in each particular section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;from my point of view, would he consider then that type of approach to the other two sections instead of what is in them? That is the point I am making.

      <P>May I say that the Deputy has the wrong end of the stick to some extent?  In practice, section 15 will not apply at all to the case of the unmarried mother seeking to get back her child.  It will come into operation only in the case of wealthy persons who, for some selfish reason of their own, abandon a child or leave it in an institution.  If an unmarried mother, after a period of emotional upset, eventually decides what is the right thing to do, and seeks the custody of her child, the court would be very reluctant and very slow to make an award of money to the Health Authority in such a case.  The provision is <Col N="1184" /> intended to apply only where it would be unreasonable not to ask parents to make some contribution to the cost the ratepayers have had to carry or to the expenses which a private person may have had to meet in maintaining the infant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that other children are affected besides those abandoned by unmarried mothers.  That does not mean that these children are the children of wealthy parents.  Children are committed to institutions for various reasons.  Four or five children might be committed because one of the parents has deserted.  A mother might find it impossible to carry on at home. The children might be running wild. An officer of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children might make investigations.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong as to whether or not this case comes under section 7, but where such an investigation is made, the children are often committed to an institution.  If that mother subsequently wishes to get the children back, from my own personal experience, I know very big difficulties are put in her way because of the type of procedure she must adopt.  We know the difficulties that are put in the way when the local authority is concerned; officialdom very often looks for its pound of flesh.  I do not say the court will not take the view the Minister takes that all these objections should be thrown out and the children restored.  My argument is that the almost insurmountable obstacles&mdash; that is what they appear to be to what I describe as an ignorant person&mdash; daunt the prospective applicant at the very outset.  Anything the Minister can do to weight these sections in favour of the parents will be worth doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is, briefly, to authorise the Minister for Finance to make additional repayable advances of £1,000,000 to the Authority for capital purposes.  The effect will be to increase the limit of £2 million in section 23 of the Principal Act to £3 million.</P>
      <P>Before I go into the question of how it is proposed to spend the additional sum now required, I would like to tell the House how the sum already authorised has been spent and how the actual expenditure compares with the estimate given by me during the debates on the Broadcasting Authority Bill, 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the present, close on £1¾ million has been advanced to the Authority.  The sums so advanced are now represented by fixed assets in the form of lands and buildings, transmitters, <Col N="1187" /> masts and aerials, studio equipment, vehicles, etc.  The balance of the amount that may be advanced under the Act will not be sufficient to meet the Authority's existing capital commitments on the provision of the main television network.  In fact these commitments will involve an excess of about £350,000 above the present statutory limit for advances from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Television Commission had estimated on the basis of cost forecasts submitted to it that £1½ million would be necessary to establish a television service comprising a studio centre and five main transmitters, and to cover initial losses.  The extra £500,000 provided under the Act was intended to allow some margin for possible underestimation and to enable the Authority to execute some improvements of a capital nature in the sound broadcasting service.  None of the capital expenditure to date has however, been on Sound Broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The actual cost of establishing the service including the cost of the five main transmitter stations, will be of the order of £2,350,000 made up as follows:</P>

    <P>In addition, pre-transmission costs of roughly £200,000 were incurred which the Authority was able to write off in 1961-2 when it received a grant based on licence fees in respect of then existing television sets for 12 months although the television service was in operation for three months only of that year.</P>
    <P>The cost of the transmitters includes the expenditure on buildings, masts and aerials, together with the expense of providing roads, power and other essential services at the high remote mountain-top sites whose names are now well known to everybody&mdash;Kippure, Truskmore, Mount Leinster, Mullaghanish and Maghera.  The cost of <Col N="1188" /> the Studios Building includes lease, mast, drainage, fixtures, fittings, etc. The building at Donnybrook, Dublin, was carefully planned to meet programme requirements with very modest provision for expansion.  The form of construction used was simplified in the interests of economy.  The building was constructed on favourable economic terms; the Authority has been informed that if built now its cost would be 33? per cent higher.  The capacity of the building is now over-extended to the point where major groups of staff have had to be located outside the building.</P>
    <P>The studio capacity is now fully utilised to provide an amount of home originated programmes which is under criticism as being insufficient.  The building and its facilities have been commented on favourably by numerous television experts from overseas as an example of concentrated and balanced development at very reasonable cost.  The technical equipment installed was ordered on the basis of competitive tenders, and was related to studio needs and outside broadcast requirements. Technical resources are fully utilised to meet current programme commitments.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the original estimates on which capital requirements were based were framed in 1958 and rising costs between then and the completion of the television studio building and the television network added substantially to the expenditure.  For example, the eighth round of wage increases was largely implemented during this development period.  The original estimate was also based on the assumption that the 405 line standard would be adopted; the later adoption of the 625 line standard with dual standard working on 405 and 625 lines from the Dublin and Sligo transmitters added £150,000 to the capital cost.  Moreover the cost of developing mountain sites at high altitudes with the heavy commitments involved in road construction, power supplies, buildings, masts, aerials, etc., turned out to be much greater than anticipated.</P>
    <P>A further important factor is that the studio and technical needs necessary <Col N="1189" /> for the provision of a national television service of the type which the Oireachtas doubtless expected the Authority to provide entailed a larger television centre and much more equipment than the Commission envisaged for minimum initial requirements. The scale of the Authority's operations, too, was larger than was originally thought would be the case.  The Television Commission had assumed for the purpose of determining whether a television service was likely to be self-supporting, that initially programmes would be provided for about 30 hours per week, that 25 per cent of these would be of home origin and that the balance would be of filmed or tape-recorded material.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances facing it, however, the Authority felt that 30 hours weekly of television transmissions would be inadequate and that from the outset Telefís Éireann should broadcast for about 42 hours a week of which over 40 per cent of the transmitting time should be devoted to home-originated programmes.  This meant that production facilities would have to supply 18 to 20 hours a week of home-originated programmes instead of seven or eight.  Even so, the Authority has been criticised for the amount of imported recorded material it transmits and Deputies will have seen that it recently announced that the percentage of home-originated programmes has been increased to slightly over 50 per cent of total output.</P>
    <P>The extra £1 million now required is to cover the excess of £350,000 which I already mentioned and to provide for further capital expenditure of £650,000.</P>

      <Col N="1190" /> The present Montrose building is seriously overcrowded and the Authority is satisfied that it will be necessary to spend about £270,000 on providing additional accommodation for storage, workshops, boiler-house extension, rehearsal facilities and office accommodation. The extra accommodation will cater for the transfer of portion of the sound broadcasting staff from the GPO and will also enable the Authority to vacate outside accommodation which it has had to rent to cater for expanding television needs.  Additional technical equipment estimated to cost up to £110,000 will be required to enable the service to obtain more programme material from the provinces, to extend the scope of outside broadcast operations, and, in general, to diversify home television production as well as provide essential standby transmitters at Kippure and Mullaghanish.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, when the television service commenced on 31st December, 1961, it was at first confined to 405 line transmissions from Kippure but the Authority's aim was to extend the coverage throughout the country as quickly as possible.  The 625 line transmissions commenced from Kippure on Ist November, 1962, and the main provincial transmitters were brought into service on low power with temporary aerials in December, 1962.  Due mainly to delays caused by bad weather they were not, however, in full operation with permanent aerials on permanent masts until the following dates:</P>

    <P>Until the main network was established, it was not possible to begin a reliable survey of the areas of poor reception with a view to deciding where low-power satellite transmitters should be provided.  The one exception was the pocket of poor reception from Kippure in the South Dublin region.  The necessary equipment to improve reception in this area has been ordered, and, <Col N="1191" /> although it will involve separate transmitters for the 625 and 405 line standards, it is expected to be installed and working by August, 1964, for both standards.  The equipment will also serve as a stand-by for the radio link between the studios and Kippure.</P>
    <P>The northern part of Cork city had poor television reception from the main transmitter at Mullaghanish and I am pleased to say that the first of the satellite transmitters&mdash; in this case a 50-watt transposer&mdash;has already been installed and is working satisfactorily.  The Cobh area has also been surveyed, and it has been established that a transposer will be required.</P>
    <P>Surveys of Counties Donegal and Monaghan have been undertaken and it has been established that three transposers will be required in County Donegal and one in County Monaghan to overcome the reception problem in these areas.</P>
    <P>The provision of transposers at these seven locations will form Stage I of the Authority's programme of satellite transmitters.  The Authority is confident that Stage I will be completed by the end of 1964 or early 1965. Other areas of deficient reception will be dealt with as Stage II of the Authority's programme but investigation and surveys have not yet progressed far enough to enable definite plans to be made.  On present estimates, the total satellite transmitter programme may cost £150,000.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of improving sound broadcasting coverage. This is no easy problem to solve. Because of the large increase in the number of medium and long wave broadcasting stations in Europe over the years, there are now far more stations in operation than there are wavelengths for them, and as a result there is a considerable and increasing amount of mutual interference between stations operating on the same or adjacent wavelengths.  This becomes very pronounced at night and the illeffects have been suffered by listeners in parts of the country which are furthest from Athlone, particularly in the south-east, south, south-west, west, <Col N="1192" /> and in County Donegal.  Indeed the Authority does not regard the reception as satisfactory over much more than two-thirds of the country.  As Deputies are aware, an improvement was effected some 18 months ago in the &ldquo;earth system&rdquo; at Athlone which had the effect of improving reception from Radio Éireann in a number of areas, particularly along the East Coast.  The Authority is satisfied however, that substantial further improvement is necessary, and now that the main Television network has been completed the matter has been given special attention.</P>
    <P>This country's frequency assignments are limited by international convention, and it has not the wavelengths which would be necessary for the additional number of medium-wave transmitters that would be required to give proper national medium-wave coverage. Neither have we a long-wave assignment.  In any case, with the increasing crowding of the medium-wave bands, it is becoming more and more difficult to get proper quality medium-wave reception, particularly in the evenings.</P>
    <P>On the other hand the advantages of VHF broadcasting are compelling. It would provide virtually interference-free reception of a quality which could not be obtained under any other solution, and would ensure independence from the effects of the activities of other broadcasting organisations.  Television transmitter sites afford ideal VHF transmitter locations, and as these are already fully developed with buildings, masts and power already in existence at the sites, the capital cost would be very reasonable, and much less than for any other scheme giving nearly comparable coverage.  There is the consideration, too, that the international trend is towards VHF for satisfactory national broadcasting&mdash; indeed almost every European country already has VHF broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The main objection to solving the problem by VHF is that the sets at present in use are not as a rule, capable of receiving VHF transmissions. The benefits would, therefore, become available to listeners only as existing radios are replaced by sets which include <Col N="1193" /> a VHF band.  I understand that the extra cost of such sets would not be appreciable.</P>
    <P>After careful consideration the Authority has concluded that a national VHF service should be established at a capital cost of about £120,000, and that medium wave transmissions should continue as at present from the Athlone, Dublin and Cork stations.  My Department's technical experts have reported favourably on the Authority's proposals.  Accordingly £120,000 of the capital being provided under this Bill has been earmarked for a national VHF service which should greatly improve reception of the Radio Éireann programmes in areas where reception is at present unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The provision being made in this Bill should meet the Authority's requirements up to the spring of 1966. A further increase in the amount that may be advanced will probably be necessary at a later stage, because no provision has been made for development of the Donnybrook site to cater for the sound broadcasting studios, which are still uncomfortably housed in the General Post Office.</P>
    <P>I have confined my remarks to the question of the Authority's capital programme because we will have another opportunity shortly of discussing the Authority's affairs.  I refer to the Supplementary Estimate for my Department which will make it possible to pay to Radio Éireann the proceeds of the higher licences that came into operation on 1st November, 1963.  Moreover, the provisions of the Principal Act which deal with the Authority's revenue, as distinct from capital, cover only the period up to the end of March, 1965, and further legislation on this point will, therefore, be needed in about a year's time.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House as a measure which is necessary to enable the Authority to consolidate the progress which it has already achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that the Minister in his remarks confined himself to the capital expenditure involved, because the purpose of this amending legislation is to increase the repayable <Col N="1194" /> advances from £2 million, at which they were fixed in the Principal Act, to £3 million, or to raise them by a further £1 million.  I should be interested to hear from the Minister what the deficit has been for each of the years during which Telefís Éireann has been in operation, and if he can indicate how much of the deficit is attributable to Telefís Éireann, and how much to sound broadcasting.</P>
      <P>As I understand the Minister's remarks, the total capital expenditure which has been incurred to date has been entirely devoted to Telefís Éireann and no portion has been devoted to the sound broadcasting service.  The very large expenditure involved here covers a great deal of work: the provision of the studio and all the other technical equipment, transmitters, transport of programme equipment and so on, as well as the sum of £200,000 which apparently was incurred before the Authority started to transmit.  The Minister might indicate the reasons, and some of the items, responsible for that expenditure.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the cost of a television service, it is obvious that very heavy expenditure is involved.  The very nature of the service involves expensive equipment and the use of current and other media and equipment which, in some cases, would rank as the most expensive type of equipment used for any purpose at the present time.  The fact that this country is so close to Britain, and that we have also a separate service from the North, makes for comparison between the services and the programmes.  Comparison in these cases inevitably means competition.  While we may have further opportunities for discussing the services rendered, there are some matters in connection with it to which I should like to advert this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information contained in the Minister's speech to the effect that there has been an increase in the amount of the programme which is based on home-produced programmes will be generally welcomed.  On the other hand, home-produced programmes should also aim at producing the best, and if I have any criticism <Col N="1195" /> of the services provided by Telefís Éireann, it is that there is still too much of the canned programme being presented. While that is probably inescapable&mdash;in fact, some of it, I suppose, always consists of canned programmes &mdash;great care should be taken in the type of programme presented.  In many cases there is too much of what I might regard as the Texas gunman type of programme.  I know in catering for a service of this sort you have to cater for all tastes, and what appeals to certain viewers might not appeal to others.  Sport has to be covered, entertainment, theatre, music, talks, and so on.  The whole range of public interest has to be catered for and what may please or interest one section may be, if not objectionable, certainly of no interest to others.  But I believe that in matters of this sort the aim should be to raise public standards and to raise general standards rather than the reverse.  Some of the canned variety of programmes transmitted fall below that high standard, and certainly the aim of the Authority should be to provide the highest standard in these matters and not to cater for any other outlook in relation to that type of programme.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I wish to refer is the question of contracts and the arrangements under which programmes are presented generally. I know that in the running of the Authority the Board has authority and is independent of the Minister.  It has discretion to expend very considerable sums of money and it is because of that I believe the Minister has, as has any Minister who is responsible for a statutory body or a State or semi-State company, a duty to see that where large sums of public money are being spent, the greatest care will be exercised to ensure that not merely is value given but that no body or individual is given preferential treatment, that equal opportunities for all will exist.</P>
    <P>I mention this because of some views that have been expressed that individuals, or individual firms or organisations, have preferential rights. Whatever contracts are entered into <Col N="1196" /> between Telefís Éireann and individual firms or organisations is of course a matter for the Authority, subject to this over-riding duty which this House has and which the Minister has, to see to it that in awarding contracts, or in making arrangements, equal opportunities will be given to all firms or to all individuals who apply for or who seek these contracts.  It may be that, for one reason or another, the Authority will decide that A is better than B or that B is preferable to C, and in some cases only one firm or one individual can be selected.  In others, it may be possible to afford over a period opportunities to a number of individuals, or firms, but where so much public money is involved, it is the inescapable duty of the Minister and of the Government, and indeed the House has a responsibility, to ensure that contracts or arrangements made should be advertised or, in the case where applications are invited, equal opportunities afforded to all who wish to apply.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in any matter of this sort is not merely that justice must be done but it must be seen to be done. For that reason, I should be glad to get an assurance from the Minister that equal rights and equal opportunities are afforded to all who are interested.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter which I am pleased to hear from the Minister in the course of his speech is that it is proposed to improve sound broadcasting and that an estimated sum of £120,000 will be spent on it.  I note from the Minister's speech that one of the difficulties in this regard is that the frequency assigned to this country, in common with frequencies which other countries have, is the subject of international <Col N="1197" /> agreement and that some of the interference is due to the close proximity of other frequencies to our own.</P>
    <P>I should be glad to know whether we have sought any review of the frequency assignment which has been given to this country and if there is any provisional arrangement under which these frequencies are reviewed periodically.  I understand that on previous occasions we sought some facilities on this matter but so far as I know it is some time ago.  I do not know whether the body responsible for dealing with this matter meets at regular intervals or not, or whether it is open to review.  If it is, we should endeavour to take action to remedy some of the interference.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note also from the Minister's statement that it is hoped to improve the reception available from Kippure to people in the south Dublin area.  The people there have been receiving poor reception, mainly due to their geographical location in relation to Kippure.  It is now hoped this will improve.  There is one other criticism I have heard.  In some parts of Dublin, not confined to the south of the city, the reception is unsatisfactory because of what has been described as ghost reception&mdash;the reflection of the picture on the television screen.  I do not know whether there is any remedy for this difficulty but the Minister might get his technical advisers on to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that struck me, listening to the Minister's statement, was that we have once again an example of something which has become only too common in this country.  We have had it when new national schools were being built, when hospitals or new housing schemes were being erected, and now we have it when our television service is being started.  I want to say that I do not for a moment blame the Minister. The planners do not seem to be able to think ahead.  Less than two and a half years after the new service was started, the Minister must come in and tell us that the people who estimated the cost of the service under-estimated to the tune of almost a million pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1198" /> Of course we have been told that the eighth round of wage increases was responsible for a great part of the over-expenditure.  We have also been told that the accommodation which has been provided, even with the extra money spent, is not sufficient and that, accordingly, a lot of the services have to be provided outside Montrose, without at all accommodating the sound broadcasting services which are still in very cramped quarters in the GPO.  Again, I do not blame the Minister, but is it not just too bad that such a short time after these services were planned and prepared, the Minister should be put to the embarrassment of coming here and saying: &ldquo;When we started, we entirely under-estimated and now we want 33? percent over what we got and, please God, in 1965 we shall be coming back looking for another substantial amount.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is despite the fact that there appears to be more advertising on Irish television than on any of the other commercial stations and that the licence fee has been raised to £5. I note that the Minister says the effects of the increase have not yet been brought to bear or have not been felt in the service.  I assure him it has been felt in the pockets of the people who have been watching television or listening to radio.  While we must be prepared to face up to our responsibilities, it is not good enough this should have happened and I suggest the Minister should have a very serious talk with the planners to find out if the same thing is likely to happen again&mdash;are we to find that when this scheme is completed, we will again be short of money, that we have not enough money to do what we sought to do, that we are still left with cramped conditions and that there will be again over-expenditure to the tune of nearly a million pounds?</P>
    <P>We all know it is a very expensive business to set up a new television service.  We all appreciate it was a wonderful achievement, but I do not think it is good enough to come up with the excuse that roads had to be built to the tops of mountains in order to provide television masts.  The <Col N="1199" /> people who planned the service must have known that beforehand.  Any schoolboy could have anticipated these difficulties.  Surely, therefore, the planners should not have had to wait until the job was completed to say they were all wrong, that they had under-estimated?  It would have been as convenient for us at the Start to have given the actual amount needed as to sanction it now.</P>
    <P>I have a hazy idea, too, of hearing it said here that the station would be self-supporting within a certain number of months.  There must have been a grave mistake there, also, because not only was it not self-supporting after a few months but it does not appear it will be so even after as many years.  It looks now as if we are getting deeper into the mire.  I wonder is it that our advertisement rates are so low that they are not bringing in the revenue?</P>
    <P>I shall deal with the question of interference in a different way from that in which Deputy Cosgrave dealt with it.  While there is a considerable amount of interference, and while the Minister told me in reply to a question last week that it can be remedied if the matter is reported to the Post Office authorities, I suggest again to the Minister that the fact that interference can be reported to the television authority and to the Post Office and that action will be taken, should be made known through the national network so that the people will know to whom they can have recourse for a remedy.  It should be made generally known over the network.</P>
    <P>Apart from this interference, there are growing complaints about another type.  I do not know whether it is considered to be patriotic duty to interfere with the television services provided by the Sassanach&mdash;I thought we had outgrown that&mdash;but there seems to be a general tendency to endeavour to make reception from the BBC and UTV less effective.  In this respect, two points should be considered. One is that if it were not for the fact that we were able to get, free, gratis and for nothing, services from <Col N="1200" /> the BBC and UTV, there would never have been the taste for television among our people and there would not have been, when Telefís Éireann started out, thousands of television sets in this country.</P>
    <P>People grumbled, but they did take out their licences when the new service was set up, and I think it is most unfair that there should be an attitude against watching those two services now that we have our own television. That is a narrow-minded point of view. It has been expressed in this House from Government benches and it is about time it stopped.  This attitude goes a little further.  I am aware that quite a number of dealers have approached the Department with a view to getting permission to instal what is known as piped television. Piped television would do away with the unsightly aerials which now decorate our rooftops not only in Dublin but all over the country.  There are forests of them everywhere and we will have them until the situation alters.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a fortune for the man who can invent an aerial so small that it will not be unsightly.  Until that comes along, I submit there should not be any objection, When these dealers agree in a particular town to putting up a main aerial which will provide piped television to all the houses in the surrounding area.  Any objection to that system should be withdrawn.  The objections of the Minister and his Department should be withdrawn.  I can see nothing wrong with it.  Even if the public here look at BBC and UTV, they will still pay their £5 licence fee to the Department; and that is where the matter begins and ends.</P>
    <P>As far as Irish culture is concerned, I do not think it is generally appreciated that very often far better Irish programmes come from UTV than from TE.  Certainly, as far as Irish songs and dance music are concerned, while the TE programmes are pretty good, they are not as good as those from UTV.  The people up there are Irish too and we should not be carrying on this petty boycott, which seems <Col N="1201" /> to be the thing to do, according to some people on this side of the Border. For 50 per cent of the time, TE are doing an excellent job, but there are some very irritating little things.  One of them has been brought to my notice again and again.  In the Irish version of the news in the evening if something important happens, it is shown in pictures; but when it comes to the English news, a shortened version without the pictures is given.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We might not get the opportunity on the Estimate for a long time.  However, I bow to the ruling of the Chair.  But I should like to refer to one thing, which, I am sure, cannot be called a detail, that is, the matter of programmes generally.  The Minister has told us it is intended to increase the number of home-produced programmes. One type of programme which would get the highest TAM rating is that dealing with Gaelic games.  I understand there is a little bit of sourness at present between the GAA and TE.  I know the Minister is a Gaelic fan himself.  Would he whisper into somebody's ear that Gaelic sports are as much a part of Gaelic culture as the Irish language? Those who seem to think they should not appear too much on Telefís Éireann should learn to deal with them in the way they should be dealt with. If the Minister wants any details, I will give them to him afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1202" /> We cannot argue too much about the general cost.  Practical experience has proved that this amount of money is required.  But it is too bad to find the people who made the Estimates being so badly out.  I am glad to hear an effort is being made to increase sound broadcasting.  VHF transmissions may be the answer, but we must take into account the cost of licences added to the cost of sets. Perhaps the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will permit me to make one last comment which might be more proper on the Estimate?  The Minister should again attempt to do something about the cost of wireless and television licences to handicapped people in poor circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is of such general interest that most Deputies will want to say something about it, even though they may be parochial in their remarks.  It affects the lives of everybody in the country today.  The Minister finished up by saying that in order to consolidate the progress already made this extra £1 million was needed.  I did not stand up to make a case for the Minister&mdash;he is well able to do it himself&mdash;but I do not agree with the last speaker that there is anything strange about concerns finding after they have been established that they require more money than was anticipated at the outset.  That has been a feature of private and public institutions down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But they usually estimate correctly the cost of their buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unforeseen circumstances are bound to arise, particularly in so flexible an undertaking as television.  Looking back over the period that has elapsed since its inception, we must all agree Telefís Éireann has progressed well during that relatively short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, we may be inclined to be parochial in our comments.  We all have complaints from our constituents in regard to programmes and reception.  I am particularly <Col N="1203" /> pleased that in his speech the Minister undertook to eliminate the reception blackspots in different parts of the country.  Unfortunately, in Donegal we have more than a few of those; and the sooner we can get them rectified the better.  People feel that, when they have to pay a licence fee and cannot get the service provided, they have something to grouse about.  Most thinking people appreciate it is not easy to overcome technical difficulties unforeseen when the service was being established.  It is not due to any flaw in organisation that these things exist.  It is only with experience they can be detected.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes providing transposers in various areas.  I would appeal to him to consider those areas furthest away from the programme source.  He should try to give at the earliest possible date the necessary boost to enable those people to get a satisfactory signal.  The same applies to sound radio.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister mentioned when the VHF appliances will be fitted to the present television transmitting sites.  When replying, he might be able to tell us whether it would be inside six or 12 months.  The sooner the better as it is felt that, since Telefís Éireann opened, sound broadcasting has become somewhat of a step-child. I think the Minister admitted to some degree that the Authority had been preoccupied with television to such an extent that it was not possible to deal with the eradication of the flaws in sound radio that have become so apparent recently.  It is impossible in many cases to get clear radio reception, particularly at night.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the success which Telefís Éireann enjoys, and which I hope will continue, is that it gives rural Ireland the same entertainment as urban dwellers enjoy and those in the bigger centres, at a time when so many people are anxious to flock to the bright lights of the cities.  Radio and television are the greatest media ever to bring a brighter life to the rural areas.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to convey as far as possible to the Authority the importance of always <Col N="1204" /> bearing that fact in mind and not to be disposed to cater entirely for city people in their programmes.  We noticed a welcome change in that respect recently and programmes such as &ldquo;Location&rdquo; are helping to bring the medium to the more remote areas and create general interest in the programmes as a result.  The more of that the better.  Frequently it is possible to arrange a programme of general interest with a rural bias.  I do not want to deal too much in detail with programmes, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle does not seem happy about it, but we do not often have the opportunity and on this occasion, when we are voting a lot of money for television, we should be able to make some reference to programmes.</P>
    <P>We realised before Telefís Éireann came into existence that it is impossible to produce over a prolonged period a programme giving general satisfaction. Sometimes a narrow view is taken by people who think their kind of programme is the only one worth considering. I suppose if I were to arrange a programme to suit myself 99 per cent of the people would not be satisfied with it.  One can always select what one likes and leave out what one does not like.  You need not go beyond one household to realise the difficulty there is in trying to get radio and television material for a whole community.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann is limited in a way that possibly does not affect any other television station.  We have neither unlimited time nor money and we depend to a certain extent on commercial programmes for revenue.  Some complain about the programmes not being aimed at developing and educating the people.  The BBC originally aimed at adult education: I do not know whether they feel they have been able to follow that course successfully. Telefís Éireann is precluded from developing in that way.  On the other hand, to give the people entirely the type of programme they want is not always right.  If we could finance television out of revenue without depending on commercials, we could possibly have adult education programmes and give people what they should get&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whether they would like it or not.  As it is, we must adopt the newspaper editor's approach and give them what they want without going too far in that direction and lean more to the cultural, informative and educational side to a limited extent also.</P>
      <P>In their efforts to maintain a middle of the road course, the Authority's programming at present is a fairly good effort.  There is a reasonable amount of everything and that is the best one could hope for in our circumstances. You do not want to produce programmes which will cause the majority to switch over to another channel: you do not want to give a lot of slapstick that might please a big section but would conflict with the high standards one would hope to instil in the community.  Those responsible for programming have a very difficult task.  They have a rather limited time in which to establish any scheme of programmes; they must cater for various interests and must give a percentage of home-produced material.  They cannot engage in excessively expensive productions and they must use a selection of canned imported material.  In the relatively short time they are operating they are doing reasonably well.</P>
      <P>The most popular item on either television or radio, one is told, is the news to which practically everybody listens.  I sometimes think we could get a little more detail in the television news which I think is a bit short.  That is only a personal opinion.</P>

He gets a very good technical <Col N="1206" /> summary of the actual situation from the meteorological point of view.

      <P>With regard to sound broadcasting, rightly or wrongly, the impression has got abroad that it is not receiving the attention it might receive since Telefís Éireann started. Sound broadcasting is most important from the point of view of persons who are confined to the house inasmuch <Col N="1207" /> as programmes were available in the early part of the day.  It is very important that Radio Éireann should continue to produce programmes of the same high standard as it has given since its inception.</P>
      <P>It is a beautiful sight to see television aerials on the roofs of rural cottages, county council cottages and other homes in backward and remote areas. Many people are cynical and talk about hire-purchase and so on.  It is the people in rural areas who should have television sets.  Television is the greatest benefit that has ever come their way.  They can sit at their own fireside and enjoy the same type of life as is available in the city.  If hire-purchase has helped them to get that amenity, I say that television and sound radio are the greatest amenity that people in the labourers' cottages and in hillside farms could possibly have.  When the stage has been reached that these people can have television and radio sets, electric light and running water in their homes, we have gone a long way towards tackling the problem of the depopulation of the congested or remote areas.  Those of us who come from areas far removed from the source of television and radio programmes are always mindful of the importance of suitable programmes.  The authorities should keep in mind that, while the majority of licences come from Dublin city, there are many people in the rural areas to whom the programmes presented are of greater importance than they are to the people in the cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should congratulate the Minister on the obvious success of Telefís Éireann up to the present time.  I hope the Authority will not be carried away by that success.  They should understand that from now on people will be much more critical.  When the station was set up people were happy if they could get a picture on their sets but in future viewers will be much more selective and much more critical.  While viewers are prepared to make allowances and to give credit for success achieved so far they would like the television authority to understand that the service is capable of improvement <Col N="1208" /> and it is no harm to remind them that improvement is expected.</P>
    <P>I know the Authority have a very difficult task to perform in maintaining an even balance as between political parties.  Now and again somebody gets his toe across the line and may abuse the privilege that he has of presenting his views to the public. I do not object at all to what some people might regard as a biassed programme if it is factual.  The Authority could not be blamed for presenting anything that is correct but where the medium is used for propagating what is dishonest or untrue that is a crime against the system that is unpardonable and should not go unchallenged.</P>

      <P>I was waiting until I could see would you try on the cap. <Col N="1209" /> I would seldom intervene to discuss an Estimate or Bill but one has a duty to one's area on an occasion such as this.  I have already conveyed to the Minister the complaints I have received from persons in my area about bad reception of sound radio and in regard to the few black spots in the county which are awaiting transposers.  I understand that three transposers are required in Donegal in order to get television to all areas.</P>

      <P>Those are the things which we urgently require.  The people will feel they are unfairly asked to carry the expense of having a set and paying a licence if they do not get a signal from the station.  Therefore, I hope that, in sound radio and television, those black spots will be brightened up for us in Donegal in the very near future.  We expect that to be done at the earliest stage because we are the farthest away from the sources and we are pretty well isolated. It does not have to go around the long way to get to the county.  We expect the Minister to assist in getting that extra little bit of entertainment for the entire country at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he required the money to consolidate the progress already made.  I am quite prepared to say that that is a modest statement. We are all agreed that very definite progress has been made.  I think we are not being asked to pay too much for what is of great service to the community.</P>

      <P>What he had to say relating to Donegal applies to my constituency, too.  He was parochial and I shall be parochial, too.  We read on page 7 of the Minister's supplied statement about mutual interference between stations operating on the same or adjacent wavelengths.  He says:</P>
      <P>This becomes very pronounced at night and the ill effects have been suffered by listeners in parts of the country which are furthest from Athlone, particularly in the south-east, south, south-west, west and in County Donegal.</P>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister mentioned the south-east first.  I trust he will maintain that order and will look after my constituency before going off to Donegal.  There are more people in the south-east than there are in the Donegal area.  It is a case of the greater good for the greater number.</P>
      <P>There are great complaints in my constituency about the noises in sound broadcasting.  If the Minister does not attend to this matter soon, a lot of people will give up the purchase of sound broadcasting licences.</P>
      <P>Deputy J. Brennan mentioned that people in rural areas now have sound broadcasting and television.  I would add that they have electric light.  We can say &ldquo;Thank God&rdquo; for the Shannon Scheme and the people who thought of it.  Otherwise, we would not be able to enjoy these other benefits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I took a note of the statement by the Parliamentary Secretary that rural Ireland is not getting a chance on television.  I agree with him. We see very little of the country people on television.  The Minister should send some of his young men out through the country more often.  Whenever they do so, they bring back very worthwhile programmes and features. I am not &ldquo;sold&rdquo; on some of the canned programmes but I suppose we have to have them.  You bought a lot of junk and that ought to be looked to.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is also the Parliamentary Whip.  He was responsible, I am sure, for negotiations that went on here from time to time about whether or not we would have sound broadcasting from this House. I have an idea he was a bit afraid of it in view of what he said here tonight and what has transpired.  I was hoping Deputy Booth would be here tonight to give his opinion as I was speaking to him some time ago on the matter.</P>
      <P>The first step in projecting this House to the people of Ireland should be taken on the principal occasions that occur in Dáil Éireann&mdash;the occasion of the Minister for Finance presenting his Budget; the occasion of the replies by the leaders of the Opposition Parties.  I do not mean that ordinary mortals such as myself would be included.  Now that we have an amplification system in this House, tape recordings of speeches could be made and supplied to the Authority&mdash; and let us all take our chance.  It would be fair reporting and it would be an advance to project Dáil Éireann to the people outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not go into details on programmes. We have very good newscasters, as good as any I have heard from across the water and elsewhere. It is extraordinary that we can get news of Nicosia, the Panama Canal and Vietnam but we do not know what happens down in Mooncoin or in Gloccamorra in our own country. I would draw the Minister's attention to that.  It would be nice if we had more news from the provinces.  I know <Col N="1212" /> this would cost money but the Minister is responsible for a service and he should ask his officers to do this.  In the country we have decided the only times we will see pictures of Irish news is when an accident occurs within a mile or two of the studio but we will never see anything that happens down the country.</P>
    <P>Another point is that we will send telecasters into Northern Ireland to report on their factories or on the digging up of their railways but we will not do likewise around our own country.  I should like, and the Irish people would like, to have telecasters going to, say, Abbeyleix to ask the people there what do they think of the railway being closed.  I was surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary should find fault with the young men who give the weather forecasts.  They are doing a good job but the reason I was surprised was that they all speak with a Donegal or a Northern Ireland accent.  If they had the accent of the Decies, I would not complain about them.  Indeed, when the Irish programme is on, the weather is the signal for English-speaking people that the programme is about to finish because two words which have been projected over the country are &ldquo;An aimsir&rdquo; and people know when they hear those words that the end of the Irish Broadcast is at hand.  Some years ago I attacked traditional singers and brought fire and brimstone down on my head.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is Gaelic culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard traditional singers on Telefís Éireann and they would be better off elsewhere. I say &ldquo;thanks be to God for the Clancy Brothers&rdquo;.  They sing traditional songs in the way Irish people want them sung and I would ask the Minister to use whatever influence he has to see that if traditional songs are to be sung, they will be sung by people who are able to sing.  That should be the policy in Telefís Éireann.  No traditional songs should be sung by a man merely because he writes his name in Irish but only if he is able to sing. Some chieftains, shall I say, of sound <Col N="1213" /> broadcasting did not welcome the Clancy Brothers at the start but Irish people both here and in the United States have given them the answer. These people can put it over and they are able to sing Irish traditional songs, Scottish songs or American ballads with a zest and with something the Irish people like.  In future, when traditional songs are being presented on Radio Éireann or Telefís Éireann, I hope they will be presented only by people competent to do so.</P>
      <P>In my constituency and in Waterford city, we do not ask for recognition; we consider we are the most musical part of Ireland.  You only have to pick up a newspaper today to see that another of our bands have won another open competition.  It does not matter whether it is a song that is sung by Elvis Presley, a piece by Brahms, Mendelssohn or an Irish traditional song, I give first place only to the Decies.  As I am speaking, there is a &ldquo;Féile na Scol&rdquo; taking place in which thousands of children participate. It is a feature on Radio Éireann.  We seldom see Telefís Éireann in Waterford, either at the grand festivals of light opera or at the Waterford Music Club which presents artists of international repute, or the other musical festivals or at our competition between the factories, &ldquo;The Tops of the Town&rdquo; in which boys and girls play classics or &ldquo;pops&rdquo; or imitate Elvis Presley or the Royal Show Band, which is the best band in its own line of business.  I seldom have the satisfaction of looking at Telefís Éireann and discovering that they were in Waterford and have recorded some of those things.  I have written to the Director of Telefís Éireann about this matter and I consider that it is only right, when we are supplying the money, that we should mention it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I would say to the Minister that a good policy for Telefís Éireann would be to have more pictures of our own news and if that is going to cost more money, the Minister will get it if he comes to the House; that we should have more teams and camera men going through the country recording the ordinary life of the <Col N="1214" /> people and putting it into magazine form.  This is not such a tiresome thing as evidenced by the picture which was taken recently in Abbeyfeale.  They were able to take it to the continent and get an award for it.  That was just a picture about ordinary people in Abbeyfeale, a cattle market, talking to the people, asking them about the statue erected in memory of the priest, what he did, and so on.  I saw another picture, again about a village, this time in Kerry.  It was splendid.  We should have more of these.  I do not want Telefís Éireann to move away altogether from this great capital city of Dublin, but I believe it would be a good thing if there were more live programmes from all over the country, showing the Irish people, telling us about the stories and legends, and the customs of the people.</P>
    <P>Last night I listened to a talk about calendar customs in Ireland, the things that are done in different places at different times of the year&mdash;Shrove Tuesday, Ash Wednesday, Chalk Sunday.  These are the things that will project the real Ireland.  I hear and read about &ldquo;Irish culture&rdquo;, but I do not know what it is, and those who use the phrase do not know what it is either.  If they want to find out what it is, then they will find it in the homes of the people, in the streets, at the fairs and in the markets, in the markets of this great city, and in the factories.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister luck.  We will give him the money he wants.  Lastly, I would advise him and the members of his Party not to be afraid of television. The members of the Government and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party are afraid of television.  You are afraid of the medium.  You are afraid of having the Dáil reported.</P>

The members of the Government Party are afraid of the <Col N="1215" /> medium.  I appeal to the Minister and his colleagues not to be afraid of television. I ask the Minister to send for the people concerned, to send for the members of the Labour Party, to send for Independents and the chief Opposition Party here, Fine Gael, and make arrangements that each group will have a certain time on television.</P>

      <P>I have no comment much to make about programmes.  I think they are best left to those who deal with them. It is like housing.  I know all about housing.  Lots of people who talk here know nothing about it.  I appreciate that the people in Radio and Telefís Éireann have the job of living with the problem; they know what the people want, what the handful want and what the multitude want, and they know what people are prepared for what they want, and they work accordingly.  In my own home when items that are not thought well of here are on, my children come in wanting &ldquo;Rusty&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bat Masterson&rdquo; and, when they are over, they are gone again.  When some of the things people consider superior are on, there is no one in the house.  Do not forget there are a great many teenagers who want something a small number may not want, but these teenagers have to be catered for.  So much for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have more important matters to refer to now.  There is an item on Radio Éireann &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo;. I have never had any objection to that.

      <P>There is a matter for the future which I should like to raise in connection with programmes and the voting of money here.  It is a matter that affects the privilege of the House.  I do not wish to transgress, but, to meet Deputy Sherwin's point, I do think that, rather than have the <Col N="1218" /> risk of misrepresentation in the future of personalities in the House, it should be considered whether permission directly to take the proceedings of the House and report them should not be considered by the House.</P>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I think Telefís Éireann has, since its inception, done a very good job, by and large.  We may all feel reasonably proud of the standard of general technical competence which was achieved relatively smoothly right from the beginning. However, it is only proper that the medium, being a national medium, should be something more than an entertainment medium.  The deliberations in this House are of such fundamental national importance that they should be accurately conveyed to the electorate.  I suppose it is not feasible for technical reasons to televise the House live, which possibly would be the best method&mdash;but the sound proceedings could be recorded and if speakers from the House were then represented on the medium, they could be faithfully represented in their own voices.  We should welcome here the giving of prominence to the proceedings of the House and we should at the same time be conscious of our own position under the Constitution and <i>vis-á-vis</i> the community as a whole and, should I say, be jealous of our own privileges.</P>
      <P>I raise this partly because two other Deputies have touched on it and partly because it is likely to be the only opportunity for the moment of commenting on the problem and, if the Chair will allow me to make this reference to the programme to which Deputy Sherwin referred on the basis that it will continue in the future&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Then I, like Deputy Sherwin, would have very little further to say on the matter. Obviously, if we are to have such a service, we must provide the equipment <Col N="1220" /> for it.  We have already gone a good way towards it.  On the technical side, the performance has been very creditable and I do not think any Deputy should object to voting money for this project.</P>
      <P>While I do not agree with all the remarks or some or the innuendoes of Deputy Lynch, I agree with him when he suggests, in a more serious vein, that the medium can be of importance in conveying to the country the more serious sides of Irish life and the serious social, political and other problems concerning the community. In so far as the medium can do that, it should be encouraged with facilities. I suppose, within the terms of your ruling, Sir, that is as far as I may go now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a pity if the turn which this debate has taken were to deflect the attention of the House from the extraordinary capital position which the Minister has revealed in his speech here tonight, that what was estimated to cost £1,500,000 has in fact cost £2,350,000.  The Act which only three years ago provided £2 million for the television service is now being amended to provide £3 million.  It is anticipated that in a few short years more money will be needed; in other words, the whole basis of the cost of establishing a television service has been thrown overboard.  These original estimates were not merely wrong in points of detail but grossly wrong.</P>
      <P>Other parts of the Minister's speech amount to no more than an apologia for inefficient financial management. He has to say that &ldquo;the cost of developing mountain sites at high altitudes with the heavy commitments involved in road construction, power supplies, buildings, masts, aerials, etc., turned out to be much greater than anticipated&rdquo;.  Why were proper estimates not made of the costs involved in these proceedings?  If a private business were to finance its operations on such a basis, it would have long ago gone bankrupt.  At page 1, the Minister states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance of the amount that may be advanced under the Act will not be sufficient to meet the <Col N="1221" /> Authority's existing capital commitments on the provision of the main television network.  In fact these commitments will involve an excess of about £350,000 above the present statutory limit for advances from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to resent very strongly the extent to which we were misinformed three years ago when the Minister introduced the Broadcasting Authority Bill.  It completely alters the light in which we must regard the provision of the television service.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the technical equipment installed was ordered on the basis of competitive tenders.  Unfortunately the Minister cannot say that the Montrose studio buildings, costing £790,000, were ordered on the basis of competitive tenders.  When Montrose was being built, the contract was not advertised by public tender.  A certain number of builders, a small number of builders, were invited by a private architect, not a civil servant, to submit tenders for that large contract. That is not sound administration of public moneys.  This House, established precedent, and convention, have laid down a rigid procedure for the handling of public moneys so far as direct State expenditure through normal Civil Service channels is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is true that we have from time to time set up autonomous bodies, or semi-autonomous bodies, such as Telefís Éireann, for various purposes, which sometimes engage in commercial operations.  It behoves us to indicate to such bodies handling such large sums of State moneys as Telefís Éireann handle, that we expect the exacting standards of financial administration by officials in State Departments to be applied by them, and that we object to any private professional architect dispensing patronage in the form of contracts for the building of public institutions.  It is time for us to have regard to the first principles upon which we want our State bodies administered, and I would urge the Minister to advise Telefís Éireann of our concern about these matters.</P>
    <P>Beyond that, I have very little to say on this Bill, particularly having regard <Col N="1222" /> to your ruling, Sir, on the last two speakers.  There is one matter, however, to which you may permit me to refer, that is, the question of interference with television programmes.  I am not quite clear as to what the present state is regarding the formulation of comprehensive regulations for the prevention of interference.  Certainly, I know that in this city one hears many complaints, from time to time, of serious interference with television programmes by electrical equipment. I understand there still is on sale by dealers, electrical equipment&mdash;household equipment mostly&mdash;which has not been fitted with suppressors for the elimination of interference.  It might be helpful if the Minister would tell us where matters stand in that respect.</P>
    <P>Like the previous speaker, I believe that taking things by and large, Telefís Éireann have done a very good job. I do not object to more money being made available for the continuation of that service and its expansion, but I strongly object to the fact that it transpires that what was originally estimated would cost £1½ million now costs nearly £2½ million.  To my mind, that is inefficient financial planning and administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Opening the debate for the Opposition, Deputy Cosgrave asked a few questions.  He wished to know what were the deficits in each year for television and sound broadcasting. In 1961-62, there was a surplus of £10,000.  In that year, of course, the television service was in operation for only three months.  In 1962-63, the television deficit was £17,000.  The sound broadcasting deficit in 1961-62&mdash; for the full year&mdash;was £114,000, and the deficit for 1962-63 was £153,000. As the House knows a subsidy was voted to sound broadcasting year by year from its inception, and under the 1960 Act, there was a provision of £500,000 subsidy for the sound broadcasting side of the Authority's business. In 1961-62, the subsidy was £133,400, and in 1962-63, it was £150,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave also wanted to know what was the reason for the £200,000 pre-transmission expenditure. <Col N="1223" /> I mentioned in my opening statement that this cost covered expenditure on television during the period before Kippure went on the air.  It also covered the cost of staff recruited in advance of its operation.  It was necessary to recruit staff and have them trained to operate the service when it commenced.  Those are the reasons for the expenditure of £200,000 mentioned in my opening statement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave and other Deputies also mentioned the programmes and seemed to think there were too many imported or canned programmes as against the percentage of home-produced programmes.  Deputy Cosgrave advised that the Authority should exercise great care in the selection of the type of imported programmes, and with that I thoroughly agree.  They have to make the best selection they can from whatever is available to them in imported or canned programmes.  I am sure every Deputy realises that within their resources, the Authority cannot operate the service on a completely home-produced programme schedule.  It is necessary, as other Deputies have said, to meet the tastes and desires of other listeners and many of them, as Deputy Sherwin pointed out, are interested in looking at imported or canned programmes.</P>
    <P>Deputies Tully, Byrne, and others mentioned the necessity of coming to the House after three years to seek additional capital to enable the Broadcasting Authority to consolidate the progress made.  Deputy Byrne found fault with the people who estimated the cost, in the first instance, of providing the country with a television service.  It is true that the costs are much higher than anticipated by the Television Commission, but, at the same time, I must point out that the operation which has been carried out by the Broadcasting Authority is much greater than that which was envisaged by the Television Commission when preparing their plans and making their estimates for them.  The Television Authority is putting on longer programmes each day, many more hours of programmes, and they are, of course, putting on a higher percentage of home produced programmes than <Col N="1224" /> was anticipated by the Television Commission.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the costs of building became greater by reason of increases in wages and increases in the prices of materials.  In so far as the estimated cost of providing mountain roads are concerned, I would point out to Deputy Byrne that I do not think that the people who made the estimate, or the men who were engaged in carrying out the operation, had any previous experience in building roads to such heights on mountain sites and it is not an extraordinary thing that they underestimated the cost.  I would not hold that against them under any circumstances.  At the same time, I would point out to Deputy Byrne that some of those roads were constructed during the shocking bad weather conditions that obtained last year.  I do not think that the operation of establishing this television station could have been carried out at any less cost than we provided for under the 1960 Act and this Bill.  As a matter of fact, I have already indicated in my opening statement that people who have come here and looked at the buildings and have seen this station in operation have commented on the low cost.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne also raised the question of how the contract was placed for the building of the Montrose studio.  I was asked a question here on that matter&mdash;I do not know exactly when&mdash; and at that time I told the Deputy who asked the question that it was a matter for the Broadcasting Authority itself. It is, of course, a recognised practice in recent years, I think, for business concerns, when they are engaged in a very large building operation, to seek tenders from a limited number of contractors whom they know are capable of carrying out the building operation for which they are asked to tender.  I think that the Broadcasting Authority were influenced at the time by the consideration that they wanted to have a job well done.  They wanted to have tenders from firms whom they thought were capable of doing the job.  They wanted the job done quickly as well at that time.  I do not think it very fair to pin the decision on any particular architect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say <Col N="1225" /> how many builders were invited to tender?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the number.  I know it was a limited number but I have not got any documentation here in relation to the matter.  I am talking completely off the cuff, as they say, and out of my recollection of looking into the matter at the time the Parliamentary Question was put to me.  I was satisfied then that the Authority was operating in the best interests of the State in the matter. I know that ordinary Departmental contracts are subject to rigid regulations and that such regulations are scrupulously carried out by the officials who are engaged in that business but this contract was placed by an independent Authority set up by this House.  I am convinced that the Authority was acting in the best interests of the State. That is a matter of opinion, of course, and Deputy Byrne, or any other Deputy, is entitled to his opinion in relation to the manner in which the contract was placed.  At the same time, I do not think it was a question of patronage or a matter of any irregularity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that assurance from the Minister so far as he is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter decided on by the Authority.  Deputy Tully raised the question here with me of the reception of Ulster Television and the BBC.  He seems to think that the Broadcasting Authority and the Government or somebody else are anxious to interfere with reception from both stations.  That is not so.  We do not try to interfere with reception.  We are concerned, of course, with Telefís Éireann and we are concerned that Telefís Éireann should be operated according to the Stockholm Agreement. Our first obligation is to ensure that viewers get satisfactory reception of the home programmes and our second obligation is that Telefís Éireann transmitters will not cause interference within the service areas of other transmitting stations.  These are our main concerns and whatever interference there is with reception from UTV or BBC I can assure the House <Col N="1226" /> that it is not caused deliberately by the Broadcasting Authority's station.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully and some other Deputies raised the question about piped television services.  Piped television services could improve the reception of Irish programmes but would offer greatly improved reception of foreign programmes over wide areas of this country.  This competition would adversely affect the revenue earning capacity of the Authority at a time when it is trying to establish itself.  A few months ago the question of a television relay service was raised by me and I was advised by the Broadcasting Authority that it might be reviewed at the end of 1965 in the light of conditions obtaining at that time.  It was, therefore, decided to continue the ban on the relay of television programmes from outside the State.  The provision is not finally closed for all time.  It is a matter which can be reviewed again and the Broadcasting Authority suggest it should not be reviewed prior to 1965.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach raised the question of the length of time it will take to put in operation the VHF system for sound broadcasting.  I am advised it will take from 1½ to two years to provide full programmes through this medium.  I am also assured it is the best and cheapest solution to all the problems attached to reception of sound broadcasting, particularly from the viewpoints of capital and operational costs.</P>
      <P>Deputies have asked me to hurry up the programme for the provision of additional transposers, and I can say that the Broadcasting Authority intends to go ahead with Stage 1 and expect to have it completed by the end of 1964. This scheme, when completed, will make for better reception in certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy T. Lynch asked me to try to get the Authority to provide more pictures of local rural events in the television news programmes, that more should be done to bring rural people and rural areas on to the television screen in their daily lives, in their pastimes, both outdoor and indoor&mdash;the opera, dramas and other cultural activities engaged in by the people of the <Col N="1227" /> cities and towns and villages far removed from Dublin.  I would draw his attention to the statement I made during my opening remarks that additional technical equipment, estimated to cost £110,000, will be required to enable the service to obtain more programme material from the provinces.</P>
    <P>New equipment will be purchased with that money, and this will help to extend the scope of the outside broadcast operations and in general to diversify all television broadcasts.  The idea is that television cameras and camera teams will be sent to more widely dispersed areas of the country and their pictures seen on the screen more often.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the service is young and new, that as time passes, it will become more diversified and more progressive, that it will cater for many more interests than it is capable of catering for at present.  We could not reasonably expect in the short space Telefís Éireann has been in existence to get everything we need from the service, but as time passes, the Authority will, of course, look to wider fields for its activities and will endeavour to increase its work in the country, bringing to the screen our own people in their working lives and occupations.</P>
    <P>I do not think there are many more points I have to deal with.  I believe this Bill meets with the general approval of the House.  I feel that the Broadcasting Authority, when it obtains the necessary approval of the House for the capital it needs to extend its operations will, in the shortest possible time, carry out the work that it envisaged at the outset.  This additional capital will enable the Authority to consolidate and extend its operations aimed at providing full coverage of the country, through both sound and television.</P>
    <P>It is a mistake for people to think sound broadcasting is the Cinderella of the service.  In my view, sound broadcasting is an essential element of the Broadcasting Authority's operations. It is my belief that for a long time to come very many people in this country will use sound receivers and that the Authority will, if that is <Col N="1228" /> possible, give more attention to this aspect of its operations.  Sound broadcasting is the side on which the money is being lost.  It is not a paying proposition.</P>
    <P>I may say that by and large the television operations are paying their way.  I would also point out that the advances made to the Authority under this Bill and under the Act of 1960 are on the principle that they are repayable, that the Authority is expected to balance its budget and pay its way, while, at the same time, conforming to the general principles laid down in the 1960 Act to provide a service in keeping with the best traditions of our people.</P>
