      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Lenihan):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £805,000 be granted to defray the charges which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1965, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Garda Síochána, including pensions, etc., and for payment of compensation and other expenses arising out of service in the Local Security Force.</P>
      <P>A sum of £647,000 is required under Subhead A to meet the additional cost for the year, 1964/65, of the 12 per cent pay increase granted to members of the Garda Síochána with effect from the 1st February, 1964.  This award followed the acceptance by the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance of an Agreed Recommendation of the Garda Síochána Conciliation Council on a claim for a 12 per cent increase in Garda pay in line with the national agreement on salary and wage increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An additional sum of £5,000 is required under Subhead B to meet increases in locomotion rates payable to Officers and Inspectors in the Garda <Col N="763" /> Síochána.  These increases were granted following acceptance by the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance of an agreed recommendation on a claim for an increase in locomotion rates in line with an increase granted to Civil Servants and with effect from the same date, namely, 1st April, 1964.</P>
    <P>A further £5,000 is required under this Subhead to meet the additional cost of cleaning Garda Stations outside the Dublin area.  This represents a 25 per cent increase on the existing allowance which was last revised in 1960.</P>
    <P>Postal and other services rendered by the Post Office are paid for, since the 1st April, 1964, on a cash basis. The original Estimate for these services has now been increased by the Post Office from £30,000 to £37,500.  In addition, the cost of telephone rentals, etc., has been increased since the 1st July, 1964, and it is estimated that this increase will amount to £8,500, making a total additional charge of £16,000 under Subhead C.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £132,000 is required to meet the increases in pensions and gratuities payable to members of the Garda Síochána on retirement, and to their widows.  The increase follows automatically from the increase in pay to which I have already referred.</P>

      <P>There is nothing in this Supplementary Estimate to which we take any exception, but really I must make this comment.  We are informed by the Government that they are engaged in what they are pleased to describe as a programme&mdash;a Programme for Economic Expansion.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I want to raise a specific point.  The Minister states that &ldquo;An additional sum of £132,000 is required to meet the increases in pensions and gratuities payable to members of the Garda Síochána on retirement, and to their widows.  The increase follows automatically from the increase in pay to which I have already referred.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A situation has arisen in regard to Garda widows' pensions in that they circulate between the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Social Welfare, and the Minister for Justice, and no matter who you take it up with, you are referred to someone else. Ultimately responsibility for the Garda Síochána and their pension scheme, and the provisions made for their widows, must devolve on the Minister for Justice.  I understand very full and detailed representations have been made to the Minister by the Garda representative body in regard to the problem of the Garda widows who were in receipt of non-contributory widows' pensions in addition to Garda widows' pensions which they received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special provision was made in the Pensions (Increases) Acts of 1956, and I think 1962 and 1963, requiring for the purpose of the social service code that Garda widows' pensions would be treated as income not to be reckoned for the purpose of social service benefits.  The story, as I understand it from what the Minister for Finance told me yesterday, is that some elaborate calculation was made in the Department of Finance under which it appears that Garda widows whose <Col N="766" /> minimum rate of pension has risen to £110 a year received some pension benefit which represented a percentage somewhat greater than that given to other beneficiaries under the Pension Acts, and accordingly out of the Pensions Act of 1964 there was left the proviso that appeared in the three previous Pensions Acts exempting Garda widows' pensions from being deemed to be income for the purpose of social welfare code.</P>
    <P>The net result of that was that in a strictly limited number of cases, the increase in the Garda widow's pension has brought about a reduction in the total income of the widow, because where a widow had received a Garda widow's pension under the code prior to 1964, she was getting the full pension, and when the 1964 pension increase came into operation, and the minimum scale of the Garda widow's pension rose to £110, apparently part at least of that adjusted pension was treated as income by the Department of Social Welfare, and the Garda widow's non-contributory pension was proportionately reduced.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister for Finance, and possibly the Minister for Social Welfare, found themselves caught up in some abstruse calculation which, in accordance with the letter of the law as it was inadvertently written, obliged them to make this adjustment.  Surely this House is not so paralysed, when we find we have done something we did not want to do but which is causing an intolerable sense of grievance to a tiny group of people and which can be remedied by the annual expenditure of a relatively small sum of money, that we cannot do anything about it.  Is it beyond our capacity to say that, without creating any precedent, without establishing any departure from the general rule governing such matters, we shall hereby determine that the minimum £111 will in future be treated on the same basis as it was prior to the 1964 Act?</P>
    <P>I know it sometimes is not easy to prevail on the Department of Finance to approach these matters in a constructive way, but I put it to the Minister that he should say to the Department <Col N="767" /> of Finance: &ldquo;I do not care what kind of Bill you draft, or what kind of section, or what steps you deem necessary.  All I want to secure is that if a Garda widow gets this £111, it will not operate to reduce her widow's pension under the social welfare code&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The whole House wants this done, so let it be done.  If the Minister faces this request in that way, nobody will chase him, or shock him or harass him. We fully realise it will take some little time to draft the necessary legislation, but if the Minister says it will be done, a relatively few decent widow women will say: &ldquo;Give him time to get it done&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Each one of us would surely like to see this provision made retrospective, if that is possible.  I realise the Minister's difficulties.  There may be the suggestion that this might set off a whole forest of precedents.  If it cannot be done, let a regulation be made putting the matter to rights, at least from now.  I can assure the Minister that whatever steps he finds it necessary to take to effect that purpose will secure the support of this Party and, I am quite sure, of the Labour Party and of every other section of the House.  I believe the present situation arises from an over-zealous mathematical calculation in the Department of Finance.  Whatever the reason, let us put it right, and the sooner we do it the better.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will find himself free to say this thing will be done as soon as the appropriate machinery can be devised.  If he does, he will secure our support in any ensuing encounter he may have with the Minister for Finance or, on this occasion, with his colleague the Minister for Social Welfare, and he can rest assured I shall not describe his behaviour as a crack in the ceiling that requires the neighbours to examine the foundation of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party agree that the Supplementary Estimate should be passed as quickly as possible. I should like to support Deputy Dillon in what he said about this hardship <Col N="768" /> which has been imposed this year. I do not know whether it was done inadvertently or not but it has caused grave hardship to a small number of widows.  An effort should now be made to rectify it and to have that done retrospectively. I do not see how retrospective payment could cause embarrassment because the Minister for Local Government has agreed to have payments made retrospectively to 1st October, 1963, and an Act which has not yet been presented to the House will effect this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have this programme for the widows; let us give them that which has been taken away from them.  Gardaí and their widows are in a most peculiar position in the social structure.  Whether we like it or not, gardaí are members of the police force and in this country and every other country are not members of any particular class.  They do not belong to any particular section of society because their job requires them to enforce the law.  For that reason, they do not have the ordinary connections, the ordinary friends that other people have.</P>

These <Col N="769" /> people need protection more than anybody else.  The Minister is in a position to do this without breaking any regulations.  If he finds it impossible to persuade his colleagues in the Departments of Finance and Social Welfare to give the compensation required to restore the <i>status quo,</i> could the Minister not have the increase operated through the Department of Justice?</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Dillon, I would not put up any defence of Garda widows on the basis that they are pariahs in the community.  That was the suggestion of Deputy Tully.  My experience in the West is that there is never any suggestion of local people sending the Garda sergeant to Coventry.  In fact, he is usually the keystone, the friend and adviser in any difficulties that arise in the parish.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with the point made.  As Deputies are aware, it is not my function: it is a matter for the Department of Finance to make <Col N="770" /> regulations altering the social welfare code.  I assure the House I shall take this matter up with the Minister for Finance to see what can be done. There does appear to have been a case made for it.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Estimate as a whole, it arises as a result of the 12 per cent increase given under the national wage and salary agreement.  This, of course, is in accordance also with the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> where we are seeking to have salaries and wages and all forms of incomes go forward at a stable rate.  Indeed, the whole purpose of the National Agreement, freely entered into, was that all income sections would benefit in accordance with the prescribed increases in income for a certain definite period, so that we would get over any haphazard increases, or any frustrations caused by not granting particular increases in salaries when these became due.  Since then, certain storms have arisen regarding particular categories of our economy but the entire idea of a National Agreement is laudable. It is the first attempt to achieve this object which the British Government are now seeking to achieve.  All Parties, I take it, would subscribe to the hope that such agreements and their observance of them would be a permanent feature in our economic development in the future.  I shall not go any further into the matter; I leave it at that.</P>
      <P>This particular Supplementary Estimate arises because, as Deputies know, the original Estimate for the Department was drawn up prior to the conclusion of the National Agreement. Since it was concluded, the automatic increase has been applied to every section of the community and this Supplementary Estimate is required for the categories and purposes mentioned. I do not think there is anything further to be said, beyond adding that I will take up the point made by Deputy Dillon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £469,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st day of March, 1965, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (No. 13 of 1946 and No. 6 of 1956), including a Grant-in-Aid for Acquisition of Land.</P>
      <P>When introducing the Forestry Estimate for the current year, I told the House that the Estimate as then submitted did not include provision in respect of the ninth round increase in basic pay nor did it allow for the effect on operational costs of a pending reduction of the working hours of Forestry labourers to 45 hours all the year round.</P>
      <P>The head under which this extra provision is mainly required is subhead C.2, which relates to Forest Development and Management.  Over three-quarters of the expenditure on this subhead is in respect of direct labour and the 9th round wage increase of 12 per cent with a minimum increase of £1 per week coupled with a reduction from the beginning of July, 1964 of the summer working week for forest workers from 48 hours to 45 hours per week will necessitate an additional provision of £252,500 for wage payments to forest workers.  The general pattern of rising wage rates has also contributed to increased costs in respect of services and materials amounting to £69,500.  The main non-labour elements showing higher costs are cartage, maintenance and repair of machinery and hire of mechanical equipment.  The total additional requirement for subhead C.2 is, therefore, £322,000 spread over the various operational sub-divisions of the subhead. An additional provision of £65,000, arising from adjustment of salaries of foresters and certain other grades, is required under subhead A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increased allowance rates for travelling coupled with an increase in travel requirements have necessitated an increase of the travelling and Incidental Expenses provision of subhead B.1 by <Col N="772" /> £12,500 while increased Post Office charges have necessitated an increase of £6,000 in the provision for post office services in subhead B.2.  There is also a small additional sum for subhead C. 3&mdash;Sawmilling&mdash;due to wage increases.</P>
    <P>In subhead H&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;allowance has been made for a shortfall of £75,000 in receipts from timber sales, which it is expected will be partly offset by an increase of £10,000 in miscellaneous receipts resulting in a net shortfall of £65,000. The inflow of money against current timber sales was exceptionally heavy in the closing months of 1963/64 resulting in a revenue level for that year appreciably above expectations but with a resultant shortfall in income in the current year.  Some difficulties may be experienced in achieving even the somewhat reduced allowance now proposed.</P>
    <P>The gross additional amount required on subheads A, B1, B2, C2, and C3 is estimated at £406,500, which with the expected shortfall in Appropriations-in-Aid brings the gross requirement to £471,500.  Savings on other subheads of £2,500 are, however, expected, so that the net Supplementary Estimate is for £469,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on behalf of Fine Gael, we are not going to oppose this Supplementary Estimate but I might add that it seems to me that in all sections of the administration of this Government, we are going to have Supplementary Estimates due to the rising costs of production, rising wages and so forth.  This is not the Estimate on which to comment on that trend and simply <i>en passant</i> I wish to refer to the fact that it does exist.  We are fully in favour of as great an increase in forestry production as possible.  This Supplementary Estimate covers the wide range of activities of the Forestry Division and I propose to make a few general comments and perhaps the Minister, if he is in a position to do so, would reply and give us an indication whether he is working on these lines of policy or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an undoubted fact that there is a growing shortage of timber and in <Col N="773" /> fact the supply does not meet the demand in Europe today.  That trend has been very evident over the past three or four years and I wonder if the Minister feels that the policy he and his Department are adumbrating is sufficient to meet requirements, because it is quite obvious to anybody who knows anything about timber and is responsible either for buying or selling it that the demand has increased out of all proportion in the past 12 or 15 months.  Projections such as I have before me and which I got from attending a conference of the Food and Agriculture Organisation which discussed the matter recently, go to show that the urge and the drive in European forestry policy is to make production as rapid and as expansive as possible in the immediate future. For that purpose I want to make one or two suggestions to the Minister.</P>
    <P>In Europe at the moment they have two million hectares, or approximately five million acres, available for actual afforestation and on top of that, they are making a drive to secure another one million hectares of marginal land. Marginal land as far as I understand it to be&mdash;perhaps the Minister's advisers may differ&mdash;is land on the verge of good agricultural land and it is afforested along the edge so as not to interfere in any way with agricultural production.  The Minister's advisers know my view on the planting of arable land but marginal land is a different thing.  The planting of such land creates shelter belts and also acts as a water barrier.  The projections in European policy are to get another one million hectares of marginal land or approximately 2½ million acres. They are endeavouring by doing that to meet the requirements of the market.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that the world population is increasing at a tremendous rate.  The estimated projection for population is 65 million a year. There is, of course, as a result of that increase an increased demand for timber for constructional and building purposes.  I should like the Minister to indicate to the House what plans <Col N="774" /> he has, or if he has any plans, for marginal development.  If he has no plans, would he consider encouraging private enterprise to produce that marginal development?  It is only out of private enterprise you can get it.</P>
    <P>At present we have a cut and dried system, admirable on paper, where, if a person plants an acre of land, he can get subventional help from the State for that purpose.  But it is very hard to get an acre of marginal land on a small farm.  Would the Minister consider in the administration of his Department making it possible for people to plant marginal land and get some benefit to encourage them to do so in regard to the cost of timber, fencing and so on?  As I have emphasised so often, it is only by getting private enterprise, in conjuction with State afforestation itself, we can hope to get the production.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying we are practically the only country in western Europe that is not increasing its private planting.  Our planting is practically entirely in the hands of the State.  While I realise that State afforestation, in the cost of production and the difficulties we face nowadays, is an essential, alongside that there should be encouragement of a healthy private enterprise.  I have the feeling&mdash;maybe I am wrong; maybe I have a suspicious mind&mdash;that the Forestry Division feel they are the be-all and end-all of forestry production.  As such, they have failed to produce our own requirements. We are not producing our full requirements.  There is always the urge to buy outside timber, because there has been the trouble of timber being used here before it is mature.  No one can blame the Forestry Division for that.  Our overall requirements are not met here and are not likely to be.</P>
    <P>We are voting a sizeable sum here. Could the Minister tell us in a few brief words when we are going to be solvent?  We have invested a considerable sum in forestry over the years. Could he indicate when we can say: &ldquo;Here is a mass industry carried out by the State.  It is solvent and paying a dividend&rdquo;?  Obviously, it is not doing that at the moment because we are voting this £500,000 as a Supplementary <Col N="775" /> Estimate to meet particular requirements.</P>
    <P>One other thing was stressed in Europe.  The problem does not apply to us at the moment, but we will face it shortly, the same as everybody else. In their drive for production and the tremendous demand for timber, the heavy imports they are making, their efforts to get up to the fullest production, the people in Europe find themselves confronted with the difficulty of ageing manpower.  This brings us back to rural life in Ireland again.  It is a tremendous difficulty that the Forestry Division may have to face in regard to ageing manpower.  Although we have some measure of unemployment here, it may be possible that in the not-too-distant future we may find ourselves short of manpower.  Therefore, the Minister should give us some indication of what he believes are the trends in that direction, whether we will face that situation.  If we do face it we will have to keep production up.  The Minister should tell us what plans he has for greater efficiency within his Department to meet that production.</P>
    <P>There is another matter.  Although it is a matter personal to my own constituency, I think it is a matter of national importance.  In my constituency the Forestry Division have recently taken over an estate, the Doyle estate, with a house on it known as Ballysop House.  The Minister outlined the plans for us.  The Forestry Division are to set up an arboretum or a forestry college there.  This is a memorial to one of the world's greatest statesmen, affectionately remembered by us all, John Fitzgerald Kennedy.  It is only right that this memorial should be in Wexford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, administration.  If you will allow me develop my point.  They have taken over Ballysop estate.  I am informed that the original house&mdash;Ballysop House, built about 120 years ago&mdash;<Col N="776" /> is to be demolished and in its place a modern structure is to be erected.  I have made representations to the Minister's Department on this subject, but somebody&mdash;some architect, some planner or somebody within the Civil Service itself acting on the direction of the Minister&mdash;has decided this building must go.</P>
      <P>There is very strong feeling in Wexford on this subject.  I am voicing the opinion of my constituents that this house should be allowed to stand.  The Forestry Division say: &ldquo;We must demolish this house if we are to build a suitable college or whatever will be there.&rdquo;  Further representation has been made to me that as this memorial is associated with the Kennedy family, who are very interested in the problem of retarded children, the house should be left where it is and used for the care of such children.  There are plenty of rooms in it and it is on a beautiful site overlooking the mountains.  The reason I am making this plea to the Minister is that the Kennedy family are perhaps the greatest supporters and helpers of organisations for retarded children.  It would be a fitting memorial if this house were left for that purpose.  It is a fine house and it would cost thousands to build its like today.</P>
      <P>I know that what is known as a policy decision has been taken by the Department that this house must be swept away.  I am trying to urge on behalf of my constituents, on behalf of public opinion in Wexford for which I am qualified to speak, that the Minister should seriously take another look at this.  I only hope the bulldozers have not already been sent down to perpetrate what I consider would be an outrage on this fine old Wexford residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I wish to say we also support this Vote.  While we agree the Department have come into line in regard to the ninth round wage increase and have introduced a 45-hour week and a five-day week for the summer period, we regret they have not decided to apply the five-day week all round. Perhaps it is a technical matter but we <Col N="777" /> would urge the Department to introduce the five-day week all the year round, and particularly because of the fact that, as the officials and the Minister must be aware, the employees of the Forestry Division who work in country districts have not had the benefit of any short day or leisure time down through the years.  A person who has to travel a distance across a mountain or across fields to work in a forest finds that by the time he gets home after stopping work at one o'clock, his half-day on Saturday is gone and, for all practical purposes, he has only Sunday to do anything about his own place.  Leisure time does not enter into it.</P>
      <P>It is true that in country districts the five-day week has been a blessing because many people, including many forestry workers, who have small portions of land have been able to work them and in that way to supplement their income.  While I do not want to criticise too severely the present situation as far as income is concerned, in the forests, I would point out that one of the great snags there is that although the income has been increased because of the introduction of the bonus system, nevertheless, forestry workers are by no means very well paid and do need something to supplement their income. The fact that they are able to do some work on their own land or on their own property, if they have a small portion of land, on the day on which they have not to work has helped considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would, therefore, urge the Minister to consider this question for the winter period as well as the summer period. One can envisage a person working until one o'clock on Saturday during winter periods and having to go one and a half miles from the mountain to a road and then a distance of four or five miles to his home.  It is dark by the time he gets home.  The amount of work such a person can do about his own place or the amount of leisure he can have is negligible.  I would urge that something be done about it because, unlike most other workers at the present time, forestry workers have <Col N="778" /> not got either a pension scheme or a sick pay scheme.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde's suggestion about the possible shortage of manpower or, as he put it, ageing manpower.  I do not think we will run into that as a very serious problem in the near future but if outside employment continues to offer better wages, sick pay schemes and retirement pensions, naturally the attraction will be from employment such as the Forestry Division provide. That is one factor which will result in a reduction of the number of persons anxious to work for the Forestry Division.</P>
    <P>I would just make one further comment as far as the ninth round increase of wages and salaries is concerned. Nobody will attempt to deny that the ninth round was a shot in the arm of the economy of this country.  I was one of the persons responsible for the negotiation of that increase with the Federated Union of Employers. Even there it was admitted that almost 80 per cent of the money which would be paid by industry would find its way back into industry almost immediately because workers, particularly low-paid workers, do not save money.  They spend it as fast as they get it.  Therefore, a wage increase is in very many cases something which does good to everybody.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the extra money for sawmills because I have been trying to get extra money for some of my people in the sawmills for some time and I hope this means that the rates will be brought up to the rates being paid in local sawmills.</P>
    <P>On the question of the shortage of land available for the extension of forestry, I would suggest that there is one obvious solution which the Department have not yet adopted.  It has been made here again and again.  I remember that about thirteen years ago the suggestion was made from the Labour benches and other benches including those occupied by the present Government.  I should like to know from the Minister if anything definite is being done about the cutaway <Col N="779" /> bogs.  There should be an effort made to develop cut-away bogs on a much larger scale for the purpose of tree planting.  I know that it is being done to a certain extent but not to the extent that it should be done.</P>
    <P>There is another obvious remedy. There are people in my constituency living in what has been described as marginal land, land on which it is extremely difficult for a small farmer to make any kind of decent living. Such persons should be offered farms of good land, of which the Land Commission have a considerable amount in their possession in Meath, on condition that the land which they at present occupy be made available for forestry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which, since the ninth round of wage and salary <Col N="780" /> increases has been brought considerably more to the fore, that is, the question of forestry workers' pay and deductions made from the wages of forestry workers.  Over the past few years the PAYE system was introduced but Government Departments do not operate it in the same way as other employers do.  They have a special section dealing with it.  For some extraordinary reason it has become a habit that persons, particularly persons who were not liable for income tax until the particular year, have heard nothing at all about it until a couple of weeks before Christmas and then they got the bad news that they owed £15 to £20 income tax and that it was proposed to deduct at the rate of £2 per week from that date until 31st March.</P>
    <P>Last year I had to make representations and I want to say that the officials, who have always been most courteous, did agree that it was extreme hardship that in Christmas week a person should have £5 deducted from his pay of £9 because of the fact that somebody had forgotten to collect income tax from him.  Is there any reason in the world why forestry workers as well as other employees of Government Departments should not have such deductions made weekly?  Why have PAYE for those outside and adopt a different system in respect of forestry workers?  Why cannot PAYE be applied to everybody? This is one of the things which is causing a certain amount of unrest.</P>
    <P>The whole question of forestry work and the items covered in this Estimate are matters with which we on these benches must agree.  We do agree that the salaries and wages needed to be adjusted and we agree also that the travelling and incidental expenses needed to be adjusted.  Those things must take place.</P>
    <P>There is one thing which I cannot understand and which perhaps the Minister might be able to explain.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>In Subhead H (Appropriations-in-Aid) allowance has been made for a shortfall of £75,000 in Receipts from <Col N="781" /> Timber Sales, which it is expected will be partly offset by an increase of £10,000 in Miscellaneous Receipts resulting in a net shortfall of £65,000. The inflow of money against current timber sales was exceptionally heavy in the closing months of 1963/64 resulting in a revenue level for that year appreciably above expectations but with a resultant shortfall in income in the current year.</P>
    <P>Surely, with the increase in wages, the increase in costs of every kind, there must also be an increase in the value of timber being sold?  That being so, how does it come that there is such a big deficit here or is that being taken into account?  If it is, does it mean that the position would have been very much worse but for the increase in timber values?</P>
    <P>On top of that, could the Minister say how this situation arose?  Was it because certain forests became mature, that the timber was ready for sale at a particular time?  It seems rather extraordinary to me.  I was under the impression that as years went by more and more timber would be available for sale and that because of the increase in its value, the money expended on that timber would be recovered faster and faster.  Perhaps the Minister, if he has the necessary information, would make a comment on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>After the tourist industry, the agricultural industry and the fishing industry, there is no reason why forestry could not rank next.  The real position in that regard is, perhaps, that since native Government was established, we have been only tinkering with the development of forestry.  The Supplementary Estimate moved now by the Minister, asking this House to give him some additional moneys which are required in connection with wages and salaries, is necessary and perhaps no time should be lost in providing the Minister with the Estimate in order that the essential services of this branch of the Department may be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is notable again, however, as has already been pointed out, that nearly <Col N="782" /> every State Department this year has seen fit to come to the House with a supplementary estimate.  We have now reached the stage when our State Departments present their Estimates, this House is presented with a Budget and then we have a rehash of the whole demand from the taxpayers in which the various Departments seek additional moneys.  I hope this practice of supplementary estimates will be discontinued and that an effort will be made by Government Departments, including the Forestry Division, to present to this House their annual Estimate to cover the amount of expenditure which will be incurred for the financial year.  In principle, it is wrong that demands should be made on this House so frequently and I hope that after this year a better system of estimation of expenditure will be evolved.  We are now asked to provide for the Forestry Division £65,000 for wages and salaries, £12,500 for travelling and incidental expenses, £322,000 for forestry development and management, and £1,000 in connection with saw milling.</P>
    <P>I put it to the House, and particularly to the Minister for Lands, that the Government have not shown any real earnestness to make forestry what we all desire it to be.  It is all very fine for the Minister to stand up here and paint a picture of an increased acreage being acquired for forestry, of an increased number of persons being employed in forestry or of improved conditions of employment for forestry workers, but forestry deserves to be brought up to date and modernised.</P>
    <P>In the Government's <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> there is a target set for forestry which I cannot describe as very ambitious.  I cannot say that the Minister charged with the responsibility for forestry has shown the earnestness expected of such a Minister, more particularly when we realise that at one time, in the early ages, our country was one of the best wooded countries of Europe and that it was only as years passed we were completely stripped of our woods and forests.</P>
    <P>An effort has been made to expand <Col N="783" /> forestry activities and it is admitted that there has been a certain amount of improvement in that regard.  In parts of this country, in Cork, Kerry, Wicklow, Laois and Offaly, there are some of the finest and most attractive plantations in the world.  There are in charge of these forests some of the ablest foresters that can be got, foresters who are equal to the best in any of the great forest countries of France, Denmark, British Columbia or Norway.  I venture to say our State foresters can equal the standard of efficiency and skill of the foresters of Sweden, Norway, Denmark and France who are looked upon as the world's greatest authorities on forestry.  However, our men are not treated in the same manner as the forestry supervisors of these other countries are treated by their Governments.  The Governments of these other countries realise the great importance of forestry, whereas here forestry seems to be taking one of the last places.</P>
    <P>I can never understand why our forestry industry cannot expand at a far greater rate than it has in recent years.  In our annual estimates, a niggardly sum is provided, and the Government were never bold enough to set a courageous target for forestry. Today we are asked to provide modest sums for the purpose of bridging the gap from now until 31st March.  It is high time this House asked for a more courageous deal for forestry.  Our rate of planting and the annual target for planting should be vastly increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that in order to expand forestry, one must have land and also that on subhead C.2, in which we deal with forestry development and management, I put it to the House that while we have the best possible forestry supervisors, we do not seem to appreciate their skill and efficiency.  Will the Minister be prepared in the course of his reply to deal very fully with certain questions?</P>
      <P>He seeks here, for salaries, wages and allowances, £65,000.  Perhaps he would let us have some information as to what portion of the money will be provided for foresters.  Forestry workers are a select and skilled type of worker. They have got a 45-hour week and it is hoped that all forestry workers will be on a five-day week the whole year round.  I join in the plea made by other Deputies in regard to that and, in addition, I ask that a pension scheme and sick pay scheme be introduced with the minimum of delay.  Unless work in our forests is made more attractive, we may face the position in which skilled workers will be obliged to seek employment elsewhere.  In areas convenient to large State forests, we may face a labour shortage, not due to lack of workers but due to the fact that they are seeking employment with suitable pension and sick pay schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such schemes are long overdue and the Minister should take steps to improve conditions in State forest employment by taking action now and not leaving it to the incoming Government to bring about this improvement. If he does not do it, I venture to say it will be done very shortly.  It is high time public recognition was given to the men responsible for the work of our State forests.  We have been trying to improve their conditions for many years and it is only Deputies in whose constituencies there are extensive State forests who realise the development and the amount of hard work and the specialisation it entails for those on forestry staff.  If we want <Col N="785" /> efficient forest workers, we must have attractive conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>Conditions have been improved but they are still lagging behind without justification.  If the Minister is so eager to see an expansion in forestry and development maintained, he must have a contented staff devoted to their work. In my constituency, there is a forestry training college at Kinnitty which is perhaps the best such establishment in the world.  There is nothing like it outside the country.  It was set up and designed to provide this country with the best type of specialised men to manage and take charge of our State forests.  Some years ago a plea was made to parents with sons willing to embark on a good profession with a future, to send their sons, if they had a liking for forestry, to the forestry training college.  The response was reasonably good and that college has produced some of our best foresters.</P>

      <P>I am coming to the payment of foresters.  We have had excellent results from the Kinnitty college but recently there is a decline in the number of people following the profession and there have been vacancies in the college.  Why must we face a shortage of foresters?  It is because the foresters have not been properly paid and their conditions of employment not made attractive.  I know that if the Minister can prevent foresters from ventilating their grievances, he will do so, but I am entitled to ask what part of the £65,000 will be provided for the foresters.  Unless we have foresters with proper conditions of employment in charge of our forests we cannot have proper forestry management and development because it is those men who will be responsible for it.  I want to inquire from the Minister, since there is difficulty in recruiting students to the forestry school at Kinnitty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whether <Col N="786" /> that is not due to the failure of the Department of Lands to pay the foresters.  Because the foresters are, therefore, discontented with their terms and conditions of employment, we are now reaching the stage when, instead of our young people opting for forestry work, they refuse to enter that profession because of the lack of proper facilities for those already engaged in it.  How many new foresters qualified in the past few years will benefit under Subhead A of this Supplementary Estimate?</P>
      <P>I should like to know what the wage is of a forest manager, responsible for 3,000 acres of forest and 80 acres of nursery, with 90 employees under him. We have a case in which a forest manager is responsible for 3,000 acres of forest and an extensive nursery with a salary of only £13 per week.  He has full responsibility for the forest and the nursery and for a staff of 90 men.  In my view, that is a disgraceful situation and I cannot understand why the Department has not taken appropriate action to ensure that a man with such responsibilities is adequately remunerated.  I should like to know what portion of this £65,000 will be devoted to improving terms and conditions of employment for forest managers and forestry workers.  Is it possible to ensure that foresters will continue to take an active interest in forestry development if they are treated in this fashion?</P>
      <P>Has any effort been made to provide houses for foresters?  Under Subhead C, Forest Development and Management, the Minister is asking for £322,000. Will any part of that sum be devoted to providing housing accommodation for foresters?  Perhaps the Minister would indicate to the House when and where this money will be spent.  We have had statements from the Minister that suitable residences convenient to forests would be provided.  So far only two such houses have been erected.</P>

I give the Minister any credit that is due to him, but, going to the root of the matter, what was mainly responsible for the successful announcement he has made about increased employment and the <Col N="789" /> output from our forests will not be found at his doorstep.  It was Cumann na nGaedheal and the inter-Party Government who made it possible for him to stand on the forestry dunghill today and crow so loudly.</P>
      <P>It is not honest of him to say that the future of forestry under a new Government will be gloomy and dim. I hope this will be the last Supplementary Estimate for forestry to be introduced by Fianna Fáil.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest I forget, may I ask the Minister whether during the past few months he refused to meet a deputation of the foresters' executive, whether such a request was made to him, why he did not see them, and if he has made any provision to permit this responsible executive to air any grievances they may have in the interests of forestry development in general?</P>
      <P>I should also like to ask whether he has received representations from that executive in regard to promotions to the rank of forester which have been delayed in his Department.  I am told the reason why such promotions have been delayed is to save money at the forester's expense.  Surely we are entitled to ask&mdash;when we see provision for allowances, wages, travelling and incidental expenses in the Supplementary Estimate&mdash;why these promotions have been held up in an attempt to exercise economies and cut down expenditure.  What explanation was given to the foresters' executive when they addressed queries to the Minister's Department on this matter?  I put it to the Minister today that deliberately, designedly, and by order, he is responsible for preventing promotions to the rank of forester.  The House is entitled to an explanation of his conduct in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> I also want to ask the Minister in relation to travelling and incidental expenses, what generous allowances and expenses have been paid to foresters?  I am told that was one of the problems the executive were anxious to discuss with the Minister, and I am reliably informed that he refused to discuss it with them.  I know there are foresters who use their own cars, and who travel many hundred of miles at their own expense, to carry out their work efficiently and well.  They drive their private cars in the course of their duties, and they are not paid for that.  If we have the most expert group of foresters in the world today the least we can do is to give them a fair hearing, and let them ventilate their problems and grievances. That is why I accuse the Minister of slamming the door in the faces of those responsible for the administration of our State forests.  I want to assure those people that when the change of Government takes place within the next two years, the knob of the door to the office of the Minister for Lands will be in their own hands any time they have problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subhead B.1 &mdash; Travelling and Incidental Expenses, £12,500&mdash;perhaps the Minister will be able to enlighten the House as to what portion of that sum will go to the foresters who use their own private cars in the course of work for the Minister's Department That is the point I want to raise, and that is the point on which I feel the Minister is obliged to give the House an explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no intention of holding up the House any longer on this matter because after Christmas I expect we will be dealing with the main Estimate. I want to assure the Minister that while we are prepared to give him any money he requires for the Forestry Division, there is a great deal of dissatisfaction&mdash;<Col N="791" /> and it is right that he should know about this dissatisfaction&mdash;amongst the ordinary working men employed in our forests in regard to the five-day week, sick pay, and pension schemes.  The Minister may be prepared to face very critical opposition on the question of forestry, and he will need to have something better for us when he comes with his next Estimate than he has today, or has had in recent years.</P>
    <P>When there is such a wonderful future in forestry, and when it is such a wonderful medium of employment in rural Ireland, it is high time the Minister stopped tinkering with it, and was bold and courageous enough to do something practical which will produce beneficial results all round, and advance the interests of forestry development, private planting, and all sections of planting.  As Deputy Esmonde said, forestry in this country lags far behind most continental countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true, as Deputy Esmonde says, that there is a growing shortage of timber in Europe, that the demand for timber has been increasing, and that the FAO survey for the decade 1960 to 1970 shows prospects of an ever-increasing demand for timber supplies.  In addition to the reasons advanced by the Deputy, there are still further reasons why that growing demand will continue.  In the new and emerging African countries, uneducated in most cases, the demand for paper, and so on, is bound to increase vastly in the years ahead.  Indeed, if we were in a position now to export wood pulp&mdash;although we have not sufficient for our own use&mdash;we could do so with tremendous advantage to the economy.  In reply to what Deputy Esmonde said, I have no doubt that under the present policy we will fully meet our needs, and in due course will profit from the European shortage which now exists and which will continue for very many years, so far as anyone can estimate, because new uses appear to be found year by year for the products of timber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the development of marginal land suggested by Deputy Esmonde, the House and the country <Col N="792" /> know that, notwithstanding our efforts, we have met with very little success in the private planting sector. Deputy Esmonde suggested that it was difficult to find an acre of marginal land on a small farm for planting. In order to try to induce small farmers to plant, I reduced the qualifying figure for a grant to enable them to qualify even in the case of a half acre.  I had not much success.</P>
    <P>It is true that we have succeeded in increasing private planting to approximately 1,000 acres per annum, but that is a very small amount, insignificant in the national picture.  It is quite obvious that in this country, with all our peculiarities, the main drive in this field must continue to be led by the State and the main development must take place under State provisions and State guidance.</P>
    <P>Our land structure does not, in the main, provide suitable facilities for a large amount of private planting.  In other countries, particularly our nextdoor neighbour, there are landlords, very large landowners, who can devote a certain amount of their land to private planting.  The farm structure here is, in the main, very different and that is partly the reason why the State must play such a very large part in afforestation. We still have quite an amount of marginal land suitable for planting.</P>
    <P>As I told the House yesterday, we have some difficulty in maintaining our programme.  Notwithstanding some of the irresponsible statements made in this House, through this Supplementary Estimate, we are maintaining the 25,000-acre per annum plan.  We are planting per head of the population more than any other country in western Europe.  That is a fact.  That is the answer to those who claim we should embark on what they call a courageous programme.  I shall get on to the courageous programme of Deputy Oliver Flanagan in a few moments. First of all, I shall stick to realities, endeavour to answer some of the points put to me by responsible Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Division does not regard itself, as Deputy Esmonde suggested, as being the be-all and end-all in forestry.  It has devoted a very large <Col N="793" /> amount of time to endeavours to induce the private sector of the economy to come into this field.  The only objections we have advanced to grant applications have been in cases where people were inclined to come in and acquire land between State forest blocks that would be required for the normal development of State forestry, and take advantage of the work of the Department. We have provided generous grants for people who want to plant marginal land, and there is quite an amount of it in every farm, big or small.  However, as I have said, our efforts in that field have not been a success.  While people are more conscious of it now than they were, the State must still keep up its efforts to intensify afforestation, to continue to maintain the steady target of 25,000 acres per annum.</P>
    <P>I estimate that in a period of ten years the Exchequer should be relieved of the responsibility for subventions towards State forestry.  If things go wrong with my calculation, I put it, at the outside, at 15 years.  If things go right, ten years may be a little optimistic, but inside 15 years the position will be that our afforestation programme will be paying for itself from its income without calling on the Exchequer to come to its aid.</P>
    <P>That position could only have been achieved through the vast efforts we have put into the programme during the past five years.  Of course its continued success will depend on our being able to keep up that target.  That will indicate to the House that as soon as we have reached that position, we shall be in sight of our national goal of trying to make ourselves self-supporting in this field.  When we have reached that stage, it is possible that the Forestry Division will be able, through new techniques acquired from experience gained in planting areas formerly not considered plantable to increase the programme now reached. Techniques change with time and from the experiments being carried out during the past few years, all the thorny problems of exposure, particularly in western areas, should be solved in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> Deputy Esmonde referred to an old house, the location of which is earmarked as the site for the administration building to be erected in connection with the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Memorial Park in Wexford.  I have seen it and, in my judgment, firstly, it is in a hopeless state of repair and would cost a fortune to do anything with it, and secondly, it would be completely unsuitable for the purpose for which Deputy Esmonde suggested it could be used.  It would be unsuitable to house the people Deputy Esmonde suggested it should house, being beside the administration building in this Memorial Park and beside the new agricultural school being erected on that site. I am advised by those who are competent to judge these matters that the cheapest and best thing to do is to knock it down.  Even if the building itself were suitable, for the reasons I have given&mdash;location and so forth&mdash;it would certainly not be suitable to house the type of people the Deputy suggested.</P>
    <P>The point about pay was that the deductions should be made weekly.  I had not received any complaints about this matter until the Deputy spoke about it.  I shall have the matter examined but the Deputy will appreciate that the Revenue Commissioners come into this matter as well as the people in my Department.</P>
    <P>The position about the intake of money towards the end of March of last year is this.  Some customers, particularly public Departments like the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, paid in an amount of money.  Their deadline was 31st March and they paid for stuff that we did not expect to be paid for before 31st March, which would normally come into this year's Estimate.  The same occurred with a few other large customers and it is a matter which we cannot control. We have these hills and hollows in the income.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully has criticised the intake of money to the Department.  It is not all represented by mature timber or by clear felling.  Indeed, in certain years, chance plays a big part in this. <Col N="795" /> For instance, if there is a very severe storm and quite a lot of timber is knocked down, which would not be mature and which would not be sold or felled for a number of years, it has to be dealt with and sold.  If as a result of these storms there is a particularly bad windy sweep in a certain area, it may be necessary for the mechanics of the job of replanting to clear fell an area that would not perhaps be clear felled for ten or 15 years to come.  So the Deputy will appreciate that this matter may vary, depending on circumstances from year to year.  The figure is not a steady figure representing a clear felling of mature timber year by year.  Those other elements come in.  There are also other matters, such as thinnings, and so on, being sold.</P>
    <P>The price of timber, and forestry products outside mature timber, is always a matter of contention between those concerned in the trade and the officials of my Department.  This particularly refers to the price of timber which goes into wood pulp.  There has been an increase in the price of that timber in very recent months.  It is a matter, however, like other matters of this kind, that is always the subject of arguments as between those concerned in that business and the officers of my Department.  Suffice it to say that my Department try to get a realistic price for their produce, as the Dáil would naturally expect them to do.</P>
    <P>In connection with the five-day week raised by Deputy Tully, it would not be possible to do this in the winter without further reduction in the working hours or an extension of the normal workday to an undesirable extent at another time of the year.  That cannot be done under the Conditions of Employment Act, as the Deputy well knows.  We can work only a certain number of hours in a day and what the Deputy is advocating is that there should be still further reduction in the working hours.</P>

      <P>The work of the Forestry Department differs from the work of local authorities.  We have to work the hours as they are now to meet the agreement made.  I pointed out before that under the Conditions of Employment Act we could not make up for this time in working longer hours in summer without a breach of the existing law.</P>
      <P>I do not know who made the point&mdash; whether it was Deputy Tully or Deputy Esmonde&mdash;but there is not, in fact, any shortage of people available for work in State forests.  Indeed, the contrary is the case.  Notwithstanding what may be said or alleged here, wherever a new State forestry work is opening up, in my experience, there are very many more applicants seeking to get on the job, and to leave their employment in order to get on the job, than there are jobs for them.  I think this is the best indication as to conditions in forestry employment generally throughout rural Ireland.  That is my own experience and I am sure it is the experience of most Deputies who are familiar with areas in which forestry work is available.</P>
      <P>The sawmill rates have, I understand, been suitably adjusted in the ninth round, under the terms acceptable to those concerned.</P>

      <P>Where cutaway bogs are available, I should like to inform the Deputy that we are very glad to get them.  There is, however, as I pointed out to the House before, a certain amount of misunderstanding amongst some people who think there is a large amount of cutaway bog which is left by Bord na Móna and which is there for the taking and that something should be done with it.  That is not so. We are in close touch with Bord na Móna and we are quite prepared to plan and develop any cutaway bog we can get.  Generally speaking in connection with cutaway bog, from the forestry point of view, in acquiring it, one of the difficulties is there are many common owners of bogs and, secondly, perhaps there are one or two who have <Col N="797" /> rights to cut a bank of turf here or there.  It is for these reasons, as the Deputy will find if he has a particular bog in mind, that there are difficulties in the way of bringing them into the machine.</P>
      <P>The money provided was questioned under the different subheads here.  Subsection A has an additional sum of £65,000.  Practically every penny of that, or 90 per cent of it, is going to increasing foresters' pay, as distinct from forest workers.  There is £12,000 for travelling and incidental expenses which is also in the main for that same class, foresters, and there was some adjustment, I understand, in the travel or mileage allowance to which they were entitled.  The big portion of this Estimate under forest development and management, which is an additional sum of £322,000, is required to meet the increase in wages to which I referred in my opening statement, and to provide for the ninth round for the ordinary forestry workers throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
      <P>I am criticised for bringing in a Supplementary Estimate here.  All the matters covered by this Supplementary Estimate arose in the course of the year since I introduced my original Estimate for the Department.  Practically every penny of this Supplementary Estimate is due to the wage increases and the improvement in the conditions of employment for the different grades to which I have referred. If such a situation takes place during a year, how Deputy Flanagan can suggest that we can provide the money for it without coming to this House is just beyond my comprehension. The annual Estimate for the Forestry Department introduced into this House would have been quite sufficient for us only for these changes that took place during the year and it is to meet and provide for these changes that this Estimate is now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are accused of not making any reasonable effort to carry out a good national afforestation programme.  I have been invited to embark on what Deputy Flanagan says is a courageous forestry programme.  I think, in view of that, Sir, it is necessary that I should <Col N="798" /> run over a few figures.  For the year 1959-60, 25,100 acres were planted in this country; 1960-61, 26,069 acres; 1961-62, 25,317 acres; 1962-63, 24,708 acres and in 1963-64, 25,000 acres, making a total in those years of 126,194 acres.  I should like to compare that total with the miserable effort made by the Deputy who has been accusing us of not carrying out a courageous forestry programme.  His Government in 1948-49 planted a miserable 7,736 acres; 1949-50, 7,393 acres and 1950-51, 9,372 acres; 1954-55, 13,845 acres; 1955-56, 14,996 acres and 1956-57, 17,407 acres.  In those two periods of Coalition Government, the total amount planted by them was 70,749 acres in comparison with 126,194 acres planted under my direction over the past five years.  In this very year when Deputy Flanagan accuses us of not providing money for afforestation, we have provided £3,408,700 for afforestation in this country in comparison with what the Deputy's Party did in their last year of Government&mdash;£1,755,000, for the whole staffing of the Department as well as for the miserable intake of land that they had.  These are figures which neither the Deputy nor his Party can get over.  When he has the neck to come into this House and allege that we are falling down on forestry, let everybody know his own record when he was in Government and his efforts in this field.</P>
    <P>I do not know that it is necessary for me, in view of Deputy Flanagan's reputation for veracity, to say that it is a complete invention to suggest that we are finding difficulty in getting forestry students for our schools.  That allegation is utterly untrue.  It is completely untrue to say that foresters, because of their conditions, are leaving their employment, as alleged by the Deputy.  It is completely untrue and inaccurate to say that we are not turning out the same number of trained foresters for our national requirements. We turn out trained, after their final year, approximately 30 foresters per annum which is roughly the number we need for our expanding forestry programme.</P>
    <P>All these allegations will no doubt be repeated by Deputy Flanagan outside <Col N="799" /> this House in the hope that if he keeps telling an untruth often enough some people are bound to swallow it or some people are bound to believe it.</P>
    <P>I cannot follow Deputy Flanagan in his references to the Galway by-election. It is true that in Galway the Fine Gael octopus has, with its usual cannibalistic history, swallowed up half of a small Party.  The Deputy's Party has survived in Irish public life for the past 40 years by devouring cannibalistic-like some small Party but their latest meal, I can assure the Deputy, will not give the Party sustenance for very long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise for the purpose of supporting the amendment moved by the Leader of the main Opposition and standing in my name, amendment No. 7 to section 27.  The Leader of the Opposition dealt very fully last night with the importance and the urgency of this amendment.  I feel that he has said what every commonsense Deputy in this House would wish to say in relation to it.  Not alone has he done that but he has expressed <Col N="800" /> the opinions and the views of practically every landowner in Ireland.  I say &ldquo;every landowner in Ireland&rdquo; because of the large number of landowners throughout this country who, no matter what their political opinions may be, have expressed their horror and astonishment at and their indignation and dissatisfaction with the action taken by the Minister for Lands under section 27 of this Bill.  It is because of that dissatisfaction, and because of the great principle involved, that we in Fine Gael have tabled this amendment. It is designed to control and to minimise the activities of the Minister in relation to the extraordinary power which he is now taking.  It is a power in regard to which Deputy Dillon has given an undertaking, both last night and previously, and particularly to the people of Roscommon and Galway, at recent by-elections.  It has mainly been in regard to section 27 that so many of the landowners in Roscommon and Galway expressed their disapproval.  It is because we realise the Minister has power under this section that he ought not have that we are prompted to ask the House favourably to consider this amendment.</P>
      <P>Landowners, whether they own a small or an extensive holding, are united in the one expressed opinion that the Minister ought not have power to carry out an inspection of any man's lands.  We ask that the Minister intervene only when he is quite satisfied and when the evidence has been submitted to him, that the Land Commission have failed to make such an inspection.  It is generally felt that the Land Commission as an independent and judicial body, set up in a rather similar way to our courts, above influence and above intervention from any political Party, acting in an entirely independent manner, should alone have the right to consider whether or not a holding is to be inspected with a view to acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is still fresh in the minds of many landowners how, during the Emergency years, they were invaded by inspectors. One thing landowners do not like is the intrusion of inspectors on their property.  No State inspector should invade the privacy of any landowner, <Col N="801" /> unless he is invited by the landowner to go in, or unless he is going to give the landowner the benefit of advice in regard to the improvement of his lands or of his production methods.  Here, however, we find the unwelcome guest, the inspector, forced on the landowner by the Minister for Lands and he will come for the purpose of carrying out an inspection which may result in the landowner being deprived of his property and driven out on to the roadside, property which may have been held by his family for generations.</P>
    <P>I hate to think what opinions the young farmers of today must have when they realise that after 40 years of native Government, the time of Parliament is occupied with legislation designed, as this section is, to deprive them of their right of ownership of their property and to deprive them of fixity of tenure which, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out last night, was so dearly won and is so cherished by the landowners.  The Land Commission, in my opinion are quite capable and competent to carry out inspections which they feel should be carried out with a view to acquisition for the relief of congestion and we are asking the Minister now only to direct his inspections.  We cannot prevent him, for the time being, from doing that, but, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, we will, at the earliest possible time.  That is the pledge which the landowners have been given by the Fine Gael Party and which will be honoured certainly within the next 24 months.</P>
    <P>Until we can restore fixity of tenure, we propose to ask this House to ensure that the Minister use these powers only after the Land Commission have failed to carry out the desired inspections.  We feel that the Land Commission having carried out the job in the past are quite capable and competent to do so in the future without any political intervention. There are sure to be evil consequences when you have political intervention in regard to the inspection of lands and in regard to methods of depriving the landowners of fixity of tenure.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister whether he is satisfied that the <Col N="802" /> inspection of land to date by the Land Commission has been carried out in a satisfactory way, or what does he see wrong with the present position.  The only explanation he has given for taking these powers is that he feels they will lead to the speeding up of land division.  Last night a Deputy said that this was the section which put teeth into the Bill.  The reason the people have shown their confidence in this Party is that Fianna Fáil have put those teeth into this section, into the Minister.  We are satisfied that the Minister and his political henchmen will provide sufficient strength of jaw to drive those teeth into the owners of every holding in Ireland where the political Party of which the Minister is a member feels they deserve a chop of those teeth.  The reason we object to this so strenuously is that the Minister is taking unto himself such teeth in order to drive them into the landowners of this country and deprive them of what they have so dearly won.</P>
    <P>If the Land Commission can carry out an efficient inspection&mdash;and I have every confidence in their ability to do so in an impartial manner&mdash;why is it necessary for the Minister to authorise them to do so?  Under the law as it stands, the Minister has no say, good, bad or indifferent, in regard to the inspection of land.  At an earlier stage of this Bill, we had a long statement from a Deputy saying he took it on himself to inspect a farm at midnight with the headlights of his car, as a result, in the course of a few days he was responsible for seeing to it that the Minister took action&mdash;he complimented the Minister on it&mdash;and the farm was acquired.  When a Fianna Fáil Deputy can do that, what will happen to people's property when the Minister will have the right to inspect their lands?</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter for the future of this country.  A grave principle is involved here.  No Fianna Fáil Deputy should have the right to carry out a midnight inspection of his neighbour's land with the headlights of his car.  No Fianna Fáil Minister&mdash;or the Minister of any other Party&mdash;should have the right to authorise the inspection of any lands with a view to <Col N="803" /> acquisition.  Later, we will be dealing with an amendment on which we can demonstrate to the House the more serious consequences of such action, when we see that a decision as to inspection will have to be given by an officer of the Minister's Department who will sit as one of the Commissioners. However, we will have an opportunity of dealing with that later.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is dissatisfied with the slowness with which the Land Commission inspect holdings, without taking unto himself the power to authorise an inspection, what would prevent him calling the Land Commission together and telling them it was the opinion of the Government that they should speed up their activities?  There would be nothing to stop the Minister making a recommendation, which would be considered by the Land Commission in the same way as they are always prepared to consider representations made by any section of the community, without, at the same time, interfering with their independent right of decision.</P>
    <P>The power of inspection should be vested in the Land Commission and in them alone.  No other person should have, or seek to have, that power.  If the Minister had sufficient evidence before him to justify his feeling that the Land Commission were failing in their duty, there is nothing to stop him dismissing the personnel of the Land Commission and re-appointing, on the nomination of the Government, their successors, with the request that they carry out their duties with speed and efficiency but, at the same time, leaving to them the right to determine whose land should be inspected, when and by what means.</P>
    <P>This is a most desirable amendment. In recent weeks the Minister should have learned a lesson and should accept this amendment.  It was put down for the purpose of loosening the teeth in the section and of nullifying the Minister's powers under this section.  For the moment, it is the best we in the Opposition can do, until we are in a position to do better.  Section 27 is so bad and so evil in motive and design that <Col N="804" /> the amendment is the only way by which we can possibly try to render it harmless.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister, in the event of the amendment being rejected by the House, and when the Bill becomes law, does he propose, as the law will enable and entitle him to do, to authorise what inspections he desires of various lands and farms submitted to him by the Fianna Fáil organisation? Would it not be better if instead of using the powers vested in him by section 27, if the Minister, as my amendment suggests, would give the Land Commission an opportunity of doing their job first, independently? Should they fail, then the Minister could authorise the inspections.  First, he should be satisfied beyond all doubt that the Land Commission, as an independent and competent body, had failed in their duty.  It is only when they had failed and evidence was available in the Department that they had either failed or refused or had delayed in the carrying out of an inspection, that the Minister could use the powers vested in him in section 27.</P>
    <P>There are principles which all of us cherish.  Many people have what they consider to be their own high principles. Some may have political principles. Some may have principles characteristic of their individuality.  A principle with which the people of rural Ireland can be associated is the principle of fixity of tenure.  That principle has been endangered.  It is for that reason that the Fine Gael Party ask the House to accept this amendment. I am quite satisfied that the amendment, in its own small way, will help for the time being to convey to landowners that the Land Commission must first be given the opportunity before the political head of the Department intervenes.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult for any Deputy to say something that has not been said already in relation <Col N="805" /> to this matter.  I agree that the time of the House ought not to be occupied by repetition of statements. We do not learn anything new from repetition.  That has been the way with the Minister for Lands.  The more the Fine Gael Party have stressed the seriousness of the powers taken upon himself by the Minister, the more there has been public demonstration outside this House against the authority which the Minister is taking to himself, the less heed the Minister has taken of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is an argument against repetition and it is an argument also that the Minister has failed to lend a favourable ear to the wise counsel and just advice given to him by the Opposition.  The reaction to that has been demonstrated in no uncertain manner by every single voter who got the opportunity of voting since the Minister introduced this Land Bill.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  It is, as Deputy Dillon has pointed out, the very best we can do for the time being and I trust the House will accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather difficult to talk seriously on this amendment which has been described by the Leader of the main Opposition as a contemptuous amendment and one on which he does not intend to divide the House.  That being the view of the Leader of the main Opposition of Deputy Flanagan's amendment that we are discussing here, I do not suppose that I should devote much time to it except that it is probably necessary to put on the records of the House that the amendment would entirely frustrate the purpose of the section, which is to expedite the process of inspection generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically, what I have proposed is that the decision to inspect will be delegated in every case to the senior inspector of the region or province. In this way reference back and forth to Dublin on this point will be avoided.  What is proposed in the <Col N="806" /> amendment is that the reference back and forth to Dublin will continue and that the senior inspector will be able to order an inspection only if the Commissioners unreasonably fail to do so.</P>
    <P>Let us glance at the mechanics of that proposition.  Firstly, is does not provide for tackling the problem either realistically or expeditiously and, secondly, it fails to recognise that the Commissioners, being superior in rank, cannot rationally be overruled by an inspector, which this amendment suggests.  It would simply cause an upset in the working of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The amendment, of course, is put down for a purpose and if it is the view of the Leader of the main Opposition that it should be treat contemptuously, perhaps we can treat it with the contempt which it deserves. But, outside this amendment the opportunity was taken to roam, high, wide and handsome, on the whole of this section and whereas practically everything that Deputy Dillon said last night or Deputy Flanagan said today would be far more relevant to another amendment which they have tabled and on which we will have to discuss these matters in principle, still, it is necessary for me to nail some of the wilder statements that have been made.</P>
    <P>Under section 27&mdash;let me reiterate because it is necessary to do so to nail these falsehoods&mdash;it is the Land Commissioners who must decide what land will or will not be taken.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying it was necessary to repeat that under this Bill it is still the Land Commissioners who will decide what land may be taken or may not be taken in the very same way as they have had to decide what land would or would not be taken under the Land Acts down through the years since 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What this section proposes is that a senior inspector can authorise the signing of a section 40 inspection <Col N="807" /> notice.  Let me reiterate that this section starts off by stating that it is there for the purpose of removing doubt, that as far as the legal advisers of the Land Commission can determine or ascertain, the question of signing a section 40 inspection notice was never a reserved or excepted function of the Land Commissioners.  Even if it were, all these crocodile tears now being shed for alleged invasion of the Land Commissioners' domain were conspicuously absent when Deputy Dillon and his colleagues were putting through the 1950 Land Bill because in section 12, subsection (1) (d) for the first time, it is stated:</P>
    <P>the determination (other than any determination arising in or being part of a re-arrangement scheme) of the persons to be selected as allottees of any land;</P>
    <P>For the first time the power was given to the political head of the Department solely to deal with rearrangement schemes and that power which was always reserved to the Commissioners of the Irish Land Commission as an excepted matter was swept away under section 12 of the 1950 Act by Deputy Dillon and his colleagues without any song and dance about the awful thing it was to interfere in the domain of matters reserved to the Land Commissioners. Subsection (2) of section 12 of the same Act says:</P>
    <P>Any power or duty for the time being vested by law (including this Act) in the Land Commission or the Lay Commissioners may, save in relation to excepted matters, be exercised or performed by&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the Minister, or</P>
    <P>(b)  any officer of the Minister or the Land Commission for the time being authorised, whether specifically or by reference to a class of such officers, in that behalf by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in dealing with rearrangement schemes if I wanted to, either I or an inspector appointed by me and sent down specially by me could go round in that land slum and say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" />&ldquo;Pat, you will get only half an acre&rdquo; or &ldquo;John, you will get four acres&rdquo;, and so on.  That power of dealing with rearrangement and additions was, since the foundation of this State, a reserved function of the Lay Commissioners until Deputy Dillon and his friends removed it under the 1950 Act.  These are the people who suggest that it is an outrageous thing that in order to cut red tape and expedite matters, I should have the power to authorise divisional inspectors&mdash;and there are only four of them in the country under my seal&mdash;to serve the preliminary inspection notice.</P>
    <P>Let us get this clear&mdash;we shall have it again, I know, but Deputy Dillon had a rehash of it last night&mdash;this procedure of the Secretary-Commissioner of the Land Commission sending out notices and sitting on the case has been going on since the foundation of the State.  The Lay Commissioners who have signed the notice for the purpose of getting a preliminary inspection under section 40 have to sit and hear the case in respect of which they authorise the inspection.  That has been the position since 1922.  How would they inform themselves as to whether lands should be taken or should not be taken unless they authorise the inspectorate of the Land Commission to go in and make a report to them as to the user of the land and as to the suitability of that land for the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>It is utter nonsense to create the fear in people's minds that by this provision every farmer in Ireland will be affected. I have no doubt that this smokescreen is paying political dividends for the Deputies who have created it.  It is not appreciated that since away back in 1923 there has been no such thing as fixity of tenure in this country.  It is not appreciated that in respect of any land where a man is working day and night, working it according to the best methods of husbandry, giving full employment and even though having no other means of livelihood, under the existing law, if there is congestion in the vicinity, the Land Commission are entitled to go in and take that land willy-nilly.</P>
    <P>It is suggested we are doing away with fixity of tenure here.  That law is <Col N="809" /> there but everybody knows that it is only in the case of badly worked land, or in the case of the absentee owner or the <i>fánach</i> farmer who is letting his land year after year that the Land Commission move in.  When they do that, all these rights provided by law are still there for his protection and, taking one thing with another notwithstanding all the inspections that take place in the normal way of the Land Commission, in the case of approximately half of them no further action is taken.  Even where compulsory proceedings are initiated only in about 40 per cent of these cases is the land allowed by the court to be acquired for Land Commission purposes.  These are in the main the worst worked lands in the country.  That is the type of land that Land Commission policy deals with and that is as it should be.  To suggest, because the law is as I have stated, that under this Bill the purpose is to move in on every working farmer, is absolutely utter nonsense.</P>
    <P>Let me put this on record also.  In reference to section 27, I should like to quote section 40 (6) of the 1923 Land Act of which we hear so much from the Leader of the main Opposition. Section 40 (6) provides that any inspector or other person appointed by the Land Commission may, after notice sent by post to the person who appears to be the owner or occupier of any land, enter upon the land and make all such inquiries as may be necessary to enable the Land Commission to ascertain the extent and character thereof and such other particulars in relation thereto as they may require for the purposes of the Act.  That is the law about inspections since 1923.  The material words are &ldquo;any inspector or other person appointed by the Land Commission&rdquo;, not by the Land Commissioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>What is the difference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy does not know the difference between the Land Commission and the Land Commissioners he is wasting much of the time of the House.  The Land Commission is under my control; the Commissioners, except in connection <Col N="810" /> with excepted matters, are under my control and work under me as political head.  Let that be clearly understood because it appears to me that the Leader of the main Opposition is utterly ignorant of the work of the Land Commission and the respective powers and functions of the political head of the Land Commission and the Lay Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Any inspector on the staff of the Land Commission was authorised under the 1923 Land Act to carry out inspection.  In case anybody should contend that is not so and a doubt could arise, by this section I am simply putting the matter beyond doubt.  The very first words of this section state that it is there for the removal of doubt.  I am satisfied that a mere reporting of the facts concerning any land, its ownership, character, user and conditions of local congestion in accordance with the terms of the 1923 Land Act, that is left to the commissioners as an excepted matter, raises no doubt that this will alter the position where little more than half of the inspected lands will, in the last analysis, be subjected to steps for acquisition.  These rights are still there. Under that section, since 1923, we have the power of an inspector to go and inspect land and, under this section, to remove doubt, I am making it clear that a divisional inspector, instead of having files going up and down gathering red tape, will be able, where matters are brought to his notice by his local inspectorate in the different areas he controls, to sign the inspection notice so that a report will come up to the Land Commissioners to enable them to determine whether that land is suitable for the relief of congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be clear as to what the purpose is.  If the Land Commissioners so decide, as it was their function to decide since 1923, that these lands should be taken over, the owner has an appeal against that on the question of law to the Judicial Commissioner and, indeed, up to the Supreme Court, and on the question of price to the Judicial Commissioner who is a judge of the High Court.  As regards the status of these Land Commissioners, let me make it clear that they are not, <Col N="811" /> as Deputy Dillon suggests, judicial personages. That status was taken from them a long time ago, strange to say, by the 1923 Act, to which the Deputy has referred.  They did have the status of county court judges before that Act but under that Act&mdash;and on the next amendment on which this is relevant, I shall have the relevant section here&mdash; that position was changed so that they are in the position of independent arbitrators of the Minister in respect of these specified excepted matters to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>That function is still there and it takes two&mdash;not one&mdash;of them to decide whether the land should be taken for Land Commission purposes or not. That law is not being interfered with. The picture that is being painted around this section that all the Land Commission inspectors will be let loose on the country for political purposes to enable the land of enemies of the political head of the Department to be acquired, is utter nonsense.  It is being said for the purpose of misrepresenting the purposes of this Bill and to frighten people who do not know the law and do not know that since 1923 that power is there enabling the Land Commission inspector to go in under section 40 and inspect any land, and report back to the Land Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The other matters referred to by Deputy Dillon last night during the performance he put on about evicted tenants should fool nobody.  This section has nothing to do with evicted tenants or with evicting anybody.  It simply provides that the four most senior officials in the Land Commission, in charge of the four different quarters of the country through the administrative machine, will be enabled to sign an inspection notice to authorise a man to inspect lands that have come under notice so as to enable the Commissioners to have that report of the inspectors to enable them to decide whether such lands should be taken or not.  That is the sole purpose of the section.  It is there for the purpose of removing doubt and for the purpose of ensuring a speeding-up in the Land Commission machine.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> I shall not follow Deputy Dillon's performance last night quoting from some unnamed document what he alleged to be the view of anonymous Land Commission officials.  In all my experience of this House I have never seen such procedures sanctioned.  In any case, just as I would treat an anonymous letter, I shall not waste time in dealing with alleged opinions of men whom the Leader of the main Opposition is afraid to name or will not name in the House.  That is the kind of smokescreen which they are endeavouring to raise on this section to try to create an atmosphere that something extraordinary is being done and that knowledgeable people are of the view that there is something revolutionary in the section.  However, we shall, no doubt, have this out in more detail on the second next amendment tabled by the Opposition.  I shall have to go into the law, for the purpose of keeping the records right, in more detail on that amendment.  It has been said by the Leader of the Opposition that they do not intend to divide the House on this amendment.  Therefore, I do not think I should devote any further time to what Deputy Dillon himself called a contentious amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>The thing that puzzles me about all this is why the Minister feels so deeply that he himself tells us that this amendment is purely for the purpose of securing greater expedition in the inspection of land for the purpose of permitting the Lay Commissioners to determine whether or not it should be acquired.  He never fails to emphasise what I have repeatedly said, that we have never suggested, and do not suggest, that section 27 was designed to confer on the Minister the power of acquisition.  That is a reserved power still in the hands of the Lay Commissioners.  The only power section 27 seeks to transfer from the Lay Commissioners to the political head of the Department is the power to order inspection with a view to acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully is here.  I want members of the Fianna Fáil Party to note what Deputy Tully said about section 27.  Deputy Tully takes quite an interest <Col N="813" /> in this.  I do not think I misrepresent his position if I say that he takes the view that it might be a very good thing if everybody who is a tenant of land in Ireland were a tenant of the State as the ultimate authority for the user of the land and that if any user misused his right, it should be taken from him and should be given to some other person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy presumes too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the direction in which Deputy Tully leans.  I lean in the opposition direction.  I believe if a man is living on the land, he should own his land.  By that unique title for which he has no superior except God Almighty, he is entitled to his land.  I am proud to avow that.  Deputy Tully says he rejoices in section 27.  He is quite unlike the Minister who says section 27 is really of no consequence and is there only for the removal of doubt.  Deputy Tully says this is what puts teeth into the Land Commission, this is what makes the Land Commission bite effectively.  The Minister considers it desirable to institute inspection for the purposes of acquisition.</P>
      <P>I called for a quorum to bring in Fianna Fáil Deputies because I do not believe all members of the Fianna Fáil Party want to see a situation which, in the words of Deputy Tully, will put teeth in the Land Commission to enable the Minister&mdash;any Minister&mdash; for Lands to institute inspection with a view to the acquisition of the holding of any individual in the country.  I urge on the members of the Fianna Fáil Party to note well the impression conveyed on Deputy Tully's mind by section 27.  He is no neophyte; he did not come into the House today or yesterday.  He is as well able to read and understand the Bill as anybody else and he is as capable of interpreting section 27 as anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in order to draw those teeth that we put this amendment on the paper.  We do not want the political head of the Department of Lands to have power, or to have teeth, to sink into the flesh of any individual who owns land in this country, whether he <Col N="814" /> owns five acres or 100 acres.  We say fixity of tenure is a very precious asset and one that we have carried on in this country since 1885, when the first Land Act was passed.  For 70 years we have, generation after generation, scrupulously maintained fixity of tenure.  Were they all wrong?  I think they were right.  This is the first Minister for Lands who has ever challenged that.  We have had a Fianna Fáil Government; we have had a Cumann na nGaedhael Government; we have had a Fianna Fáil Government; we have had an inter-Party Government; we have had a Fianna Fáil Government, an inter-Party Government and then another Fianna Fáil Government. In none of these seven administrations has anyone ever challenged this principle before.  This is the first time it has been challenged.</P>
    <P>Let me follow the Minister through the case he makes today.  He says: &ldquo;The only thing this does is to give four high officials of my Department&rdquo;&mdash;I emphasise &ldquo;high officials&rdquo;&mdash;there are only four of them in the country&mdash;&ldquo;the power to issue a section 40 inspection notice.&rdquo;  Now it is to be done on the instruction of the Minister for Lands, where, heretofore, it could be done only on the instruction of the Lay Commissioners.  We cannot divorce from our minds the other sections of the Bill.  We shall return to this in greater detail when we discuss a later amendment.  One of the Lay Commissioners will be the Secretary of the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>What is the machinery whereby the Minister authorises an act to be done under his seal?  The Minister instructs the Secretary of his Department to give effect to his decision and the Secretary will be a Lay Commissioner.  The Secretary instructs one senior inspector to go and inspect somebody's land, which the Minister has instructed him to do.  Now what?  The land is inspected. The land is inspected on the Minister's direct communication to the high official by the Secretary of the Department of Lands.  The question now comes before the Lay Commissioners to determine whether the land is in fact suitable for acquisition.  One <Col N="815" /> of the Lay Commissioners is the Secretary, whom the Minister has ordered to direct the senior inspector to inspect the land for acquisition.  When it comes to examination of the case, nobody will be heard by the Lay Commissioners but the paid inspectors of the Land Commission, every one of whom depends for his prospects of promotion and advancement in the service of the Land Commission on the judgement of the Secretary of the Department of Lands.</P>
    <P>The Minister said to the House today: &ldquo;Remember, on questions of law, there is an appeal from the findings of the Lay Commissioners to the High Court and, indeed, to the Supreme Court, if the matter is of sufficient gravity to justify it.&rdquo;  I put it to the Minister that he is an experienced, practising solicitor and that, in saying that, he has been extremely disingenuous because he knows as well as I do that on any matter of fact there is no appeal from the Land Commission at all to anybody.  If you are charged with petty theft, if you are charged with murder, and you are brought before a court of competent jurisdiction, there is an appeal on all the <i>mens rea</i> to the whole hierarchy of the judiciary; but, in the acquisition of your land, the only matter on which there can be any probable valid difference is the matter of fact.  Do the facts alleged by the inspectors of the Land Commissioners truly exist in respect of the lands proposed to be acquired?</P>
    <P>On that issue no one can be heard but the inspectors of the Land Commission and from the findings of the Land Commission there is no appeal to anybody.  Now, is it frank and honest for the Minister for Lands, who is himself a solicitor and who has appeared, I suppose, in thousands of cases on behalf of clients in the Land Commission, to tell the House that any person aggrieved has, in respect of a point of law, an appeal to the superior court?  We all know that in regard to price there is an appeal from the decision of the Land Commissioners to the Land Judge, but how often in the <Col N="816" /> Minister's experience in the Land Commission work that has passed through his hands has he found himself obliged to appeal on a point of law from a finding of the Land Commission to the superior court?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of personal explanation, and in case anyone is misled, I will quote for the Deputy subsection (4) of section 25 of the Land Act, 1936:</P>
      <P>An appeal shall lie from every decision under this section of the Lay Commissioners (other than the members of the Appeal Tribunal) to the Appeal Tribunal on questions of law or of value, and the decision of the Appeal Tribunal shall be final subject only to any appeal to the Supreme Court on question of law.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon knows quite well that every question of fact must be decided by the Commissioners really on a question of law, because the statutes define what is good husbandry and what are the protections for the farmer against acquisition, so that, in fact, you have an appeal; and a regular appeal, outside the question of price, is where people fight against the acquisition and there is an appeal taken from the Lay Commissioners to the Judicial Commissioner. I said that it is on a question of strict law only from the Judicial Commissioner to the Supreme Court, but let me tell the Deputy that I have been in the Supreme Court on questions of law on a number of occasions on appeal from the Judicial Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, we are all agreed that on an issue of law, there is appeal all the way through the whole judicial system, but the real fact is that 90 per cent of the differences that exist between persons who own land and who go before the Land Commission are on matters of fact, in which there is no appeal, and all I say is that I feel it is disingenous of the Minister inadequately to distinguish, for the information of the House, the difference between appeal on law and on fact.  They are two entirely different things and substantially on questions <Col N="817" /> of fact, there is no appeal.  So far as my information goes, in the proceedings before the two Land Commissioners who hear the case for acquisition, the only evidence that can be called is that of the inspectors of the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>I was not aware of that.

      <P>The Minister quoted section 12 of the Land Act and from the quotation he gave, would anyone believe that the effect of section 12 was to increase the number of excepted matters reserved to the Lay Commissioners from six to 14?  The impression created by the Minister was that section 12 transferred from the Lay Commissioners very substantial jurisdiction and further limited the number of matters which were restricted to their discretion. In fact, it increased the number of matters restricted to their discretion.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In this subsection the expression `re-arrangement scheme' means a scheme for the re-arrangement of land held in rundale or intermixed plots whether with or without the distribution of other lands to facilitate the said re-arrangement, such other <Col N="818" /> lands being either adjoining any of the land held in rundale or intermixed plots ...&rdquo; Subsection (2) says: &ldquo;Any power or duty for the time being vested by law (including this Act) in the Land Commission or the Lay Commissioners may, save in relation to excepted matters, be exercised or performed by&mdash; (a) the Minister or (b) any officer of the Minister or the Land Commission for the time being authorised ....&rdquo; The land law is extremely complex to read and digest on one's feet but, in fact, I believe the power there conferred on the Minister for Lands was to relieve the situation of dealing with rundale estates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>I know all about the rundale estates and I know all about the man in the red waistcoat who went down to settle the rundale estates.  I have been listening to the rundale estates all my life and I know them intimately.  Of course they always constituted, as the Minister says, the hard core of virtually insoluble land settlement, and if the Minister had come in here and asked the House frankly and openly for special powers to deal with rundale estates, I certainly should have heard such an application with great sympathy.  How many Deputies know what a rundale estate is?  How many people in Ireland know what a rundale estate is?  According to the Minister, one would think every man you met on the street would know all about them.  They are as rare now as white blackbirds and 99 people out of 100 walking the roads of Ireland in any <Col N="819" /> part of the country would not, I venture to say, know what one meant by the word &ldquo;rundale&rdquo;.  The Minister practised all his life in Castlebar, and I lived all my life in Mayo.  A person living in Galway or Mayo is familiar with this problem, but outside those two counties, how much rundale is there left in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot in those two, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>Have we not steadily and progressively eroded it down through the years with care and circumspection? We have taken an infinity of trouble.  The Congested Districts Board approached it gingerly, carefully and slowly because they understood the problem and were determined they would not leave any feuds that would last from generation, to generation, to generation.  They were perfectly right, but it took them 20 or 30 years in some cases satisfactorily to re-arrange rundale estates.  No one but a fool would have done other than they did.</P>
      <P>Every one of those rundale estates was settled without the shedding of a drop of blood, without firing a shot, without injury to animals, without a single explosion of agrarian outrage. That should be one of the Minister's proudest boasts of his Department.  It is one of their great achievements.  So many of the countries on the Continent of Europe found it so insoluble a problem that they simply swept it under the carpet.  Here it was tackled slowly and skilfully by the Congested Districts Board, until, as the Minister says, we are down now to a small hard core of the rundale problem which still remains to be resolved.  In this year of 1964 it would be legitimate to ask ourselves whether in the small remaining intractable areas, we might not consider a more drastic approach, but I would listen with close attention to the advice of the older and more experienced inspectors of the Land Commission who, I suspect, would tell us the best way would be to keep on going slowly and gradually, and perhaps they would be right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> I freely admit that in regard to rundale there is a unique problem, but we are not dealing with rundale: we are dealing with the whole untenanted land of Ireland.  In that connection all we are asking is to provide that the power to order inspections for the purpose of acquisition will continue to be a reserved function of the Land Commission. It is all eyewash for the Minister to tell the House today that I said the Land Commissioners held their office by judicial tenure.  I never said any such thing.  I said the Land Commissioners held their office by quasi-judicial tenure.  The Minister says they are independent arbitrators. If the Minister can distinguish a difference between a quasi-judicial office and the office of an independent arbitrator, I should be grateful to hear it. He knows perfectly well there is no distinction.  I know, as he knows, that they ceased to have the stature of county court judges years ago, but the 1923 Act was solicitous to preserve in them their independence of outside pressures, for the simple reason, as we all know from our own experience, that if they were not free from that kind of pressure, the honest discharge of their extremely laborious and difficult duties would be impossible.</P>
    <P>The astonishing thing in regard to the 14 excepted matters is that the Minister himself does not propose that we should revert to the old rule of having only six.  He himself said he proposes to leave the 14 reserved matters as reserved matters and he said: &ldquo;We have always believed the right to issue this inspection order was not a reserved matter, but we have always been afraid to act in that belief for fear we might be wrong.  Therefore, in order to ensure that any proceedings we initiated would stand the test of litigation, we have acted on the assumption that it was a reserved matter.  Now we want to declare what we have always hoped and believed to be true: that it is not a reserved matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister says the reason he wants it is that from their point of view it involves no question of principle. He merely wants it to improve <Col N="821" /> the expedition with which lands can be inspected.  I believe this is a matter in respect of which the Minister has dug his heels in the ground.  He feels that he is challenged and is obliged to fight.  God only knows why.  If he had not got the bit between his teeth he would have met us in a reasonable way and said: &ldquo;You feel deeply about this and think we can get increased expedition by increasing the field force of inspectors, and perhaps appointing senior inspectors who would go on to any area where things appeared to be moving too slowly, contact the inspectors, and see if some change would not make things go faster.&rdquo;  We have said already that if there is a lack of inspectors in any area, we will strongly support the Minister in the House in asking for additional staff, and we will strongly support additional supervisory services in any area where things are not moving as fast as he would like.</P>
    <P>Is it a reasonable man's reply to such representations to say: &ldquo;Never, never, never.&rdquo;  Outside Bedlam, no man would make such a reply to a responsible case.  I cannot get into the Minister's mind.  I cannot imagine what he is up to, because he seems to move from one foot to another.  One moment he seems to think it is bluff on our part, and the next that we are trying to run some extraordinary political stunt.  If we are running a political stunt, can he not sweep the ground from under our feet by saying: &ldquo;Forget it; if you do not like this way of expediting the procedure, we will give yours a trial.&rdquo; If I am running a political stunt, I am immediately exposed to the country. I must say at once: &ldquo;If this is the Minister's reply to our representations, that is fair enough.  He met us on this. What is more, he said he feels deeply that we are mistaken but he is prepared to give it a try.  We do not want anyone to feel that any fundamental right was being violated.&rdquo;  Accordingly, if this were a cheap political stunt, unless we were all lunatics we would not go to a by-election that we wanted to win and, over a campaign of three long weeks, put this matter in issue before the people, laying ourselves <Col N="822" /> open to the full blast of contradiction, correction and exposure, if that opportunity were available to the Minister and his colleagues.  What does the Minister think we are up to?  We are telling him we want expedition, and we are telling him we agree that no delay should be tolerated.  We are telling him that any assistance he wants in order to secure expedition we shall help him to get.</P>
    <P>I am giving him here, and I make no apology for it, the accumulated advice of every ex-Land Commissioner and the Minister is not right recklessly to say that I offered the anonymous advice of officers of the Land Commission. If I asked officers of the Land Commission to give me an opinion which differed from the Minister's declared policy, any such officers would quickly tell me to go take a running jump at myself and it would not matter whether they heartily agreed with me or not.  The tradition in the Civil Service is that every officer will support the declared policy of the Minister, and the Minister for Lands knows that and he should not have said that.  Perhaps, he said it inadvertently.</P>
    <P>I never said the authorities I quoted represented the views of officers of the Land Commission.  What I said was that I had consulted every available ex-Commissioner and every available person who I believed ever had experience of Land Commission work, and the distillation of their long experience in the discharge of that work was precisely what I related to this House.  I am not exaggerating when I say that the distillation of their wisdom is fairly expressed in these words:</P>
    <P>The point about the new plan of inspection of land might henceforward be by Ministerial act.  This could cause panic in the country if pursued to excess, especially by any Minister.</P>
    <P>Note it is not &ldquo;by the Minister&rdquo;. There is not a reference specifically to the present Minister.  It is a reference to any Minister.</P>
    <P>Once a Land Commission inspector <Col N="823" /> is sent on a man's land, there is fear and trembling and intense anxiety in that man's mind until the business is finalised properly, and if that is done under Ministerial control in any way, nothing can stop people believing it was the work of the local Government TD.  At the moment I am not applying that to Fianna Fáil TDs: I am applying it to the members of the Party to whom the Minister belongs, whoever the Minister may be.  If I were Minister for Lands in the morning it would apply to me with exactly the same force as to the present Minister.</P>
    <P>The excuse for this proposal is to stop delays in the acquisition procedure, the inference being that such delays are caused by red tape in the Land Commissioners' office.  This is a very ancient wheeze.  The truth is that the one place where there is and has been no delay is in the Land Commission offices.  Years ago, when the complaint was first made, the Land Commission were determined to clear their desks as speedily as possible and keep them clear.  This combined source of wisdom which I have been quoting goes on:</P>
    <P>There is a quota of delay and the remedy is quite simple.  That quota of delay is with the outdoor inspectors and it is not due to any failure of the inspectors diligently to do their work.  It is due to the fact that in certain areas the Land Commission have not at their disposal a sufficient number of inspectors.</P>
    <P>Then, let there be more inspectors appointed.  The very simple remedy is to tighten up the outdoor fabric of the Irish Land Commission by appointing a few senior inspectors at headquarters to make constant visits to areas where the work is in arrears.  If that course is adopted any existing delays can easily be put an end to.</P>
    <P>In five, ten or 15 years, this proposal will make no difference whatever to the expedition with which land inspection is conducted but it will create turmoil in the minds of our people, particularly those west of the Shannon.  I do not want teeth put in the Land Commission <Col N="824" /> and I especially do not want those teeth put in by the transfer of the powers of the Land Commission to the political head of the Department.  I do not believe there is a single Fianna Fáil Deputy representing a constituency west of the Shannon, in Kerry, or Clare, or in Donegal, or in Monaghan or Cavan for that matter, who does not in his heart know that in regard to this matter I am right.</P>
    <P>The solution of the land problem in Ireland is a monument to the tact, the patience, the forbearance of the officers of the old Congested Districts Board and of the Irish Land Commission.  It is a marvellous story, when you look back on it, that since 1885, in all the rearrangement done during the tempestuous times through which we have passed, I do not think you can say that a drop of blood was spilled or the hair of a man's head touched as a result of the operations of the Irish Land Commission. Some of us can remember the early days when the CDB had a great deal to do in the west of Ireland. Sometimes in the pursuit of their duty, the officers of the board had to face the task of dividing up equitably lands, some of them in rundale, which had been the subject of acrimony for years.</P>
    <P>I remember Sir Henry Doran going round the roads and gathering the tenants around him.  He would get up on a ditch and talk to them, explaning his purpose.  One day some fellow gave him a five pound note to try to bribe him.  Sir Henry brought that man along to the next meeting, took the five pound note out of his pocket and told the people there assembled: &ldquo;That fellow there has tried to bribe me.  I shall make a report to the Land Commission and he will never get an acre of land if I can prevent it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The way they moved among the people and the people grew to trust them is a monument of glory to the Irish Land Commission and to the Congested Districts Board, many of whose officers now adorn the staff of the Irish Land Commission.  All of it was built up on this extraordinary method we had worked out.  They were away from the possibility of contact with political influence of any kind. <Col N="825" /> How many Ministers for Lands have endured inquisition on this point? People have been forced to say again and again: &ldquo;Control the inspection for acquisition of land.&rdquo;  I have heard numerous Deputies here say that you ought to.  Whatever side of the House I have sat on, I always supported the Minister for Lands when he said: &ldquo;I cannot and I will not.&rdquo; This is the first Minister who has ever departed from that principle.  Why he has elected to do so, is a complete mystery to me.  I solemnly warn him that he puts in jeopardy a reputation built up over 70 years of peaceful reform in land tenure in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to warn the House of this. The old CDB, the Congested Districts Board, was universally recognised in my part of the country as the friend of the people.  It was then merged into the Irish Land Commission and the Irish Land Commission came to be regarded as the friend of the people. The people trusted the Land Commission inspectors and felt that they had a high sense of responsibility and that they acted under a very stern control utterly remote from the possibility of intervention.  They never can believe that again if section 27 stands, particularly if the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment we are now submitting.</P>
    <P>I want this House to realise what it is doing.  We are quite casually throwing away 70 years' work on no other plea than that this will expedite the inspection of land for the purpose of acquisition.  I solemnly assure this House that this proposal will do nothing to expedite the inspection of land.  I solemnly assure this House that any effective measures by way of strengthening the staff of the Irish Land Commission to expedite this work we will support most readily without any possible delay.  But, if the Minister persists in this proposal, it is like going out to cut down a 70-year-old oak because he wants to make a walking stick out of one branch.</P>
    <P>I know why he does it and I am disappointed that certain members of his Party, who I know share my view, have not been able to prevail upon him to yield in this matter.  He would do credit <Col N="826" /> to himself and to this liberal assembly and he would do a great deal to facilitate the passage of this Bill into law, if he would now accept the amendment. This is not the last Land Bill that will ever be passed in this House.</P>
    <P>There is one last word I should like to say.  It is not true that I described this as a contemptible amendment.  I drafted it with Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan.  We sat down and worked together and for every word in that amendment, I share the responsibility with Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan.  What I said was: &ldquo;It is not the second best; it is the second worst&rdquo;.  That is true. The worst is section 27 as it stands. Section 27 with our amendment would be a million miles away from the preservation of the principle we seek to maintain, but it would be better than the worst, just one degree.  I said I recommend this amendment to the House only as the second worst.  I do not want to be on the records of the House as suggesting that this amendment removes the radical and fatal evil enshrined in section 27.</P>
    <P>I am now struggling to avoid the worst consequences of this deplorable view on the part of the Minister for Lands.  It is not true to say that I announced that it was not our intention to divide on this amendment because of our contempt for it.  I said we would not divide on it because, by voting for it, it might appear that we believed it to be an acceptable substitute for the situation which section 27 operates to destroy.  We will not put it to the test of the Lobby because it is the second worst; but, even as the second worst, it would be some departure on the part of the Minister if, at this stage, he said: &ldquo;Very well; if this will help you, I am prepared to concede it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If, as I suspect, he feels himself in some way deeply committed, feels he has drawn his Party into a difficult position and must defend it to the last ditch, then I know reason can never prevail.  I think he is living under an illusion if he feels that way.  It would redound to his credit and the credit of his Party if he said even now: &ldquo;In view of the fact that the Opposition feel so deeply about this, we want to <Col N="827" /> meet them&rdquo;.  I am perfectly certain I could get a very large section of the Fianna Fáil Party to advocate that cause if they could make their voices effectively heard.  I only regret that none of them has ventured into this Chamber to say in any form they choose to employ: &ldquo;Remember we are a deliberative assembly and the truest test of democracy is not the strength of a Government's desire to impose their will but the solicitude of a Government for the fundamental beliefs of an opposition.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 40 and 41, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) The Minister shall lay before Dáil Éireann on the 1st day of February, the 1st day of May, the 1st day of August and the 1st day of November in every year a list giving particulars of the cases in which he has authorised an officer to make a determination pursuant to subsection (1) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment speaks for itself.  Does the Minister propose to accept it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, I propose to make a comment on it.  Having regard to the fact that the Minister is not, in any circumstances, prepared to give one single inch on the powers he has taken unto himself by section 27, it is proposed by the Opposition that we ask him to place before the Dáil on the 1st day of February, the 1st day of May, the 1st day of August and the 1st day of November, a list giving the details of the holdings for which he has authorised an inspection. I feel that such a requirement will at least curtail the activities of the Minister, inasmuch as, with regard to the ordering of inspections of the many lands in this country in respect of which he may be approached by Deputies of his Party, it may be a <Col N="828" /> deterrent to the Minister carrying out the wholesale inspections which we can describe as political inspections.</P>
      <P>I am very much afraid of the political inspections.  I can see the occasion arising when any Deputy may be approached by his constituents with a request that the inspection of a neighbour's holding, whether small or large, be undertaken.  My sympathies in this matter lie with the very small holder who, for example, may be forced to emigrate and with the smallholder who, for example, may have to con-acre or sublet a part of his holding to supplement his income due to financial or domestic circumstances.  I am considering, again, the holding which is often mentioned in this House of the widow who may not be in a position to work her lands until her family come of age.  I am considering the holding of the energetic landowner who goes out at election time and takes the side of any candidate in opposition to the reigning Minister for Lands.  There is nothing to prevent that Minister from saying: &ldquo;We shall teach this lad a lesson and the lesson we shall teach him, because of his political activities in the last election, is that we shall have his land inspected.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Brady is not the Minister for <Col N="829" /> Lands.  If he were, I am sure a good deal of common sense would prevail. My argument is that in the case of inspections which will be carried out under this section, if the Minister knows he has to furnish to this House a list of the names and of the lands in respect of which he authorises an inspection, it will be a deterrent to the wholesale inspection of lands which he will be asked to carry out.</P>
      <P>When this Bill is enacted, the Minister will be inundated with requests from Deputies of his Party to carry out inspections of various lands which, in the opinion of the supporters of the respective Deputies, warrant inspection. All my amendment seeks is that where the Minister accedes to the request of a Deputy and says: &ldquo;Yes, I shall authorise an inspection of these lands,&rdquo; this House will be in a position to keep the matter constantly under review.  We want to ensure that, on the first day of every February, May, August and November &mdash; four times a year &mdash; the Minister will furnish a list to this House giving details of inspections.</P>
      <P>I can visualise the manner in which queues of Deputies will be outside the offices of the Minister asking that inspections of various holdings take place under section 27.  I can see the Minister yielding considerably through Party and political pressure, through pressure by his Party Deputies, and saying to them: &ldquo;Yes, I shall carry out inspections of those lands.&rdquo;  When the Minister takes unto himself this power, surely Dáil Éireann has a right to know, as a safeguard against an abuse of that power, to what extent the Minister will use the power which this House is giving him under section 27.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I do not trust the Minister for Lands with the power he is getting under section 27.  I feel that, whatever guarantees he may give, under this section we are all human, more particularly when our political colleagues come along to us and say that they consider a certain matter, in which there may or may not be merit, to be a genuine grievance.  In a case of that kind, any Minister who takes unto himself this power is more than likely to be <Col N="830" /> swayed by political considerations or by friendship and affection, but above all is likely to yield to the request that the inspection takes place.</P>
    <P>We have heard in this House time and time again details of various inspections.  It is no harm that on this occasion we should recall the statement by a Fianna Fáil Deputy that he took it upon himself to carry out the inspection of a holding at midnight with the headlights of his car: that is on record. When we have Fianna Fáil Deputies inspecting lands at night-time with the headlights of a car, what will they do when their own Minister will have the power to authorise the inspection of lands if he so desires for his own Party and political purposes?  Is it not giving us in the Opposition cause to think and indeed is there any reason why the power the Minister is getting is not leading to what we can describe as public panic in the country&mdash;and it is public panic?</P>
    <P>There are people in the country today, the owners of land&mdash;hardworking, honest, industrious people&mdash;who are most definitely in a state of panic because of the fear and dread of what can be the greatest fear and dread in any home, namely, insecurity.  We have the fear and dread of insecurity causing panic in the country as it is causing it, not to the same extent amongst the large landowners as amongst the small landowners because it is the small landowners in the west of Ireland who have most definitely given a decision against the dictatorial powers which the Minister is taking unto himself in this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health what action he proposes to take to deal with the nutritional defects and consequential deformities amongst infants in the poorer class section of the population in Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee:</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the reference in the question to &ldquo;nutritional defects&rdquo; is to incorrect dietary habits of expectant mothers and not, as would appear from the question, to the diets of infants.</P>
      <P>I presume also that the question is prompted by a comment, published in the press, by the Master of a Dublin maternity hospital, following the publication of an interim report on a survey carried out, with the assistance of moneys which I made available, on the eating habits of a sample number of expectant mothers attending that hospital.  The survey did not deal in any way with a possible connection between incorrect dietary habits of expectant mothers and the birth of congenitally deformed infants and the specialist in question has indicated that the opinions he expressed are personal ones, not strictly derived from the results of the survey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A study of iron-deficiency anaemia in expectant mothers is being carried out in another Dublin maternity hospital and a much more comprehensive study of the factors interfering with intra-uterine development of infants born in Dublin city is being carried out by the Medical Research Council.  As part of the last-mentioned study, an enquiry is being made into the sociological, nutritional and other characteristics of expectant mothers. When the results of both these studies, which are being financed by grants which I have provided, are available in <Col N="832" /> due course, we should be in a much better position to say to what extent congenital defects in infants are attributable to defects in the dietary of the mothers.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the education of expectant mothers in correct dietary habits is continuing.  The three Dublin voluntary maternity hospitals, for instance, devote particular attention to this aspect at ante-natal clinics.  The leaflet prepared by my Department on ante-natal care, for circulation to expectant mothers availing themselves of Health Act maternity services, devotes a section to this important matter and the recently revised arrangements with doctors participating in the services are designed to encourage women to contact their doctors at the earliest stages in their pregnancies.  Free milk supplies are available to expectant mothers in the lower income group.</P>
    <P>I feel that it is important to bear in mind that lack of nourishment, where it exists, does not necessarily result from poverty but can result as readily from eating the wrong type of food as from an inadequate supply of it.</P>

The pencils referred to by the Deputy are of a special hard quality known as H grade which were purchased in October, 1963, and of which some are still in stock.

It would be contrary to the public interest to disclose the relative costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment of Property Arbitrators is, under the Property Values (Arbitration and Appeals) Act, 1960, a function of the Land Values Reference Committee.</P>
      <P>Neither my Department nor the Reference Committee are aware of any complaints of delay on the part of the Property Arbitrator in dealing with disputes about the compensation offered for land compulsorily acquired by local authorities.  I understand that, in fact, all cases referred to him before 1 August, 1964, have already been cleared by him.</P>
      <P>The normal practice is to leave it to the parties concerned to agree on a date for hearing by the Property Arbitrator. On the basis of that practice, 13 cases have been referred to him since 1 August, 1964.  One has been completed, one has been adjourned until 1 February, 1965, two are due for hearing on 8 February, 1965, and the date of hearing has yet to be fixed in the case of the remaining nine. Where there is undue delay or on complaint from either party, he can fix a peremptory date for the hearing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland:</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>Letters dated 8th July, 1963, 25th March, 1964, 25th May, 1964 and 1st December, 1964, respectively, were received from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in relation to the question of raising the present limit for insurance purposes under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>In reply to the first letter the Joint Secretary to the Congress was informed on 10th July, 1963, that the matter was receiving attention.  Receipt of the second letter was acknowledged on 1st April, 1964, and on 1st June last the Joint Secretary was informed in reply to his letters of 25th March and 25th May, 1964 that it had been decided to defer further consideration of the question of raising the limit until the final report of the Select Committee of the Dáil on the Health Services had been received and considered.  Information was also given concerning title to benefit of persons who ceased to be compulsorily insurable as a consequence of the operation of the limit and as to the maintenance of insurance for certain benefits on a voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>The last letter, receipt of which was acknowledged on 2nd December, is not concerned solely with the question of raising the limit.  A reply to that letter will be issued within the next few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="842" /> It is not proposed to alter the existing limit for insurance purposes pending receipt and consideration of the report of the Select Committee of the Dáil on the Health Services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give any specific reason why he has decided not to increase the insurance limit until the Select Committee on the Health Services have made their report? Would the Minister say whether or not he has had consultations with the Minister as to when it is likely there will be a report and proposals by him or by the Select Committee? It seems to me it may be a considerable time before the Select Committee will report and certainly before any action may be taken on the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the raising of the insurance limit would have implications under the Health Acts.  I am not in a position to say when the Select Committee will report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it will have serious implications <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Health Acts.  As the Minister has pointed out, it is open to those whose salaries have gone beyond £800 to elect to become voluntary contributors. As voluntary contributors, they are deemed to be members of the middle income group and are, therefore, entitled to the particular services applied to that group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that; but large numbers of those who have gone out of insurance since 1958, because of the operation of the limit, have not become voluntary contributors. The Deputy must be aware that if the limit were raised now, a number of those people would become compulsorily insurable and there would be implications under the Health Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact, as the Minister has said, that those who cease to be insurable or insured may receive the benefit of the Social Welfare Acts for a period of up to 17 months.  Since the application of the last ninth round wage increase, ten months have elapsed.  That means there are seven <Col N="843" /> months still left.  I do not think even the Minister for Health could assure the Minister for Social Welfare that there will be a report from the Select Committee in that time.  Would the Minister for Social Welfare not consider that there may be a considerable number of people who in that period since February have gone out of insurance benefit and are either unemployed or sick?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should reconsider this.  We pressed him to increase workmen's compensation and he wants to leave that&mdash;whether deliberately or not, I do not know&mdash; for quite a long period.  I would ask him seriously to consider changing the insurable limit now and not to wait for any report from the Select Committee on the Health Services.</P>

I say that with all due respect to the Health Committee. I think this is a decision which the Minister should make irrespective of that report because of the many considerations which are serious as far as a considerable number of people are concerned, persons who may find themselves without sickness benefit when they are sick or without unemployment benefit when they are unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that, in addition to the fact that increasing numbers of employees are being excluded from compulsory insurance owing to wage increases, his Department are narrowing the definitions of <Col N="847" /> manual work and informing employers of such narrow definitions, so that workers such as employees of the licensed trade are being excluded from compulsory insurance through these definitions; and whether, in view of the fact that social insurance of employees earning under £800 and of all manual workers was originally intended to cover the majority of workers, he will now state whether it is Government policy to endeavour to exclude large numbers of workers from compulsory insurance and to confine such insurance and the benefits arising therefrom to a minority of lower paid workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the remuneration of increasing numbers of non-manual workers is exceeding the present insurance limit of £800.  Nevertheless this limit does not exclude the great majority of such workers.</P>
      <P>So far as counter-hands, foremen, assistant managers and managers in the licensed trade are concerned, it has been held for many years that for the purposes of social insurance they, in common with comparable employees in other trades, are, in general, employed otherwise than by way of manual labour.  I am not aware that there has been any recent narrowing of the interpretation of what constitutes manual labour.  Nevertheless, the question whether any change in the existing interpretation of the term is desirable is at present under consideration.</P>
      <P>It is open to any person who is in doubt as to his position in relation to social insurance when his rate of remuneration exceeds £800 a year, to apply to my Department for a decision in the matter.  If he is not satisfied with the decision, he has a right of appeal to an appeals officer and a further right of appeal to the High Court from the decision of that officer on a question of law.</P>
      <P>The answer to the second part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland:</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of the term &ldquo;manual labour&rdquo;.  The present interpretation of it is based on opinions of two different Attorneys General and that interpretation could only be changed as a result of an appeal to the courts.  I am considering whether or not I should take steps to define it in a way which would possibly have these people considered as manual workers.</P>

      <P>It is regretted that the failure of the Department to trace in the first instance the claimant's insurance number, which he himself was unable to quote since he had not been in insurable employment since 1948, led to prolonged local inquiries, which were largely responsible for the undue delay.</P>

Why, because of the failure of his employer, should an unfortunate man who is justly entitled to social welfare benefits be deprived of these things?

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the reasons for the proposed change in the system for the oral Irish examination in the leaving certificate to examinations carried out by teachers from the schools attended by the candidates; and if, in view of the fact that (a) this type of examination by the candidate's own teachers was discarded as unsuitable in the primary certificate examination and (b) university scholarships and other qualifications depend on the leaving certificate examination, he considers that this is a suitable method for such an examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery:</NameTxt>
      <P>While the marks in the oral Irish tests were until now awarded by my Department's inspectors, the tests themselves were carried out in each case in conjunction with a member of the school staff appointed for the purpose by the school manager. Having reviewed the procedure, I considered the time opportune for carrying the matter a stage further by entrusting the school authorities with the making of the initial assessment of the standard reached by their Leaving Certificate <Col N="856" /> candidates.  This assessment is to be subject to subsequent vertification by my Department's inspectors.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the method of examination in question will prove entirely satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say how the Department inspectors can test the fluency of those who present themselves for the Leaving Certificate examination?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery:</NameTxt>
      <P>The main function of the inspectors in an examination is to ensure uniformity of standard throughout the examination.  I understand they intend to take samplings of the students already assessed by the school at the top level, perhaps in the middle and at the bottom of the lists supplied by the schools, examine these pupils and scale the whole school according to their reading of the standard as applied to the results given in the lists.</P>

The Pigs and Bacon Commission are all the time endeavouring to improve the quality.  I do not think anybody would expect them to do that overnight.

I think that, rather than the campaign which has been carried out to denigrate our bacon, all concerned should be doing what they can to help to promote its popularity on the British market in general and in that particular area in Scotland which has been chosen for this experiment.</P>

While I am prepared to increase further the number of sittings, should this prove necessary, it may be possible to avoid congestion, without additional sittings or limiting the number of cases per sitting, by arranging that the cases for hearing are divided into two separate lists, one for the morning session and the other for the afternoon session.

      <Col N="866" /> In page 14, between lines 40 and 41, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) The Minister shall lay before Dáil Éireann on the 1st day of February, the 1st day of May, the 1st day of August and the 1st day of November in every year a list giving particulars of the cases in which he has authorised an officer to make a determination pursuant to subsection (1) of this section.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy O.J.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of the amendment, I have expressed the opinion, and I want to repeat it, that the power which the Minister for Lands is given under section 27 of the Bill is a power with which he cannot be trusted.  That is why my amendment seeks to keep a close check on his activities in relation to the number of inspections which he shall order the Land Commission to conduct.  The amendment requests him four times per year to give Dáil Éireann the necessary information and it is necessary because of the political power of the Minister under the section to order an inspection of any man's land if he so desires. We may take it that if this Bill becomes law many supporters and Deputies of the Government Party will be queueing up outside the Minister's office requesting him to conduct an inspection into the lands of such-and-such persons in their areas.</P>
      <P>When we adjourned, I was conveying to the Minister and the House the urgency and importance of keeping a check on this matter more particularly when we heard a Deputy standing up here on the section to which the amendment relates telling us he himself inspected a particular farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>When you have the Fianna Fáil Party so eager for the inspection of certain lands that they <Col N="867" /> will do it themselves, what will happen when the Minister has power to order an inspection for them?  What will be the position regarding the secret meetings that will be held in the Minister's room with his Party colleagues when they approach to have these inspections carried out?</P>
      <P>That is why we want to bring this matter into the open.  I am satisfied there is an ill-conceived and very evil motive behind the effort of the Minister to obtain these powers for himself. My amendment aims at eliminating some of the evil behind this section. There is an element in the country today on which this section impinges who are anxious to deprive their neighbours of their lands and grab these holdings however small.  Beyond a shadow of a doubt there are Government supporters who, in order to cash in on this before a change of Government, have compiled long lists of their neighbours' holdings so that these may be inspected.  That is why we seek that what may take place behind closed and barred doors with curtains drawn in secrecy will be brought out in the open and details given to the Dáil so that a close check may be kept. We want the Minister to account in public for the backdoor invasion of farmers' property.  That is all we ask.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this quarterly return to the Dáil is to make sure that we will be continuously informed of the various inspections he holds.  I am convinced again that whatever we in this House may think of the Minister for Lands, that he cannot&mdash;and it is the opinion of the people in the country&mdash;be trusted with this power.  If it were a matter left entirely to the Commissioners, the Dáil, the country and the general public would be reinforced in the knowledge that this inspection was being carried out by an independent authority.  Because it is not, and because it will now be a political matter, the Dáil is entitled, four times per year, to have a full check up on the Minister's activities in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's refusal to accept this amendment points the seriousness of this whole problem.  If the Minister had nothing to hide and nothing to be <Col N="868" /> ashamed of and if his actions in regard to this whole section were above-board and not politically-inspired, why could he not stand up and say: &ldquo;I shall be prepared to present Dáil Éireann, four times a year, with the details of the land of which I have ordered inspection.&rdquo;  In order to maintain the secrecy, and in order to maintain the strong weight of political pressure, the Minister tells us that he will not accept this amendment and that this inspection of people's land will be conducted and carried on by Fianna Fáil behind closed doors.  If the Minister has nothing to hide, nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to conceal, why does he not give Parliament&mdash;the most democratic institution possible &mdash; the return of his activities under the power which he has now taken unto himself?</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition has pointed out on many occasions to the country and to this House that no Minister for Lands, since the State was founded, has ever taken this authority unto himself.  When he takes this authority, he is going to make sure it is surrounded by secrecy and all kept to himself, his own Party and his own Party colleagues.  I ask what is to be the position of landowners in Ireland who have no faith or belief in Fianna Fáil?  Is there any reason for us not to believe&mdash;and we must believe what we see and hear in the country&mdash;that this Land Bill has created panic amongst the people when we find the Minister failing to give Parliament the details of inspection which he orders so that a check will be kept on the authority which he now seeks.  He says that he will not recognise the right of Parliament to get details of these inspections. Does that not create greater doubt amongst the people?  Does that not create greater doubt and greater gloom among the landowners of Ireland, who are already in a panic because of the loss of fixity of tenure and who may put up with this loss of fixity of tenure while Fianna Fáil are in office?  That, in my opinion, shows that we are now coming to the real motive behind section 27, which gives this power and authority to the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> I hope the Minister will enlighten the House and will give us more information.  Silence will not do on this matter.  The smallholders and landowners, the big landowners and every single owner of property in Ireland, whether it is three acres or 300 acres, will not accept the Minister's silence, the concealing and hiding of his activities behind closed doors in this matter.  That is why we want him to give details of the inspections ordered by him.  I ask the Fianna Fáil Deputies who have any faith, belief or understanding of the people in the country not to support the Minister in his efforts to conceal his methods of inspection of the people's land and the people's property.</P>
    <P>That is the serious objection which I have and which caused me to move this amendment.  I see no reason why the Minister should not accept it except some reason best known to himself, that he is prepared to dig in his heels in the ground and to give no favourable ear to the voice of commonsense, wisdom, intelligence and experience in this matter.  That is why the Government have fallen and are steadily falling in strength. It is because of the measures which they have taken to investigate people's property and deprive the landowners of Ireland of fixity of tenure.</P>
    <P>The request I make in this amendment is that Parliament be given information.  The Minister has refused to allow Parliament to have that information.  They are creating great suspicion in this country and in this House, which is to the discredit of the Fianna Fáil Party who want to investigate&mdash;I deliberately use the word &ldquo;investigate&rdquo;&mdash;people's land in secrecy without being prepared to give the details of the inspection to the Dáil four times a year.  The Minister authorises these inspections and that is why we are asking that we be given that information.</P>
    <P>I hope and trust the Dáil will seriously consider this amendment. It is one which I expected the Minister would readily accept if he has nothing to hide or be ashamed of, but for some reason or other, he is not prepared to do so.  The country <Col N="870" /> will not take his silence.  An explanation is required on this matter and an explanation should be forthcoming. Otherwise, how are we to know what is to happen behind the closed doors, the drawn curtains and the heavily locked doors?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran) Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran):</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another completely irresponsible amendment put down for the purpose of codding the people in rural Ireland. It is a typical Fine Gael attribute.  This amendment indicates a basic misunderstanding of the section.  I say it is a deliberate misunderstanding in the case of Deputy O.J. Flanagan.  Deputy O.J. Flanagan evidently thinks that the Minister will, in certain cases, instruct a senior inspector or authorise inspection of particular land.  That is not so, and well the Deputy knows it.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum on this Bill states that four senior inspectors residing at divisional headquarters will have powers delegated to them to authorise inspection.  This will obviate the need to refer cases to Dublin and will thereby eliminate the source of delay in what might well be a critical stage of Land Commission proceedings.  What is at issue is the proposed delegation of authority on a general basis.  There is no question of some cases being selected for the senior inspectors and other cases for the commissioners.</P>
      <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan's amendment, therefore, can be implemented only by publishing the names and other particulars of all the various landholders throughout the country whose lands may have to be inspected, irrespective of the result of these inspections.  That sort of publicity, in my opinion, would be most unfair. This irresponsible amendment&mdash;I should say I am not surprised by it&mdash; is put down to try to misinterpret the purposes of the Bill.  It is put down to try to fool the poor innocent people down the country that the object of this Bill is to move in on farmers' land throughout the length and breadth of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this section is to cut red tape, to ensure that, where the <Col N="871" /> Land Commission have information that a place which is badly needed for the relief of congestion is up for sale and should be acquired, the Land Commission will be able to move quickly for the acquisition of these lands.  Instead of taking six months, as it does now, with files passing up and down between the Commissioners, a divisonal inspector can in future sign a notice to enable his junior to go in and make a report as to the suitability, or otherwise, of the land for Land Commission purposes.  That report will come up to two Commissioners of the Land Commission whose function it will be to decide, irrespective of the political head of the Department, whether or not these lands should be taken over.  That is still the law.  That will be the law after this Bill notwithstanding the rampage by Deputy Flanagan as to what could happen and what will happen should this section be enacted.  Inspections have gone on under the section I quoted on the previous amendment since 1923.  In order to stop the ballyhoo, I have to put on record now subsection (6) of section 40 of the Land Act, 1923, which reads:</P>
    <P>Any inspector or other person appointed by the Land Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>By the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;may after notice sent by post to the person who appears to be owner or occupier of any land, enter upon the land and make all such enquiries as may be necessary to enable the Land Commission to ascertain the extent and character thereof, and such other particulars in relation thereto as they may require for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section to which this amendment is tabled states that it is in order to remove doubts that we are enacting this section for the purpose of enabling the divisional inspectors to save time by signing these notices.  Let Deputy Flanagan not fool anybody in this <Col N="872" /> House or outside it by saying that this amendment is a deterrent.  Dáil Éireann is the deterrent; Dáil Éireann is the deterrent in the vicious picture Deputy Flanagan is painting of me, going like an ogre at dead of night to decide with members of my own Party whose farms will or will not be inspected.  If any political head of the Department of Lands tried at any time to implement the law in that way, we would have questions here in Dáil Éireann within 48 hours.  On the previous amendment, I pointed out that under section 12 of the 1950 Land Act the reserved functions of the Land Commissioners were stripped from them in relation to rundale estates.  It is true that I have power to appoint a special inspector to go down and deal with the re-arrangement of land in the West of Ireland and in other rundale cases, and it is true&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that, for the first time, Deputy Dillon and his colleagues in 1950 stripped the Land Commissioners of their reserved functions. There were no crocodile tears shed then about the sacrosanct functions of the Commissioners and of the Irish Land Commission when that provision was enacted, curtailing their powers and handing over to Deputy Blowick complete and absolute control in dealing with re-arrangement cases.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran:</NameTxt>
      <P>What can any political head of the Department do except delegate power to officials to deal with these matters?  This section authorises the four senior divisional inspectors looking after the entire country to sign the form enabling the preliminary inspection to be made whereby the Commissioners will inform themselves and make up their minds as to whether or not these lands should be taken for the relief of congestion.  Let me emphasise again that, after the enactment of this section, it will be the job of two Commissioners, independent of the political head, to decide whether or not any particular lands should be taken. <Col N="873" /> I have already told the House that in cases in which the Commissioners authorise proceedings for compulsory acquisition, which come before the Land Court and before these same Commissioners, a procedure about which Deputy Dillon seems to complain, only 40 per cent of cases authorised for compulsory acquisition succeed before these same men in open court.  Those are the facts.</P>
      <P>The position is that under this section we are spelling out in black and white, in case there might be any doubt about the law under the section of the 1923 Act I have quoted, which stipulates that any inspector of the Land Commission can make these reports, that a divisional inspector will be able to do so in future.  In actual fact, what happened was that a deputation came in to the local office&mdash;let it be in Mayo, Donegal, Sligo or Kerry &mdash;and made their case about some farm that should be acquired for the relief of congestion.  That case was recorded.  It went from the local official to the inspector in charge, from him to the divisional inspector, from the divisional inspector to the senior inspector and from the senior inspector on to the Lay Commissioners.  The Lay Commissioners signed the preliminary notice under section 40 which went from them to the senior inspector, from him to the divisional inspector, from the divisional inspector to the inspector in charge of the local office and, from him, it passed to his minion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that took months.  In the meantime, when it was learned that locals were interested in the acquisition of the lands, the lands were got rid of before the Land Commission could serve the necessary notice.  The purpose of this section is to stop that codology.  The Lay Commissioners had to act on the report from the divisional inspector and they had no option but to sign the Section 40 notice to enable the preliminary inspection to take place and they had no information other than that which came from the divisional inspector through the cumbersome machinery I have described.  All that is now cut out and power is being sought to enable the preliminary <Col N="874" /> inspection to be made without this archaic procedure.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan has painted a picture of what, according to him, will happen when this section is enacted.  All that will happen is that the political head can sign a delegation order authorising the four divisional inspectors to sign these notices.  Every day in the first week of the year I sign orders delegating certain powers to certain officials.  A big organisation like the Land Commission could not work unless there were such powers.  The suggestion that I or any other Minister would pick out a particular individual because we did not like him, and direct a special inspection through the Land Commission is utter nonsense and I am perfectly satisfied the people who are making that case here are very well aware of that fact.  In the next amendment perhaps, we will have to go into closer detail on the question of procedure and appeal.</P>
    <P>Let me reiterate that it will still be the law that it will take two Commissioners of the Land Commission under their reserved function to decide whether any man's land is taken in any part of the country.  All that is happening here is that we are endeavouring to speed up this archaic procedure and ensure quick action so that the Land Commission can in suitable cases where land is badly needed deal with the land slums of Ireland in a speedier manner than it now takes with the present procedure of the file going up and down.</P>
    <P>I quoted only one section of the 1923 Act and I am satisfied this has been the law since 1923.  The opening words of the section are: &ldquo;For the removal of doubt...&rdquo;.  If anyone is seriously interested in dealing with the land slums, this is the very section he would support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say with the fullest possible deliberation that I am perfectly certain this has never been the law of the land under the 1923 Act, that it should not be the law of the land under the 1964 Bill, and that it will not be the law of the land as soon as we are the Government. I could not join issue more <Col N="875" /> emphatically with the Minister on that matter than I do.  Forty years of administration contradict the Minister. It has been consistently held since the Hogan Land Act was passed that the issue of a section 40 order for inspection was reserved to the Land Commission, and by that term was understood the Lay Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The Minister is afraid to ignore section 40 of the 1923 Act without introducing section 27 of this Bill. If he is not, why bring it in at all? He knows in his heart and soul that the courts would hold, and have held &mdash;and that every adviser he has ever had in the Department, including the late Mr. Deegan who was breast-high for what the Minister is trying to do now, held&mdash;that section 40 meant it was reserved for the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister has lost his sense of proportion.  All this amendment means is that he should do in respect of these requisitions for inspections of land for the purpose of acquisition what I did in respect of the Land Project, that is, publish a regular quarterly return.  The reason is perfectly simple.  When I brought in the Land Project, a lot of mischievous Fianna Fáil Deputies wanted to make it unworkable.  They started putting down Parliamentary Questions every week: &ldquo;Did you do So-and-So's land?  How much land have you done?  How much land have you done in this parish and that constituency?&rdquo; I got authority from the Government to say I would answer no more questions, but that I would publish a quarterly return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is in the absurd position that if he has the power which he now seeks under section 27, he is bound to answer this Parliamentary Question: &ldquo;How many times did you use the power during the previous week?&rdquo; There is nothing to prevent me putting down a standing question every Tuesday the Dáil meets asking the Minister how many times he used the power conferred by section 27 during the previous week.  Seeing that he himself is taking responsibility in the House, he is obliged to answer. Heretofore he could say: &ldquo;That is a <Col N="876" /> matter for the Land Commission on which I have no responsibility to Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;  He is now asserting by positive statute that he is responsible and I venture to say he may be perfectly certain that every Tuesday afternoon as regular as the clock, we will have a question on the Order Paper asking: &ldquo;How often has the Minister used the powers conferred on him by section 27 during the previous week?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In his own defence, he will be obliged to seek authority from the Government to make a regular return and to refer Deputies to that regular return.  I am satisfied that the Government will not make any proposal of an unreasonable character in that regard.  No one could say a quarterly return would be an excessive demand on the Minister, and as surely as tomorrow's sun will dawn, if he does not give a quarterly return, every Tuesday afternoon the same question will be on the Order Paper.  A much more sensible arrangement would be for him to say he would undertake to make a quarterly return, or a return at the beginning or end of each Parliamentary session.  We would be quite prepared to meet him on that, but that a return should be made is certain and that it will be made is certain.  If the Minister goes so far as deliberately to take this executive power on his own shoulders, he will not refuse to answer for it, because that would be an impossible situation, and one which no Minister has ever attempted to maintain before.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House, that the Minister's passionate reaction to this very moderate amendment is an indication of the state of mind into which he has allowed himself to get.  If he does not accept the amendment, what will he do?  If he gets a Parliamentary Question every Tuesday, will he not have to reply to it?  Does the Minister not agree?  If section 27 stands and becomes law, will he not have to answer Parliamentary Questions relating to his actions under the section whenever they are asked?  Why force on us a procedure which is manifestly unreasonable, and an embarrassment and annoyance to the Minister?  We are not proposing that course; we do <Col N="877" /> not want to adopt that course.  We are quite prepared to meet the Minister if he wishes to make returns on the first or the last day of each Parliamentary session.  That would meet the situation.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous for the Minister to get into a passion and say he is being misrepresented.  There is a genuine difference between us.  He takes one view and we take another view.  Under section 27 he is increasing the functions for which he is personally responsible to the House.  It is childish to force upon members of the House an obligation to put down weekly Parliamentary Questions.  We would be quite content with the returns in an appropriate form at reasonable intervals. In the Minister's own interest, I suggest he should accept our proposal. The only alternative is the putting down of Parliamentary Questions every week but regular returns would be much better.  In the event of an unreasonable requisition for inspection that he did not think was opportune or necessary, he would be in a position to say: &ldquo;Am I to face Dáil Éireann and tell the House that I ordered inspection of lands when their unsuitability for acquisition was so manifest?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, far from causing the Minister embarrassment, I submit he should have welcomed this amendment, but he has got himself into such a frame of mind that no proposal on this Bill will be viewed on its merits. Consequently, the Bill's passage through the House is being unnecessarily delayed.  I again point out to him that far from embarrassing him, I have a rather uncomfortable feeling, to tell the truth, that this amendment would do the Minister a service which, in the special circumstances of the situation, I am not particularly anxious to do.</P>

In point of fact, there must have been absolute doubt because the Minister has failed to tell us how much practice has arisen in the Land Commission or in the Department of Lands whereby land inspection has been initiated through the Minister.  He mentioned something about rundale land in part of the west where he claims some such powers were taken.</P>
      <P>I am speaking on the acquisition of land throughout the entire country.  If, as the Minister maintains, this power has been in operation by law since 1923, does it not seem strange that no Minister has seen fit to take that power?  The suggestion I must make is that the Minister's legal interpretation must be incorrect.  He has told us, for instance, that this section is nothing more than a delegation of authority. In point of fact, it is quite obvious it is an assumption by the Minister of authority which the Land Commissioners had hitherto held.  I do not accept his interpretation of the 1923 Act in this respect.  It is obvious that if the power did exist, some Minister would have thought of exercising it during the past 40 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister does not propose to accept the amendment.  I had a feeling the Minister might be reasonable and accept it.  I had thought it might have been accepted to allay the feelings of suspicion from which landowners <Col N="880" /> throughout the country, big and small, have been suffering.  It has been pointed out that this section has created panic unnecessarily among all landowners, and in order to allay fears and restore a degree of confidence in fixity of tenure, I expected the Minister would accept this amendment to place on the Table of the House each quarter the information sought.</P>
      <P>Quoting Acts of Parliament is no answer.  This is the first time since the State was founded that a Minister for Lands has taken it unto himself to cause inspection of an individual's land or property.  The only way to curb Ministerial activities of that kind is to bring the Minister out into the open at the end of each quarter by giving Deputies an opportunity of inspecting details of orders made in regard to the inspection of lands.  What, might I ask, is unreasonable about that?  Since this is the first time the Minister has taken on this power, the first time in which the Dáil has been asked to give any political head of a Department this power, is it not reasonable to expect that it should not be exercised with his own Party colleagues behind closed doors?  That is my great dislike of this section.  In other words, the Minister has made no effort whatever to deny that there are political motives behind this section.  I shudder to think what will happen when the Minister authorises the inspection of every individual's land who appears publicly to be a political opponent of his.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very fine to say that no Minister, having regard to his high office and his responsibility, will do that, but those of us who know for a long period of 20, 25 and 30 years in this House the methods by which Fianna Fáil get votes, and those of us who know and realise the low depths to which they sink to capture a miserable vote, know that we cannot trust a Minister with this power.  I respectfully say that the reason for secrecy and privacy is to enable the Minister to have lands inspected, if he wishes in Kilkenny, the lands of every single farmer in Cork, the lands of every single farmer in Tipperary, in <Col N="881" /> Leix, in Offaly and in Meath and nobody will know whose lands are being inspected because the Minister now refuses to disclose to Parliament details of his orders to the senior inspectors of the Land Commission in this matter.</P>

      <P>No matter what is said by Fianna Fáil, we can always take it and smile back.  But, when it comes to Fianna Fáil being administered strongly with their own medicine, they cannot take it.  There is no reason whatever why, if the Minister has nothing to hide, to conceal or be ashamed of, he should be working behind closed doors.  It is not my intention to arouse the Minister to greater anger.  I see no justification whatever why the Minister should go into a panic himself after having successfully driven every single landowner in Ireland into a panic within the past three months.  I want to assure the Minister that he will not get away with this in the country. He may get away with it here even though the Government majority is slender, is unrepresentative and does not represent the views of the majority of the Irish people.  The Minister may bulldoze this section and defeat the amendment in the House but he will not get away with that in the country.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> This, in my opinion, is a legalised attempt in secrecy to spot and squash a neighbour's land.  Could there be anything meaner or lower?  If it were to be done in public and if Fianna Fáil were to come out in the open and say: &ldquo;We shall dispossess and confiscate so many holdings,&rdquo; you could understand that as their policy, but, when they are doing it in secret and denying Parliament the orders of inspection which the Minister makes, it is degrading.  It is contempt for Parliament and, in my opinion, the Minister will not get away with it in the country and, as sure as there was a day of reckoning in North East Dublin, in Roscommon and in Galway, there will be a day of reckoning very soon.  The Minister will then realise his folly and how stupid, how small, and how silly he is acting by taking to himself the right to conceal the inspections which he orders for the furtherance of his own political henchmen and his own political party.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9.</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 40 and 41, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) The Minister shall not exercise the powers conferred on him by subsection (1) of this section at any time when a Land Commissioner is a person who holds a position as a civil servant of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an amendment standing in the name of Deputy O.J. Flanagan, which he asked me to move, reserving the right to himself to speak in the course of the debate.  This raises a very important issue, and that is the question as to whether it is desirable that a member of the Civil Service directly responsible to the Minister for Lands for the time being should himself be a Land Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this matter was under discussion on the Committee Stage of the Bill, the Minister for Lands invoked, in defence of this new proposal, the memorandum which he said had been <Col N="884" /> left in the Department by a very distinguished member of the Irish Civil Service, the late Mr. Deegan, who himself was for some time Secretary of the Department of Lands and an Irish Land Commissioner.  I will not go into the history of that memorandum, but, for reasons which I think the House will readily understand, it is necessary for me to go very expressly on record as saying that the personality of the present Secretary for Lands is not involved in this discussion.  So far as we are concerned, Mr. O'Brien, who is at present the Secretary of the Department of Lands, would, in our judgement, be a most excellent Land Commissioner, in every way eligible for the heavy responsibilities of that position.  If he were appointed to that position in the morning, we should be very happy to see him there and would have complete confidence in the scrupulous rectitude with which he would discharge the duties of the office and in the high degree of competence that he would bring to such a position.</P>
    <P>Our objection, then, is in no sense related to the person of Mr. O'Brien: it is related to the principle here enshrined. If there was any man in the public service who could, with propriety, have discharged this dual function, it would have been Mr. Deegan and it could be Mr. O'Brien.  Our case is that there is nobody in this public service or outside it who could with propriety be burdened with this dual responsibility.</P>
    <P>Now, I call in support of the contention I make, as opposed to the memorandum on which the Minister for Lands relies, the opinion of every other Land Commissioner who has ever served in the Irish Land Commission since it was established in 1885.  I challenge the Minister to consult any previous Land Commissioner on this question.  If he does, he will find that the substance of the conclusions which I shall now submit to the House represents the unanimous opinion of every ex-Land Commissioner, except that of the late Mr. Deegan.</P>
    <P>I have already told the House that I did not think it fitting that, as Leader <Col N="885" /> of the Opposition, I should consult any existing officer of the Land Commission or of the Department of Lands. Therefore, I do not purport to know or to report to this House what existing Land Commissioners or officers of the Land Commission believe in this regard.  I have purported to report to this House the substance of the views of the Commissioners who have gone before and are now retired.  I believe that their unanimous view can be summarised: The appointment of a top level executive in the Land Commission to the additional post of Lay Commissioner and calling upon him to function in both capacities is undesirable and perilous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am about to tell the story of that.  I know it.  That is what I want to prepare the House for.  He put a lot more on record which the Minister can very easily produce from his files and let the House examine it and pass judgement on the fate of the proposals which he put on record.  You know, I have been in Government since Mr. Deegan put these notes on record. All of these files were available to me as well as to the Minister.  Now, remember, it was the Minister for Lands who produced the memorandum of the late Commissioner Deegan and submitted it to the House as coercive evidence of the propriety of the present Minister's proposal.  Let us not hear one side of the story: let us hear both &mdash;and I know both.</P>
      <P>I did not become interested in Land Commission affairs today or yesterday. I became Minister for Agriculture because I wanted to be Minister for Agriculture.  I have long felt that the Land Commission should be part of the Ministry of Agriculture.  Feeling so, I took a considerable interest in the Land Commission and, on occasion, as the Minister will learn if he cares to consult his records, acted as Acting Minister for Lands.  So it was a foolish thing for the Minister to quote extracts from his files if he was not prepared to hear the further extracts from his files that he is now about to hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I challenge the Minister to consult any ex-Land Commissioner&mdash;any of them&mdash;and to quote him in support of the proposal to have a Land Commissioner Secretary of the Department of Lands.  The Lay Commissioners <Col N="887" /> should have no say whatever in staff matters which should exclusively be controlled by the Minister through the Secretary of the Land Commission.  By law, the Lay Commissioners have vested in them sole responsibility for dealing with what the statutes term excepted matters.  They are 14 in number and are of great consequence to the citizen, vitally affecting some of his most fundamental rights.</P>
    <P>The special onus on the Commissioners, because of these serious duties, has been recognised by the Oireachtas by giving the office a special kind of statutory protection analogous to the judicial one only to deal with the most important of these excepted matters&mdash;the power to deprive a citizen compulsorily of his land.  It has been truly said that next to depriving a citizen of his life and property, this is by way of being the most drastic power entrusted to any individual.  It is all the more so when it is realised that there is no appeal from the order of the Commissioners to any court whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Let us recall at this stage that if you are sentenced to death or sentenced to imprisonment for theft you have an appeal from the jury's decision on fact, not only to the court of appeal but to the Supreme Court as well.  Therefore, it is obviously of great importance that in the exercise of this sweeping power, the cardinal legal principle of not only doing justice but of being seen to do it is strictly honoured.  How then can it be said to have been done when one of the Commissioners is a Secretary under the Minister controlling the staff who in that capacity is responsible for selecting the particular person or persons to go on people's lands and make the necessary report and recommendations leading to the acquisition and who, in the final proceedings, may be a member of the court that hears the decision on the citizen's very natural objection to the alienation of his land and property?</P>
    <P>There is a further vice in this set up of great gravity.  I believe it is the law here&mdash;I may be wrong and I stand <Col N="888" /> subject to correction if I am&mdash;that the only witnesses called to give evidence for the acquisition of land are the inspectors of the Land Commission and those inspectors have their careers controlled, very properly, by the Secretary of the Department of Lands who may be one of those adjudicating on the evidence tendered by the inspector.  But even if they have, as a result of the Dunleavy case, to give evidence now on oath, where heretofore they had not, and the rebutted evidence can be heard and called on at the instance of the objecting landowner, the fact remains that inspectors who are asked to take an oath may find themselves in the dilemma of being called upon to give evidence, on oath, which is adverse to what they know is the view of the Secretary of the Department on whose good opinion they depend for the ordinary promotion and advancement which is their legitimate ambition.  I want the House to note these words because they accurately represent a wide consensus of opinion among experienced men in Land Commission business.</P>
    <P>Some time or other it is virtually certain that decisions on excepted matters come to, or participated in by a Commissioner-Secretary of the Department of Lands, will be challenged before the courts and it is impossible to foresee any judgement on such an issue other than one declaring the proceedings null and void.  Over the years the Land Commissioners' orders have been many times upset by the courts on issues trivial in comparison. Such a decision would obviously be extremely serious and the matter will have vast retrospective effects because all people affected by such orders over the years would bring actions against the Land Commission for the return of land illegally alienated from the <i>status quo</i> condition and looking for heavy damages or the return of allotments and with the new owners of these allotments pressing their case in return.  This, of course, would call for a rectifying Act being rushed through Dáil Éireann to stay the spread of such a distemper throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Now I am going to tell a little of <Col N="889" /> the history of this story.  This issue of the Commissioner who is also going to be Secretary of the Department of Lands is not of today or yesterday.  It goes back at least 30 years when the late Mr. Deegan joined the Land Commission as Secretary.  Mr. Deegan was certainly one of the most distinguished civil servants in the public service of this country.  It would be true to say of him, by those of us who knew and admired him, that he was the quintessence of all civil servants, possessing all the civil servant's most admirable quality, in his case one might fairly say more on the executive than on the administrative side.  On the other hand, superbly as he displayed the finest qualities of a public servant, he had some of the shortcomings of the bureaucrat.  It would be too harsh to say some of the vices of the bureaucrat but if I use the term in that sense my colleagues in this House will understand that it is not today or yesterday that some of us have been inclined to speak critically of bureaucrats. They have their virtues but they have their vices, too, and one of the vices of the bureaucrat is a complete lack of comprehension of legal principles, or, indeed, of the necessity of the rule of law at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his brief spoke of unfavourable judgments, or some such expression, of the courts and said that certain sections of the Bill were necessary to rectify the consequences thereof.  The bureaucrat's view is that if the courts agree with the individual against the bureaucrat the courts are wrong and the best way to put it right is to pass appropriate amending legislation at the earliest possible opportunity. That, of course, is not a view shared among the sovereign people of a democracy but it is a feeling one can recognise in a highly efficient public servant because his anxiety is to get business rapidly despatched and anything which hinders that distresses him unduly.</P>
    <P>It is true to say of the late Mr. Deegan that he had small use for any lawyer.  I now remember the phrase the Minister used and I think it was from Mr. Deegan's pen it came&mdash;<Col N="890" />&ldquo;adverse decisions&rdquo;.  He had small use for lawyers and adverse decisions of the High Court caused him acute distress.  It was fair enough to say of him that in his heart he felt the courts had a kind of animus against that body of public servants to which he was so proud to belong, the civil servants.  I believe Mr. Deegan thought that whenever the judges could take a rattle at the bureaucrat, they always leaped at the opportunity.  He was, then, the great civil servant who felt that the executive head of the Department of Lands should also be a Commissioner and it was in his brain that this concept was born, but Mr. Deegan did not stop there.</P>
    <P>Here is the interesting part of the story; this is the part of the story the Minister has never told us heretofore; this is the story of which the Minister has a record in his Department.  As he told one half of the tale, I think he should have told us the rest.  Mr. Deegan did not stop at believing that the Secretary should be a Land Commissioner. Mr. Deegan drafted a Bill when he was Secretary of the Department of Lands.  Did the Minister ever see it?  No.  I saw it.  The Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Aiken, was then acting Minister for Lands. If the present Minister will search the files, he will find this interesting little vignette of history.</P>
    <P>The then Minister for Lands, Deputy Aiken, and Mr. Deegan had a conference. To the astonishment of nobody, it was quickly discovered that on a great many topics of the kind to which I have been referring, the present Minister for External Affairs and Mr. Deegan found themselves <i>ad idem.</i> One of the facts on which they found themselves <i>ad idem</i> was that there should not be any Land Commissioners at all, that, in fact, the whole question of reserved matters should be abolished and placed under the control of the Minister and his Secretary.</P>
    <P>They drafted a Bill.  If the Minister searches the records of the Government, he will find a record of that Bill.  It did not last for long, because the Bill in question never reached Dáil Éireann.  When it was circulated in preparation for submission to the Government, <Col N="891" /> with the Blue Paper attached, the roof blew off Government Buildings.  The acting Minister for Lands, Deputy Aiken, and Mr. Deegan met the then head of the Government who dictated to them the terms of the kind of Bill they ought to have drafted and laid down very explicitly that there were to be independent Lay Commissioners and that there were to be at least six reserved matters.  In regard to the reserved matters, his instructions were carefully carried into effect.  I do not think the person concerned at that time knew that, in fact, more than one of the Lay Commissioners at that time were executive officers of the Department of Lands.</P>
    <P>But this interesting fact emerged. Having been frustrated in his efforts &mdash;done from the highest motives, of that I have no doubt&mdash;to abolish all reserved matters and to make them all the subject of direct control of the Minister for Lands for the time being, Mr. Deegan recommended to the then Minister &mdash; I think it was the late Deputy Derrig, but I am not quite sure&mdash;that the Assistant Secretary of the Department and the Chief Inspector, the late Mr. Waddell, should both be made Commissioners, and they were made Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I now assert that every single one of these men&mdash;and the late Mr. Nally, too &mdash; having attempted to discharge the dual duties of Secretary and Commissioner, all of them went on record as saying that they found it was impossible to do it satisfactorily.  I say that on the records of the Irish Land Commission, which the Minister can find, there will be clear evidence that the late Mr. Brown, a Land Commissioner appointed by the Fianna Fáil Government and a man of notoriously Fianna Fáil sympathies, emphatically went on record that he dissented from the proposition that there should be an executive officer of the Department appointed to the Lay Commissioners. I do not think I overstate the case when I say that the late Mr. Commissioner Nally finally prevailed on the then Minister for Lands, Deputy Blowick, to relieve him of his executive duties on the grounds that he <Col N="892" /> could not discharge the two satisfactorily. Consequently, he ceased to be an executive officer of the Department of Lands and elected to continue as a Land Commissioner.</P>
    <P>I want to submit to the House the view that this whole concept of Mr. Deegan's was utterly fallacious and arose from the peculiar and distinguished qualities of the man&mdash;his passionate desire to come straight to the heart of every matter, his ruthless impatience with the slow processes of the courts and of the law.  These are all admirable qualities, but when brought in contact with the infinite delicacy of the whole question of land tenure in this country, they are qualities fraught with volcanic danger unless prudently controlled.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that the late Mr. Deegan held the view that the Secretary was hopelessly handicapped&mdash;I think those views are recorded in the memorandum the Minister says he left behind him in the Department of Lands&mdash;if he was not at the same time a Land Commissioner.  In my belief that matter was frequently canvassed in the Land Commission between Mr. Deegan and several of his colleagues.  I want to put it here expressly on record that some of his most experienced colleagues perennially asked him this question: &ldquo;In what way are you handicapped or in what way would you be handicapped?&rdquo; When that question was put to him he never could answer it.  His colleagues' view was that he could not answer because there was not any answer.  He had just conceived this notion and nothing would shake him.  When pressed to say why, there was no answer.  He believed it and that was all.  He had convinced himself of its truth and nothing would shake him.</P>
    <P>He was very much of the same sort of mind as the Minister is about this Bill.  He regarded it as a determined, irrevocable decision, and nobody was going to change him.  This was reasonable to do and he was convinced of it. His colleagues urged on him the view that the Commissioners' power is prescribed in precise and detailed terms in a sealed order made by the Minister, which anyone can see and read.  If the Commissioners meet in conference, <Col N="893" /> the Secretary must see well beforehand the agenda the Commissioners propose to discuss, and any and all decisions arrived at in such a conference must be forthwith communicated to the Secretary of the Department of Lands.</P>
    <P>Of course, all this boils down ultimately to the universally-held view that every stage in the proceedings to acquire a man's land from him, from beginning to end, should be outside any suggestion that the Minister or the staff under him have had any say in the decision.</P>
    <P>We have argued at length the whole question of expedition and so forth on previous sections and the net point here is whether we should have a man who is Secretary of the Department of Lands a Lay Commissioner as well.  I know the Minister can produce a Finance memorandum from Deputy McGilligan in 1949 approving the arrangement whereunder I think Mr. Nally and Mr. Waddell were Land Commissioners as well as executive officers.  I want to point out to the House, if there is anybody really concerned to judge of the merits of this&mdash; and I have not discussed this with Deputy McGilligan as I have not had the time or opportunity; as the House will readily understand, I have been engaged elsewhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Successfully, thanks be to God and to the electors of East Galway.  But there is clear evidence on the face of the document produced by the Minister for Lands and read to the House recently of its true character. I know Deputy McGilligan was Attorney General in our Government from 1954 to 1957.  He was also Minister for Finance in our Government from 1958 to 1961.  I suppose that on the table of the Minister for Finance every morning there are dozens of documents, granting or opposing Finance sanction for proposals submitted by his colleagues.  I admit at once that the Minister for Lands can fool the House and can fool the rest of his colleagues because most of them have not shared the experience he and <Col N="894" /> I have had of the ordinary intercourse between Ministers but, ordinarily, if an urgent matter arises and you want Ministerial sanction for it, if Deputy McGilligan were Minister for Finance, I would send around to him a note saying: &ldquo;Dear Paddy, This is a matter that is urgently necessary and I implore you to give it priority and give me your decision upon it&rdquo;, to which I would get a reply: &ldquo;Dear James, N.B.L.  I am not going to bite my ear. The matter has to be examined by the Department of Finance and, I suppose, adequately examined, before I will give it my whole approval.&rdquo; I would then ring him up and argue the toss.  Sometimes I would persuade him to give way and sometimes he might say: &ldquo;Go to blazes.  It will have to take its course.&rdquo;  One thing he would never do is to write back and say: &ldquo;My dear Minister, your proposal for so and so is hereby approved&rdquo;, and so forth.</P>
      <P>I could well imagine, when I was Minister for Agriculture, the distinguished Secretary of my Department, Mr. Seán Ó Broin, saying to the then Assistant Secretary, Mr. Nagle: &ldquo;We will never get these Finance fellows to do this right if we do not go over to the Department of Finance&rdquo;, and the pair of them would go and would concoct the letter of approval they wanted from the Minister for Finance on a particular project that I had in mind and then I would get to work on the Minister for Finance; they would get to work on the Minister for Finance; we would all get to work on the Minister for Finance and we would pray to God that when the document, redrafted in consultation with the high officers of the Department of Finance, got on the Minister's desk, he would take it up and write &ldquo;P. McGilligan&rdquo; to it.  Seven times out of ten he did and it came back to me with: &ldquo;Dear Minister, The proposal you have submitted for, <i>et cetera, et cetera,</i> is hereby approved &mdash;P. McGilligan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that I would never see that letter and the fact is that the Minister for Finance would never see that letter.  The whole transaction would take place between the Secretary of my Department, possibly the Finance <Col N="895" /> Officer of my Department and the corresponding officers of the Department of Finance.  The hallmark of such correspondence is when one Minister addresses his colleagues as &ldquo;Dear Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To me or to Deputy Seán MacEoin, who have been in Government, that is as patently obvious as the black and white on the paper in front of us. I fully recognise that to Deputies or people outside that evidence is not as coercive as it would be to me or the present Minister for Lands, who knows perfectly well that what I am saying is true.  But the Minister for Lands has sought to say that because the Minister for Finance, Deputy P. McGilligan, signed that letter, he thereby not only approved the arrangement whereby two men would do four men's jobs for two men's pay but that he also by implication declared: &ldquo;This is a constitutionally and legally desirable arrangement&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The point I want to emphasise to the House&mdash;and it is important that the House should recognise it&mdash;is that the signature of the Minister for Finance to that Finance minute meant nothing more than, &ldquo;As Minister for Finance of the Irish Republic, I am delighted to discover a device whereby I can get two men to do four men's work for two men's pay.&rdquo;  There is not any Department of State that will ever put up any proposal to any Irish Minister for Finance that two men should do four men's work for two men's pay who will not get by return an enthusiastic memorandum saying: &ldquo;Dear Minister, A thousand times, yes,&rdquo; signed &ldquo;P. McGilligan&rdquo; or &ldquo;James Ryan&rdquo;, or whoever the Minister happens for the time being to be. It is not honest and it is not true to suggest that Deputy McGilligan's name in association with that Finance minute implied any opinion as to the legality or constitutionality of the proposition.</P>
    <P>I admit this&mdash;I have not consulted Deputy McGilligan about this particular letter and I am not suggesting to the House that I am authorised to say on his behalf that in his judgment the constitutionality of the Secretary Land <Col N="896" /> Commissioner is doubtful.  I do not know what his mind on that legal subject is and I do not know if his mind has ever been directed to it, but I am emphasising to the House that when he signed that minute he did it as Minister for Finance and not as Attorney General.</P>
    <P>What is all the pother about?  That is what puzzles me.  Why is the Minister for Lands married to this idea? Thanks be to God, we are not short of good men in the Land Commission. If there is any breakdown in communications between the Land Commissioners and the executive head of the Department, it can be easily remedied. Can the Minister find anywhere, from anybody, in any musty file or record of the Land Commission, a single authoritative opinion which supports that expressed by Mr. Deegan?  If he cannot, surely he should think again?</P>
    <P>We are perfectly content on this side of the House that the existing Secretary should continue to be Secretary or that the existing Secretary should be a Land Commissioner and one of the appropriate officers of the Land Commission should be made Secretary of the Department of Lands.  We commit ourselves irrevocably to the proposition that under our administration these two offices will be separately held because we believe it to be constitutionally desirable that they should be so held.</P>
    <P>We invite the Minister to offer any independent testimony he has for the proposition that the separation of these two offices of Land Commissioner and Secretary of the Department of Lands embarrasses or inhibits the efficiency of the functioning either of the Land Commission or of the Department of Lands over which the Minister presides. I am satisfied that far from inhibiting it, it would improve its efficiency, inasmuch as it would increase the confidence of this community into whose lives the Land Commission so inevitably enters, in the impartiality and detachment of the Land Commissioners in the execution of their powers in regard to excepted matters which now number 16.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am an optimist but I am still not without hope that the Minister <Col N="897" /> may, in the course of this discussion, show some inclination to yield to reason.  It would be a happy thing if in regard to this amendment he should combine both sides of the House to pay a tribute to Mr. O'Brien by offering him in the name of all Parties the option of remaining as head of the Department of Lands or becoming a Lay Commissioner as a special expression of our confidence in his capacity and of our admiration for the distinguished public service he has rendered up to date.  I suppose it is too much to hope that the Minister would join with us in such a tribute, but if he would, he would do a service not only to the Land Commission but to the Civil Service, and in doing that he would be doing something in which we would all wish to have a share.</P>

      <P>The amendment standing in my name and moved by Deputy Dillon is not alone one which is worth the serious consideration of the House but one which the Minister should have no hesitation whatever in accepting.  There is little use in the Minister endeavouring to convey to the House that the fact of the Secretary of the Department of Lands also holding the office of Commissioner will involve no change when this Bill becomes law.</P>
      <P>There is no comparison between the circumstances which now exist where the present Secretary of the Department of Lands is a Land Commissioner and the situation which will prevail.  The Minister has gone to great rounds to try to confuse this issue deliberately with the intention of confusing the people of the country and in an attempt to cover up the reason why he wants the Secretary of his own Department to be a Land Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Secretary of any Department, including Lands, is first and foremost an obedient servant, sincere and loyal to his Minister, no matter what Minister it may be, and what a Minister tells the Secretary of a Department to do, in practice and in law that loyal officer of the Department must carry out.  If the Secretary of the Department of Lands is also a Land Commissioner <Col N="898" /> and if the Minister indicates to him as the Secretary of his Department that he wants a particular farm inspected as a matter of practical politics, the Minister will insist under this section that that inspection be carried out.  The Secretary of the Department, as a loyal civil servant and loyal to his Minister, will obey.</P>
    <P>If the Secretary of the Department as a Land Commissioner cannot persuade his fellow Commissioners to have the inspection carried out, that is to say, if they are satisfied that there is no good reason, beyond a political reason, for it, what position does the Secretary of the Department of Lands then have as Secretary if he cannot solicit the goodwill of his fellow commissioners to have the inspection carried out at the instance of the Minister?</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter and one in which this House should display a particular interest.  We can see the position which will arise if the Minister asks the Secretary of his Department to authorise and instruct an inspection to be carried out, and if the Secretary's fellow Land Commissioners considered there were no grounds, other than political grounds, for the inspection, or that it was merely an obligement in order to boost the popularity of some political colleague of the Minister's in a constituency in which he had a slender majority and that the only way in which his popularity could be raised within that constituency was to solicit the support of the Minister in having an inspection of lands carried out.</P>
    <P>When the inspection has been carried out by order of the Minister, a report on the inspection is then submitted to the Land Commission.  Who is to sit in judgment as one of the Commissioners but the Secretary of the Department whom the Minister had already instructed to have the inspection carried out?  What confidence can the landowners of Ireland have in a law of that type?</P>
