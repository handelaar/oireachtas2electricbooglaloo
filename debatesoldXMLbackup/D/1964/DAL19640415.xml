Is the Taoiseach aware that in that Parliamentary Question, I asked the Minister for Transport and Power for particulars of a fleet of buses CIE were about to purchase?  That question was disallowed because the Minister said he had no responsibility in the matter. Yesterday another Deputy asked a question relating to Aer Lingus in <Col N="1718" /> regard to the purchase of planes.

    <P>The figures are taken from the Civil Service Census which relates to the first working day of the calendar year. They do not include industrial employees, persons casually employed or civilians employed in the Department of Defence.  The 1945, 1950 and 1955 figures include classes&mdash;mainly scale-payment Sub-Postmasters, Branch Managers of Employment Exchanges and certain part-time employees&mdash; whose estimated total number is 2,700 <Col N="1720" /> at most and who were excluded from the Census from 1959 onwards.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned in a reply to a question on 22nd January, 1963, the open competitive examination for clerical officers was suspended as part of a scheme for the reorganisation of certain general service grades which came into effect on 1st July, 1960.  This whole scheme is subject to review in the light of experience when it has been in operation for four years.  One of the matters to be considered when the review takes place will be the question of reintroducing the examination.</P>

      <P>Surplus potatoes in County Donegal can be disposed of through the factories of Ceimicí Teoranta at Labbadish or Carndonagh, both of which are in operation.  The Irish Potato Marketing Company has arranged to make a special payment in respect of surplus up-to-date seed disposed of to the Labbadish factory and I understand that the company is considering the question of a similar arrangement for seed surpluses of other export varieties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would fully agree with the Minister that the Potato Marketing Board are doing a good job but it is a fallacy to say that the Potato Marketing Board are giving them a subsidy.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there are 3,000 to 4,000 tons of seed potatoes surplus in Donegal and 4,500 to 5,000 tons of ware potatoes, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>

    <Col N="1723" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated to the Deputy that the Board will consider the matter.  The Board has already subsidised to the extent of £6 per ton a fairly substantial quantity of seed potatoes of the up-to-date variety.  It is the Board's intention, according to the information supplied to me, to consider the question of subsidising the disposal of the remainder of other export varieties of seed.  It is true to say that the export of seed this year was much higher than last year&mdash;in fact, 53,000 tons as against 39,000 tons last year.  Of that total quantity, 43,000 tons of seed potatoes were exported from Donegal as against 33,000 tons last year.  As far as the ware potatoes are concerned, it does not appear to me, from the figures I have obtained, that any problem will exist in their final disposal maybe not at prices that will be all that favourable from the growers' point of view but in this particular sphere there is always that degree of uncertainty as to what farmers will get from their potatoes as is the case in many other crops.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the twenty-five per cent grant to existing businesses for adaptation purposes is fair in comparision with the fifty per cent grant to new industries.  The Deputy will, no doubt, appreciate that the established firm has the advantages of plant and machinery which has been depreciated, workers who have been trained over a period and, in some cases, tariff protection for many years; and also that, in the cases of new firms, the 50 per cent grant is a maximum which is made available for the purpose of manufacturing something which has not been produced here before or to an insufficient extent or alternatively is exclusively intended for export.  I do not propose, therefore, to take steps to increase this adaptation grant.</P>

      <P>It has already been announced in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> that the Government hope to be in a position to raise the school-leaving age to 15 by 1970.  My Department's plans for the future are being framed on the basis of achieving this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the work was almost completed about four months ago, except for a small painting job?  Is he aware that it has since been completed, completed since the putting down of this question, and would the Minister now advise the Board of Works that it is wrong to hold up a job such as this for several months just because a small painting job has to be done?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. S. Dunne</b> asked the Minister for Education what are the reasons for the delay in starting the building of the technical school at Sallynoggin, County Dublin; and at what date he expects building of this <Col N="1732" /> school to be (a) started and (b) completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The preliminary planning associated with a school such as is proposed in Sallynoggin must of necessity take a considerable period to complete.  I am satisfied that as far as my Department is concerned there has been no avoidable delay in dealing with the matter.  The stage has now been reached when the revised sketch plans for the building have been sanctioned.  The lay-out plans and working drawings must be completed before tenders can be sought.  I am not, therefore, at present in a position to state when building operations will begin.</P>

      <P>I am aware of a case &mdash;I do not know whether or not it is the one which the Deputy has in mind&mdash;in which a claim for £20 approximately has been made by my Department against the estate of a holder of a special allowance under the Army Pensions Acts who died intestate.  A brother of the deceased is administrator of the estate.  In this case it came to light that the deceased held a bank account over a number of years which had not been disclosed at the investigations of his means for the purpose of the grant of special allowance, so that the allowance had been paid at a rate higher than that to which the deceased was entitled. The Army Pensions Acts provide that, in such cases, the payee, or, if he is dead, his personal representative, shall be liable to make repayment to the Minister on demand.  It is not intended to alter that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Commissioner, Garda Síochána, has statutory powers to give directions as to the location of individual bus stops, those powers could properly be exercised to overrule the wishes of CIE only if it became necessary to do so in order to ensure that a particular bus stop did not create a serious avoidable traffic hazard or obstruction to traffic.  In all other cases, the decision as to where bus stops should be placed is a matter for CIE and the recent re-siting of stops which was necessitated by the introduction of one-way traffic in certain streets in Dublin was carried out by CIE on that basis.</P>
      <P>Some re-siting was of course essential since bus stops cannot be located on the right hand side of one-way streets but, in so far as there may be any room for flexibility, the decision, as I have said, is one for CIE.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It has, for some considerable time, been apparent that this is a gambler's Government, but now it appears to me that this Government have pretty well taken leave of their senses and this Budget is symptomatic of the madness that has overtaken them.  When Budget proposals of this kind are brought before the House, we would do well to ask ourselves what does the country really need.  We need plans to expand industrial exports by stabilising prices and costs.  That is a theme at present being urged in every country on the continent of Europe and they are at present in conference to evolve a means of ensuring that will be done.  It is more urgently necessary for us than for almost any other country in Europe, if not in the world, for we have considerable obstacles to overcome over and above the ordinary problems of export trade.</P>
      <P>Secondly, what we need is a plan to expand agricultural exports and production and provide efficient marketing to dispose of that increased production.  Thirdly, we need to plan for the maintenance and expansion of the permanent employment of our own people at home.  Fourthly, if this third objective is to be attained, it seems to me clear as crystal that one of the most urgent needs of this country at this time is a comprehensive and effective programme for education that will provide adequate facilities in the primary, secondary, technological and university spheres for all our people. Last, but by no means least, one of the urgent needs of this country at present is to have a sufficiency of houses to provide our people with homes and to put an end to the horrible scandal of houses falling down in our capital city on the people who live in them and families being removed from houses no longer safe and put into institutions because there is no place else to house them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is true these are the things we most urgently need, it is legitimate to ask ourselves what have we got.  We have got this year a Budget which levies on our people the highest rate of taxation ever recorded in this country.  We were told last year that the introduction of the turnover tax was made inevitable by the failure of <Col N="1746" /> all other sources of taxation to provide a reliable source of revenue.  Nevertheless, in addition to the £14 million the turnover tax is designed to collect from our people this year, we have imposed £7 million additional taxation on petrol, spirits, beer and the other commodities against which taxation is being levied.  All the time there is creeping up upon us, and all our people, a growing burden of costs, to which I shall refer very shortly.</P>
    <P>I want to ask this question of the Minister for Finance.  In the national income and expenditure publication, in Table 8, there is set out total taxation as a percentage of national income and further on we get the current expenditure of public authorities as a percentage of the gross national product at market prices.  In the Minister's speech, we have a reference to the current expenditure as a percentage of the gross national product at market prices.  I would be glad to have from him a figure which would tell us what the taxation he now proposes represents as a percentage of the national income of this country.  I think it will provide a startling comparison with the standards that have obtained in this country over the past ten years and with the standards that have been internationally accepted as consonant with sound progress.</P>
    <P>We have in these Budget proposals the highest rate of taxation that has ever been levied on our people; but, over and above that, there is being levied this year on our people rates at an unprecedented scale on property throughout the country.  I am glad that the Government have awakened to a sense of responsibility and have undertaken to bear the burden of extra rates in respect of agricultural rates this year.  But has everybody forgotten the circumstances of every small businessman in every rural town in Ireland?  Has everybody forgotten the circumstances of every individual householder in rural Ireland?  There are many rural towns in which small traditional businesses are striving to remain solvent in competition with the invasion of self-service stores and who are called on year after year to pay not only a steadily increasing burden of rates but to face the continual and <Col N="1747" /> intensified programme of revaluation being carried out up and down the country to the grave detriment of country people.</P>
    <P>In addition to that burden of rates they are now going to be asked to make their contribution, as we all are, to the second Budget which the Post Office are about to introduce in which the cost of posting a letter in this country will be raised to 5d, in which the cost of a telephone call will be increased by 50 per cent from 2d to 3d on your own telephone and to fourpence from a kiosk, and in which the cost of sending a telegram is to be raised to 5/- for 12 words.  That burden, however, is merely the second of the Budgets for which this Government are responsible.  How many Deputies realise that over and above these charges, which have to be carried by business and industry and the individual, over the past few years the increase in the contribution made by employers and employees, through stamps, to the Social Insurance Fund has been from £5.5 million to £13 million per annum.  Now on top of that we have a new tax on cigarettes, a new tax on beer, a new tax on petrol and diesel oil, all of which, certainly that on petrol and diesel oil, will bear heavily by way of increased costs on business and industry in this country.</P>
    <P>Every year borrowing by this Government has increased.  We have borrowed £261 million net since 1957 and we will borrow £82 million this year.  What have we got for it?  If we had houses to house our people, as we had in 1957, we might claim that the burden was worth bearing.  If we had schools and educational institutions adequate to the inevitable requirements of our people over the next ten years, we might say that the outlay would one day bring its return. But we find ourselves today with this unprecedented burden of taxation, with this immense capital expenditure undertaken, and we are without the schools, without the houses and without many other essentials the country so badly needs.</P>
    <P>There has been some talk and rejoicing about the buoyancy of <Col N="1748" /> revenue.  The buoyancy of revenue, of course, can expand indefinitely if the Government borrow sufficient money and spend it quickly enough.  Buoyancy of revenue is a poor return for borrowing money and expending it unless the borrowed money and its expenditure leave the nation the richer in things that are really vital to the nation's welfare.</P>
    <P>Side by side&mdash;and one grows weary of reciting the catalogue &mdash; with the taxes and rates to which I have just referred, the cost of living continues to climb.  In the past three or four months, the price of bread has gone up; the price of flour has gone up; the price of bus fares has gone up; the price of sugar has gone up; the price of cigarettes and the price of the pint are going up; and, as I have said, postage, telephones, petrol, and electricity charges are all going up.  Not least of all but only too easily forgotten, not only are the actual rates on property rising to the great disadvantage of everybody who owns his home, but, as a consequence of the increased cost of local government and the increased rate demand of the local authority, the rents payable by people living in corporation property are rising steeply.  Reference was made in this House only recently to the fact that the maximum differential rate in Ballyfermot which had been 36/6 for the largest type of house has gone up by 3/9 to £2 0s. 3d., and in the case of the smaller house, from 33/- to 36/3 per week.</P>
    <P>When we consider the impact of all these steady increases on the cost of living of our people, should we not ask ourselves how far this programme conforms to the desired end of stabilising prices and costs and how it is consistant with that picture to aspire either to the stabilisation of prices or of costs?  And if we fail in that, how can we hope economically to survive?</P>
    <P>As I read of bread, flour, sugar, rents, the pint and postage rising.  I think of the circumstances of the old age pensioner or any social welfare beneficiary, the widow, the blind, the unemployed.  We are now going to give them 2/6d. extra and for that they must wait until next August, and not all of them will get it.  I want to ask <Col N="1749" /> this House: what is the purchasing power of 37/6d. next August compared with the purchasing power 20 years ago of 10/-?  I suggest that the purchasing power of that 37/6d., when those people get it, will be approximately 12/- in terms of money 20 years ago when the old age pensioner was getting 10/-.  Perhaps then we can persuade ourselves we have made the old age pensioners effectively 2/- better off than they were 20 years ago.  Surely that is a performance on which we have no reason to congratulate ourselves, and that is not the performance which we had in mind in expanding the national income if the poor and the most defenceless sections of the community were to benefit from any development which took place.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the House that much of this expansion of the national income is illusory.  We are expanding it in terms of money but in terms of purchasing power, those who have to depend on fixed incomes, such as the old age pensioners, are finding themselves steadily being forced lower and lower in comparison with their neighbours.  The same is true of all the small farmers who are self-employed. They are sharing that burden, too.  If we were all sharing burdens, heavy burdens, and had dramatic results to show for them, that would be some consolation.</P>
    <P>Have Deputies considered what the results of the past seven years of Fianna Fáil's policy have been in terms of human welfare amongst our own people?  There are 70,000 fewer people employed today than there were in 1956.  Anyone who wants to check that figure can look at Table 15 of <i>Economic Statistics.</i> There are approximately 60,000 unemployed persons, though, by the introduction of the first employment period, that number has been reduced to 57,976 as at 4th April. Remarkably enough, that figure of 57,976 is 200 higher than it was a year ago and 3,000 higher than it was two years ago, More than 250,000 of our people, almost all of them between the ages of 18 and 30, have emigrated in the past seven years.  It is costing us just twice as much to run this country today as it cost seven years ago, <Col N="1750" /> more than £100 million more today than it cost seven years ago.</P>
    <P>The adverse trade balance today stands at £110 million.  The adverse balance of payments last year amounted to £22 million.  It is perfectly true that that adverse balance of payments has been substantially reduced by the influx of a considerable volume of foreign capital.  We have consistently advocated the desirability of the investment of foreign capital here for the establishment of new industry, for the provision of employment and the creation of additional export potential.  How is this country's advantage served by the influx of foreign capital which either goes to find a temporary abode in our banks, hot money, or for the purpose of buying land in rural Ireland to the exclusion of our people who need land to make their existing holdings economic or indeed to the exclusion of young landless men who want to settle and stay in their own country, to farm in their own country and who will not be given land but who watch it being sold to foreigners for cash?  How does it advantage this economy to see old, established businesses being bought out by foreign interests for the profit that can be made out of them?</P>
    <P>I feel that in the import of foreign capital, which is at present in a very large degree covering up the true adverse balance of payments on current account, we must differentiate very clearly between that kind of capital investment which will inure ultimately to the long term advantage of our economy and that kind of capital investment which socially, politically and economically, constitutes a very grave danger to the country and the community for which we are responsible.</P>
    <P>I want to warn the Government of this, and I think I know whereof I speak: the purchase of agricultural land by foreigners will be tolerated by our people up to a point but a time will certainly come when our people will revolt from the procedure of selling for gold what was purchased with blood.  There is not the slightest doubt that our people have a right to <Col N="1751" /> the land and that that right ought be acknowledged and protected by their own Government.  It is an intolerable strain to place on their patience to be told that there is no land for them, or for their sons, because it has been purchased by strangers either to operate for their own profit or as a safe repository for money they want to stash away.</P>
    <P>I note with amazement as a further result of the past seven years of Fianna Fáil that the net output of agriculture stands in 1963 at almost precisely the same figure at which it stood in 1957.  The net output of the agricultural industry in 1957, to a base of 190 in 1953, was 106.6 and 107 in 1963.  I am glad to see that the income of those on the land, the farmers' income, which was estimated to be £107.8 millions in 1963, which represented a decline of £1 million since 1962, is now to be augmented in some measure by a very conservative concession of twopence a gallon on creamery milk.  When you bear in mind that by legislation we levied on all creamery milk 1.3 pence to subsidise exports; when we realise the burden of the Exchequer to meet that has declined by nearly 50 per cent in the last 12 months as a result of an increase in butter on the British market, I do not think we broke our hearts when we gave farmers back twopence in exchange for the 1.6 pence we are taking from them in the levy to pay for exports costing the Exchequer just 50 per cent of what they cost 12 months ago.  We are to give them an increase of 8/- a cwt. in Grade A pigs.  That represents about 10/- a pig.  When you bear in mind that we have already increased the price of barley by 1/- a cwt., 2/- a barrel, which represents on the old calculation an increased cost of about 7/- per pig in the cost of feeding stuffs, the effective increase in the profit to the farmer raising a pig is about 3/-a pig, and none of them will get fat on that.</P>
    <P>I see nothing in this Budget beyond a few patches and splints for the haphazard arrangements that existed. What I look for and fail to find is any provision whatever for what is now <Col N="1752" /> universally agreed to be urgently necessary, that is, a radical reform of the health services.  When you bear in mind that this year we plan to raise by taxation £215 million; when you realise the extent to which we have expanded the contribution made through the stamps of employer-employee; when you realise the various increased costs which we have called upon our people to bear, surely we have a grave duty to ask ourselves where are the resources to be found to meet the essential charges that most people in this House are agreed must ultimately come in course of payment. If we are going effectively to reform the health services, they will cost more. Whether or not they are paid through an insurance scheme such as we advocate, both the State and the beneficiaries will have to contribute their share to the increased cost.</P>
    <P>When we come to consider the essential needs of education not only to provide sufficient schools but to give the children reasonable facilities in their classrooms in the national schools; when we come to think of the virtual non-existence of adequate technological educational facilities outside the limited resources available in Dublin and Cork; when we realise that to date no contribution by way of capital assistance has ever been given in this country to secondary education, and that it is now accepted by Fianna Fáil from our policy that such grants will have to be made; when you contemplate the necessary expansion in higher education and what that will mean in expanding facilities at University College Dublin, and presumably in Cork, and Galway and Trinity as well, and ask yourself where we are going to find the means to do that if we are already taxing our people virtually to the limit of their capacity, I think we realise the gravity of the problem with which this country is confronted.</P>
    <P>When one reads that what this Budget contemplates doing for agriculture is to increase the price of a pig by 10/- and to increase the price of milk by 2d., when one reads in that context the submission made by the <Col N="1753" /> National Farmers Association to the Government of what is necessary by way of capital investment and development in order to expand agriculture to its full capacity in the years that lie ahead, one cannot help wondering if the Taoiseach was not, perhaps, speaking for all his colleagues when he contemptuously said that if that programme were to be implemented you would want all the gold in the Bog of Allen.</P>
    <P>I have read that programme pretty closely and certainly as to 90 per cent of it I think it is sound and reasonable and not extravagant.  If we are to get from the land of Ireland the kind of output requisite to sustain the economic future of this country, investment of that kind is urgently necessary and any responsible Government should bring forward a plan, or the prospect of a plan, for giving effect to the recommendations contained in that report.</P>
    <P>The Government must be awake to the fact of the urgent need for additional educational facilities and the Government have an obligation to state their programme over the next period for realising that end.</P>
    <P>I look back with satisfaction on the fact that when we were in office we anticipated the necessity for expanding university facilities in this country and enabled the National University of Ireland to acquire the ground at Belfield on which building has now begun of the science buildings and the complex of building that will ultimately find its place there.  It is that kind of long-term planning that is urgently needed now and a very essential and important part of that long-term planning is to envisage the sources of revenue that will be available to finance it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in the course of his Financial Statement, referred to the Government's intention of re-opening its discussions with GATT. I want to ask the Minister a specific question.  One of the generally accepted conditions of GATT is that any member of it will extend to its fellow members the most favoured nation treatment, that is to say, that any facility we provide in a trade agreement <Col N="1754" /> with any country must be made available to all countries associated with us in GATT.  How can that condition be reconciled with the special trade relations obtaining between ourselves and Great Britain?  The Minister should be more explicit in his explanation of the Government's policy in regard to this matter before this debate is finally concluded.</P>
    <P>I urge on the Government that their present policy of raising the cost of living and watching that rising cost of living drive the costs of production steadily up should be urgently reviewed.  We maintained, when we were responsible for the government of this country, that it was a matter of vital urgency to keep the cost of living down and we substantially succeeded in achieving that end.  I suggest to this House that as the value of salaries and incomes declines our costs of production will rise and our exports will be less and less able to compete in the extremely competitive conditions that obtain in the world at the present time. I say that much of this Budget which we are at present considering will add to the burden that business and industry will have to carry and notably the charge which it is proposed to levy on petrol and diesel oil, which will constitute a very grave burden on every firm in this country that has to transport goods, together with the steep increase in the postal charges which every business in this country will have to bear.</P>
    <P>If the adverse trade balance of this country and its adverse balance of payments continues to rise, the influx of foreign capital sooner or later will cease to be sufficient to cover it, that is, unless we sell out the whole country, lock, stock and barrel.</P>
    <P>I say to the present Government that the fundamental needs for enduring prosperity are being ignored by the Government, both in education, housing, and in marketing organisation to deal with the increased production which we must have if the country is to survive.  I believe that the increases in taxation and the increased cost of living are reducing our competitive position every day of every <Col N="1755" /> year.  Unless this tendency can be brought under control and corrected, I believe the danger to this country is very formidable.  I see no evidence whatever in the speeches, statements or the actions of this Government that they have any conception of the dangers that attend the road they are at present travelling.  I believe them to be gamblers hoping for something to turn up.  I believe that constitutes a very grievous danger to us all.  Unless we can plan, not only for today and tomorrow, but for the long-term view, to get for our people permanent and enduring employment in their own country and a revenue sufficient to meet the long-term requirements of our people in the competitive world in which we live, the very independence of this nation will be put in peril.  If that should come to pass, this Government will have to bear their full responsibility for such a crisis.  I believe the only way to avoid that is to get rid of the present Government and I believe until we do we will have no effective change in the gambler's road they are at present travelling.  It is urgently necessary for this country that we should have, and I hope our people will take an early opportunity of displacing the present Government and substituting for it one which will have some regard, not only to the problems of the present, but to the hopes and prospects of the long future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on record that on more than one occasion a Government here and Governments in other countries introduced two Budgets in one year.  This is the first time that two Budgets have been introduced in one day.  The Minister for Finance, yesterday afternoon, introduced his Budget and during the course of his Financial Statement he made reference, in an offhand way, to the fact that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would be looking for a couple of millions, the details of which he would explain at a later date.  None of us imagined that later date would be some six or seven hours after the Minister for Finance had finished his Budget statement.  Perhaps the Government considered it was a rather clever <Col N="1756" /> way of dissociating the very serious increases in the postal charges from the actual Budget but if the idea was to fool the country in that way, the people are far too intelligent to swallow it.  Having listened to some of the comments late last night and today, I am satisfied the Government did not get away with it and that everybody recognises what has happened as a cheap confidence trick reflecting no credit on those responsible for it.</P>
      <P>When the turnover tax was introduced last year, the Minister for Finance said categorically that the main reason for it was that the traditional method of taxation had reached saturation point.  While most of us opposed the turnover tax as applied to foodstuffs and essential clothing, we felt if those items had been excluded, possibly the Minister, if he meant what he said, might be on to something which was quite correct.  Strangely enough, this year he has returned to the attack on the traditional method of taxation and if it had reached saturation point last year, I do not know what the position will be in a few weeks when the new taxes bear on the items concerned because the price increases which are proposed are not only big increases but have been described in the newspapers and by individuals to whom I spoke as &ldquo;savage&rdquo; increases.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister was serious when he said saturation point had been reached but this year the country is deadly serious when they find that items which they felt sure could not be touched again are now asked to bear not a penny or twopence but three or four pence.  The Minister is well aware that the increased prices will reflect in the turnover tax with the result that the income will all the time be growing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish yesterday commented that the Government had a vested interest in prices.  How true that statement was.  The higher prices go, the more the Government will get in taxation.  It appears as if the Minister is backing two horses and flogging them for all he is worth, hoping that one of them will come home a winner or that possibly they will dead-heat.  Whether <Col N="1757" /> the price the Minister is prepared to pay on his horses will compensate the country when the odds are counted is something we shall wait with interest to discover.</P>
    <P>The Minister began as usual with a survey of the economy in the past year.  According to what he said, he was satisfied with it, but the extraordinary thing is that of the five pages of his survey, between two and three are devoted to gloomy forebodings of what would happen as a result of the ninth round of wage increases.  Again we find the Minister and his Government attempting to have a foot in both camps.  They are attempting to take full credit, where they think it will suit, for the recent increase in wages and seem to forget that the Taoiseach had stated very definitely that the increase which the economy could carry was between seven and eight per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Eight to nine per cent.  The Deputy is one point below.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Taoiseach's word for it but the documents which I examined said a maximum of eight per cent.  He gave this advice to the body negotiating the wage increase, representing the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, after that body had turned down ten per cent from the employers.  I do not know if he expected them to go back and say: &ldquo;we were looking for too much; we will back down and take eight per cent.&rdquo;  They made it plain they would not do so.  Having agreed, apparently, that they were entitled to negotiate for the highest figure they could get&mdash; as they were&mdash;and that figure having been achieved, the Government are now attempting to blame the ninth round for certain things that have happened since.  Worse than that, they have come up in his Budget with increases in social welfare assistance.  I want to stress the word &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; because social welfare benefits are mentioned in certain newspapers today and these benefits are not affected.  By a strange coincidence, the increase in social assistance represents something more than seven per cent.  I do not know if <Col N="1758" /> the Taoiseach, having failed to impose a standstill on the trade union movement with the seven or eight per cent, decided they would impose it on those on whom he could impose it, recipients of social assistance.  The previous speaker referred to the fact that it was payable from 1st June.  In fact it is payable from 1st August.  I suppose that was a slip of the tongue.</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party consider that not alone is the half-crown offered to the social assistance class not sufficient but it is nothing short of an insult.  Worse still, the Minister has apparently succeeded in persuading himself that the people who will be fortunate or unfortunate enough&mdash; depending on how you look at it&mdash;to draw social welfare benefits are not entitled to any increase.  I do not want the Minister to come back and say they got 5/- in January.  They did, and the other people got 2/6 in November but that was supposed to be compensation for the 2½ per cent turnover tax.  The Taoiseach is on record as saying here that if the assistance classes got 2/6, the benefit classes were entitled to double that.  That was last year.  Apparently it does not apply this year because the assistance classes get 2/6 and the benefit classes get nothing at all.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, costs have gone up on people in receipt of those benefits just as much as on those who have benefited by the ninth round of wage increases.  I am sure both the Minister and the Taoiseach are well aware that the increase in the cost of goods, which was shown as merely 3½ per cent in mid-February now seems to be reaching a 12/15 per cent level. Everyone will be shocked when the next cost of living index is produced by the tremendous increase which has taken place since the figures were last checked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The blame for that does not rest with the trade unionists, as so many people wish to make out.  The blame rests fairly and squarely on the back of the Government Minister who took no steps, except soft talk in this House, to try to tie prices when he found they were going out of hand.  Even yet, the only thing we have from the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1759" /> in regard to prices is that some type of private inquiry is being carried on behind closed doors to find out if some people have been charging too much for commodities for the past couple of months.</P>
    <P>Surely the sensible thing would have been for the Minister to make an order that before prices were raised, the people who wished to raise them must bring their case before the Prices Advisory Body.  That was not done. At first the Minister talked about the Fair Trade Commission and said they would be investigating the price of soap.  I do not think that codded many people, but it gave him a breathing space, and it gave the people who wanted to raise prices a breathing space.  He then reconstituted the Prices Advisory Body and, so far as I am aware, there has been no public inquiry, and judging by some of the answers the Minister has given, none is contemplated in the near future.  If any blame is to be passed around for the inflationary trends we hear so much about, it must rest on the Government, and not on the trade unionists.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister for Finance really appreciates what he has done by increasing the price of petrol. He says the increase is less than 3d. per gallon, and with the turnover tax, it will be 3d. per gallon.  He should appreciate that while CIE will be exempt, every other form of transport will cost more.  People who haul goods from one end of the country to the other, people who deliver goods, people who take supplies of raw materials to factories and who bring the finished articles from factories, farmers, and everyone will pay extra.  I am sure the effects of that 3d. will be felt right down the line.  Even the unfortunate&mdash; and I think unfortunate is the correct description&mdash;builders' labourers, hundreds of whom travel from as far afield as 40 miles into the city by car in the early hours of the morning, and return in the evening, because there is no other employment available to them, will find it will cost them more to travel, on top of the punishment which they have already to face.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Budget Statement <Col N="1760" /> made the rather vague remark that unemployment and emigration continue to be much lower than a few years ago.  In 1963-64, unemployment was consistently some thousands higher than it was in 1961.  Page 37 of <i>Economic Statistics</i> proves that.  It was an average of 6.1 per cent in 1963.  In Britain unemployment is now two per cent.  I cannot understand why the Minister seems to be so happy about that position.  Surely he appreciates it is not a position to be happy about, and that something dynamic must be done, apart from expressing generalities that things are not so bad.</P>
    <P>It is true that emigration figures are lower than they were a few years ago. Last year the Minister was very anxious to give us the exact figure for emigration.  He told us, and I believe it was correct, that for the 12 months ending February, 1963, emigration had declined to the figure of 12,200, which was a relatively small figure.  Even though it was still far too high, it was lower than in previous years.  The Taoiseach has admitted that the 12 months ending February of each year is the fairest period for judging emigration figures.  The Minister did not quote the figure this year.  It was very noticeable that he did not make any reference to it.  Maybe he assumed people would think the downward trend had continued, but it is a fact that the emigration figure is more than double that of last year.  In fact, to the end of February of this year, the figure is 25,060.  I am sure the Minister cannot be too happy about that figure, and I cannot blame him for not being terribly anxious to mention it yesterday.</P>
    <P>I come now to jobs.  The Minister and all Government speakers for some time have been trying to give the impression that there are more jobs available, and that the number of people in employment is higher than it was.  That is all cod.  I suppose it is all right to fool us if we accept these statements and do not check them. I have checked them.  I want to make this clear, and put it on record, that while it is true that the number of jobs increased by 1,000 in the two years 1962 and 1963&mdash;and that <Col N="1761" /> is rather far from the 100,000 jobs we heard about a few years ago&mdash;in the ten years since 1953, the number of jobs has decreased by 114,000.  Since Fianna Fáil came into office in 1957, when the 100,000 jobs were just around the corner, the number of jobs has decreased by 32,000.  In fact while in 1957 the number of people in employment was 1,084,000, it has now dropped to 1,052,000.</P>
    <P>If those figures are not correct, perhaps the Minister for Finance would state what are the correct figures when he is replying.  I challenge contradiction that they are the correct figures.  It is utter nonsense for Government speakers to try to give the impression that thousands of new jobs are appearing every year, and that unemployment is rapidly disappearing.  The facts are that there are not thousands of new jobs appearing every year, and that emigration is continuing and climbing again.</P>
    <P>On Saturday 4th April, the unemployment figure was 57,976 and the previous week, 26th March, it was 57,338.  In other words, there were over 600 more unemployed on 4th April than in the previous week.  That is entirely different from the normal trend because in the previous year the trend was in the opposite direction and there were almost 800 fewer unemployed in April than there were on the last Saturday in March.  When we talk about employment and unemployment, let us have facts and figures and not deal in generalities.  When a Minister says employment is growing and emigration is dropping, we do not have to accept that as fact, because I have proved conclusively that it is not so.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs really understands that he has added tremendously to costs by the increases which he is now demanding.  It is now 5d. for an ordinary closed letter.  Across the Border it is 3d.  We are paying 2d. more than they are paying a few miles away in Northern Ireland; yet we are told costs are much higher in Northern Ireland.  It is another example of muddling.  In order to try to deal with the queue waiting for telephones, there <Col N="1762" /> is now a £10 charge to have a telephone installed.  That means a man who wants to start a small business will have to find £10 extra.</P>
    <P>Some of the charges for parcels are out of this world.  It is absolutely astonishing that there is as much as 9d. extra of a charge for small parcels.</P>
    <P>The telephone service was not doing so badly.  In addition to those who will have to pay an extra charge for the use of the telephone, there will now be an extra 1d. for each local call and a <i>pro rata</i> charge for other calls.</P>
    <P>The cost of a telegram is going up to 5/- and 5d. per word.  Surely the Minister is doing either of two things. Either he is determined that he will cut down the use of the telephone very considerably&mdash;maybe that is his object and if it is, he looks like achieving it&mdash; or, if that is not his object, somebody is trying to build up a nice nest-egg for next year.  Perhaps that might be the real kernel of the whole thing.</P>
    <P>We are told about the wonderful assistance being given to farmers&mdash;2d. per gallon for milk at creameries.  We only hope that that will not result in 3d. or 4d. extra on butter.  Then there are 8/- and 5/- for Grade A pigs. The question arises of the Grade A pigs coming out of the factory.  The extraordinary thing is that they do not seem to come in, according to what the farmers tell me.  They find extreme difficulty in getting Grade A for pigs going in.  If what Deputy Dillon says is correct, that there is 7/- extra on one commodity alone for feeding pigs and there is a profit of only 3/- for the farmer, then there is not very much being given there.</P>
    <P>I would refer particularly to this question of rates relief.  It is true that it is rates relief for agricultural land. I am one of those people who for quite a long time have been pointing out that the unfortunate householder has to pay very much more in rates than quite a lot of people who have fairly sizeable farms.  While it may be said that the householder has in many cases some way of making money much better than the farmer has, at the same time when the last increase in the subsidy to rates was <Col N="1763" /> given by the Government, I know hundreds of small farmers who found that they got a rates remission of anything between 9d. and 1/3d. per week while their neighbours with very big farms were able to boast that they had got anything up to £5 and £6 a week of a remission.  Again, it appears to me as if the small farmer will get very little here and the big farmer will, as usual, come out with the lion's share of this particular gift.</P>
    <P>It is rather interesting that when the Minister was allowing his heart to bleed for those engaged in agriculture, he did not pause for a minute to think of what was happening to the agricultural worker.  Did it never strike the Minister that we have long since reached the stage where the only way to keep agricultural workers on the land is by a direct Government subsidy to the agricultural worker?  We have a board dealing with agricultural workers' wages.  That board met in January and recommended an increase of 15/- per week.  Though it is now the middle of April, they still have not met to decide when or if they will give it.  Yet those people are paying the increased prices the same as the industrial and other workers who have their ninth round of wage increases in their pockets.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is again thinking of agriculture, I would ask him to remember that there are two sides to it. There is the man who has a farm, for whom the management of the farm is his job, and who makes his money in it.  Then there is the man who is employed on the farm.  I think in many cases he is the important partner.  It is too bad that he should be treated now not as a second-class citizen but as a ninth- or tenth-class citizen, as if he were a slave, as if he did not count. The only difference is that they are not being sold.  The Minister should bear that in mind when looking at this problem again.  While I am quite well aware that the agricultural industry does need a boost, at the same time I feel the benefit will be distributed&mdash;we have not details of it yet&mdash;as those things are always distributed: those who have plenty will get more and those with little will get less.  That <Col N="1764" /> seems to be the pattern all along and I do not think it will be changed this time.</P>
    <P>I come now to the increase of public service pensions by five per cent for those who retired prior to 1961.  In this case, I think the Minister might possibly have been a little more generous.  Is there any reason why the gap could not be bridged?  Why did the Minister not bring it up to 1963, and remove this long-standing grievance of those pensioners that they are being left behind in the race, because they too, have to pay?  In relation to the last increase given by this House to pensioners, I had a letter the other day from somebody whose pension was increased by 7d. per week as a result of the increase given here.  I am sure the Minister will agree that 7d. per week will not compensate for the increase in the cost of living which has been occurring.</P>
    <P>The question of the increase in the price of cigarettes is one on which we may have different views.  I do not smoke and therefore I suppose I am not a fit person to judge whether or not it is right to increase the cost of cigarettes and cigarette tobacco.  Perhaps the Minister might tell us if it was because of the fact that there is at present a scare about lung cancer that he availed of the opportunity to put on an extra 3d.?  Possibly, for the same reason, he could have decided to do something about the diesel fumes when he put the 3d. on the petrol and diesel oil.  I am sure we could accuse him of the same thing.</P>
    <P>When the Minister referred to the fact that pipe tobacco was not included, did he mean all pipe tobacco or hard tobacco?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad.  Having seen the Taoiseach smoke a pipe afterwards, I was sure all pipe tobacco would be excluded.  As far as the taxation reliefs are concerned, it is rather a pity that when the Minister was considering these, he did not do something about the question of the income tax paid by <Col N="1765" /> the wage earner.  I do not have to tell the Minister and it is hardly necessary to repeat it in this House that the amount of money which is allowed to a wage earner before tax is collected is far too small.  Not alone that, but the amount of money allowed for a dependent relative is far too small. Consider the father of a family who is attempting to educate his children and the ridiculous tax allowance which he gets.  The Minister must not be <i>au fait</i> with present-day costs.  If he were, I am sure he would have included in his tax reliefs something to help the unfortunate person who is in that position.</P>
      <P>The Minister, I think, is aware that quite a number of old people are maintained, and rightly so, by their children down through the country. Working people have their aged fathers and mothers, or other relatives, living with them, as well as their own immediate family.  If they are able to keep these relatives, that means that local authorities, and the country generally, are saved a considerable amount because the expense of keeping these people in the county homes can be very considerable.  The tax concession given by the Minister is not very much encouragement to these people to make the extra sacrifice called for in providing a home for their aged relatives.  This is a matter in which the Minister could be a great deal more generous.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are the people&mdash; I mentioned them a few minutes ago&mdash; who must of necessity use vehicles to travel long distances to work.  At present they are ruled out completely unless they are using the vehicles in the course of their employment.  They are not allowed to claim a remission of income tax.  Surely, if a man drives from Kells, or Trim, 40 miles to Dublin, and back again, it is more reasonable that he should get a tax remission than the man who drives five miles between jobs, five miles again, and five miles home.  He can claim a remission.  This is a matter the Minister should have another look at because it causes hardship.  It is in cases such as I have mentioned that tax should be remitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1766" /> I am sorry to see the £200,000 Exchequer Grant to the Road Fund withdrawn because, at the present time, the volume of traffic on the roads is so great that I feel the more money that can be found for making the roads safer, the better it will be for everyone concerned.  I believe a great many road accidents can be explained very easily if they are related to the increased volume of traffic finding its way on to the roads following the closing of the railways.</P>
    <P>We believe that the Budget is not just a calculation of income and expenditure.  We believe that it should be an instrument for moulding the economy in order to ensure a just distribution of both the country's resources and the total tax imposition. We believe this Budget fails utterly to do either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is fair enough to conclude from the boring character of the two speeches to which we have just listened and the very inadequate attendance of Opposition Deputies in the House to-day that the fighting on this Budget is over.  However, I suppose we have to go through the motions of debating it, but it is clear that, so far as the Government are concerned, we have not got any very great problem on our hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Deputy in this House knew from the information which the Government supplied him with, in advance of the introduction of the Budget, in relation to the estimated tax yield and the estimated expenditure for the year, that this year's Budget could have been balanced with some comparatively minor adjustments, and without additional taxation of any significance, if we were willing to make no additional provision for agriculture or for social welfare payments, that is to say, provision over and above that set out in the Book of Estimates.  We decided that this course would not be justifiable, that the obligation to render further support to farmers' incomes and to make further increases in social welfare payments was paramount, and that it had to be fulfilled even if it meant further tax changes.  We should have liked indeed to have done a great deal <Col N="1767" /> more than we propose and we hope that this may be possible in future years.</P>
    <P>The examination of the estimated yield of existing taxation this year made it clear that, if the Budget were to be balanced, and the Minister for Finance in his Statement yesterday emphasised the overriding economic necessity of achieving a balance, that additional taxation was inevitable.  We devised the taxes, therefore, which press least onerously on the public.  It is quite true, as Deputy Tully said, that last year we did not consider that cigarettes and drink could bear any additional taxation.  It seemed to us that, if we had attempted to tax these commodities last year, the yield in revenue would be disproportionate to the tax increases put on.  This year, however, when we came to examine the situation, knowing the trend of consumption of both tobacco and beer during the year, and taking into account the fact that wages and salaries are being increased generally throughout the country, we decided that additional taxation on these commodities was feasible.  Deputies will have noted, with interest, that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer reached the same decision.</P>

      <P>The general view of the public on this Budget is, I think, that it is both a confident and a levelheaded Budget.  Listening to Deputy Dillon today, I could not make up my mind whether he was criticising the Government for taxing the people too heavily, as he appeared at one time to suggest, or for not providing for vastly increased expenditures on various Government services, expenditures which would have necessitated still heavier taxation.  Unfortunately, in this regard, he gave a very bad example to the Labour Party because Deputy Tully followed suit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1768" /> These Parties must make up their minds whether they want lower taxation and, therefore, lower expenditure by the Government, or higher expenditure and, therefore, higher taxes. They cannot, it seems to me, with any appearance of consistency attack the Government simultaneously for imposing tax increases and for not providing for more farm price supports, higher social welfare payments, increased expenditure on health services, on education, or anything else.  People will respect them, as Parties, when they make up their minds which road they wish to travel.  At present they are not even consistent in their criticism.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;must be based upon facts and not upon wishful thinking.  This is what the Government have always tried to ensure and this was the consideration which determined the characteristics of the Budget which the Minister for Finance presented here yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taxation is not only an instrument of economic policy, it is also an instrument of social policy.  Tax revenue, the money coming into the Exchequer as a result of the taxes imposed, is not money taken out of circulation.  It is paid out again and it is paid out for precise and explainable purposes, economic and social purposes, which would not otherwise be achieved if the Government did not organise them. <Col N="1769" /> There may not be in this House between the Parties now represented in it full agreement as to the role of Government in economic and social development.  But the old conception that Governments should stand aside and allow economic and social forces to have free play and to work themselves out is not now, as far as I understand it, held seriously by anybody.  It is not likely to be contested&mdash; and having regard to the vagueness of the policies of the Opposition Parties, I will not put it stronger than that&mdash; that there is an overall responsibility on the Government for the general regulation of the national economy, preferably by knowledge and consent rather than by direction.</P>
    <P>It may be that that principle is not yet fully accepted in respect of the all-important sphere of incomes policy. We have never sought to exaggerate the job of the Government in economic and social matters.  As far as economic development is concerned, we have tried to maintain a logical separation between the functions of the State and the role of private enterprise and have kept clear in our own minds what must be the subject of State supervision or State control and what can best and safely be left to the free play of market forces.  In our political philosophy, we accept that education, the relief of poverty, including better housing, the care of the sick and the reduction of undue and unjust inequalities within the community are matters in which the Government, acting for the community, must make provision.  This may be common ground between the Parties.</P>
    <P>It is not likely either to be contested that the redistribution of the benefits of economic progress, so that all the elements of our national community can share in them, involve in present circumstances exceptional provision for the support of agriculture and of agricultured incomes; and that the Government should have special care for the problems arising in localities where economic development possibilities are less obvious than they are elsewhere.</P>
    <P>All Deputies now accept, or have been forced by the facts to recognise, <Col N="1770" /> that economic progress is not something that will happen of its own accord and that the direction of national resources, the elimination of impediments to expansion, and the programming of development possibilities are rightly the concern of the Government and have an important bearing on the nation's rate of progress.  Neither will social justice happen of its own accord.  Here the role of the Government is to mobilise community resources to whatever extent they deem it to be just and practicable to ensure that social aims are realised and that undesirable inequalities are minimised if they cannot be eliminated altogether.</P>
    <P>I do not think, as Deputy Dillon tried to suggest, that the Irish people have any undue grievance over the taxation measures in operation here. By and large, our tax rates are lower than in other western Europen countries&mdash;indeed, lower than any other country in the world with comparable living standards.  Taxation represents a smaller proportion of our national income than it does in other countries. This is not altogether attributable to restraint on the part of the Government but to the fact that we do not have to meet exceptional burdens for national defence which other Governments undertake.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about Government taxation.  In most other countries in Europe Government taxation as a percentage of national income exceeds 30 per cent.  The great advantage secured for this country by the publication and fulfilment of the Government's <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was in creating a more dynamic attitude among all elements of the nation and more confidence in the country's future.  We can now say with justification that the country has recovered from the inertia of the mid-1950s.  It is going ahead strongly at this time.  There was a slowing down in our rate of expansion during 1962, due mainly to export difficulties, but this situation was changed again in 1963 when the full desired rate of growth was maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prospects for this year of achieving a growth rate between four per cent and five per cent are reasonably good, assuming stability in international conditions and normal circumstances, including the weather, at home.  All the economic forecasters whom the Government have consulted in preparing their estimates for the year have predicted a reasonably favourable trend.  The point I am trying to get into the heads of the <Col N="1772" /> Deputies opposite is that this has been made possible by maintaining the volume of Government spending.  The maintenance of the projected growth rate will require a further expansion of investment in national development possibilities which will certainly involve the utilisation of all available capital resources within the country and a continuation of the capital inflow about which Deputy Dillon is so perturbed.</P>
    <P>While saying that, and indeed emphasising the favourable character of the economic indicators, I do not want to suggest, nor will I say, that there are not difficulties ahead and some dangers of which we have to take note. We know that the conditions prevailing in international markets for agricultural products are still a serious impediment to the realisation of the full potential of our agricultural industry.  A real improvement in agricultural incomes by reason of increased sales of agricultural products at economic prices can be realised only when international trading conditions in respect of agricultural products have been reorganised.  It certainly will not be until that happens&mdash;if it ever does happen&mdash;that the exceptional measures now being taken by the Government to support agricultural prices and farmers' incomes can be given up and the money now required for these purposes transferred to production aids and other useful purposes.</P>
    <P>There is a danger this year that the total level of consumption by our people, our total spending on consumption goods, may have adverse consequences on our imports, may, by increasing the volume of imports, widen our external payments gap.</P>
    <P>The further development of our industrial production, upon which depends the realisation of the overall targets for the national economy, will require very careful consideration of the structural changes required in industry, on the expansion of our training programmes for workers and matters of that kind, including the maintenance of the grants and inducements now offered to facilitate both expansion and change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1773" /> Industrial expansion is the first aim of our policy because the realisation of all the targets of the Second Programme depends on it, and here at least we can look at the existing position with some optimism and confidence.  Industrial production was up by seven per cent in 1963 and, as the Minister for Finance pointed out yesterday, that was one of the highest rates of expansion achieved by any European country in the past year. That expansion took place over the whole range of industries, in old industries as well as new industries.  A more encouraging feature was that the rate of increase accelerated as the year went on and was particularly noticeable in the second half of 1963, especially in the metal, engineering and textile industries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon is always pretending to be worried about our balance of external payments.  I suppose he will not take my word for it that there is as yet no great reason for concern. There is a widening gap in our visible trade and a deficit on our current payments of some size but there is no reason up to now why we should be showing any undue concern in respect of our external payments position. The total deficit on current account in the past year was £22 million but there was no loss of reserves, due, as Deputy Dillon appreciated, to the continuing inflow of capital.  In fact our external reserves increased during the year.</P>
    <P>Irish development is, in the main, financed out of Irish resources.  The bulk of the capital invested in development projects here last year was Irish capital but the capital inflow which has been a remarkable feature of recent years is a very important element affecting our rate of economic growth.  That capital coming in is, in the main, invested in productive enterprises, in new industries and in the expansion of existing concerns, and has gone for the purchase of plant and equipment.  Strong investment outlays are essential for the maintenance of our rate of economic growth.  The argument that this inflow represents the sale of Irish assets to foreigners is just nonsense.</P>
    <Col N="1774" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not bear up one moment to examination.  I am sorry to have to destroy a political illusion of the Fine Gael Party.  Even if that has happened in some instances, even if in a few commercial or other concerns shares have been allocated to external interests, the Irish capital thus released is reinvested in Irish development.</P>
      <P>The transfer of agricultural land to foreigners, the constant bugbear of the Fine Gael Party, even if it were decided to count as foreigners some persons of Irish birth or parentage who have returned here and acquired land in the counties from which they or their parents came, is of no great significance whatever.  The total acreage of land transferred to foreigners &mdash;and it is now measured precisely&mdash; is not much greater in recent years than it was in previous years, and Deputies who are familiar with this matter know that the figures are swollen by the fact that very frequently the same farm or the same area of land changes hands more than once.</P>
      <P>However, if this inflow of capital for productive purposes should cease or become curtailed, then the financing of the deficit on our external payments might present grave difficulties, and certainly our rate of development would slow down.  There is a danger, particularly during this present year, that the expansion of purchasing power amongst the community by reason of income increases will expand imports more rapidly than exports and in certain circumstances, if this trend should go too far, it might require corrective measures which might represent a very serious setback to our development plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance emphasised in his speech here yesterday, the surest remedy for that situation is an expansion of savings.  In 1963 small savings, by and large, did not expand.  If, as the Minister for Finance urged, those in our community who have got increases in their wages or their salaries would decide to save some part, if not the whole, of the <Col N="1775" /> increases by any of the means which are open to them, then it would not only benefit themselves but help the country over a difficult patch.  We expect with some confidence an expansion of savings in this year.</P>
    <P>In time of economic expansion such as this country is now happily enjoying, it is not a matter for concern that some reasonable deficit on external payments should appear.  We have in fact programmed for this.  There are substantial external reserves in our banking system and external investments in the ownership of Irish residents.  There is no national purpose to be served by increasing these reserves.  There is no danger that this country cannot meet its external obligations and payments, and corrective action, if required, can be taken in time to prevent any serious difficulty.</P>
    <P>The work of preparing the detailed plans and measures to achieve the production targets set out in the Second Programme is proceeding.  Most of the material has been collected.  The detailed investigations and examinations are being completed and the work of analysing the results and tabulating the targets for individual sectors, for particular industries and occupations, is now in progress.  It is still a prospect that this second volume relating to the programme will be completed by June. This is rather later than we had anticipated but consultation with various organisations and consideration of their submissions has been a fairly heavy task.  Nothing has emerged which suggests that the targets outlined are not realisable or that the resources required for the fulfilment of the programme are not available.  The National Industrial Economic Council has produced an important report upon the targets set in the industrial sector which confirms these targets and which I hope Deputies have studied.  Discussions are taking place with farmers' organisations regarding production possibilities for agriculture and prospects of realising them.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Second Programme is to determine the highest rate of growth that can be maintained in the period until 1970, in the light of <Col N="1776" /> policy considerations, the probable development of trading conditions in the external markets that concern us, and the resources of men, money and ability available to us.  In reaching a conclusion as to growth possibilities, our past experiences and the experiences of other countries were relied upon.  Many judgments and assumptions, not all of them economic, had also to be made.  Precisely accurate forecasts from all sectors of activity are not to be expected but the over-all calculation of growth possibilities reflects the results of very careful study. The decision that a four per cent growth rate is feasible was based upon realistic assumptions as to internal and external factors and resources.  What is involved is a programme of probabilities, not of promises that these things will happen nor a rigid plan for doing them.  This is still predominantly a private enterprise economy and our progress depends on a multitude of individual decisions, supplemented and stimulated by State activities.  The purpose of our policy is to encourage the making of the right decisions.</P>
    <P>The role of State activity and particularly of State investment in the fulfilment of our targets will be considerable.  Our economic progress is predominantly a matter of spending money in the right directions, in directions which add to the productive capacity of the country.  Only the very wealthy countries can afford to ignore economic tests of public expenditure and not for very long.  We cannot afford to ignore them at all.  We must ensure that we get full value for all the money we spend.  That necessitates checking and double-checking the purposes of all expenditure and making sure to avoid all waste.  It may involve, and it has involved, as Deputies may be aware, decisions to postpone expenditure on many desirable developments which we would like to undertake, which are not directly related to production, until we can better afford them.</P>
    <P>I would like Deputies to study very carefully the booklet provided by the Government relating to this year's capital Budget.  Deputy Sweetman made some critical observations regarding this capital Budget when he spoke here last evening and appeared to <Col N="1777" /> suggest that the Government are fixing their capital expenditure targets at far too high a level.  I would like Deputy Sweetman to particularise his objections.  I want all Deputies to be aware of the objects of this expenditure.  In this year we propose to increase State capital investment in housing to £16.6 million.  That is more than double the amount spent five years ago.  So far as I know, there is not likely to be in the House any criticism of that expenditure on the ground that it is at too high a level.  If I interpret Deputy Dillon's remarks correctly, he would wish to see a still higher level of expenditure on housing, even though he would like to see that achieved without expending any money.  In sanitary and similar services, we propose to invest £4.10 million.  This will be spent mostly on water supplies for rural areas and the improvement of water and sanitary services in our towns and villages.  That is three times what was spent for these purposes five years ago.</P>

      <P>You never spent anything at all.  This year we are expending on new schools and on the restoration of other schools £3.14 million and that is nearly double what was spent five years ago.  Our hospitals will require another £2.90 million and other buildings and construction works will take £2.47 million.  That is many times the expenditure of five years ago.  I made the comparison with five years ago, which was not the disastrous period of the Coalition Government but the beginning of the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, and this increase in capital outlay upon desirable purposes is possible now because of the success of that <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>

      <P>The Deputy suffers from some illusions.  The rapid rate of growth of the national economy requires that the capital outlay on essential services should rise in line with national requirements, and for this reason, because of the growth of activity within our economy, we have this year to undertake additional capital investment to the extent of £12.4 million for the generation and distribution of electricity.  Turf production will involve a further capital outlay of £1.8 million and transport by land, sea, and air including ports, harbours and airports, will involve an investment totalling £14.47 million. Capital expenditure on telephone development will reach £6 million this year.  Industrial development of all kinds, including food processing, will call for a total of £9 million of State capital investment, apart from private investment which is expected to be considerable.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation requires £3 million and voted capital services for Agriculture will absorb £11.3 million.</P>
      <P>These are impressive figures and reflect the policy of the Government to maintain the level of State capital expenditure at the highest possible point.  Deputy Sweetman appeared to regard it as a criticism of the Government that this level of capital expenditure by the Government is, as he said, double what it was in 1956.  That is one of the reasons the people are now twice as well off as they were in 1956 but the maintenance of this high level of investment which is essential if our rate of economic growth is to be maintained will present some difficulties. The total capital programme this year is £96.11 million, of which £70.77 million must come from the Exchequer. Normal sources will produce, as set out in the booklet, an estimated £31.2 million, leaving £40.46 million to be found by national loan or other borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon exhorts us to spend more money on education and this is something I am very glad to hear because it reflects a remarkable change in Fine Gael's point of view.  I am <Col N="1779" /> going to remind him of how the Fine Gael view was expressed in action when he was over here on this side of the House as part of the Government of the country.  Deputy Sweetman said yesterday that there is nothing in this Budget for education.  He was one time Minister for Finance and he should know the elementary procedures of presenting the Budget.  The most important factor in determining the size of the Budget is the total of the Book of Estimates and I suggest that Deputy Sweetman should have taken the trouble to read the Book of Estimates before commenting on the Budget.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the considerably increased provision for education on which the Government decided is set out in the Book of Estimates and it was not considered necessary to make any further arrangements in regard to education in the Budget.  That is the sole reason why there was no specific reference to the allocation of funds for education in the statement by the Minister for Finance.  Last year, the Government, as a deliberate act of policy, decided to raise the status of all groups of teachers by giving them salary increases in advance of the ninth round.  The 12 per cent increase of the ninth round which applied to all categories of public servants was applied to teachers over their salaries as already increased by the status awards made during the year.  The annual cost of this deliberate act of policy on the part of the Government, decided upon for the express purpose of raising the status of our teachers, will this year amount to £2.210 million.</P>
    <P>As compared with the amounts budgeted last year, the amount provided in the Book of Estimates for the building of national schools is up by over £500,000.  The provision for heating and cleaning grants for national schools is being increased by £100,000 which enables very substantial increases to be made in the rate of grants.  Deputy Dillon is particularly concerned now about secondary education.  One of the last acts of the Government of which he was a member was to cut the capitation grants to secondary schools by ten per cent.  Has <Col N="1780" /> he forgotten that?  They were not very much concerned about the development of secondary education when they had the power to do something about it.  This year the capitation grants to secondary schools are being increased by 20 per cent on top of the ten per cent already restored to them to make good the cut by the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>For the first time in our history&mdash; as the Deputy pointed out for the purpose of trying to gain credit for himself with the spurious allegation that the idea was his&mdash;a scheme of capital grants for the construction and development of secondary schools is being introduced by this Government. Deputy Dillon may have thought about it when he was in Government but he did nothing about it.  Arising out of the operation of the Scholarship Act which the Government passed in 1961, a further £69,000 is being provided for scholarships in this year.  The provision for vocational education, apart from teachers' salaries, is being increased by £74,000.  An additional £615,730 is being provided for university education, including an added amount of £443,000 in respect of capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>The total increased expenditure for education this year, as compared with last year, and apart from any sums of money that may be attributable to the ninth round of wage and salary increases, is £2,167,000, and to mark the contrast between our performance in office and Fine Gael's hypocrisy out of office, I will mention one startling fact: since 1957, since Deputy Dillon ceased to be a Minister, the total expenditure on education has increased by no less than £12 million.  That is a fairly substantial contribution.</P>

      <P>Deputies in both Fine Gael and Labour appear to be <Col N="1781" /> perturbed about the announced increase in Post Office charges.  I want to take them back to reality in this. These increases are required solely to meet the cost of higher wages and salaries in the Post Office service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not make the 5d. stamp any cheaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The full amount which it is anticipated the higher charges will yield this year will not be sufficient to meet the full cost of these wage and salary increases.  That is because, first of all, there is a retrospective element in the wages and salaries paid this year, and secondly, because the increases will not be in operation for the whole of the financial year.  When the Government examined the position in the Post Office, we found that salaries had fallen behind comparable classes in other branches of the public service and we decided that it was just and right to make an adjustment in these salaries to bring up the clerical salaries and operative wages in the Post Office to the comparable standards applying to similar work in other sectors of the public service.  We did that knowing that, because of the very large numbers involved, this would necessitate a revision in the Post Office charges.</P>
      <P>Am I to interpret Deputy Tully's statement denouncing these increases to mean that he and his Party are against the upward revision of the salaries and wages of Post Office workers?  Or are they merely against providing the money to pay the increases?  The principle that the Post Office should pay for itself and not be subsidised from taxation is not merely sound but as far as I know, has never heretofore been questioned in the Dáil.  There is, I agree, an obligation on the Government to ensure that the cost of these services is not unduly inflated and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is now about to initiate a drive for economies in the Post Office by the adjustment of the services to the reasonable needs of the people and by changes in procedures which will, it is hoped, increase individual productivity.</P>

      <P>I wish the Deputy <Col N="1782" /> would make a sensible remark some time.  It is not possible yet to say what scope for economies may exist.  Postal and telephone charges, however, are still very reasonable by comparison with other European countries and we could not continue to keep them lower than the charges obtaining elsewhere at the expense of denying to our Post Office workers rates of remuneration related to the quality of their work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The most disturbing feature of our national situation is that incomes per head of persons engaged in agricultural occupations is rising less rapidly than in non-agricultural occupations.  This disparity, which has been a cause of concern for many years past, is tending to widen rather than to narrow.  That is the main justification for further substantial measures of agricultural price supports and subsidisation.  Farmers cannot get regulated and uniform increases in their incomes like wage earners.  We think it reasonable to ask the rest of the community to accept some burden of taxation to enable farmers to acquire a better share in the improving national circumstances, even if full equality of incomes is not yet possible.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances of this country the gap between farm and urban incomes cannot be closed by Government action or Government subventions alone.  The proportion of our population engaged in agriculture is too great and the resources of the rest of the community too limited to permit of it.  In other European countries the industrial sector is relatively much stronger and the agricultural sector much smaller, which enables them to adopt policies of agricultural income support which are not feasible here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As our industrial sector grows in strength, the possibility of giving a greater measure of assistance to agriculture will grow with it, if it should continue to be needed.  The improvement of agricultural incomes must come, in the main, from market prices. <Col N="1783" /> Because higher agricultural output must almost entirely be exported, this improvement must depend on better international regulation of trade in agricultural products.  The prospect of this happening under the forthcoming GATT negotiations, or by our participation in the European Economic Community, are still uncertain. The Minister for Finance yesterday made known our decision to revive our application for GATT membership.  What the outcome of these negotiations will be is still not known. The conflict between the GATT and the existing trade agreements which we have with Great Britain is obvious. The GATT restrictions do not apply to existing preferences but they would apply to any new preferences.  These are the matters we are going to negotiate about.</P>
    <P>There may be possibilities of improving the net incomes of farmers through the development of co-operation and the initiation of better marketing systems for agricultural goods, and all these are being examined.</P>
    <P>In programming a 2.7 per cent annual increase in agricultural output the Government were setting forth a view as to what was practicable and probable rather than what is desirable. There is no doubt that Irish agricultural potential would permit of a much more rapid rate of expansion, if market openings could be assured for the higher output.  There is, of course, no thought of limiting the growth of agricultural output to this figure, if further possibilities for its extension should present themselves.  The assumption underlying the recent document published by the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association that the rate of growth of agricultural output can be determined by our own decision, regardless of external market conditions, is unrealistic in the extreme.  In respect of international trade in agricultural products, most predictions have the habit of proving very inaccurate.  In respect of milk products, of meats and of sugar, there have been recent changes which were not foreseen, affecting both the volume of demand and the prevailing level of prices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1784" /> There is no reason for pessimism regarding world needs for the kinds of foodstuffs that are produced in this country.  In recent months we have had many discussions with the British at ministerial and official levels in respect of agricultural markets and agricultural marketing arrangements in that country, both arising out of the new British policy of market regulation and sharing and the wider prospects of a more fundamental change in our trade relations.  These discussions have on the whole been fruitful, although their outcome was not uniformly satisfactory from our point of view.  In respect of the wider proposals for a new trading relationship, the imminence of the general election in Great Britain and the political circumstances prevailing there seem to be impeding our desire to bring the discussions to early finality.</P>
    <P>The Budget also makes provision for increased social welfare payments. It is our boast that some improvement in the social welfare benefits in force has been effected by this Government in each year in which it was in office since 1957.  These increases were individually not spectacular in any year but they have amounted in the aggregate to a substantial improvement.  Most people would wish to see greater improvements in these payments than it is possible to effect&mdash; even Deputies opposite who yesterday voted against the provision of money to enable any increase to be achieved.</P>
    <P>Again, it is, perhaps, necessary to remind Deputy Dillon that his newfound interest in the wellbeing of the social welfare classes does not seem very convincing against the light of the record of his Government.  During the whole of the three years of the Coalition Government when he was an important Minister in it and Deputy Corish was Minister for Social Welfare, there was one increase, one single increase.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about social insurance arrangements.  The range and magnitude of our social insurance benefits are determined mainly by the size of the contributions paid by workers and their employers, although in this country the Government pay a much larger proportion of the benefits than is the case in other European countries and more than double the proportion paid in Great Britain.  The rates of contribution and of benefits were increased in January last.  As Deputies are aware, aspects of our social insurance arrangements which may result in an expansion of their scope and their cost, are under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;And their cost.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how you can expand them otherwise than by increasing the cost.  The Deputy ought to have a bit of sense once in a while.  In these matters the Minister for Social Welfare consults with the representatives of employers and of workers and generally tries to proceed by agreement while maintaining the contribution principle, which is the outstanding characteristic of these social insurance arrangements.  While fresh legislation is not contemplated in this year, we must envisage further changes in the future and the progressive improvement of these services and the progressive expansion of the individual contributions.</P>
      <P>Deputies profess to be worried about prices.  I do not know if any of them thought it would be possible to bring about an all-round increase of 12 per cent in wages and salaries without some upward movement of prices.  If they thought that, they were the only people in the country who did.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite that.  If the Deputy would listen for a few minutes, he would be a little wiser. Between the first quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, the general price level here increased by three per cent, as revealed by the Consumer Price Index Number.  Deputies <Col N="1787" /> who pretend to be perturbed about the rise in food prices might have studied these figures a little more closely and they would have found that between these two periods there was little change in the overall level of food prices.  The index for the food group changed from 126.1 in January 1963, to 126.7 in January, 1964.  As I have said, the likelihood is that the impact of higher wages and salaries on prices in this year must cause prices to rise in some degree.  It may be that there will be a rise in prices by 4 per cent or thereabouts.  An increase of that dimension may be expected&mdash;due to higher internal costs.  I expect that adjustment of prices, where necessary through higher costs, to the extent that it has not already been done will be completed within a couple of months. Then we can expect a period of price stability for, perhaps, two years or even longer if import prices remain stable.</P>
      <P>Once again it appears necessary to re-state some elementary principles in this matter.  When national production is rising at an average annual rate of 4 per cent this is the maximum rate at which incomes can increase in real terms.  If nominal incomes rise faster than that prices will certainly move up to confine the real gain in incomes to what higher national production can support.  This is a mathematical certainty.  When this national wage agreement was being negotiated I expressed the view of which Labour Party Deputies have since reminded me that an increase of 8 per cent or 9 per cent over a two-year period was the increase that in my opinion, and in the opinion of the expert advisers of the Government, was possible without adverse effect on the cost of living or national development prospects.  The argument I am now making is that if that national agreement had provided for increases of that size the workers would be as well off as they are now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible for us by any arrangement of wages or salaries to make ourselves better off than we are and if we push nominal wages and salaries above the level that national <Col N="1788" /> production can support, prices will rise to defeat that possibility.  In our circumstances and under our democratic methods sound national policy depends upon an understanding of economic realities by all workers and by all managers and on the determination of the Government to let economic realities guide their decisions.  A function of the Government is to give advice on these matters whether the advice is taken or not.  We have also another function, which I am now exercising, of spelling out the consequences of the actions taken.</P>
    <P>There was an agreement for 12 per cent and I said here at the time that it would be worth while paying some premium, over and above the average increase which the expansion of national production could support without adverse consequences, in order to initiate a new and better system of wage adjustment which we hoped would be retained in the future. Because of the undertaking which I gave in the communication which I addressed to the Federated Union of employers and to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions the Government honoured that 12 per cent national agreement in respect of all the people in its own employment.  The point, however, is that we must as a nation recognise, whatever political people may want to suggest, that these higher wages are being paid out in advance of the increase in national production and the improvement in national productivity which should make them possible.</P>
    <P>The gap which we referred to in the White Paper published in January, 1963, has reappeared although it should close again before the agreement recently negotiated has expired. There may be difficulties to be overcome before that can be achieved.  It is important to get it understood that the 12 per cent increase in wages on this occasion was exceptional and that if the rate of national economic growth averages 4 per cent per year further wage increases must be related to it.  If our economic progress proceeds, as we expect, with an average increase in total production of 4 per cent per annum, then the average <Col N="1789" /> increase in national wage agreements must be in line with that development and these further improvements in wages and salaries should be paid preferably after, rather than before, the production gains have been recorded.</P>
    <P>In the excitement of our progress we must not let our prices and costs move out of line.  If we do, our progress will stop. I have urged all our business leaders, business concerns and managements to consider and apply every possible alternative for meeting higher costs rather than price rises.  Some have already found it possible to absorb higher costs without price changes; others can do so, perhaps at the expense of employment.  Some cannot do it at all.  All can try to minimise the effect of higher costs by measures to improve productivity, that is to say, keeping unit labour costs at the lowest practicable level.</P>
    <P>In all countries and at all times the most potent force working on industrial managements to strive for maximum efficiency and productivity has been the upward pressure of wages.  I expect our trade union leaders will act wisely.  Some concerns cannot afford to carry any higher costs now and stay in business.  They must be given a chance of reorganising before new burdens are placed on them.  The preservation of their employment is of greater importance to most workers than the upward movement of their wages.  The main danger of rising prices is that the country's export capacity may be reduced.</P>

      <P>For instance, the Second Programme envisages an increase of 150 per cent in industrial exports in this decade and this can be achieved only if we produce quality for quality goods which will be competitive in price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that inflationary forces are operating elsewhere also and this may enable us to maintain relative competitiveness <Col N="1790" /> even in marginal industries on this occasion.  So far, at any rate, there has been no sign of any loss of confidence among our manufacturers in their ability to maintain or to expand their exports in this year. Everywhere, in this country as in all countries, the union leaders are now understanding that the only sure and permanent basis for higher wages is higher productivity and are actively co-operating in plans to propagate this doctrine.</P>
    <P>In the era of freer trade into which this country is moving whether we like it or not, we must achieve a steady improvement in productivity, that is to say, in the output of goods per person employed, higher than in the countries with which we expect to trade until equality has been accomplished.  This means an annual improvement in productivity of at least 3 per cent per annum.  The output of goods must grow more rapidly than employment to this degree.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government can have no more effectiveness than the public understanding and support it receives.  I have tried in this speech to deal with the main aspect of the policy of the Government arising in connection with the Budget.  Economic recovery has been achieved and the continuation of the country's progress can be forecast with confidence.  Levels of output are unprecedentedly high and still rising.  We have not done all we would have wished, and certainly not all we hope in due course to accomplish.  The foundation and framework for future development have been built.</P>
    <P>The advances of recent years are sometimes taken so much for granted that their importance is under-rated. Nothing is so secure that it cannot be lost again.  The world's economic environment is constantly changing, and we must always be prepared to adapt our policies to it, and to ride the winds of change, no matter whence they may blow.  Failure to do so would involve heavy economic penalties.  The prosperity of a small nation is never a static situation but the outcome of a continuous struggle. We must always be prepared to try <Col N="1791" /> out new ideas, to seek new roads on which to advance, to accept no setback as final and no victory as adequate.  Our knowledge of our national problems is continually increasing, and also our understanding of the means of minimising or overcoming them.  The most futile person is he who asks the petulant question: &ldquo;Why was this not done long ago?&rdquo; Many things are possible for us to-day which were never possible before, and there are many ideas, born of our own experience or the experience of others, which were not known before.</P>
    <P>The practice of consultation with the organisations which are representative of important economic interests has been a most fruitful source of good and new ideas, whether or not agreement on all possibilities, or even complete harmony of viewpoints, was found.  We have found that consultation most fruitful when focussed on specific problems, less so when general aims are being defined, because no sectional organisation can look at national problems objectively and comprehensively.  Only the Government can achieve a balance between national resources and the often conflicting desires of every section, and take the decisions which determine the rate of economic or social progress and keep the country moving in line on a common front.  As President Kennedy said: &ldquo;A rising tide lifts all the boats.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While our aims are fixed and constant, we intend to go towards their realisation pragmatically and flexibly, trying so far as possible to bring all sectional organisations and sectional interests along with us but, in the last resort, taking full and final responsibility for our own decisions.  We have tried to keep to a realistic and down-to-earth interpretation of national policy and, when decisions are taken and announced, to apply them vigorously and completely.  That is our conception of good government.  That is what, in all modesty, we claim we are now giving to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <P>I certainly have some admiration for the Taoiseach's audacity when he tries to convince us <Col N="1792" /> as well as his own backbenchers, who clapped so much, that he means what he says.  It is amazing.  I am not surprised that the country is in the condition in which we find it.  The Taoiseach has given expression to several principles to which we can all subscribe.  In Gormanston, he made a speech on christian social teaching that St. Thomas Aquinas could have made, but when it comes to practice, it is a very different thing.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach says we must adapt our policies to the changing circumstances of national and world trends, does he mean to assert that no one has the right to change his mind or his policy except Fianna Fáil?  Is that the prerogative of Fianna Fáil?  If we suggest changing a policy from yesterday to today because of changed circumstances, we are immediately pilloried and told: &ldquo;That is not what you said last week; that is not what you said six months ago.&rdquo;  We are reminded of some point that suits the Fianna Fáil political trend at the time. Of course there is neither sense nor reason in that.  We might as well challenge Fianna Fáil for changing their policy from time to time.  Of course they change their policy.  If they did not, they would be static and there is no place for that type of person in any country.  We must adapt ourselves to the circumstances in which we find ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position in which we find ourselves today?  The greatest burden of taxation that has ever been imposed in the history of the country is being imposed in a most hypocritical and dishonest way.  When the Minister got up yesterday to introduce his Budget, we expected that it would be the national Budget of an Irish Government dealing with all the moneys coming into the Exchequer for the coming year.  Out of a clear blue sky, he said he would not deal with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, as if they were an extern body. From the manner in which these two Budgets were introduced, one would think the revenue of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs does not come into the Exchequer and is not taken into account.  Of course it is part of <Col N="1793" /> the national Exchequer receipts and expenditure.  When the Government introduce two Budgets on the one day, I think it is the lowest trick possible.</P>

      <P>We introduced levies to bring in £3 million for capital expenditure, not for Supply Services, and we have never been allowed to forget it from that day to this, but Fianna Fáil can bring in taxation of £24 million without any question at all for Supply Services, not capital expenditure.  I shall deal with their capital Budget in a moment.  I am now talking of their day-to-day expenditure.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach blandly said that in three years the inter-Party Government did not give any increase to social welfare recipients, he did so with his tongue in his cheek.  We did give the increases.  But we did more than that.  We kept the £9 million worth of food subsidies in operation.  When Fianna Fáil took those off, they could have given the old age pensioners and all the social welfare recipients a rise of 22/6d. a week if they had wanted to because that is what they took from them.  They could have increased the whole social welfare payments then by no less than 22/6d. a week but they did not.  They gave them 2/6d. again. They are great with halfcrowns.  They seem to have a sort of affection for the halfcrown.  They did not like the crown, I suppose, and the halfcrown does: we shall leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thing that strikes me about this Budget is its similarity to the British Budget.  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer set out to reduce spending. He set out to stop the spending spree. He set out to reduce the spending power of the people by imposing the £100 million additional taxation and he had the courage to say that that was what he was doing.  It may not be good politics for him to say it&mdash;I do not know whether it is or not&mdash;but at least he told the people what he was doing.  Fianna Fáil increased taxation with the same objective&mdash;remember, it <Col N="1794" /> is to reduce the purchasing power of the people&mdash;but they have not the courage to say it.  They will take it in and the reason I assert that is this. There is no doubt about it any Government with a Budget today of over £200 million estimated expenditure for the ensuing year could not say that there would be over-estimation by at least 5 per cent&mdash;and 5 per cent on £200 million, 1/- in the £, means £10 million.</P>
    <P>There is no over-estimation this year.  There is no £2 million or £3 million, even.  It was £2 million or £3 million in the last Budget but, this year, there is none.  What does that mean, exactly?  It means, as far as Supply Services are concerned, that the Minister for Finance has abdicated. He is saying to every Government Department: &ldquo;Spend, boys, as much as you like.  There is no restriction. You may spend everything in that Book of Estimates and you can fire away.  I shall not control you.&rdquo;  Thereby, he is failing to carry out the duties which are assigned to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It is part of the duties of the Minister for Finance of any Government, and here, in particular, because of our peculiar circumstances, to carry out the financing of the country in the very same way as a first-class mother of a household would do in the running of the household.  She is not to give all the children the right to say: &ldquo;We shall spend what we like&rdquo; because, if she does, there is trouble.  There is no point in labouring the matter further but they will take that £10 million from the people which, in my opinion, they do not want.  At least, if it is not £10 million, it is £3 million.  On £160 million the year before last, it was £3½ million for over-estimation.  Last year it was £3 million.  This year, there is not a shilling.  There is the most accurate calculation ever done by Departments&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a word of truth in it.  I will bet a halfpenny to a hayseed that if there is a single Department that could not and <Col N="1795" /> would not save more than a half per cent of their Estimate, they could not spend it: it could not be done.  Therefore, the implication is clear that the Government are not satisfied and are not happy with the expenditure that has taken place.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach waved aside the balance of payments problem.  Then, in a suave way, he said that Deputy Dillon had a figment in his mind as to where the inflow of capital was coming from.  Take your own book&mdash;<i>Economic Statistics</i>&mdash;page 4.  You say:</P>
      <P>There was a net inflow in 1963 of about £0.7 million in respect of the sale of securities by private holders. Share capital from abroad received by companies amounted to £3.2 million.  Payments in respect of life insurance are estimated at £2.0 million and withdrawals from the British Post Office Savings Bank and British Saving Certificates amounted to about £0.6 million.  The net inflow in respect of other capital transactions amounted to £24.2 million. This item contains a number of constituents, the principal being extern subscriptions to issues of the central government and public corporations&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;in other words people thinking it is safe to invest money here from outside the State&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;direct investments by extern companies in their branches and subsidiaries in the State, net changes in bank deposits within the State of extern customers, net change in Irish bank acceptances discounted in London, changes in external indebtedness and loan capital, stock exchange transactions through external brokers, purchases of buildings and land by externs and revaluation of external securities held by the banking system.</P>
      <P>They are the sale of the land and buildings.  It is alleged it is only a figment in our mind.  What is this figment, then?  Are we again paying for the production of figments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we to take it that these statistics are to be read only provided they suit the Fianna Fáil argument?  Are we to take it that they have no value <Col N="1796" /> whatever if they are utilised to show that what Fianna Fáil and the Government are asserting is wrong?  I recall the truculent way in which the Taoiseach said across the floor of the House to Deputy Dillon, the Leader of the Opposition, that he had this phobia, that he did not know what he was talking about.  There is no doubt about it, everybody knows that, notwithstanding the number who have left it, the Irish people still love the land of Ireland. When large tracts are bought up by some people who are not citizens of the State, it can create situations which I should not like even to mention.  The Government should take very careful note of that matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Capital Budget, may I comment again on the way the Taoiseach asked: &ldquo;Are you opposed to capital expenditure on housing?&rdquo; Of course, we are not.  What we complain of is that the Government have failed in their housing programme over the past six years.  Housing is always a sound capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>He asked if we were opposed to capital expenditure on schools.  Of course, we are not.  Are not the rural schools a public scandal?  They are outdated and outmoded.  Half the rural schools have no proper sanitary arrangements, no proper heating, or anything like that.  No matter what money is required, this Party, and I am sure the Labour Party, and, indeed the Fianna Fáil Party, too, are prepared to go ahead with the programme. Nobody is opposed to it.  From the way the Taoiseach spoke and from the way he propounded his questions, one would think we were opposed to all this.</P>
    <P>We are not opposed to arterial drainage.  The only complaint we have is that it is not going fast enough.  We initiated the Land Project and the only complaint we have about that is that it is not going fast enough.  It is held up because of two factors: arterial drainage is not being done quickly enough to take the water off when it is let go under the Farm Improvements Scheme and the Land Project; the other is the elimination of that part of the Land Project under which the State did the work and the farmer repaid his share of the cost through <Col N="1797" /> the medium of his land annuity.  That has actually held up the reclamation of land.  It is a pity.</P>
    <P>The Government say they want to increase agricultural production by at least 2½ per cent per annum.  They would like a bigger increase.  The increase would come if only they would make the land available to the people. Reclaimed land brought into production is stated to be 1,500,000 acres since the introduction of the Land Project in 1948.  It could be 2,000,000 acres if Section B were continued.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that the proportion of our taxation to public expenditure was around 20 per cent. The figures show that for the Supply Services and other services national taxation is in the region of something over 27 per cent.  The Taoiseach brushes that aside and quite blandly states that this Budget will be described as a farmers' Budget.</P>
    <P>Out of the huge amount of increased taxation, agriculture will get approximately £5 millions.  There will be 2d. on the gallon of milk and a reduction in rates on agricultural land; the astonishing thing is that the Minister for Finance stated yesterday that it was a reduction to the 1957 level. Again, that is only half the truth. What he really meant was that the rates will be brought back to the 1957 level.  He forgot that there is no reduction of rates on farmhouses and out-offices.  The full rates have to be paid on these.</P>
    <P>In 1933, a small farmer in Longford paid 4/6 in the £ on his valuation of £5 on his house.  To-day the rate is 60/9; on the £5 valuation, he has to pay £15 now in rates.  Because of the relief of rates, he has to pay a much lower rate on his ten-acre or 15-acre holding.  No matter what anyone says, the increase in rates is still an intolerable burden on the small farmer.  No reduction in rates on agricultural land is of any benefit to him whatever.  The average valuation in north Longford is under £5 and the greatest incidence of that £5 valuation falls on the house. There is no reduction there.</P>
    <P>Yet the Minister blandly says that rates are being brought back to the 1957 level.  That will probably be true <Col N="1798" /> of any scheme he introduces but there will be no compensation for the increased valuation on the house. Many houses have been reconstructed through the medium of grants by the Department of Local Government and by the county councils.  No sooner is a house reconstructed than the valuation is increased.  The valuation of a small cottage to which one small room was added was increased by the colossal figure of £6.  The owner appealed and the Commissioners brought it down to £3.  That means that man must pay £9 extra in rates merely because he added a small room to his house seven or eight years ago. There is no reason in that.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on to say that we had a sound economic position.  I cannot see how he can convince himself and his Party of that when the policy of the Government over the past five or six years has resulted in 70,000 fewer people in employment. There are 70,000 potential heads of families who should be producers of wealth here producing wealth elsewhere.  The smaller number in employment at home are forced to bear the burden of increased taxation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that an extra £5 million was being spent on education.  With taxation running at over £200 million, on what would we spend it if we did not spend it on education? The sum spent on education is out of all proportion to the total amount levied in taxation.  With taxation increased to such an extent this year, education should have received a much higher amount.  Much of the increase for education is in respect of teachers' salaries.  That will not be of any great assistance to the pupils.  It may mean that the teachers will not be so cross with them.  It may get the teachers out of financial difficulties and, therefore, allow them devote more time to their pupils.  But there is no great increase for improving the facilities for the pupils.</P>
    <P>I was never happy about the figure for unemployment.  I believe it has been fallacious from the beginning.  In my opinion, a large number of people are registered as unemployed who are not employable.  However, the standard <Col N="1799" /> has been set.  Today, although 70,000 fewer people are in employment and are gone out of the country, we have a figure of 60,000 unemployed.  That makes the Taoiseach's assertion that industrial production has increased by four per cent a very doubtful one.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that this country is not like Britain and some continental countries where industry is the big end and agriculture the small end of the economy.  In this country agriculture is the big end.  Therefore, it is important that those engaged in agriculture should have an opportunity of increasing their production and, above all, an opportunity of marketing what they produce.  I have heard complaints from farmers that the marketing boards for the sale of agricultural produce here are not similar to those in other countries which are constituted mainly of the farmers themselves.  I know that the NFA have asked that these marketing boards be manned by members of the agricultural community.  If they want that, why not give it to them?  I do not care how good the civil servant or politician may be who is put on these boards, when his livelihood does not depend on agriculture he has not the same interest in it.  The agriculturalists have not confidence in these boards, and when there is a lack of confidence you do not get the co-operation that should be got.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach emphasised that the Government believed in private enterprise.  He said this was a country in which the State intervened when required and in which private enterprise was regarded as the mainstay.  I am glad to hear him repeat that.  I feel that a great number of our industrialists believe that, although they represent privately-owned concerns, they must know-tow to the powers that be in Industry and Commerce and, I regret to say, in Mount Street.  They have not confidence in themselves.</P>

      <P>If I could get them, I would like to have them; but I did not get them and never did.  I met business men who complained of this, that and the other.  I asked them: &ldquo;Why do you not say this to the Fianna Fáil club you are in or to the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  What is the use of talking to me when I am out?  Go and talk to those who are in.&rdquo;  They say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach went on to say that the economy was buoyant, that everything was going well.  At the same time there is uncertainty as to what taxation will be imposed overnight.  I have no hesitation in saying it was a ghastly mistake for Fianna Fáil, in the first instance, to bring in their second Budget in 1947.  The Minister for Finance in the inter-Party Government made a mistake when he imposed the £3 million tariffs for capital expenditure, and this Government have now made a mistake by introducing two Budgets on the one day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How does the industrialist know what will happen next?  Will the Minister for Industry and Commerce bring in a number of tariffs next week or will he take them off?  The Taoiseach talks about stability but the industrial community are very unsettled and do not know where they stand with the Government today.  It would appear tariffs are being removed but consultation between industrialists and the Government is very meagre.  Industrialists complain that the employment of their employees is placed in jeopardy.  Along with unsettled conditions we get this colossal double Budget.  People in industry transporting goods will have <Col N="1801" /> to pay more for their petrol and diesel oil.  The young and the old who smoke cigarettes will have to pay 3d. a packet extra for them.  All that has been done in spite of the fact that the Government was quite clear this time last year that these taxes could not be imposed, that we have reached saturation point and that that was the reason they were bringing in the turnover tax.  They complained that when you voted against the turnover tax you voted against the increase in old age pensions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>But you did not give them anything like the proceeds of that tax.  Now the Government and the Minister for Finance, without a blush, bring in a demand for £209 million in respect of total supply Services. Added to that is £4,500,000 for agriculture, £730,000 for social welfare and £140,000 for public service pensioners.  I suppose the fellow with a military service pension of £12 10s. who gets a five per cent increase will cheer.  He certainly will not buy many packets of cigarettes with it.  However, for small things we must be grateful.</P>
      <P>There will be at least £10 million collected&mdash;I believe it will be much more&mdash;on the turnover tax.  Then there will be the additional taxes upon cigarettes, tobacco and so on, and then the buoyancy of the revenue.  I do not know how the Minister calculates that but I take it the Revenue Commissioners and himself have some solid grounds on which to base it.  However, taking the figure for over-estimation at even 2½ per cent, the Minister could have given a greater increase in social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>As regards capital expenditure, there is no doubt that when a Government embark on building projects, the installation of plant and machinery, and so forth, they are creating valuable assets. Let me take Bord na Móna and the briquette factory and let me remind the Minister that the inter-Party Government did much for that.</P>

The point I want to make is that in establishing factories such as that, in promoting the Shannon Scheme, the Carlow beet factory or anything like that, we have created valuable assets.  When somebody says to me the National Debt is £x, I ask him: &ldquo;Have you calculated what the assets are against that?&rdquo; Any businessman will do that.  He will calculate the assets he has against his liabilities. It is now admitted that if the Shannon Scheme, which cost £10 million, were on the market today it would realise a much greater sum than that.</P>

There is nobody who will deny that to do that adequately will cost a very large sum.

      <P>Not even decent Jack Lynch, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, would do that.  It would be put across as a purely Fianna Fáil idea and we would not get any credit for it.  They got the people of Ireland to reject our proposals several times but the reason so many people in Kildare rejected our relief of rates plan beats me.  Perhaps I should complain that our publicity was not successful and that, like Fianna Fáil, we should appoint a publicity agent to get it across, although they have three papers with which to do it.  We have that plan; we know we can do it.  The Government asks how, but let them find out.  We will do it and that is not a half-promise.</P>

    <P>This Budget is a mistake by Fianna Fáil.  They are going to extract substantial amounts from the working people through the tax on cigarettes, petrol and beer.  They have taxed all the essential things, food, fuel and clothing with the turnover tax.  They have taken away the subsidies and when you add all these things together, we have to ask ourselves what they do with the money.  If <Col N="1804" /> we had not the Book of Estimates which shows how it is spent, one could not imagine how they could do away with so much money in so short a time.</P>

The Opposition and this side of the House are fairly even and surely the Opposition do not deny us an opportunity to speak if we offer to do so.  I was interested in the concluding remarks of Deputy MacEoin that the cause of the failure of the Opposition candidates in the two by-elections was that we had a better publicity officer than they had and that the people did not believe that Fine Gael had a plan for the relief of rates.  I do not know the details of that plan but the people were asked to believe that benefits could accrue to them at a cost of £80 million extra without any increase in taxation.  At the same time, they were told that the Opposition propose to abolish the turnover tax which has meant an increase in revenue of £14 million.  The difference to be found by Fine Gael was £100 million and at the same time, they propose to run the country at the rate of progress to which the people are accustomed. The people did not believe that and that is one of the main causes why Fine Gael failed to convince the electorate in Kildare and Cork city.  I am not going to rub salt in the recent by-election wounds.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1805" /> This Budget, even taken by itself, is a good one.  It can stand on its own as a solid contribution to our economic progress but in order to appreciate any Budget, it is necessary to take it in conjunction with preceding Budgets by the same Government and, in this case, with both <i>Programmes for Economic Expansion</i>....  The First Programme was introduced at a time when there was a grave recession in the economic position.  That recession started in 1956, in the middle of the second term of the last Coalition Government.  The production rate was not fast enough.  The increase in economic progress was only one per cent and in many respects we were losing ground.  There was large scale emigration which, as Deputies opposite know, ran at something like 40,000 a year and that was accompanied by a very high level of unemployment.  In fact, the unemployment figures reached some 95,000 to 96,000 in the winter weeks of 1956 and 1957, that is, at the end of 1956 and the beginning of 1957.</P>
    <P>It was little wonder then that there was despondency throughout the country and that doubts prevailed as to the capacity of the country to make any solid or regular progress at all. Public confidence was at such a low ebb that it was obviously necessary for somebody, and particularly for the Government, to re-define the national objectives.  This was done in a very realistic way through the medium of the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion.</i>  That programme, as we all know, set out a number of attainable targets, some of which were surpassed. In the main, however, the programme involved the elimination of wasteful capital expenditure and it was laid down, and has since been strictly adhered to as a principle, that henceforth any capital moneys raised must be for true capital expenditure and must be capable of creating new wealth in the country.  The capital expenditure since then has fulfilled the obligations of that principle.  Then, there was the necessity for a sound budgeting policy to ensure that rather than budget deliberately for a deficit that in future in order to curb inflationary trends, we should budget <Col N="1806" /> at least to balance the account, if not for a surplus.  In many years in the intervening period, that has been achieved as well.  In short, what the people wanted was an overall financial and capital programme in which they could have confidence.</P>
    <P>The success of the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> evoked the confidence of the people and that was mainly responsible for its success.  The annual growth rate of two per cent envisaged in the first programme was more than doubled from two per cent to four and a half per cent, which represented almost five times as great a growth rate as existed in the period before the programme was undertaken.  In the four years up to 1962 the gross national product had increased by 18½ per cent and in every individual sector of our economic activity there was significant, and in many cases spectacular, progress.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has dealt, as far as I listened to him, with the main features of the Budget and dealt in some detail with some aspects of it and the economic advantages that are expected to flow from it.  I propose to deal in the main with the effects of the Budget and of the Government's policy on the creation of industrial employment.  It is accepted that in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> the achievement of the growth rates involved will depend to a considerable extent on the attainment of the industrial targets set out, the attainment of new industrial jobs and the Government's policies designed to achieve that purpose.  The volume of production in manufacturing industries has increased by about 50 per cent during the tenure of office of this Government.  In 1956 the volume index stood at 103.6.  It dropped to 102.5 in 1957, an indication of the downhill trend that had started in the middle of the period of the Coalition Government.  That has since increased substantially to an estimated 151.9 in 1963.  There is the 50 per cent increase to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>The average number of persons engaged in industry has risen from 141,000 in 1957 to 167,000 in 1963. It can be said, therefore, that some <Col N="1807" /> 26,000 new jobs have been created in industry since 1957.  The rate of increase in the numbers at work in industry has, through the greater productivity, been exceeded by the rate of expansion of output so that it has been possible, apart from the increase in the number of those at work, for those at work to achieve higher earnings in real terms in these years.  In 1963 the rate of industrial expansion was 6½ per cent over 1962.  That varied as between the first and second half of the year. It was about five per cent in the first half and eight per cent in the second but there was an overall increase of 6½ per cent.</P>
    <P>This achievement reflects the increased efficiency of all our firms and in particular some of the older firms. In the six years 1958 to 1963, there were 226 new industrial enterprises. These enterprises were those in which the capital involved exceeded in each case £10,000 and were either new enterprises or expansions of existing ones.  The estimated capital in these industries is about £50 million and the employment is estimated to range from 14,000 initially to 28,000 when these new industries are in full production. There was, of course, the usual complement of industries established, amongst the number of 226, with either whole or partial foreign investment.  These foreign investments in our industries have, of course, been attracted by the generous incentives provided by the State together with&mdash; and this is important&mdash;the favourable conditions for development which prudent Government policies have brought about.</P>
    <P>These results, which are on a scale that has not been experienced before this in the country, have merited favourable comment from abroad and in particular from such an objective and responsible source as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  I do not think anybody will deny that the progress made in the development of new or extended industries has been made possible, in a large part at any rate, by the practical aids which the Government <Col N="1808" /> have been able to give industry in the past seven years or so.</P>
    <P>I am not confining it to these seven years because Government aids had started as far back as 1952 when the first Undeveloped Areas Act was passed, but as a result of the Undeveloped Areas Act and the Industrial Grants Act, by 31st March 1964, the total amount of grants approved by An Foras Tionscal was £17.9 millions, say, £18 million, of which a total of £8.7 million were paid.  Increased funds have been made available to the Industrial Development Authority to stimulate its campaign for the attraction of industry from abroad.  Nevertheless, the Government are paying particular attention to the need to equip our native industries, our traditional industries, our long-established industries, for conditions of freer trade.  For example, the increase of £1,715,000 in the Estimates provision for An Foras Tionscal for 1964-65 over the provision for the previous year arises from the need to make payment of grants which have been approved for the enlargement and adaptation of existing industrial undertakings to meet conditions of freer trade.</P>
    <P>As well as these, the technical assistance grants which are administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce have been substantially increased both in scope, that is, the scope of the undertakings that can benefit from it, and in size of grants. This scheme now provides for the giving of grants of some 50 per cent of the cost of various schemes designed to promote efficiency in industry.</P>
    <P>On the industrial side these achievements reflect the success of the Government's policy for industrial expansion.  Exports of industrial goods have more than doubled in this period of seven years and, in case some people would like to believe otherwise, I can quote from the official statistics that the value of the overall exports increased from £131 million in 1957 to £196 million in 1963 and the volume of exports, apart from the value, increased by some 40 per cent in the same period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1809" /> Latterly we have been hearing complaints about the difficulty that some people have in maintaining their standard of living and complaints about a falling off in retail business.  The figures give the lie to these complaints and prove that the contrary is the case. The average index of weekly retail sales has increased by some ten per cent between February, 1963 and February, 1964.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <P>It is performances like these that give confidence that the targets set out in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> can be achieved, targets such as the creation of 86,000 new industrial jobs which, when allowance is made for an inevitable falling off in the number engaged in agricultural employment, will result in a net number of 78,000 more people in employment of all kinds at the end of the decade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that the provisions being made through the medium of the Book of Estimates are showing these results and people are happy about it.  People are earning money and enjoying a higher standard of living now than ever they did in their lives.  That is true in particular of the people living in the towns and <Col N="1810" /> cities.  But, while all this achievement has led to improved spending power and an increased standard of living, the urban people realise that their incomes have, in fact, outstripped the incomes of the rural community and I believe that there is complete understanding of the budgetary proposals that make provision for improving the lot of the agricultural community, even though it means 3d. more on 20 cigarettes&mdash;and in this respect the rural community pay as well as the city people&mdash;even though it means 1d. more on the pint and 3d. on the gallon of petrol.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, I should like to say in this connection that the 2d. extra on the gallon of milk which these new taxes will help to provide will not mean an increase in the price of the pound of butter.  The 2d. will be provided by way of subsidy and it has the dual intention of, first of all, improving the income of the farmer and, secondly, ensuring that the price of a pound of butter to the farmer and to the city dweller will not increase, the intention being, of course, that we maintain here the very high level of public consumption, which is good not only for the health of our economy but for the health of our bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just dealt with butter.  Since I have referred to comments in newspapers about the side effects of the Budget, may I say that I saw a comment to the effect that the increase of threepence a gallon will increase what is already the highest price of petrol in Europe still further.  Having read that, I took the trouble to consult the Automobile Association's publication in this respect and I extracted figures for European countries, excluding Iron Curtain countries.  The price of the gallon of petrol here will be about the <Col N="1811" /> same as, or slightly less than, the price in about 50 per cent of these European countries.  If I take only premium grades and omit no West European country, I will give the House an indication of the truth of what I am saying.  In Austria, the price of premium petrol is 4/7; in Belgium, 5/4; in Denmark, 5/-; Finland, 5/6; France, 6/10; West Germany, 5/2; Greece, 5/6; Norway, 4/11.</P>
      <P>There is a comparatively low price of 4/5 mentioned in the case of Italy but I think that takes into account some form of tourist subsidy.  I am not sure about that but my experience of the price of petrol in Italy was that it was much higher than the figures shown in the AA returns.</P>

      <P>For the Deputy's information, most of these countries have much larger populations than Ireland.

      <P>In the notes I have had prepared, I intended dealing with Deputy Dillon's criticism of the improvement in social welfare benefits, but the Taoiseach has dealt adequately with it.  He pointed out that in the last period of Coalition Government, between 1954 and 1957, there was an increase of only one 2/6d. given to each of two groups&mdash;noncontributory old age pensioners, the only category existing then, and non-contributory widows&mdash;whereas every year since this Government came into office, there have been modest increases.  Taken over all, these increases represent a reasonably significant sum to those less well off sections of the community.</P>
      <P>I should like to go back to what Deputy MacEoin said about this Government's failure in certain capital undertakings.  In particular, he mentions schools.  I happen to know a little of the performance of his Government on that matter, since I succeeded a Fine Gael Minister for Education in that Department.  Within two years of my going to the Department, the rate of building of national schools had more than doubled.  I should like to remind Deputies opposite that it fell to me to restore the ten per cent cut in capitation grants for secondary schools for which the Coalition Government were responsible.  It is therefore difficult to reconcile their actions in the field of education with their criticism now of the rate of growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I touched on a few aspects of our economic endeavour in recent years, with special reference to the advance in our industrial sector.  Deputy Dillon has described this Government as a <Col N="1813" /> gambler's Government.  My only comment on that is I would far prefer to be a member of a gambler's Government, with their solid record of achievement behind them, than of the Government of which he was a member between 1954 and 1957, a Government which were so reactionary that our economy, instead of advancing as it should have done in those years, was steadily going downhill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we come to speak on a Budget and of budgeting for any particular section, be it on a national or local basis, it is the duty of the Minister introducing the Budget to give us an economic survey of the whole situation.  When the Minister for Finance introduced the Budget yesterday, the survey he gave was confined to two or three miserable pages, reminding us of the old song: &ldquo;How can I sing when my land is in danger.&rdquo;  The Minister failed completely to give us a survey of the country's economy during the past 12 months, at the moment and the prospects for the coming 12 months.</P>
      <P>We have been given some figures by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to industrial expansion, but there is one glaring omission.  He has not told us whether the employment was male or female, whether it was juvenile or adult.  From what I know of the Government's industrial expansion policy, there are two aspects neglected&mdash;adult employment and male employment.  In the city where I come from, young girls leave their homes at 5 o'clock in the morning to be carried out to an industrial estate, there to work for miserable pittances.  If they form part of the employment figures the Minister has given us, if that is his idea of economic and industrial expansion, it is not ours.  He has not referred at all to the important things; he has not told us about male and adult employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the matter of increases generally.  The Taoiseach said he had recommended to the employers and to the workers' organisations an increase of seven per cent in salaries and wages.  He said that if these increases were to be given, they <Col N="1814" /> would be followed by increased commodity prices.  Reading between the lines of his speech, it now transpires that the Taoiseach intends to allow the level of increased prices to coincide with the 12 per cent increase in incomes which, to my mind, is a further drag on the workers, particularly since they are bound to a two-year agreement.  I forecast that that agreement will very soon be broken and higher demands made because of the indolence and inefficiency of the Department of Industry and Commerce in investigating the increased prices being charged for goods.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in introducing the turnover tax said competition would keep prices down.  We pointed out that the gangs and cliques of industrialists and manufacturers would see that would not happen. How true our words have been.  In some cases the 2½ per cent has become 20 per cent, particularly in the case of foodstuffs.  If we allow that to go on, the Minister and the Government may be assured that organised workers will not be satisfied with the 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>In that regard, one very significant fact can be borne out by any member of the House who is a member of a local authority, that is, that in every local authority this year we were forced to increase rates to the extent of 4/- to 7/- in the £, by reason of the fact that the health charges and the prices we had to pay for medicines had increased, on top of the 12 per cent increase to all the staffs.  That rate is levied on unfortunate people who are at this moment crippled by the rates burden and who get no relief.  The only relief they get is the thought of the supermarkets and chain shops coming in to take over their family businesses.  The small business is being wiped out by the supermarkets and cut-price shops. While no relief is given to the small business people, on the other hand an amount is provided in other parts of the country to put back the rate to the 1956-57 figure.  We do not disagree with that but we disagree with the fact that if we are to respect the people we represent, treat them with justice and fair play, we must give them all an <Col N="1815" /> equal share of the national revenue. The balance must not be weighted in favour of one section.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the fact that this all-powerful organisation existing in the country today called the County and City Managers' Association have now come along and in my city alone &mdash;we shall have to face the problem in the next fortnight or three weeks&mdash; the manager is demanding an increase of 25 per cent and 50 per cent in differential rents in some of our schemes.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach recommended it because of our economic buoyancy and the progress we had made but he forgot those who have no one to go to for a 12 per cent increase.  He also forgot the people in temporary employment.  I refer particularly to temporary postmen.  They got no increase and are unlikely to get <Col N="1816" /> any.  Surely they deserve it as much as the highly-paid or, perhaps, overpaid civil servants.</P>
      <P>We are told five per cent is being given.  Five per cent on what?  The unfortunate CIE pensioner has 12/- a week pension.  Take five per cent of that and relate it to the price of the pint or the half-glass of whiskey and you see what the unfortunate fellow has.  Figures can be very deceptive. Five per cent of £2,500 is all right but five per cent of 12/- is very different. Yet, they must live and do their best. No provision is made for them but provision is made for the German rancher who comes here and buys the land.  He will get relief of rates.  What is the small farmer getting, the man living on the side of the road, milking six or eight cows?</P>

      <P>They will not be able to cure it because they will not have the price of a &ldquo;half-one&rdquo;.  If we are going to be fair, let us treat all our people alike.  We all know this is a farmers' Budget and that we had the ranchers' sons up after it.  It was a hard task; they paraded every town and city looking for it.  They came out like men and fought for it, and more credit to them.  But when the &ldquo;dishing out&rdquo; was to be done, consideration should have been given to the working man and the small family shopkeeper trying to exist and face an extra 4/-to 7/- in the £ on his rates.  No consideration was given to him.  We were <Col N="1817" /> told that we would get it all in social welfare.</P>
      <P>A decisive vote was taken here not so many months ago and a Deputy made a statement that he was promised these great social welfare increases and because of that, he was going to vote with the Government.  Where has his 2/6d. gone.  In 1938 terms, 2/6d. a week is worth 1½d. today Bearing in mind the devaluation of money, who is going to cry &ldquo;Alleluia&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hosanna&rdquo; for an increase of 1½d. a day.  This is what this Budget has done.  The quicker we bring these things out into the open the better. Imagine saying to any Christian today, in the country we live in, in 1964: &ldquo;There is an increase of 1½d. to you and thank God we are in power to give it to you.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now we shall move on to the 2d. a gallon.  The 2d. a gallon was got after a hard battle.  While the 2d. a gallon may mean a little to some it means very little to others The Minister for Industry and Commerce has told us that this will not affect the price of butter.  We all know what is happening the butter in the country.  The figures are there.  The consumption of butter is falling and the consumption of margarine is rapidly rising because the people cannot afford to buy butter.</P>
      <P>What will happen to the milk products?  What will happen to cheese, powdered milk and chocolate crumb? Where will the prices of all these go? What about the woman living on the side of the street whose milkman brings along five or six pints in the morning?  There is a halfpenny on each of them.  While I am not bemoaning that particular section of the people &mdash;I am congratulating them on what they are getting away with&mdash;I would point out that these are the people who are getting everything and that there is no consideration for the working man who is producing industrially and giving us an output.  He has to bear the full lash of the whip because we are now pandering to the farmers and we want to win them from Fine Gael over to Fianna Fáil.  That is as this Budget presents itself to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1818" /> There is one very significant fact in this whole question.  I am surprised that the Minister, who should have a little knowledge, made no reference whatever to the bloodstock industry. The bloodstock industry is in a very precarious position at the moment.  The Minister is well aware of it because of the representations that were made from the different sections connected with it.</P>
    <P>No reference has been made in this Budget to the bloodstock industry in this country.  For those who are closely connected with it, I want to say to the Minister that this is one of our best and foremost industries in the country today.  I will take you to the bloodstock sales at Ballsbridge or New-market or Paris.  You will see what is derived from the sale of young thoroughbred bloodstock alone.  There are over 200 people directly employed in the bloodstock industry in County Kildare at the moment in addition to those indirectly employed.  The money derived from the bloodstock industry is a matter that should have attracted the Minister's attention.  He should have applied himself as much in that direction as he did to taking the rates off people who might not be able to carry on.  There is a Vote set up by the Minister to supervise the bloodstock industry and racing generally in the country.  Men of devotion, men of sincerity, men who have made a job of racing in this country which has not been excelled in any other country in Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>Scriptum manet</i>, and I shall leave it at that.  I come now to the question of schools and the provision of money for the development of schools.  We had the Fine Gael suggestion <Col N="1819" /> and we had the Fianna Fáil comeback: &ldquo;What did you do?  When you did not do it, we shall not do it.&rdquo;  But twenty wrongs will not make one right. The schools in this country are a disgrace to any civilised country.  They are rat-infested and they are falling down.  They are without water.  They have broken windows.  They have no fireplaces.

      <P>The amount of money <i>per capita</i> to the secondary schools increased to ten per cent.  That question, which is very near to the mind and the heart of the Labour Party, has been completely neglected over all the years.  Something should be done but no provision is made. They will tell you they will give a <i>per capita</i> grant but where does the secondary <i>per capita</i> grant go?  If the Minister wants to know I shall tell him.  It does not go where it should go, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the marketing boards. These are being set up.  I am sure more boards have been set up by the present Government than you would get in the Jetland Ballroom.  There is a board for this and a board for that and nobody knows what they are doing.  They come in at 10 o'clock in <Col N="1820" /> the morning.  They go away at 12.45 p.m., come back again and away at 5 p.m.  That is what I see these people doing.  If the individuals were left to themselves to poke out their own markets it would be better.  They did it in the past.  They marketed well. They worried about it.  They went to the trouble of doing what these boards we have set up will not bother their heads about&mdash;and I am referring in particular to Bord na gCon but I shall leave that for another day.</P>
    <P>I come now to the matter of the increase on spirits.  I should like the Minister to throw his memory back to 20th June, 1963, when, on the debate on the Finance Bill, during the course of what I had to say then, I reminded him as follows, as reported at column 1422 of volume 203, No. 10, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>We are the only country in Europe to my knowledge that allows in beer or spirits without carrying a duty or tax.  Our beers are exported to other countries.  In France, they carry a 40 per cent import duty.  In Germany, it is 27.2 per cent; in Italy, it is 39 per cent.  In Switzerland, it is 4/- to the gallon, which is a fair percentage.  In Belgium it is approximately 40 per cent and in the Netherlands it is 40 per cent.  Here are we in Ireland allowing in foreign beers and spirits without a farthing tax and allowing them to compete against the products we can manufacture here in the country creating direct and indirect employment as a result.</P>
    <P>That was in June, 1963.  Yet what does the Minister do?  Every other foreign-manufactured beer, spirit and wine should have got the same hammering as the Scotch whisky got.  They are buying your barley and a lot more of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I admire the Taoiseach for his brass &mdash; that he can come in here and have the impertinence to put over the claptrap he tried to put over this evening about this wonderful expansion he and his Government brought about.  I thought that after the turnover tax we would have the Minister for Finance giving substantial reductions in taxation, but instead we find ourselves facing the biggest Budget the country ever faced. Fianna Fáil are cheering the fact that they have been able to squander so much money.  In spite of all the <i>braggadocio</i> about the turnover tax, what has emerged?  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance were warned that the turnover tax would bring about a great increase in the cost of living.  In fact, a 12 per cent increase in wages had to be given because of the turnover tax.  That meant that the extra cost of services to the Minister frittered away £14 million.  It is a pity more heed was not paid to the warnings of the Opposition this time 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was shocked by the Taoiseach's dishonest statement regarding education.  He referred to the great increase in this Budget for education and the enormous amount of money being spent.  The increase given was an increase in pay to the teachers&mdash;again brought on by the turnover tax.  What we on this side are saying is that no provision has been made for a breakthrough to higher education.  We listen to speeches by Ministers all over the country&mdash;never in this House&mdash;to packed audiences of people who will applaud them no matter what they say. These speeches tell us that we are preparing to go into Europe and that we are going ahead with this great <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> But this Budget does not say anything <Col N="1822" /> about a programme to prepare the youth of Ireland for this great breakthrough.  No provision is made to have in various centres technologists and technicians to train our youth. Where are we to find the staffs trained in modern techniques to put through this wonderful <i>Programme for Economic Expansion?</i> No sum is provided out of this excessive taxation for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach got into office on the slogan &ldquo;100,000 new jobs and £100 million&rdquo;.  He was going to produce £100 million in 1958 and create 100,000 new jobs.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;again the usual Fianna Fáil double talk&mdash;spoke about the increase in the number of people employed in industry since 1957.  He did not say anything about the overall position&mdash;that there are 17,000 fewer wage-earners than there were when Fianna Fáil came into office.  That is a Government figure contained in Table 15 of <i>Economic Statistics.</i></P>
    <P>This means that there are 70,000 fewer people bringing home a week's wages in this wonderful period of progress of which the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke.  There are 70,000 fewer customers for the Irish shopkeeper while the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Taoiseach speak of the wonderful progress in industrial expansion made under Fianna Fáil since 1957.  The basis and foundation of the industrial expansion since 1957 was the legislation introduced by the inter-Party Government which gave tax relief on exports and which amended Fianna Fáil's stupid Control of Manufactures Act.  They are praising the fact that foreign industrialists are now coming into the country but they did not want to let them come in.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have got away with this kind of double talk for years.  They have it in &ldquo;Facts About Ireland&rdquo; from which one gets the idea that it was the members of the present Government who set up everything since 1923.  Now we come to this miserable Budget from which the old age pensioners get the dregs.  The Taoiseach boasts of the increases his <Col N="1823" /> Government have given every year since they came into office.</P>

      <P>I am delighted with you, Sir.  When I was protecting the cattle trade, I was physically assaulted by the Minister's friends so I am well used to this kind of reception.  The Government Party would attack anybody else who might change their minds but they can change their minds every few seconds and then what they say is supposed to be gospel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out that when my namesake, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, was speaking, he gibed at Deputy Dillon's record when in Government and as I am talking about cattle, I should like to point out that Deputy Dillon was not a month in office when he created the precedent of being the first Minister for Agriculture to go over to Britain.  Of course the Minister for Finance would not like that; he would not have anything to do with Britain at all.  As a result of that visit, we got the pact of 1948 which put millions of pounds into the pockets of our farmers.  Mark you, it also saved our livestock trade.  That is the best business and the greatest source of income we have.  I should like to remind you, Sir, that on the day Deputy Dillon got into office, the biggest business the meat factories had at that time, and I remember it well, was the slaughter of young cattle and calves.  They were making them into <Col N="1826" /> veal loaves and giving the farmers buttons for them.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the No. 2 Budget of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Our telephones are to go up by 50 per cent, if you have the phone in the house already.  If some poor friend dies and we want to send a telegram, it will cost us 5/-.  We have a penny extra on the letters.  I notice that all these people who attend chambers of commerce dinners &ldquo;blew their top&rdquo; in the newspapers today but they would not have the pluck to say it to some of the Ministers when they sit down with them.  The Minister has announced that those who apply for a telephone after 15th April will have to pay £10.  We are going to see economic expansion and the efficiency of Fianna Fáil.  Here is a little bit of efficiency.  Every Deputy is inundated with letters from his constituents pleading with him to try to get telephones for them.</P>

      <P>Those who know nothing, fear nothing.  He did not know anything about this.  With a little anticipation, I went into the General Office the other day and put down a question to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who yesterday got up and gave me what I call &ldquo;the old one-two,&rdquo; so that the Press Gallery or anybody else would not get it.  He replied that the answer was in the form of a tabular statement and would be included in the Official Report. Questions Nos. 82 and 83 in my name read:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the number of applications for telephones outstanding in each county in Ireland;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the total number of <Col N="1827" /> applications for telephones outstanding in respect of the whole country.</P>
    <P>It worked out that there are 206 people in Carlow who want them. Cavan has 130; Clare, 117; and Cork, 1,004.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>But some of them have only been looking for telephones for three years and cannot get them. In Donegal, there are 295 and in Dublin, the capital of the country, there are 6,804.  They have to send runners around the city with their business.  We will be going back to the old days in Darkest Africa, and we will have people running around the streets with notes on top of sticks. Galway has 411; Kerry, 209; Kildare, 272; Kilkenny, 220; Leitrim, 41; Laois, 135; Limerick, 433; Longford, 75; Louth, 272; Mayo, 296; Meath, 259; Monaghan, 144; Offaly, 140; Roscommon, 91; Sligo, 144; Tipperary, 470; Waterford, 265; Wexford, 261; Westmeath, 230; and Wicklow, 274. There is a total of 13,198 people all screaming for telephones.</P>
      <P>If the telephone service were not a State monopoly, if it were a private enterprise like the Bell Telephone Company in the United States, there would be men going around asking people to take the telephone.  We have the position in reverse and we have the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, instead of encouraging people to take the telephone, saying: &ldquo;I am going to stop these so-and-so's from looking for the telephone.  I will put a penal tax on anybody who wants a telephone from tomorrow.  I will finish them.&rdquo; This is a dreadful state of affairs.  My information is that no linesmen have been recruited into the Post Office for a long time and that the Post Office engineers have been mainly engaged in laying main cables.  I have nothing to say about that but the Post Office should have kept on recruiting staff. When the Minister sees the demand, he should recruit staff and ensure that the demand is met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made representations about one case and I was told it would require <Col N="1828" /> five telegraph poles to go down to this farmer's house and that the matter would take six months.  When that period had passed, I went about the matter again and then I was told it would require two or three months more.  That has been going on for three years.  Now I have a gem.  There was a man living in a district just outside Waterford city and he had a telephone.  He went away and the man who went into his house cancelled the telephone.  The wires are passing by another man's door and this man has been looking for the telephone for the past four months.  He can do nothing about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you.  I come now to the forgotten men, the small shopkeepers of Ireland, who are fighting a rearguard action.  They face the competition of very efficient supermarkets today.  This has affected shopkeepers in small country towns where there are no supermarkets because the customers who normally would go to these small towns are going to the bigger centres to shop in the supermarkets.  The small country towns are getting only the skim of the business while the supermarkets are getting the cream.  The small shopkeepers are making a great struggle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thanks to the Minister for Finance <Col N="1829" /> and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who trotted after him into the division lobby last year, when the turnover tax was imposed, and to the 12 per cent increase in salaries and wages, members of local councils had to face increases in rates.  I attended a meeting of the council of which I have the honour to be a member and the manager wanted an increase of 7/-, bringing the rates up to £3 5s. in the £.  This was rather appalling because the constituency that I come from has the highest rates in Ireland per head of the population.  The valuations are high.</P>
    <P>There was no mention, of course, of the forgotten small shopkeepers who have to face these enormous increases. We did not take four months to discuss the rates estimate, as other councils did.  We know we have to provide the money.  We struck the rate after an hour and ten minutes.  It was a very simple thing.  Of the 7/- increase, 5/9d. was directly due to the 12 per cent increase in wages and salaries and to the increased estimates that had been sent in from the various subsidiary bodies in respect of the 12 per cent increase in wages and salaries and the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>I am not sold on the idea that the 12 per cent will keep the unions quiet for the next two years, as the Taoiseach said this evening.  He can say that and he knows it is not true because nearly all the 12 per cent has gone since yesterday.</P>
    <P>The tax on petrol will increase the costs of the small shopkeepers also because they usually keep a van for deliveries and in order to go around and try to sell stuff.  I do not suppose tourists will be mad about it.  I believe they will be able to buy petrol cheaper in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister has increased the tax on cigarettes and beer.  I do not think it is right for the Minister to tax beer. It has always been our wish to have great industries based on the land.  The great brewing industry is based on the land, based on barley.  A farmer who has a barley contract from the brewers has an asset.  He has a guaranteed price which is higher than the price <Col N="1830" /> he can get for feeding barley.  Ministers have come in and talked about the efficiency of industries and the need for industries to be efficient.  We have one of the most efficient brewing industries in the world and the Minister for Finance puts a tax on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not increase the duty on Irish whiskey.  The distilling industry is also based on the land.  Do the distillers deserve from the Government as much as the brewers deserve? The Lord Mayor of Dublin went off to sell whiskey in America and we heard about the millions that would be brought in.  We export whiskey to the value of £800,000 or £900,000 whereas the Scotch distilleries are able to export whiskey to the value of £50 million.  The Irish distillers should be told that they have had a lucky escape, that the Government do not want to be hard on them but that if they do not make a determined effort to sell whiskey abroad, and have regard to blends, something will have to be done about them.</P>
    <P>As far as the 2d. for milk is concerned, as I said before, it will not increase the farmer's income by anything like 12 per cent.  Of the entire farming community, the dairyman deserves most from us.  The cow has to be milked Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Easter Sunday, Christmas Day and the August bank holiday. We are giving him twopence.  The Minister was even pleased with himself when reading that out yesterday. The only thing I can say is: &ldquo;Thank God I am a dairyman no longer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is 8/- a cwt. for the man who is able to get Grade A Specials out of his pigs.  I have no doubt that with the ninth round increase, the cost of feeding stuffs will go up.  People may say the farmer could produce them himself.  He may, but he must have the raw materials processed and even that will cost him more because the mills and provender manufacturers will increase their prices.  We hear of the great plans of Fianna Fáil for 1970 and 1972.  I should like to hear the Minister tell us when all this will stop.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think it is to the advantage of this country to continue <Col N="1831" /> to increase taxation every year?  Does the Minister think it is to the country's advantage to keep pouring money into a whole lot of chancy projects?  Lastly, I would ask the Minister if he thinks the policy of CIE in destroying the railways will save this country the million pounds or so that the Minister for Transport and Power seeks from us here year after year.</P>

As the Taoiseach stated today, this Budget could have been balanced if it were not for the 2/6d. improvement in the social welfare benefits and if we were to forget the agricultural community.  Everybody else had got their share.  Deputy T. Lynch made me rather sick when he spoke about the turnover tax.</P>
      <P>The turnover tax was discussed on the last Budget.  It was dragged along here and in every hole and corner in this city and throughout the country until we had it tried last February. When it was tried the gentlemen over there got the people's opinion of what they thought of our action in regard to the turnover tax.  They got it in Cork where we had the largest majority we ever got, and in the purely rural constituency of Kildare.  Would you not think that would end it?  Evidently the only thing worrying them now is that the farmers are getting something.</P>

He stated that he wanted to know how long the people of this country would continue to subsidise milk delivered to creameries at the rate of £2 million a year.  He said he hoped the price of milk would reach a level where it would no longer be necessary to subsidise it.  He followed that up by an offer of 1/- a gallon for five years.  The farmers never forgot it for him and do not think that they will.</P>

    <P>In October, 1956, a requisition was made by the Clerk of the Dáil to have the paintings cleaned and <Col N="1833" /> in this connection an estimate was received for £11.

      <P>Did you ever imagine such misery?  The cleaning of the portraits was subsequently sanctioned in June, 1957, by the present Minister for Finance.  We had plenty of money then and the Minister had no trouble in finding £11.  Imagine a team with two such Ministers for Finance&mdash;they should put them into &ldquo;Facts about Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;one who took a shilling from the old age pensioners and the other could not find £11 in the national finances to clean two paintings.</P>
      <P>Money is required if we are to make progress.  The last man to be looked after is the farmer.  I disagree with the statement from the Labour benches today and I think it is high time a declaration was made about agricultural wages.  We have seen the drain year after year of the lifeblood of the agricultural community, owing to the barrier, the differential, between the £6 or £7 on one side and the £12 and £14 on the other.  We have lost every skilled worker we had on the land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If we are to keep the rural community on the land, they must be at least somewhere near the level of their brothers in industry.  We should work on that line.  I have worked on it.  In 1948 we brought in costings on wheat.  That is the crop that Deputy Dillon referred to by saying: when will the people of this country realise that we are spending £3 million every year getting farmers to grow beet and manufacturing it in this country whereas if we brought in refined sugar, we could have that money for children's allowances&rdquo;.  It is the one crop in this country that was costed and on which the farmer is paid his cost of production and a fair profit.  I have seen to that.  We got 11/1d this year and there is more to come as soon as we are finished with CIE freight and the extra £1. The sooner the £1 is put on, the sooner we will get money.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon told us about the purchase of land by foreigners.  I do not know how much of that has gone on in other areas.  I found some of it in my constituency and immediately I brought it up here in the week before the Dáil adjourned.  I took 1,000 acres from them and I had no trouble, as far as the Minister for Lands was concerned, in getting it divided between the people down there.</P>

      <P>Not one.  The processing factory at present being built in Midleton will provide employment for some 150-200 more people and we expect the number to go up to 700 in two years.  You must have money to get those industries going.  The State grant alone for the Midleton factory will be about £300,000 or £350,000. That will benefit the farmers of east Cork to the extent of almost £500,000 a year when in full production, as well as providing additional employment. This is what counts.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to carry on and to provide employment for our own people, we shall have to increase taxes from time to time.  I cannot see what the growl is about over there in relation to the farmers.  After all, when we look the matter in the face, we have to remember a few things. We have to remember that rates on agricultural land are paid here.  They are not paid in Northern Ireland and they are not paid in Britain.  Yet we have to compete with the British and the Northern Ireland farmers on the same market.  That is why I consider that what the Minister for Finance has done today is at least a step in the right direction as far as rates on agricultural land are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also remember that our position has been worsened from time <Col N="1837" /> to time, and badly worsened, by the foolish action of people who went over to Britain and made agreements. This country has paid, you might say, during a period of around four years, something over £4 million to Britain for permission to send our sugar over there under an agreement made in 1956 before those people went out of office last.  Remember these things.  That £4 million would help out a lot today in balancing the Budget but it had to be paid in order to find a market for our surplus sugar.  That was a cut-and-dried agreement that was brought home here by the Coalition Governmen when they were in office.  The Minister for Agriculture denied knowing anything about it until he was questioned here in the House and until we came up against the awkward fact that we had to ration beet growing in order that we would not have the extra sugar.  That was one of the difficulties our Minister for Agriculture had to tackle and to surmount.</P>
    <P>People step into jobs, as the Coalition Governments stepped in here for a while, not knowing what they were doing, not knowing the harm they were doing, but the evil they did lived a long time after them and we have to remember that in relation to our experience of the Coalition Governments here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Those, to my mind, are matters to which we have to attend as far as the people in this country are concerned.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>You must remember that the ordinary agricultural labourer today has to be at least as well trained as, if not better skilled than, the worker in any factory.</P>
      <P>A lot has been said here today about the money for education and secondary schools.  I suggest that if a proper attempt were made by our vocational schools and our vocational teaching&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it would bring far <Col N="1839" /> better results for the ordinary people of this country.  Our industries today are crying out for people with some technical training.  It is far cheaper to turn out half a dozen from the technical school and to train them in the local industries which are going on around them and to give some skill there than to send some fellow on to the secondary school and to the university for five years and to make a doctor out of him for abroad or to make a solicitor or a lawyer out of him to be trying to drag his tail in here some time.  That is the way I look on it.  I suggest that, instead of this big drive for universities and secondary education, a decent drive be made to put at least a technical school with suitable technical teachers in each of the towns and cities in which industries are being started so that these men can get the technical training required for industry.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like to thank the Minister for Finance for the action he has taken as regards the agricultural community.  I think their time had come and that they have been met fairly at least.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Shortly before this time last year, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands went down to his constituency in Roscommon and made a speech on the eve of the Budget.  We had all sorts of rumours of taxes on various commodities.  The Parliamentary Secretary assured his listeners that any taxes which the Government would introduce would be on &ldquo;furs, jewellery and expensive motor cars&rdquo; and that food and clothing would not be interfered with in any way.  A short time before that, the Taoiseach introduced his White Paper in which he said there must be a standstill in wages.  Those were two clear-cut statements&mdash;one made by the Taoiseach and the other by a member of the Government.</P>
      <P>Then, last year the Minister for Finance introduced this novelty, the turnover tax.  He did not do as the Parliamentary Secretary said he would do&mdash;merely impose it on furs, jewellery, and expensive motor cars.  He went further.  He said he would have to impose it on all commodities.  I quote the Minister's speech at Col. 82, Vol. 202 of the Dáil Debates of the 23rd April, 1963:</P>
      <P>It is not safe to rely for substantially increased revenue on the duties on only four commodities&mdash;tobacco, beer, spirits and oil&mdash;the yield from which is liable to be seriously affected by changes in demand.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave us the turnover tax because these four commodities had been taxed to saturation.  By a strange coincidence, having got the turnover tax geared and working smoothly, he comes along this year and taxes the very four commodities he said he could not touch: tobacco, beers, spirits and oils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These commodities are very essential commodities.  May I be pardoned if I again quote?  In his speech yesterday the Minister gave us the Ryan Budget, but announced that we would have <Col N="1841" /> the Hilliard Budget afterwards.  We know what that will mean.  We know that postage, telephones and telegrams are being taxed.  I should like to say something about that particular taxation.  I am quoting from Column 210, Volume 157 of the Dáil Debates:</P>
    <P>I expect there is a surprise in store for those of us, particularly business people, who do the bulk of their business by means of the telephone.  Surely the cost of the telegraphic service will not be increased, unless it is deliberately increased for the purpose of eliminating the telegram altogether?  The minimum rate for a telegram to England today is 3/6d.  If a friend dies and one wants to send a telegram with just &ldquo;Sincere sympathy,&rdquo; it costs one 2/6d.</P>
    <P>We are told now that there will be further increases in the postal and telegraphic services.  Remember that the people who use the services of the Post Office most are the business community and these imposts, whatever they may be, will have to be borne by the business community. Last year when the cost of telegrams was increased I, in common with other Deputies, received hundreds of complaints from business firms as to the cost of these extra charges in the year.  But we must wait for this Supplementary Budget and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will not come into the House quite as quickly as did the Minister for Social Welfare this morning. Remember, the Minister for Social Welfare came in to talk about some reliefs.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will be held in the background until the echoes of the present Budget have faded away somewhat.  Then he will come along with his Supplementary Budget and tell us what these increases will be.</P>
    <P>Who said that?  The present Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Brennan.  He told us at that time that if we increased the cost of the telegram from 3/-, it was going to hit the business community, and if we increased the cost of the letter from 3d, it was going to hit the business community.  According to the Minister, the telegram is now to cost 5/- and <Col N="1842" /> the businessman's letter will cost 5d. As the then Deputy Brennan pointed out, this hits the business community of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan did not stop there. He went on to talk about the increase in the cost of petrol.  I quote from the same column and volume:</P>
    <P>The increase in the price of petrol is not something that can be received with enthusiasm by anybody.  Of course, the new petrol tax could not be received with enthusiasm by anybody in the House.  I was surprised to hear Deputy McQuillan trying to justify that tax by pointing out that he was prepared to support up to the hilt the taxing of anything imported.  He did not tell us that the taxes on petrol and other imported goods were not for the purpose of preventing imports of those commodities but merely for the purpose of raising revenue....</P>
    <P>At that time the tax was justified because there was the Suez crisis and petrol had to be imported.  There is no such crisis today.  As Deputy Brennan pointed out, the tax is being imposed today for one purpose, that is, to procure more money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan went on further, and I quote from Column 212 of the same volume.  What he said about the tax on cigarettes is very interesting:</P>
    <P>Cigarettes, which today are a luxury according to the Government Deputies, were an absolute essential in 1952, and it was a crime to tax them.  Mind you, cigarettes have unfortunately become more and more essential to the community.  This may not be included in reckoning the cost of living index figure but they are regarded as an essential today even in country districts. When the local housewife goes to the grocer to purchase her weekly requirements she sells a few dozen eggs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>he is talking about 1956, when she had a few dozen eggs to sell</P>
    <P>&mdash;and gets her tea, sugar, salt, bread and other things but invariably there go into her basket two ounces of tobacco and 20 cigarettes <Col N="1843" /> at least.  It has become an indispensable part of the household requirements, because the women take home the things the men require.  Every penny imposed on these commodities is going to be just as difficult on the housekeeper in meeting her budget as if the taxes had been imposed on tea or sugar.</P>
    <P>The taxes were imposed on tea and sugar by way of the turnover tax and we have this burden again on the housewife who no longer has the eggs to sell and the money for them she had in 1956.  How right the then Deputy Brennan was, How essential these things have become to the ordinary housewife and how the Minister's Budget has hit the housewife again.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go over everything Deputy Dillon said this morning but there are a few things to which I should like to refer.  There is no doubt that the population of this country is falling and has fallen considerably since 1956 when that Budget was introduced.  We now have the highest rate of taxation ever levied on our people.  It is the highest rate on the smallest number of people&mdash;and we will have another rise next year.  So surely as we tax petrol and cigarettes, so surely as we increase the turnover tax as we do by increasing the tax on these commodities, so surely will the cost of keeping patients in hospital, of transporting them from their homes to hospital and of providing necessaries in hospital increase in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon pointed out that the cost of stamps for social security has increased.  The costs of all these things, of bread, butter, flour, sugar, cigarettes, postage stamps, telephones, and telegrams have all gone up at a time when we have 70,000 fewer in employment here compared with the occasion on which Deputy Brennan made that speech.  That is worth remembering. We still have about the same number of unemployed, about 60,000.  Deputy Dillon told us of a quarter of a million people leaving the country since 1956. On last Sunday I got an example of <Col N="1844" /> that.  I visited Aranmore island, and, to my utter amazement, I discovered that one of the teachers on the island, who had been there for 28 years, had now to leave his school because his average had fallen.  There was not a school in the entire locality in which the average had risen sufficiently to employ him and now he has to seek a teaching appointment in Killybegs, 40 miles away.  That is happening at a time when we have the highest rate of taxation ever levied on the people.</P>
    <P>Although a quarter of a million people have emigrated since 1956, it is now costing twice as much to run the country as it did then.  Can we account for that?  I certainly cannot.  I do not know what is happening.  I think we have become more extravagant.  I am sorry Deputy Corry has left the House because I have just read a speech of his made in 1956 in which he deplored the number of civil servants.  The overall strength of the Civil Service has gone up since then but not a word was uttered about that by Deputy Corry in his speech tonight.</P>
    <P>There are a few things in this Budget which are worth referring to. Now we are so heavily taxed that there can scarcely be any further taxation. I remember the present President of Ireland when, in 1956, he interrupted the then Taoiseach, Deputy John A. Costello, and said that we had reached the limit of taxation.  I wonder what does he think today about the taxation being imposed on a quarter of a million fewer people than in his day. I notice it costs £60,313 to run the President's establishment.  Can we afford that in this country?  I am not here to criticise the President.  I would not do it but I think we are far too extravagant in running the establishment over which he presides.  We were told some time ago what it was going to cost the State to send the President and his party to the funeral of the late President Kennedy.</P>

We have heard the Minister for Finance, Deputy Corry, and others wax enthusiastic about what we are going to do for agriculture.  The Government were never too fond of agriculture in the early days.  It is grand to hear Deputy Corry talk about the Sugar Company and the magnificent work they are doing and the fact that there is not an unemployed man north or west of Cobh.  Remember what the present Government said about the sugar company.  They said that the sugar company was a white elephant and that all the factories built by the sugar company were white elephants.  The present Tánaiste said that and it is on record.   He was evidently an expert on white elephants at the time.</P>

    <P>We told them then the advantages that were to be gained from undertakings such as the Sugar Company. The then Minister for Agriculture, the late Deputy Hogan, told them that the policy should be one more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the <Col N="1846" /> plough.  That was his policy and he was denigrated all over the country by Fianna Fáil for it.  It took about 35 years to convert Fianna Fáil and during the course of that conversion, the cost to the agricultural community was more than we can ever estimate. That was the time when they advised us to slit the throats of the calves. Now they are advising us to do something else with them.  That was the time they advised us to abolish the cattle industry.  That was the time when the Minister for External Affairs said he hoped every ship crossing the Irish sea carrying four-footed beasts or two-footed human beings would go to the bottom of the sea.</P>

      <P>What a tragedy that the policy of the late Paddy Hogan and of the predecessors of Fine Gael was not put into practice by their successors.  If it had been, we now would have no need for this heifer subsidy; we would have sufficient cattle to keep our trade balance in order. Now, at the eleventh hour, we are trying to build up the cattle industry, something which is going to be most difficult to do because the people do not believe or trust Fianna Fáil as far as the cattle industry is concerned.  It is all very fine to talk about the buoyancy of our economy but suppose the cattle trade, the beef and store trade, collapses, where do we go from there?  It would be very, very serious indeed, but, as Deputy Dillon said, the Taoiseach is a gambler and he is surrounded by gamblers and they are gambling on this.  If it does not come off, it will be very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of agriculture, we are delighted to see that the dairy farmers in the south are to get an extra 2d. a gallon for milk.  They are entitled to it.  It is the least they are entitled to.  I wonder what will happen in Roscommon, Mayo and Donegal <Col N="1847" /> where milk is not produced.  What is the incentive to farmers in these counties?  We are told there will be a rebate on agricultural lands but we do not know what it is or how it is to work.  It would have been appropriate for the Minister last night to tell us during his broadcast how it will affect farmers in non-dairying and non-milk producing counties.  I cannot see any benefit under this Budget for the small farmers in these counties or any other counties other than the milk-producing counties.</P>
    <P>We all know that the potato trade has collapsed this year.  Farmers of the potato-producing counties like my own and that of Deputy Cunningham and of the volatile Deputy from Galway, know that the potato trade has collapsed in these counties.</P>

      <P>We do not know what we are to do with our potato surplus.  If the same thing happens to our seed potatoes this year, farmers will be very badly hit.  Still, there is no hope held out in the Budget for farmers in these counties.</P>
      <P>Let me refer now to the impact of the tax on petrol and oil on the travelling community.  As Deputy Brennan said in 1956, the car is now an essential.  Why?  Because the railways have been closed.  We have no railways now.  Fianna Fáil closed the railways and they said: &ldquo;We will give you buses instead&rdquo;.  They never told us that bus fares would go up 100 per cent.  They are now up 100 per cent over what they were when people travelled by railway and in many cases they are up by as much as 200 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me tell a short story in regard to this.  About ten days ago, there was a National Football League semi-final in Dublin, between Cavan and Down. For the occasion CIE had an advertisement in the daily newspapers offering, for that particular Sunday, a return trip from Monaghan to Dublin for 19/6d.  The distance is in the neighbourhood of 70 miles.  The same newspaper carried their advertisement offering <Col N="1848" /> a return trip from Cavan to Dublin, a distance of 80 miles or slightly more, at 13/6d.  There was a difference of 6/- for a shorter journey.  You may ask why.  I will tell you.  It is because there is an independent bus service in Cavan which could compete on most favourable terms against CIE but there is no private bus service in Monaghan and they could charge the people of Monaghan what they liked.  They were afraid in the case of Cavan because the people could turn to the independent company and say: &ldquo;Put on your fleet of buses&rdquo; and they had to come down to the price of that company.</P>

      <P>I think it was most relevant because we are talking about what the Parliamentary Secretary said would be done last year, namely that there would be a tax on furs, jewellery and motor cars and nothing else, but the Minister for Finance paid no attention to him and came along and imposed the turnover tax on everything.  This year he thought he was right.  Mind you, the Parliamentary Secretary was only just one year late because this year the tax has been put on the things the Parliamentary Secretary said it would be put on last year.</P>
      <P>What will be the effect of this Budget on the tourist industry?  It will have a most serious effect, in my opinion.  The tourist industry never thrived better than it did in the first few years after the Second World War.  We had more visitors then than we have had in any year since.  The reason was that things were cheaper here and there was an enticement to come.  Intoxicating liquor, food, petrol and cigarettes were much cheaper here. That was one of the reasons people were enticed to come here.  Our climate is somewhat similar to that of Great Britain.  They cannot come here for better weather.  They come here for these cheaper commodities just as we sometimes like to slip away to the Channel Islands where various commodities are much cheaper than they are in parts of Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are now levelling up.  Not only are we levelling up but we are now almost on the tail of the prices charged by the British Exchequer.  We will go a little further and tell them that if they come here, they must stop drinking the whiskey they drink at home, that they can no longer drink Scotch whisky except at a price, that they must drink Irish whiskey.  I have no objection to that at all but they have to acquire a taste for Irish <Col N="1850" /> whiskey.  They will not do it during the fortnight or three weeks they spend with us.  It would suit us much better if we tried to push Irish whiskey into the English market and into the markets from which our tourists come, to give them an opportunity of acquiring a taste for it before coming here.</P>
    <P>If we are serious in our ambitions to enter the Common Market, to bring down tariff walls, how can we reconcile that with putting a tariff on the importation of British spirits at this moment?  There is only one reason: we want more money and we are putting it on to get money.</P>
    <P>I would warn the Minister that the British Government might hit us back by putting an import duty on our whiskey going into Britain, and that would be serious, not from the Englishman's point of view, but from the point of view of the Irish migrant in Britain who is still fond of his glass of Irish.  I sincerely hope there will be no repercussions as a result of this but it is quite possible.</P>

      <P>Gloom and misery&mdash;the Deputy has summed it up. There is nothing in this Budget for the town and city dweller other than more blisters on his back.  We were told that the ninth round was to compensate the employee for the burden imposed by the turnover tax.  We were assured that that would amply compensate him and that everybody would be happy.  Here we have the two budgets now and their impact upon the town and city dweller.  The cost of transport, milk and cigarettes is going up and, as Deputy Joseph Brennan said, they are a household necessity at the moment. The price of the pint is going up.</P>

      <P>The rates have gone up.  The differential rents have gone up.  The cost of postage has gone up.  The cost of the telephone has gone up.  The telegram has gone up.  There is no cut for telegrams saying <Col N="1851" />&ldquo;deepest sympathy&rdquo;, to which Deputy Brennan referred in 1956. When you sent a telegram, in 1956, with only the words &ldquo;Deepest sympathy&rdquo; you got a shilling off.  That no longer obtains.  I do not know whether Deputy Coughlan heard what Deputy Brennan said when the cost of telegrams was increased in 1956: &ldquo;I, in common with other Deputies, received hundreds of complaints from business firms as to the cost of these extra charges.&rdquo;  That was when the telegram was 3/-.  He has not shown the bundle of telegrams he received since word got out that it has gone up to 5/-. I suppose every Minister, like the Parliamentary Secretary, has received a similar number of telegrams.  We have received none because most of our constituents do not know when this extra charge will come on and are afraid to send a telegram in case they would have to pay the 5/-.</P>

      <P>I could anticipate that there would be an extra 2/6 for non-contributory old age pensioners.  Deputies might wonder how I knew.  The investigation officer has been going around for the last two months checking up on the means of old age pensioners and increasing the amount assessed if at all possible, counting the hens, asking were they going to qualify for the £15 in-calf heifer subsidy scheme.  As sure as a man endeavours to benefit by the in-calf heifer scheme, up goes his means assessment and down goes his pension. This, remember, is in reference to non-contributory pensioners.  There is nothing for contributory pensioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget increases taxation by nearly £10 million apart from the £14 million thrown on the people's shoulders by the turnover tax in last year's Budget.  Those increases will be borne chiefly by the wage earners and their employers, who are <Col N="1855" /> the main contributors to this huge revenue.  The expenditure now has gone over the £200 million mark for a population of fewer than 3,000,000. It is easy to calculate the heavy burden being carried by the earning section of our population.</P>
      <P>Children and infants, widows, blind pensioners, those in ill health, all the subsistence classes, are not physically able to earn an income sufficient to enable them to keep body and soul together.  When those classes are taken out of the population, it is obvious the earning section of the community, which is supporting the other sections &mdash;the aged, the disabled and the children, who represent a very high proportion of the population&mdash;is carrying a huge burden&mdash;more than £200 million.</P>
      <P>The failure of the Minister yesterday to tell the full story is very significant.  It was only today we learned that in addition to the very heavy burdens proposed by this Budget, he intends to take another £2 million from the business community.  The new postal charges proposed are fantastic because they form a big proportion of the expenses of running a business.  A letter now will cost fivepence while across the border it is threepence.</P>
      <P>Telephone charges are to be increased considerably as well as the rentals on private and commercial lines, not alone those installed but those yet to be put in.  Really, it is only the people in business who realise what a very heavy tax this will be.  It was bad enough when the postal stamp was increased from threepence to four-pence.  Any small firm which had a postage bill of £30 a week then has had a postage bill of £40 a week.  It is now proposed to increase the bill to £50 a week.  The same applies to firms who issue cards to their customers notifying them that their orders are ready.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The telephone and postage bills in most businesses are already very high and the new charges will hit the commercial community most severely.  Of course those extra costs will have to be passed on because the firms concerned <Col N="1856" /> cannot be expected to meet them.  They must add the extra costs to whatever service they give.</P>
    <P>Again, take the business firm with three, six, or ten telephone lines coming into a switchboard.  The increase from something like £11 10s. a year to £14 a year and a proportionate increase for the other lines will be a very heavy rental.  This charge will apply, apart altogether from the cost of telephone calls which have been increased by about 25 per cent.  It is proposed now to apply a collection charge of £10 in respect of telephones.  I am interested to know if that will be a deposit or will this £10 go?  Is it to be in addition to the rental of £14 a year, making a total of £24 before a person can obtain a call on his newly connected telephone?</P>
    <P>These costs are far beyond those which apply for similar services in Northern Ireland or in Britain.  It has always been a fact that the Post Office shows a profit on its revenue but I feel that the Minister on this occasion, instead of just trying to provide a service and getting a modest profit from it, is using it as a method of taking in taxation.  This is an ordinary method of communication, whether it be social and domestic or commercial, and it should not be taxed so heavily.</P>
    <P>The Minister yesterday boasted about industrial production since 1959 having increased on an average of about 4½ per cent.  This increase is small when we consider that this was an agricultural economy. Since the agricultural side of our economy would not be sufficient to provide a standard of living to which our people have become accustomed, it was necessary to bring up the industrial side of the economy.  That increase of 4½ per cent is nothing to boast about when it is considered that we have the benefit of modern techniques in switching over to an industrial from an agricultural economy. It is fair to say that the average increase should be much higher in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>The statistics show an ever-increasing volume of industrial production and export, with the result that revenue from these exports is increasing each year.  When the first inter-Party Government <Col N="1857" /> were formed, we had a situation in which the agricultural side of our economy was responsible for less than £50 million in the matter of exports.  After two periods under Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture, that figure had gone up to £120 million.</P>
    <P>Both inter-Party Governments set about encouraging industrial expansion by way of tax concessions and this has done more than any other device to increase our industrial exports.  Our industrialists are enterprising people and when they got the opportunity to benefit from an expanding export market by reason of the favourable tax concessions, they succeeded in increasing the volume of exports substantially and that increase is still continuing.  I hope they will continue to prosper in this sector and I feel that they can do better than the 4½ per cent average improvement about which the Minister boasted.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned an extract from the OECD Report saying that in recent years we had gone through a period of the fastest economic growth. That report did not elaborate on the reasons for this growth amongst its members and one of them, at least as far as we are concerned, is that previous to this we were mainly an agricultural community.</P>
    <P>The national debt is growing very rapidly.  It is a fact that it is now about equal to the annual national income and it is also a fact that the cost of servicing the national debt is the same amount as the taxation which was needed to run the country when Fianna Fáil first came into office.  The Minister did not emphasise the fact, but we must face it, that although industrial output has increased considerably and an improvement in our economy has been brought about, our agricultural output has fallen.  It is no wonder, considering that approximately 20,000 working on the land left it last year and are continuing to leave.  If the manpower continues to flee from the land, it is only to be expected that the output in agriculture will fall and of course the measure of prosperity in agriculture is bound to suffer.</P>
    <P>In relation to employment, which was mentioned by the Minister, I <Col N="1858" /> would point out that the increased employment has taken place in the industrial sector and also if you like, in the sector of transportable goods. The workers have left the land and have moved into industry.  In spite of that, we have around 50,000 or 60,000 people registered unemployed at the moment and seeking work.</P>
    <P>We observed recently that in fact the average emigration over the past number of years, in spite of what the Fianna Fáil people tried to tell people, particularly in the by-elections some time ago, has been 33,000.  The figures show that since Fianna Fáil came into office seven years ago now, for the last two terms, over 300,000 people have emigrated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>And in spite of these 33,000 people leaving the country every year, we have 60,000 of them here at home, on the average, who cannot get work.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned, that the deficit on the balance of payments last year amounted to £22 million and in the previous 12 months, it was £13½ million.  The situation would have been worse but for the inflow of capital into this country.  Unfortunately, some of that inflow is not of a desirable type.  Foreigners are buying up good agricultural land at inflated prices. Similarly, they are coming in the back doors and purchasing house property and enterprises here.  If we did not have that type of undesirable capital coming into this country, the deficit on the balance of payments would be very much greater than the £22 million. The £22 million, however, is nothing&mdash; it is something to gloss over&mdash;and we have a situation now, as a result of the 12 per cent wage increase, in which we can easily expect, next year, a deficit of anything up to £35 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has quite rightly said here&mdash;but remember that he and his Government must take the blame for it&mdash;that in fact he may find himself facing a problem.  It is a very significant sentence and it is one that the country will, I believe, know all about before the end of this year.  It is mentioned in his speech on the deficit on the balance of payments.  He says: &ldquo;The outlook for 1964 is good and the balance of payments deficit, though <Col N="1860" /> it will be higher than in 1963&rdquo;&mdash;it certainly will&mdash;&ldquo;will contain a temporary hump which we can surmount&rdquo;&mdash;on the graph, I presume.  This is the significant sentence: &ldquo;If they are not, difficulties may develop requiring corrective action.&rdquo;  If the deficit on the balance of payments continues to go as it is and if this temporary hump becomes difficult, we can expect that corrective action will be essential.  The Minister did mention the danger of domestic inflation as a result of the economic policy being pursued by the Government at the present time.  Certainly it is clearly one of expediency.</P>
    <P>Last year, a White Paper was issued by the Government.  Just this time last year we were recovering from the scars of the debate which took place over that White Paper.  That White Paper endeavoured to bring about a wage standstill in this country and as a result of the debate which took place, the Taoiseach found it necessary to throw it in the wastepaper basket, having wasted so much time here in the Dáil on the debate and caused so much anxiety throughout the country. But his case for a wages standstill order envisaged in that White Paper of 1963 had been weakened by his statements of the previous year.  When he decided the White Paper was something the nation would not accept and discarded it, he embarked on a policy which certainly will result in inflation.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister mentioned the danger of the domestic inflation which will probably result from higher consumption as a result of inflated incomes.  It is all very well for the Minister to say inflation can be avoided if people run to the bank with their earnings.  However, if they spend their earnings, they will create conditions of inflation, because that money will be spent on consumer goods rather than invested in productive enterprises.  The ordinary wageearner, pensioner or anybody else on an income uses a high proportion of that income for consumer purposes.  It is the consumer side of a person's spending which increases his standard of living.  Naturally, if his income is increased substantially, he will use that <Col N="1861" /> income to improve his standard of living.  He will not run to a bank or to his money box.  He will see what this money can do for his standard of living.  It is foolish for the Minister to tell these people that if they spend their money on consumer goods, inflation will result.  That is the logical result of increased incomes.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that consumer spending would further upset our balance of payments.  It is true that we may bring ourselves into a situation here where the purchasing power of the £ in this country will be less than the purchasing power of the £ in Great Britain.  The question then arises of whether we will be able to get 20/- for the Irish £ in the Bank of England. At the moment our £ is guaranteed at the Bank of England for 20/-.  But if the value of the people's money is upset by the economic policy of the Government, we may find ourselves in the position where the Irish £ will not fetch 20/- at the Bank of England. There is the example of Australia. There are approximately 25 Australian shillings for the English £ note.  If the Government are not careful in guiding our economy, we may find a difficult situation for the Irish £ at the Bank of England.</P>
    <P>One reason for being happy about the value of our exports is the export marketing conditions available for Irish cattle at present.  It is unfortunate that the production of more cattle was not encouraged&mdash;in fact, it was discouraged&mdash;by Fianna Fáil in the past. Now, when it is almost too late in the day, they have brought in this heifer calf subsidy scheme, which will not begin to bear fruit for two or three years to come.</P>
    <P>When the 12 per cent wage adjustment was under consideration early this year the arrangement was that it should stand for two and a half years, that the people should not ask for an increase in their incomes for two-and- a-half years after getting this 12 per cent adjustment.  Proper consideration was not given to the fact that the cost of living is going to rise considerably according as this 12 per cent increase is paid out.  There are thousands of workers who have not yet got this <Col N="1862" /> increase and are waiting for it.  All these adjustments will have the effect of increasing the cost of goods and services.  The result is that those wage-earners who have already got their 12 per cent increase will find their incomes cut down considerably by the rising cost of goods and services in addition to the rise in the cost of living, and no doubt they will be seeking an adjustment for that loss.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the 12 per cent increase means at least an increase of £40 million a year to the people who had the benefit of it. However, the £14 million in turnover tax is going to take a good slice of that and in this Budget the Minister proposes to take a further £8 million or £10 million from the taxpayer in general.  As I said, the people who have to bear this big burden are the earning section of the community.  They pay heavily by way of taxes for whatever national services we have.  This £50 million increase will not be matched by an increase in hours worked.  The trend is towards a reduction in the number of hours worked per week and per day.  It has to be balanced, if possible, by better methods of production and increased output.</P>
    <P>But many industries are working to capacity and with a very high degree of efficiency and they cannot hope to balance the increase now coming by greater output or efficiency with the result that the extra burden must be passed on to other sections of the community.  No doubt costs in industry of consumer goods, processing and manufacturing and services, are bound to rise as a result of this adjustment. When all the increases are added up we may find ourselves almost priced out of the market for some of our goods.  We can prosper so long as we can produce and sell at competitive prices, whether finished articles, agricultural produce or manufactured goods.</P>
    <P>We found in recent times considerable difficulty in selling agricultural produce at economic prices.  The Minister actually mentioned in his speech that in some respects prices available for agricultural produce are below the cost of production.  Naturally, farmers <Col N="1863" /> are then driven to some other type of production in order to make a profit to balance their domestic economy. The danger is that goods which must bear these increases, especially where maximum efficiency is already reached leaving no possibility of bridging the gap, must be increased in price and that must be passed on.  If the article must carry a higher price the question arises as to whether it can compete with goods of other countries selling in the same market.</P>
    <P>We are lucky to have Britain so near us and taking a huge percentage of our agricultural exports and a substantial percentage of industrial exports also.  Experience has shown that opportunities for selling Irish produce, agricultural or industrial, in other countries are rather limited.  If we price ourselves out of the British market it will be very difficult to find an alternative.</P>
    <P>Recently the Government have been accused by Fine Gael of gambling with the nation's assets and taking very serious risks with the future of our economy.  They have done many scandalous things recently purely for political expediency.  The Minister mentioned that among various items which caused a deficit last year was the £1 million that had to be given as a subsidy to a shipping interest in Cork.  That crisis arose shortly before Christmas and £1 million of the taxpayers' money was immediately made available by the Government in order to keep going a concern which has no chance of making a success of ship building in Cork. But the Government won the by-election and that was the primary purpose for which this money was spent. The country cannot continue to afford the improper use of the nation's resources or a policy designed for political advantage instead of for the benefit of the nation generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister, according to his figures, I note, will be short about £25 million on the capital expenditure side and I assume he will consider it necessary this year, as last year, to float a national loan to cover that expenditure. <Col N="1864" />  It is a remarkable fact that more than a quarter of the people's earnings&mdash;self-employed people, wage and salary earners and business people &mdash;is collected in taxes to meet the cost of public services.  It is a very heavy charge on the people's income. Although the Minister on this occasion has given some benefits to the agricultural community we must accept that the average income of the ablebodied farmer, farmworker and farmer's son is far below the wage level of the lowest paid tradesman at present. Apparently that trend is to continue. They must depend on a ready market for their surplus produce from the land to make ends meet and so give them a reasonable income.</P>
    <P>The flight from the land is continuing.  From an examination of our economy at present, it is apparent that the good prices available from cattle exports are the backbone of our agricultural economy.  The 2d. a gallon on milk being offered to creameries is of course at the expense of the taxpayers in general.  The prices for liquid milk, mainly in Dublin and Cork, are related to a particular area which supplies either of these cities and the Minister indicated that a similar price may be expected by milk producers who sell their produce in that area, but they will not get it automatically from taxation; they must get this 2d. a gallon direct from the consumer.  In order to get their increase, the battle must begin between the milk producers and the consumers of Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned an increase in prices for Grade A and Grade B pigs but was careful to avoid mentioning that in fact these increases will barely meet the increased cost of feeding stuffs.  If you take the increased price of Irish barley, the price of 8/- for Grade A pigs and 5/- for Grade B pigs is only an adjustment to meet the increased cost of feeding stuffs for these pigs.  The Budget also indicated that £1¼ million is to be collected from beer.  That is a very heavy tax, on both home-produced and imported beer.  The Minister should have differentiated between what they call black beer and white beer.  Black <Col N="1865" /> beer is the stout produced by various firms such as Guinness and Beamish and others.  I feel the Minister has done a considerable amount of harm by applying the tax to black beer because it is recognised as the working-man's drink and the increased price is bound to affect his cost of living and encroach on his wages.</P>
    <P>I expect that the Minister was approached by the licensed trade regarding this matter but it is regrettable that he could not see the difference between taxing the black beer and other beers because the produce of the country is used in the production of stout and naturally this is going to place a strain on the cost of production.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very unfair to the contributory old age pensioners.  He allowed half a crown a week only to the non-contributory old age pensioners and, of course, the blind pensioner, the widows, and unemployed, but he should not have left out the other old age pensioners.  Nobody will claim that the increase of 2/6 a week, or approximately 4½d a day, is a decent increase to old age pensioners who must try to make ends meet and with prices rising as rapidly as they are.  The Minister has been very mean in regard to the social welfare classes.  He has set about a taxing rampage, taking all around, taxing petrol, beer, cigarettes and imported spirits.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that the Minister has done a very bad job for the <Col N="1866" /> country.  Before the end of the year, we may face an inflationary crisis which will be brought about by the foolish economic policy being pursued by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It had been apparent to me for a long time that since this Government took office a determined effort has been made in successive Budgets&mdash;as I suggested last year and the year before&mdash;to project the Taoiseach as the farmers' friend.  We all know the prejudices the Taoiseach had to face when he assumed his present high office.  It was said he was a city man and that his horizons were limited to the city boundary, that he knew nothing about rural conditions and that he did not care.  Therefore it was necessary for the Taoiseach to redress this political imbalance by doing what he could to show that far from being concerned only with industry and the problems of people in towns and cities, he was also one who had the interests of the farmers at heart.  This Budget is just another step on that road towards making the Taoiseach appear to the farmers as their friend and ally.</P>

      <P>Under the system of accounting for income tax, the net receipt for any year is not segregated under the various Schedules.  Estimates have, however, been prepared of the net produce of Income Tax under each Schedule and particulars for the year 1961-62 were given in my reply to Question No. 122 tabled by Deputy Sweetman on 8th April, 1964.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the Schedule E tax to be collected in 1964-65 will amount to approximately £19,900,000 of which £16,400,000 will be collected under Pay As You Earn.  Corresponding information in relation to Schedule E tax for 1963-64 was given in my reply to Question No. 116 tabled by Deputy Sweetman on 8th April, 1964.</P>
