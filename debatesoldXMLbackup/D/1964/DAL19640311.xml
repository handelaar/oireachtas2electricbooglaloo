      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of the widespread distribution of boxes of matches, manufactured in an Iron Curtain country, at the same price as Irish matches; if he can give details of the extent; and what is the value of such imports.</P>

      <P>There were no matches imported from Rumania in the year 1963.  A relatively small import from Rumania comprising 2,000 gross containers of matches valued, c.i.f., at £260 was recorded for January of this year and information in respect of the February trade is not yet available.  This evidence does not suggest that the distribution of such goods in the country is very widespread.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that recently in Limerick, when the body of a drowned woman was washed up from the Shannon, the services of an ambulance were refused for the purpose <Col N="668" /> of bringing the body into the city; and that it was intimated that this work should have been done by the undertakers; and whether, in view of the fact that a body found in such conditions may well be required for post mortem examination to establish the cause of death, and that it is not prepared for conffining by the undertaker, he will take steps to ensure that an ambulance should be available in any such case in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the services of an ambulance were refused in this case. From inquiries which I have made from the Limerick Health Authority, I understand that an ambulance was provided by Limerick Fire Brigade to convey the body of the deceased from the place in which it was found in County Clare to the mortuary of a hospital in Limerick city as soon as it was established that the body would be accepted in that mortuary.  I have been unable in the time available to obtain information which would confirm or refute that it was intimated, by whom is not stated, that &ldquo;this work should have been done by the undertakers&rdquo;.  The legal position regarding the removal of a body found in circumstances similar to those in this case is set out in Section 46 of the Coroners Act, 1962, to which I would refer the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the question, it is not the function of the Minister for Health to take the steps requested.  The purpose for which ambulances are provided by health authorities is the conveyance of living persons; and the use of ambulances for the conveyance of deceased persons is open to objection, in certain circumstances to considerable objection.  Health authorities, however, are authorised, when one of their ambulances is summoned to the scene of a recent accident, to transport a victim of such accident to the relevant hospital, even where he or she is apparently dead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will further clarify <Col N="669" /> circular letter SM.115/9 dated 31st May, 1962 relative to increased travelling allowances for district nurses so as to indicate whether it includes district nurses employed in a county borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The increased travelling allowances set out in the letter of 31st May, 1962, referred to by the Deputy, were expressed to relate to districts which are mainly rural and districts which are mainly urban, but are not in county boroughs.  In the county boroughs a different set of circumstances prevails by reason of the existence of a good public transport service which is available to the district nurses in the course of travel on official business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, no.  The Deputy was present and has since read the reply.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not yet said how long it takes to clean three portraits.  If I am to base my supplementary questions on the reply given yesterday, will the Parliamentary Secretary state are we to understand that only one cleaner of portraits is available in this country, and that it has taken nine months to clean them as a result?  Surely there is another cleaner available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that the Deputy is not interested in how long it takes to clean the portraits.  I have no intention of raking up old unhappy far-off things and battles long ago.  If the Deputy and his colleagues wish to do so, that is their concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has not replied to my question. I have asked if there was not more than one portrait cleaner available.  If there was more than one, why was he not brought in to do the work?  Would the Parliamentary Secretary answer that question?  I am concerned with last year, not with what happened before he and I were born.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a misapprehension, possibly innocently so.  If so, he must be the only member of the House who is not aware that major reconstruction work is, and has been, taking place here and that there was no vital hurry about the cleaning of the portraits.  I want to point out that besides the three portraits in question, paintings of President de Valera, Mr. W.T. Cosgrave, Mr. Robert Barton and Mr. John A. Costello were removed from the House, <Col N="673" /> and the Deputy has not objected to that.  Also ten pictures from the Taylor Bequest were taken down in the restaurant and the bar, and the Deputy has not objected to that.  Why he picks on these three is beyond me.</P>

I may mention that since works started on this scheme, about 300 applications have been received for extra drains.  The engineers on the scheme are so busy on the approved works programme that time cannot be spared for examination of all these applications as they come and many of them have to be deferred. I can assure the Deputy that each application will be investigated on its merits but meanwhile the approved programme must be given priority.</P>

      <P>I think it must be obvious that all who are interested in our fishing industry will heartily welcome the power to extend our exclusive <Col N="676" /> fishery limits which is provided by the London agreement.  This agreement must be ratified by seven other signatory countries before it comes into operation and I think there would be bitter resentment at any steps taken here which might discourage the other signatory States from ratifying it at once and so enable us to extend our limits immediately with the goodwill of all our European neighbours.</P>
      <P>I feel sure that all who have been agitating for so long for the extension of our existing fishing limits would regard it as an insult if, as the Deputy suggests, they were to be asked, now that agreement has been successfully negotiated, whether they had really meant what they had been saying over so many years.</P>

      <P>At a meeting last week with officers of my Department, representatives of the Irish Bacon Curers' Society requested an increase in the price received by them for bacon exported to Britain. The request was made mainly on the grounds that the export prices have not been increased since 1957 although curers' costs have increased considerably since then and can no longer be met out of the returns from home sales. I am examining the curers' representations and in the meantime I am not in a position to make a statement in the matter.</P>

There is a procedure, as explained by the Minister for Finance on the Report Stage of the Superannuation (Pensions) Bill, which is followed in relation to all these officers.  As I said in my reply, there is a claim now before the Department's conciliation council.

The products included soups, salads, sauces, beans, peas, tinned fruit, tinned vegetables, jams and marmalades of all sorts, to say nothing of the other increases in bread and meat?  In view of this price list, which is available, will the Minister state what steps he proposes to take to prevent these increases which range from ten to 25 per cent over the price previously in operation or have we to take the decision that the 12 per cent increase which has been given is to be totally absorbed and that another demand will have to come in order to safeguard housewives?</P>

      <P>The argument put forward by the Minister for Transport and Power and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce was that competition between retailers would absorb a great deal of the increase in costs. In the price list which I have just told the House about, and copies of which are available, is shown the increase amongst all the wholesalers of the different commodities; in other words, all the brands of soups, marmalades, jams, and so on, are going up in price. May I mention another one to the Minister and this has to do with household goods which affect the woman of the house all the time?  There is an increase in the price of crockery.  The price of even the ordinary cup in the house has gone up by 15 to 20 per cent.  The Government no longer have any control of prices and are prepared to allow the country to career into inflation, without a hand at the wheel to check it.</P>

We were told four years ago that directions had been issued to remedy the pollution and the nuisance caused by this stream.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing reciprocal arrangements on social security between this country and Great Britain are based on an agreement between the two countries which took effect on 2nd May, 1960.  The arrangements are accordingly of recent date and are the best that it has proved possible to conclude.  They are not, however, regarded by this country as satisfactory in all respects and their shortcomings are kept in mind with a view to negotiating improvements as and when opportunity offers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

The value of stamps which a contributor may have when he returns from employment in Britain is very limited when it comes to drawing national health or unemployment benefit here.

      <P>Would the Minister agree it is the duty of the Land Commission, where an estate comes on the market, to acquire that estate for division among neighbouring uneconomic smallholders, the vast majority of whom have from 14 to 17 acres only, many of them with large families?

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the Minister on this but it is a very interesting situation that two Deputies from Louth have spoken in the House within the past ten minutes on the question of the acquisition of a farm of land in Louth.  I have no personal interest in the question that was asked but the Minister replied that there was congestion in the area involved.  The Bill before the House defines the congested areas and Louth does not appear amongst the areas so defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister not power to declare areas to be congested areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will listen to me?  The Minister will have the power if this Bill is passed but the Minister has not the power at present.  That is what I want to bring home, that the Minister in his reply to the two Deputies indicated that there is congestion in Louth.  I accept that there is.  Deputy Faulkner will have to recognise that Louth will not be a congested area under the terms of this Bill and, if the Minister is doing his duty, if he gets section 4, it will be many a day before Louth <Col N="716" /> can be considered as a congested area when we have, in the Minister's words, 60,000 small-holdings in what are defined under the Bill as congested areas.</P>
      <P>I mention all this to show that there is not any clear thinking on the part of the Government on the question of congestion.  Apparently, as far as the present Government are concerned, if they are in a tight spot in this House, any area can become a congested area if it is a case of justifying the acquisition of land.  I am all in favour of land acquisition for the relief of congestion and the establishment of as many economic holdings as it is humanly possible and practicable to create.  That is my view but I do not like to find a situation arising, as can arise under section 4, that the Minister, when this Bill is passed, will accept that the particular counties mentioned will, for a start, be part and parcel of the congested areas and that he will, from the passing of this Bill, give a direction to the Land Commission to create 40 to 45-acre holdings in these so-called congested areas.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear to the Minister that he has not got the land in Ireland to create these economic holdings in the congested areas or outside the congested areas.  He would be doing a better day's work for the congests if he were to bring up the existing congested holdings to the standard of what is at the moment described as an economic holding in the non-congested areas.  That would be a reasonable step.  In other words, get rid of the existing distinction between the type and size of farm at present being given in the congested areas and the type and size of farm being given in the non-congested areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of Deputies who do not know what that distinction is, let me put it this way: up to the moment there is a procedure in operation in the Department of Lands in regard to the western seaboard that where a group of small-holdings have a valuation of, say, £5 each the Land Commission may, if there is land available in the locality, in course of rearrangement, raise these small-holdings from £5 to £10 valuation.  The Land Commission have been <Col N="717" /> operating that policy for years.  In pursuit of that policy they have recreated in great measure more and more congestion.  They have brought about the decline in the number of persons living in rural Ireland, particularly in the west, through that type of mistaken policy.  They have helped to fill the emigrant ships not only with the breadwinners but in many cases entire families from the west.  That was all because of the fact that they pursued a mistaken policy in land distribution.</P>
    <P>At the time the decision was made just to give a few extra acres to the small-holders in the west, why could they not have decided that an economic holding was a holding that would give a reasonable livelihood to a family, irrespective of whether that family were living on the western seaboard, in the midlands or in the south of Ireland?  It was reasonable that the people who migrated from the west to the midlands should have been given what they have at the present time but the people who were left in the west of Ireland got, in very many cases, only one-third of what the migrants got in Meath.  To my mind that was waste of money on the part of the State and a cause of disappointment and dissatisfaction amongst those who remained in the west.</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue that these people were satisfied when they got these few acres.  My experience of meeting people in these congested areas always has been that they will take an acre or two acres and be very thankful for getting it.  They do not realise, or perhaps, do not admit they do realise, that what they are getting is not a solution of their economic ills. They are in such dire need of some assistance that they will take an acre or two and then they are left there with that for the rest of their lives, with no credit facilities and no guidance on agricultural lines.  The result has been the disappearance of the best type of rural family.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to be quite clear that if this section is being given to him, and that if he is to say that the new policy is the family farm, they will expect the Minister to take the necessary steps to bring into the <Col N="718" /> Land Commission pool of land all the land which can be acquired or which comes on the market in order to have available a sufficient acreage of the right quality to enable economic holdings to be established in the congested areas and outside them.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies are suspicious of the fact that the Minister is given certain powers in this section.  I have no objection because my belief is that the more we can pin responsibility on a Minister who is responsible to the House, the better for democracy as we know it.  It is much better to have the Minister forced&mdash;I am saying nothing critical of the present holder of the office; this applies to whatever Minister is in charge&mdash;to be responsible to the House rather than have a Minister saying: &ldquo;I have no function.  This is a matter for the Land Commission and all I can do as Minister is refer the Deputy's representations to them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am satisfied this is a step in the right direction because it means that more control can be exercised by the House.  We always have the right as Deputies to put down questions and probe what is behind a ministerial decision.  We had an example earlier today of a Deputy accusing the Minister, and stating that other members of the House had brought pressure to bear to have certain lands acquired. As it stands, if any pressure is being brought to bear, I presume it is being done behind the scenes with the Land Commission but what I want is, in future if pressure is brought to bear, that we shall be able to ask questions here and pin responsibility on the Minister.  After the passage of this section he cannot say: &ldquo;I have no function with regard to declaring particular areas to be congested areas.&rdquo;  He cannot say: &ldquo;It was the Land Commission on their own initiative or as a result of their own investigation who decided to declare a certain part of a county to be a congested area.&rdquo;  In future, any decision of that kind will be the responsibility of the Minister and that is as it should be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to what Deputy McQuillan has said regarding congested areas.  I do <Col N="719" /> not accept his interpretation of the manner in which Section 4 will operate. In Section 4, it is stated that (a) a county or portion of a county specified in the Second Schedule to this Act shall be declared a congested area and (b) that the Minister shall have power to declare a congested area such other area as he may from time to time consider to be a congested area.  I feel the proper interpretation of that is that while we can have counties or parts of counties already included in the congested areas, the Minister will, at any time if he gets reports from his inspectors that certain parts of other counties are congested, declare these areas to be congested areas.  If this Bill were law now, he could, within a week if he so wished, declare certain areas to be congested areas.</P>
      <P>I am particularly interested in this because certain areas in my constituency are congested and I am naturally anxious to see that whatever benefits accrue to an area that is declared congested will accrue to the people in the areas I have in mind. There are very obvious benefits for an area declared congested and these are found in other parts of the Bill.  In my constituency where an area is congested, it is absolutely essential that if an estate becomes available, it should be acquired by the Land Commission and divided among the congests in the area because, in my county, which is an intensive tillage area, if land which was being taken in conacre by small uneconomic holders is taken over by one individual and farmed by him, it means that land which was available for a considerable time to these uneconomic holders is no longer available to them.  It is tantamount to taking away their livelihood, something I am most anxious to avoid.</P>
      <P>In case it might be felt that the interpretation given by Deputy McQuillan to this section would be accepted throughout the country as the true one, I merely spoke on this to say that, in my view, his interpretation is not correct and that my definition is the correct one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection to <Col N="720" /> this section can be crystallised in my general objection to the Bill.  I think it is complete &ldquo;cod&rdquo; and we have been too long talking &ldquo;cod&rdquo; here in regard to the uneconomic holders in congested areas.  I have watched, in intimate association and connection with the Land Commission, the spread of rural slums over a number of years and I cannot visualise the power the Minister seeks in this section as being anything more than a carrot to be dangled before the people so that Deputies behind the Minister will be able to say to the people who cannot get land: &ldquo;Oh, but there is section 4 of the Bill under which the Minister may, if he thinks fit, declare areas to be congested.&rdquo;  Is it not time somebody like the Minister, with experience of the difficulties that have arisen over the years owing to this dangling of the carrot before uneconomic holders, got down to realities and figured out the maximum number of economic holdings he can make and determine a reasonable size for them?</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly on this subject. The time has come when somebody should do some forthright, positive thinking outside the cumbersome, creaking machine of Land Commission acquisition and distribution.  It has been a painfully slow process and in many cases it was grossly unfair and, let me say without hesitation, manipulated, despite the fact that the Minister has no control over the very strongly political lines of distribution. That is the situation among the people in the congested districts.  I am proud to represent one of the hardest working congested districts in the country, where the people have waited so long for this alleged distribution of land that, as Deputy McQuillan has so rightly said, many of them have emigrated because of lack of hope that their holdings would ever be integrated into economic entities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would cheerfully give the Minister all the powers he wants if I felt he would make an effort to do something practicable about a reasonably speedy redistribution of land.  As he knows well, I never had any sympathy for the non-occupying rancher: I have never had any sympathy for the <Col N="721" /> rancher and his dog.  There are many tracts of land throughout the length and breadth of Ireland which I should like to see distributed to ease the lot of the many thousands of smallholders like those in west Cork.</P>
    <P>If he is to get any good out of this Bill, the Minister should ensure that his impetus and direction are towards getting something done and not continuing to talk about it, because throughout the congested districts he is familiar with and in my own congested areas, particularly in the wilder fastnesses of Berehaven and the still wilder districts of Bantry, there are people who have been years and years waiting for some amelioration of their distress.</P>
    <P>There are many people who have been living under wretched conditions to whom even five, ten or 15 acres of ground would make a considerable difference.  That is the type of thing I want to see tackled, not with pious promises but through the reality of land distribution.  Yet I am afraid that this Bill is just another sop to politicians with no practical reality or real promise of benefit for the people whom it is supposed to be aimed at.  I submit this will provide us only with further difficulties of interpretation, further problems of a technical nature created by what I have already described as the most cumbersome, lazy-minded, inept organisation&mdash;the Irish Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister is prepared to use this section for the purpose of putting drive into efforts to ameliorate the lot of smallholders, this is only another idle moment, more waste of parliamentary time, dangling another carrot before the people we should be trying to keep at home.  Whether we like to accept it or not, the endeavour and the drive have gone from our people in the fastnesses.  If we are sincere in our avocation we should get down to the job of making economic the small-holdings throughout the land, whether they be in Castletownbere, Connemara or even in the farflung fastnesses of Donegal.  Our efforts should be bent towards making their lot a little better.  They are the people who are getting none of the benefits of what we <Col N="722" /> like to call the hum of industrial development.  They are getting none of the 12 per cent rises.  They have to work, day in day out, in the hazards of their calling&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is why I am anxious to press here that all the ranches, as we call them, should be taken over and divided.</P>
      <P>In my question today, I pointed to an area of 1,000 acres of land.  The Minister seemed to be happy about two-thirds of that acreage and I feel sure the balance will become available.

      <P>I have been here 30 years and I have always found that that clause has been complied with. <Col N="723" /> There are many areas which the Minister will have to declare as congested under the powers he is taking here. For instance, the whole stretch of country from the bounds of Kerry, through Newmarket, into Kanturk and Boherbue can be regarded as a congested district.  I do not believe there is a farm of more than 100 acres to be found in it.  Steps will have to be taken to see that every holding taken over in that area is devoted to the relief of congestion.  If there still is not enough land, existing holders there will have to be shifted to other areas in order to clear up the mess that has been there for a long number of years.

      <P>Section 4 is probably one of the most important sections in the Bill as it is clearly defined therein that the Minister may declare a county, or a portion of a county, to be a congested district.  Then it goes on to state the reasons to which the Minister will have regard when making his order declaring an area to be a congested district.  I put it to the Minister, in all seriousness, that every Deputy is most enthusiastic about solving the problem of congestion.  One Minister is as anxious to see this problem solved and settled as another.  But, if we are to get down to solid facts in relation to the problem of congestion, as it exists in this country today, we must realise that if we had the entire Six Counties of Northern Ireland&mdash;the Six Counties of Ulster&mdash;taken in tomorrow morning, uninhabited, there still would not be enough land in those six counties to solve the congestion problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must bear in mind that an amount of work has already been carried out by the Land Commission regarding the congested districts defined in the Bill.  There is a tremendous amount of work still to be done in that regard when we see that the entire province of Connacht, at the moment, is not alone an undeveloped area, but is a complete province for the purpose of this Bill. In relation to land congestion, the entire province of Connacht is a congested district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We see in the <i>Statistical Abstract of Ireland,</i> 1960, that Connacht is shown as having, in 1955, 99,823 holdings.  We see here that 19,514 of those holdings do not exceed 10 acres each, that 12,217 holdings do not exceed 15 acres <Col N="725" /> and that 36,121 holdings have between 15 acres and 30 acres each.  That entire province comes within the scope of this section, and comes within the power of the Minister to be relieved of the congestion problem in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We now come to the counties of Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal. County Monaghan is not referred to in the Bill.  When this section is passed I recommend that the Minister should add considerably to the 1909 list of congested districts, as referred to in the Second Schedule of the Bill because the counties of Monaghan and Cavan are not included.  Those counties are very similar to the counties of Connacht.  We have 51,767 holdings in the counties of Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal and of those 15,247 holdings do not exceed 10 acres, 6,146 holdings do not exceed 15 acres.  That shows us that in two counties, which are not congested districts for the purposes of this Bill, we have a congestion problem as urgent to be solved as we have in the entire province of Connacht.</P>
    <P>I want to make reference in regard to congestion to the Land Commission Report of 1954-55.  We read in that report the comment of Commissioner Kevin O'Sheil and Mr. O'Brien, Secretary of the Land Commission. They expressed an opinion as to what an uneconomic holding was and they so decided that where a holding is at least of sufficient size and character to support, within its boundaries, a man and his wife in full comfort it is called an economic holding.  When it falls below that level it is known as an uneconomic holding.  Both the former Commissioner O'Sheil and Mr. O'Brien are men of authority in this matter.  We see then, when these men expressed that opinion in the Land Commission Report of 1954-55, that practically all the holdings under £20 valuation must be regarded as uneconomic holdings.  If we are to go on that, and I presume that we could not possibly go on higher authority, there are some 270,000 uneconomic holdings, which represents 25 per cent of all agricultural holdings in this country.  That is an astonishing problem of congestion to be tackled.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="726" /> There must be, in addition to that, throughout the country, what we can describe as an astonishing number of dwarf holdings from £1 to £4 valuation and from £5 to £6 valuation and they will all have to be tackled in order to make them economic holdings.  You have the special circumstances of the congest: he has to obtain work either on bog development schemes, county council road work or he has to seek alternative employment in the interval between selling his very small holding and harvest time.  He cannot possibly live on such a very small holding.  Therefore, the Land Commission have the job of solving this problem and putting the congests, who are in those dwarfed holdings at the present time, in such a position that they can get a living from the land.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself is very familiar with the seriousness of this matter because, speaking here on this problem on the 19th July, 1961, he said:</P>
    <P>I referred in my opening statement to the fundamental job of the Land Commission which is the relief of congestion in this country.  We estimate that there are between 60,000 and 80,000 uneconomic land owners in this country and these are the first charge on the land of Ireland that may be available for the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>That shows that the Minister is not waiting until today to know the very difficult job that lies ahead of him in an effort, under this section, to solve this very serious problem.  Whilst we know the seriousness of the problem in the west of Ireland and in Cavan, Monaghan and elsewhere we often hear it stated that those farmers are unscientific in their methods and that they are not hard workers.  They have often been described as lazy.</P>
    <P>I want to say for the records of this House that if the owners of those small farms had been lazy, they would have disappeared long ago but because of the hard work, because they were good economists and because they were not afraid to work on the land, many of them are still there.  Otherwise, they <Col N="727" /> would have disappeared long ago like many who were much better off and who have disappeared.  They survived because they were first-class economists and hard workers.  Because these people have succeeded in holding on to their small holdings, they should be encouraged.  Their roots are in the land.  An effort should be made to keep them on the land rather than encourage them to leave it.</P>
    <P>When using his powers under this section to declare an area a congested district, the Minister should take into consideration the commonsense recommendations of the Committee on Small Farms and the recommendations of the NFA, and any legislation he introduces should refer to the country as a whole.  Because of the seriousness of the problem of congestion, legislation should cover not only the areas listed in 1909 as congested but the entire country.  I have stated that before and the Minister knows my views on it.  It is regrettable that the terms of Section 4 allows the Minister to pick out any area he desires.  We heard Deputy Faulkner and Deputy Donegan from Louth speak of congestion in that county.  I would not be surprised if Deputy Crinion tells us there is congestion in Kildare and Westmeath, as I know there is.</P>

      <P>That may or may not be so.  The fact remains that we have this great problem of congestion.  I hope the Government will not take advantage of this Bill to tell every landowner outside the prescribed congested districts that they will get land.  On the statistics placed before us in 1960, land is not available to relieve congestion to the fullest extent.  When making orders under this section, the Minister must have regard to the size of the holding, the <Col N="728" /> quality of the land and the various types of farming carried out in different districts.  Are there any other ways in which the Minister can be influenced to make an order?  The making of an order declaring an area a congested district is something that must be given every consideration. Due notification should be given to Deputies of the Minister's intention to make an order, and that should be given in advance of making an order. I asked the Minister on the last day is there any sound reason why the order should not be laid on the Table of the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome this section because the Land Commission have created large numbers of uneconomic holdings throughout the country, particularly on the eastern seaboard and in my constituency of Kildare.  We have been told from across the House that priority must be given to the places mentioned in the Second Schedule.  I should like to take the definition I feel the Minister has in mind&mdash;that he is free to declare any area a congested area.  I know some areas between Maynooth and Dunboyne where there is a whole series of Land Commission holdings from 22 <Col N="729" /> to 30 acres.  There is no hope of giving them extra land.  However, this section affords the Minister an opportunity of giving more land to people and of declaring an area like that a congested district.  A number of other areas in the constituency come to mind: around Kilmeige, Robertstown; around Newtown, near Kilcock and near Sallins.  I should like the Minister to bear those areas in mind.</P>
      <P>This section was brought in specifically to enable the Land Commission to undo the bad work they did in the past by creating those congested areas. Some people have said they do not like the Minister having this power of declaring an area a congested district. But who should have it?  It is the Minister who is responsible to this House for the working of the Land Commission.  Therefore, this power must be vested in him.  This is a very welcome section which gives the Minister power to undo the wrongs done by the Land Commission over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>): I again plead with the Minister to consider dealing with the entire country rather than the areas outlined under the 1909 Act.  I was surprised at the argument of Deputy Crinion who comes from Kildare.  He seems to support the notion that the delineation of the congested areas should lie entirely in the hands of the Minister as and when he thinks fit.  None of us will know when the Minister will declare these other areas outside those scheduled as congested areas.  He may declare them next month, next year, or in two years.  He will give us no indication when he is likely to do so. I suppose we may assume his attitude will be determined to a certain extent by financial considerations.  I fail to see why some special treatment should be given to congested areas in one county and not in another.  We are all Irishmen.  I fail to see why this particular treatment, which sounds like favouritism, should be given to one county rather than another.  In my own county there are large areas which could be regarded as congested.  I do not see why my county should not <Col N="730" /> receive the same favoured treatment as, say, Roscommon, or any other county mentioned in the Bill.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Flanagan said, a final solution to land congestion is not possible.  We have not enough land to meet the problem; yet we are asked to believe that by the Minister's approach of picking out certain areas, he will solve the problem.  Even the problem in areas mentioned in the Second Schedule cannot be solved. There is no final solution to land congestion because there is not enough land.  The Minister tries to give the impression that when he has solved the problem in those areas, he will proceed to the rest of the country. He also seems to gloss over the fact that in those areas there are vast expanses in which there is no congestion.  I cannot understand why he does not list the congested areas in the entire country and then deal with them.</P>

      <P>We have over 13,000 holdings in Cavan, and the number of holdings under £30 valuation is roughly five-sixths of the total.  That figure in itself should bring home to Deputies that there is tremendous congestion in my county.  We have scarcely 30 farms with valuations of over £200.  Some holdings range from £2 to £5 valuation, and we have over 1,000 holdings with valuations from £1 to £4.  I know the Minister has a very difficult problem since there are <Col N="731" /> 60,000 uneconomic holdings, and I fully realise that in this Bill he is making a tremendous effort to try to grapple with the problem.  When it is law, it will not be possible to sell any holding without the Land Commission knowing of it and giving their opinion as to whether it would be suitable for acquisition.</P>
      <P>This piece of legislation will be very important to my county because we have been suffering from the problem of congestion for generations.  The Minister visited my county and remarked on the great similarity between the small holdings in that county and in his own.  We suffer from the added disadvantage that we have no outlet to the sea.  We are not disgruntled or complaining.  We are a hard-working section of the community.  We are small farmers who carry on mixed tillage and dairy farming, and we are very interested in this Bill, and particularly in the portion which says &ldquo;such other area as may from time to time be declared by order of the Minister to be a congested area&rdquo;.  I appeal to the Minister to include my constituency in that provision.</P>

      <P>This section purports to deal with what in fact is set out in it.  A congested area for the purposes of this Act shall be a county or portion of a <Col N="734" /> county specified in the Second Schedule of this Act.  This proposition has been debated <i>ad nauseam</i> as to the sinister motives that guided me in writing into this Act what is comprised in the Schedule.  In fact, congested areas, as defined in this Act, was taken word for word out of the Land Act, 1909.  Might I remind the House that the gentleman who introduced this particular Land Act, Mr. Birrell, was a Liberal.  Any Deputy, such as Deputy P. Hogan, who seems completely unaware of the reasons for applying all the Land Acts up to now to these congested areas and for giving them priority is either completely ignorant of the land laws and the land history of this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or of the reasons why these areas are deserving of priority and are entitled to priority. That is the reason, too, why these congested areas are included in this Bill.  To start off with, they are the places in which, because of our history, the most intensive congestion in our country exists.  That is why all the different Land Acts, and Land Commission policy, were directed towards ameliorating the law in some way, in so far as they could go, for these people and for the introduction of such schemes as the migration scheme, and so on, down through the years.</P>
      <P>The other enabling subsection is subsection (1) (b) enabling the Minister for Lands from time to time to declare by order a new congested area.  The reason for that is quite obvious.  Indeed, many Deputies have welcomed the provision.  I am perfectly satisfied that if that subsection were not in this section I should have amendments from all sides of the House to include some such power in the section.  I must concede straight away that there are pockets in the non-congested counties in which congestion exists.  The Land Commission operate in all of these counties from time to time, recognising that there are in different areas in these counties certain pockets of congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So soon as the Land Commission are <Col N="735" /> geared in any particular area to report to the Minister for Lands that they can deal with a certain congestion problem in a non-congested county, the Minister, under the power here, would declare that area a congested area.  For certain purposes, a particular townland where there is acute congestion might be picked out.  The general powers exercisable by the Land Commission under the provisions of this Act will be applied to that area.  As Deputies who study this Act know, there are enabling powers for the Land Commission to give certain help to people to solve their congestion problem.  As the Land Commission work proceeds apace in the non-congested counties, no doubt recommendations will come up from time to time from interested parties to have a particular townland or area in a particular county declared congested for the purpose of applying to it the benefits of this Act to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to deal in much detail with subsection (2) of this section because, of course, naturally the Minister would have to have regard to the size of the holdings, the quality of the land and the type of farming carried on in an area to be declared a congested area.  It is necessary for me to point out to the House that what may be a family farm in one part of the country, having regard to the type of soil, the land use, convenience of markets, and so on, would not be regarded as an economic unit in perhaps a more remote part of the county with a different soil type. What is conceived here is what every one of us knows.  Consider what we would regard as a congested area and by that I do not say it would be necessary to have rundale or intermixed plots.  I am quite sure this section will be exercised by any Minister for Lands on the recommendation of his staff as they recommend, step by step, to extend the reliefs given under this Bill to congested areas to non-congested areas.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McQuillan pointed out, from time to time, whatever Minister is here will have questions on the Order Paper either asking him about or bringing to his attention the acute <Col N="736" /> congestion existing in a particular place in a non-congested area or, alternatively, questioning why the particular Minister did, in fact, declare an area a congested area under the powers envisaged here.  Whatever Minister may occupy the position, either myself or any of my successors, will have to justify his decision on the use of this power to this House.  That, of course, is the answer to all the different allegations that have been made here that the power will be exercised by a Minister for Lands for personal reasons or because of political pressure that might be brought to bear upon him.  The purpose of the final subsection here is merely to make the rules flexible&mdash;that any order made under it may be revoked, changed or substituted.  That explains the enabling powers contemplated under section 4 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not think any good purpose would be served by having a rehash of what I said on the different amendments to this section or going over all the repetitive arguments made by different Deputies on the amendments to this section.  I do not know that I should treat Deputy Seán Collins's allegations in any serious vein.  He suggested that the Land Commission is manipulated on completely political lines and that it is a large inept organisation that never did anything. The Deputy must be completely unaware of the work that has been done by the Land Commission down the years for the relief of congestion in the congested districts and outside them.</P>
    <P>Let me say also to any critics of the area of migrants' holdings that the people who were brought there in these area migrations from the different parts of the western seaboard were at least brought into conditions that were one thousand times better than what they left and the little patches they left behind them contributed in their way towards relieving their neighbours.  Deputies are inclined to forget that but of course we are living in a different day and age.  The new family farm which I have laid down has not, incidentally, got anything to do with this Bill because that is already in force in a policy directive <Col N="737" /> from me to the Land Commission. The directive is that where the land is available, that should be the standard to be achieved, a holding of 40 or 45 acres of reasonably good land.</P>
    <P>Let me say also that the previous standard holding of 33 acres of first-class land, or its equivalent, worked out in actual practice in many instances at farms of 40 acres or more.  What the new concept in actual practice is getting around is the fact that in congested areas people who had already been dealt with by the Land Commission, or laid off in holdings of up to £10 valuation, were excluded. Nobody has suggested&mdash;I, least of all&mdash; that 45-acre holdings can be provided for the whole of the community who do not already occupy such holdings or holdings up to that standard.  The aim of the new policy is that that standard should be achieved where land is available.</P>

      <P>The case was made by Deputy Dolan for Cavan and of course it is true to say&mdash;I think I have already said it&mdash;that if this provision were not in this section, we would have had many Deputies from different sides of the House putting down amendments in order to have a similar provision inserted.  That is the section in a nutshell.  It is a very essential section and it is particularly essential to deal with these isolated pockets in the non-congested counties.  There may be other sections of the Bill in respect of which Deputies may claim that there are matters of principle or land law to be argued but I suggest that this is purely a procedural or enabling section and no matter of any moment arises from it except to enable the Minister, as he and his staff are able to do it, to apply the benefits of the Bill to congested pockets outside the congested areas.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, after line 30 to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iii)  the amount of an advance under this section;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole scheme is intended to assist the small to moderate farmers to better themselves by moving out of a congested area where the possibilities of expansion are negligible and where the <Col N="739" /> competition for available land is already too intense.  It is not intended to be used by big farmers as a convenient source of credit.  I consider therefore that from time to time it may be necessary to fix the maximum amount of money which one individual may get.  This is really a drafting amendment to remove doubts, in case there were any doubts, that the Land Commission had not the power to put on that limit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment relates to the amount of the advance under this section.  In the case of a congest who is giving up his holding in order to obtain one elsewhere on money advanced by the Land Commission, will he bear in mind the question of that congest requiring a certain amount of capital for the stocking and the working of the land?  Does the Minister propose to cut him down, so to speak, to the mere market value of the holding?  Or does he propose to make additional allowances in the case of a congest who surrenders his holding under section 5 and who will then be dependent on the amount of money provided for him by the Minister?</P>
      <P>Certain considerations must be taken into account.  The Minister will have the regulating of the amount that will be made available to such a congest.  The congest may be going to a new district; he may have to clear up outstanding debts before he leaves his present district.  He may need moneys to cope with certain domestic worries before going to a new holding.  Will additional allowances be available over and above the amount paid for the holding?  Will the cost of transfer be covered, including the transfer of stock, equipment, implements, and so forth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should consider this aspect sympathetically and, if there is not already provision in the Bill, then he should take steps between now and the Report Stage to ensure that such a situation will be adequately covered.  Cases are found to arise in which further financial assistance over and above the market value of <Col N="740" /> the holding will be absolutely essential.  If the congest migrates to a new district, he will probably be unknown in the area, unknown to the bank and unknown to the shopkeepers.  He will have to be put in the position of being able to purchase stock for his new holding and putting the land into good heart with fertilisers and manures for the purpose of tillage. The financial circumstances of congests are, on the whole, bad because of the standard of living which they have to endure.  I would urge the Minister to be generous in his consideration of the financial circumstances of such people.</P>

      <P>First, Deputy Flanagan's remarks are more relevant to the section than they are to this amendment.  For the purpose of the amendment, we can theoretically visualise a man selling 17 acres to the Land Commission and then demanding from the Land Commission the necessary finances to buy out the Aga Khan, or someone like that.  That is the technical reason for this amendment; it is to ensure that the Land Commission can limit the amount made available. Having said that, I can deal with the other matters raised on the section itself.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on the section.  They may clear the air.  I welcome the idea behind the section.  A great deal of good may be done under the section, provided the dead hand of finance does not operate.  In the 1950 Land Act, there was a section giving authority to the Land Commission to move into the open market and purchase suitable farms on which migrants or suitable tenants could be placed.  The feeling of the House at the time was that that could be a very useful provision in helping to relieve the pressure from congestion.  In fact, we found that little or no use was made of the <Col N="742" /> section.  I gather finance was the major obstacle.  Section 5 of this Bill appears, on the face of it, to offer considerable possibilities.  Again, unless the Minister is in a position to say he has control here, a control which was not available to his predecessors, over the purse, his power will be greatly limited.</P>
      <P>One thing I like about the section is the fact that the Land Commission and the Minister are given a certain amount of flexibility in dealing with this particular aspect of land provision.  Because it is a new approach it is highly desirable that there should be flexibility in the operation of the section.  However, I should like the Minister to let us know how far he can intervene or interfere in the actual workings of this section.  Does it bring the Minister closely into the question of land acquisition or the question of the suitability of tenants in any way? That is something I should not like to see brought about.  Naturally I want to see the Minister responsible to the House for policy, the broad, general lines of Land Commission activity, but I should not like to see the Minister with any closer association with land acquisition or intervening in the functions of the Land Commission. Perhaps the Minister would clarify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has his nose in here again, in subsection (2) paragraph (a), where his consent is necessary in relation to regulations made by the Minister for Lands.  I should like to know whether Deputies would be in a position to question the activities of the Land Commission through Parliamentary questions, and what would be the position in regard to questions asked in this House on the activities of the Land Commission arising from their operations under section 5.  One thing we must guard here is the right to probe into what is happening and, apart from the fact that the Minister himself may not have functions in regard to the day-to-day administration of the Land Commission and the decisions as to who is suitable for allocations of land, at the same time, the right of a Deputy to put questions to the Minister here that he can answer on behalf of the Land <Col N="743" /> Commission is a desirable thing to keep.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not enlarging on it.  I am simply asking for clarification of difficulties I see.  I want to see how far we can go here in questioning the Minister.  Will we be meeting opposition to putting down questions on this because it is new? There has been a tendency, as we all know, with recent legislation to restrict the powers of Deputies with regard to eliciting information.  There are other Ministers coming into the House and getting Bills through I might almost say under false pretences by calming the fears of Deputies and telling them: &ldquo;It is all right.  When the Bill is passed Deputies will be able to get information on the functions of the particular body set up.&rdquo;  No sooner have the Bills become Acts than the Ministers disown any responsibility whatever.  I do not say that will happen under this but I should like the Minister to indicate to the House whether or not he contemplates any changes in this that would restrict the right of reply to questions on the activities of his Department in connection with this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea behind this section is good and as far as the Labour Party are concerned they will encourage the Government and the Department in every way possible to show energy, courage and enthusiasm in the administration of the powers which come within this section.  It is only one of the many weapons in the armoury to tackle this problem which has been in the country for generations.  The Minister himself mentioned that the existing congested areas were <Col N="744" /> embodied in an Act of Parliament passed in 1909 by a former regime in this country.  The situation may not be as bad now, perhaps because so many people have been driven out of the country, but the fact that a definition of what certain areas were in 1909 still stands is a terrible indictment of activity or lack of activity on the part of the Land Commission over the years.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission should utilise section 5 to the utmost and take advantage of the elasticity which is there or which has been suggested should be made available.  As far as elasticity is concerned, there should be no fear of the members of this House in the mind of the Department, the people who will be responsible for the implementation of the section.  The former attitude of cautiousness which has motivated the people responsible down through the years should be shed.  The idea: &ldquo;Do not do anything for fear you would make a mistake&rdquo; should be banished as far as the Land Commission is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not be so critical of Deputy Seán Collins's remarks here on Land Commission activities. In many instances their activities have been exasperatingly slow and their sins of omission have been painful.  When it is all boiled down a great deal of the blame must attach to the Governments because no matter how well-intentioned the officials may have been at times and no matter what enthusiasm they may have felt about the acquisition of certain lands, and so forth, if the old life line of finance was withdrawn from them there was very little they could do.  I am asking for an assurance from the Minister that in regard to any restrictions which may be imposed from time to time, this is one of the last sections where we shall see such restrictions in operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section could be responsible for doing a great deal of good and, therefore, I have very little objection to it.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he can give a guarantee that he will not find himself cut down by the Minister for Finance in the necessary funds for the <Col N="745" /> making of these advances.  It is very important that the work of the Land Commission under this section should not be in any way hindered by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>We notice from the explanatory memorandum that it is proposed that a scheme should be operated by the Land Commission under which a progressive farmer, whose holding is situated in a congested area, could obtain a loan to enable him to purchase a viable farm of his own choice, his existing holding to be sold to the Land Commission for land settlement purposes.  There are a few points which I should like the Minister to clarify in relation to this section.  Assuming for a moment that a farmer living in a congested area and wishing to obtain a holding elsewhere is prepared to sell his congested holding to the Land Commission but feels that the Land Commission are not giving him what he considers to be the market value of his holding, what then happens?</P>
      <P>This is a case where the Land Commission will have to be extremely generous and will have to take into consideration the fact that if the land owner put his land up for sale in an area where there was very great congestion, he would receive twice the normal market value.  It is my experience as an auctioneer that in many cases where a small holding is put up for sale in an area where there is very great congestion, it will fetch what would be twice the normal market value.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission, therefore, will probably meet with many obstacles and difficulties in relation to the real value of land held by congests.  It is common knowledge that there is greater demand for land that is surrounded by congests than there is for land where the congestion problem is not so great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Land Commission go to pay for such land, will they be prepared to allow for the fact that, because of the demand for land in congested areas and the anxiety of congests to obtain land, the price should be higher?  If land is now selling at the rate of £120 per statute <Col N="746" /> acre, which, according to the Land Commission would be the market value, I venture to say that there are many instances of holdings being offered for sale in congested areas which, because of the anxiety on the part of congests to obtain land so that they may eke out a better livelihood, so that they may be able to supplement their family incomes, fetched up to £200 and £300 per acre.  The Land Commission must be aware of many such instances.</P>
    <P>That is why I should like to hear from the Minister how it is proposed to arrive at the value of a holding in a congested area.  The market value of land in congested areas has soared very high and is soaring higher.  That is where the demand is likely to be greatest.  The Land Commission may not realise the price which land is likely to fetch, particularly land which is about to be vacated by a congest who may be seeking a farm of his choice elsewhere.</P>
    <P>If a congest who is leaving a congested district has found a farm of his choice elsewhere, in an area not scheduled as a congested area, he may have to face very keen competition for it.  If the local people bid against him at an auction or otherwise, the fact that the Land Commission would be financing the congest will make it very difficult for others, who have not the backing of the Land Commission, to procure land.  I should like to know what the position is in relation to the value of the land which will be paid by the Land Commission to the congest and the amount they will pay in respect of the holding of his choice which he will purchase elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In relation to the scheme which will be operated by the Land Commission, Deputy McQuillan is right when he asks the Minister to what extent Deputies can query the existence and the terms of this scheme.  There will be little use in the Minister telling the House at a later stage that the Land Commission are operating the scheme and that he has no function in regard to it.  This is a scheme to be financed by the Minister for Finance and, although the scheme is being operated <Col N="747" /> by the Land Commission, the Minister has direct responsibility.</P>
    <P>Good can be done under this section.  The Minister will have more problems than one to deal with.  It is noted that an essential part of the loan arrangement is that the applicant's present holding be located in a congested area and that he should agree to sell it to the Land Commission for the relief of congestion.  Actual possession of a congested holding is not essential for the future use of a farm bought under the provisions of this section.  There is no reason why landless men could not be considered for a congested holding.  I put it to the Minister that there is nothing to stop a landless man from buying himself a small holding and thereupon describing himself as an uneconomic holder. Landless men should have equal rights with congests in regard to this matter. In rural Ireland, there are a very large number of people getting their living from the land who take land in conacre.  Many of them pay out very substantial sums of money each year for conacre.  It is well known that in some cases landless men can pay anything up to £500 per annum.  The Land Commission have been impressed by the activities of such people who derive their livelihood solely from agriculture.</P>

      <P>There is nothing to stop a landless man from buying a small holding and the moment he does so he becomes a congest.  I cannot see what the difference is.  The landless man who buys a very small holding becomes a congest and gets the full benefit of this section.  I think it is unreasonable in that regard.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to say what happens in the case of a smallholder who may be debarred from the benefits of this section because he is in England.  Will a smallholder who emigrated and is working in England at present be debarred from these benefits?  This may be the case of many from the west and elsewhere. They may be working in England, trying to earn enough capital to return and settle down at home.  It would be unfair if such people did not qualify.  The Minister must know of many such instances in congested areas and other areas.  Will they be considered for advances under section 5 for the purchase of a holding of their choice, or for the surrender of their holding to the Land Commission if they do not wish to return?</P>
      <P>In the case of a man who had had to go to England to earn a living, I should like the Minister to give us an assurance that if the man does not want to part with his holding but wants to return to it at a later stage, the Land Commission will not interfere with his holding without giving him the full benefit of this section.  If the Land Commission are prepared to assist him in financing the purchase of a farm of his choice on his return from England, that is all right, but if they are going to take steps to acquire the holding because of his absence in England&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The sections may not be going through as quickly as the Minister would like but as an Opposition, we have a duty to extract information and that is what we are trying to do.  I want to know will the Minister make any advances under this section to people who are in England and want to return to live on the land.  I think we should assist and encourage them in every possible way and financial provision should be made for the numerous smallholders who had to fly out of the country because they could not eke out an existence here.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I want to get some clarification of this matter.  I understand these loans will be administered by the Land Commission on the same lines as the Agricultural Credit Corporation works, free of any ministerial or political interference.  The Minister has mentioned <Col N="750" /> that it would be inappropriate to set out financial and administrative details in a rigid provision in the Bill and I take it he wants to wait until he drafts regulations under this section.  Could he tell us what he estimates, if he has made an estimate, the annual cost will be in hard cash of administering this novel scheme?  I am sure that when drafting the Bill he must have considered the cost and must have asked the Land Commission officials to give him an idea of what the amount would be in any year.  Can he give us any rough figure?</P>
      <P>I want to inquire also about the purchase of a farm from a man in a congested area and giving him money to buy a new farm.  If he is a smallholder and the Land Commission want to buy the holding from him and they want him to go out and buy a viable farm&mdash;or he wants to do so himself&mdash;and the Land Commission give him a loan, do we understand correctly that the general principle will apply and that the man will get the market value of his holding, whether it is big or small?  Is there any danger that pressure may be brought to bear on such a man in such a way that in order to get his loan, he might be forced into giving up his land at something less than the economic price?  Every effort should be made to avoid that situation and no pressure should be brought to bear on him through withholding the loan or anything of that kind.  That situation may not arise but it could arise and I ask the Minister to say if such a possibility is guarded against.</P>

      <P>The idea of giving power of self-migration was advocated by me for many years here.  I want to leave this section as flexible as possible as is set out in the explanatory memorandum.  That is why it is drafted in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like Deputies to be clear as to what we envisaged will happen under the section.  The enabling powers in this section will not have the effect that immediately seems to strike some Deputies.  The idea in the section will in many cases have to be sold to the individual farmers concerned. <Col N="751" />  What it does mean is that a progressive farmer in congested pockets will be enabled, with his own savings, to purchase an outside farm and surrender his own farm, at an agreed price, to the Land Commission. Let it be clearly understood that under the procedure envisaged in the section, the first thing that must be achieved is the agreement of the individual farmer concerned.  There must, first of all, be his agreement as to what price he is prepared to accept from the Land Commission for his land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Land Commission deal directly with him or with his solicitor or auctioneer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it matter?  In the ultimate, the dealing will be with the individual concerned.  The individual must agree.  We must have agreement with him on the actual price he is prepared to accept for his holding before we come to the stage of providing the loan for him to go out and solve his own congestion problem.  The individual who will be selected by the Land Commission must, in the first instance, be willing to avail of the scheme, to go outside and buy a farm of his choice.</P>
      <P>I should like Deputies to remember that when the Land Commission come to lend this man money, it is with a loan they are providing him.  They agree to purchase the farm he is leaving in the congested pocket.  They are prepared to make a loan available to him of whatever money he will need to purchase the new farm of which, of course, they will approve.  The individual is getting a loan of money.  He will be concerned&mdash;this is in answer to some of the arguments made here &mdash;to get the type of farm at the type of price he is satisfied to pay because it is he, the individual farmer, who will be paying the money in the ultimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is getting no present from the Land Commission except in so far as he can be satisfied he has got a good tempting price for the holding he is surrendering and that he is getting the <Col N="752" /> necessary financial accommodation to enable him to purchase the outside holding.  I cannot conceive the Land Commission selecting anyone under this scheme except good, go-ahead farmers, probably with what we in the west would call dry money of their own, who are willing to face circumstances and make progress for themselves.</P>
    <P>In a number of cases, farmers of that kind have already availed of such circumstances in local districts to try to help themselves in this way out of their own savings and with moneys they have got from relatives abroad and so forth.  At all events, the scheme will have the advantage that it is still another weapon in the hands of the Land Commission for dealing with acute congestion in the west.  There are many areas still left in the west where we have the rundale system and where rearrangement is necessary.  Every scheme of rearrangement entails the agreement of those who are left there. From time to time, we get questions in the House about land being a long time in the hands of the Land Commission. In some of those cases, the land is there because rearrangement schemes have failed.  Rearrangement schemes depend on the co-operation of the people concerned.  Under this scheme, where we might not succeed in getting the agreement of one or more individuals left behind, it might be possible, if they are progressive people and are willing to look for a holding outside, that they, too, would take advantage of the provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>In regard to the point made by Deputy McQuillan on the question of Parliamentary procedure, this provision would not in any way restrict present Parliamentary procedure.  I am so advised and I so accept.  I would, of course, say that in these cases there would be many dealings between individuals and the Land Commission that any Minister would not wish to disclose in the Dáil, or otherwise publicly, because circumstances will vary in different cases and family circumstances will sometimes arise.</P>
    <P>The ultimate fact remains that what the Land Commission will be concerned with and what the Minister for <Col N="753" /> Lands will be concerned with is to get people out of those congested pockets and enable the Land Commission to go ahead with rearrangement.  It may come as a shock to many Deputies to learn that in many instances, even with the prospect of a new holding, at the last moment people will refuse to accept.  Therefore, one of the urgent aims of the Land Commission will be to encourage people in such pockets of congestion to avail of the provisions of this section.</P>

      <P>The powers conferred here were never there before.  I am hoping many of them will.  Of course, many factors have changed.  For instance, when I first came into this House, in my part of the country it was most difficult to get people to accept migration, whereas now people from Kilcock in the midlands are as familiar down at fairs in the west of Ireland as the local people are.  As I might say, space has contracted so much during the past 15 to 20 years that people in the west do not regard the midlands or the eastern part of the country as such a foreign land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be drawn into combat on that score.  When it is suggested that the Land Commission must be generous in the operation of this scheme, we must remember it entails the taxpayer being generous also, and of course the Land Commission will have to pay the full market value for the surrendered farm. <Col N="754" /> By full market value, we mean the price the owner of the land is prepared to accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies argue that the Land Commission would not pay the market value for the surrendered holding, that the market value would be higher in a congested area, and it was suggested that the Land Commission might force the man to sell his land at less than market value. It is true that in areas where there are land-hungry men, land does fetch a high price.  The Land Commission realise that and where land is taken over, prices are fixed by the Appeals Tribunal.  Everybody knows that the market value of land varies from county to county, from townland to townland.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, the man must be satisfied with the price the Land Commission are prepared to offer before availing of this particular scheme.  He goes to purchase the outside holding of his own choice, with which he is satisfied, in the open market.  As some Deputy suggested here, he is in a stronger position because the Land Commission are behind him in providing a loan for this purpose and that would be an encouragement to other aspirants for such land.</P>
      <P>This is completely at variance with all the complaints we had in this House on my Estimate and by way of question&mdash;that one with a long purse, or the local gombeen man, can buy up any land that is going and prevent the small congest from improving his own lot by buying land.  Deputies cannot have it both ways.  If through this scheme we are in the position of putting this self-migrant, this man who is prepared to solve his own problem by borrowing money from the Land Commission, in a position to compete with the man with the long purse, then we are righting something that Deputies have been alleging, as long as I have been Minister for Lands, was a great wrong to the small farmer or the congest in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I can usefully add on this section.  It <Col N="755" /> is a new section which contemplates a new approach to the relief of congestion.  From the taxpayer's point of view, let me add something which I have not said before on this question. There is one big difficulty in so far as the working of this section is concerned: it will be up to the Land Commission to pick out the particular area where they will apply the benefits of this section.</P>
    <P>Having picked out that area, and having picked out the men who are prepared to take advantage of the provisions of this section, they will then be in the position to save, in my view, a lot of official time.  If people are familiar with the working of Land Commission officers in rural areas, they will realise, particularly where the Land Commission have been trying for years past to get a land settlement through, the amount of time that is inevitably wasted by continuing visits of the inspectorate staff to a particular area.</P>
    <P>For instance, a scheme may have failed five, six or eight years ago because two or three men were not prepared to co-operate in the rearrangement then proposed.  Then perhaps one man dies and the local Deputy, or somebody else, comes along to the Land Commission and says : &ldquo;I think they will agree now if you send a man there&rdquo;.  An official goes out and he comes up against the same trouble, without success or agreement being reached.  This same procedure is going on again and again, year after year, and we have all this waste of official time.  The fundamental reason for the failure of these rearrangement schemes, and the fundamental reason, in my experience, for the failure to achieve co-operation, is the scarcity of the essential commodity, which is the land available in the area.</P>
    <P>If the Land Commission in their wisdom now take any particular estate, with which they might be concerned, and if they realise that at least two men must leave that area before it is possible to reach an acceptable rearrangement scheme agreeable to those concerned, then they can use this section and can pick out two from that <Col N="756" /> area and say : &ldquo;Go ahead; will you agree on the prices for those two particular holdings?  If you see other holdings for sale at your price, you can purchase them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Then they do not need to come to that area until the land is available or until those concerned avail themselves of the new provisions under the self-migratory scheme.  For those reasons, I commend this section to the House and suggest that it will be of tremendous importance in enabling the Land Commission to deal with the real hard core of congestion in the congested counties and in those rundale estates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Land Commission will be preparing this scheme, will it be possible, because of the volume of queries which will be addressed to Deputies and Senators, for the Minister to circulate the draft scheme among members of the Oireachtas for their information?  A lot will depend on co-operation from public representatives, clergy and others, in order to enlighten people on it.  It is very desirable, when the scheme is designed, that we should know all about it so that we can inform our constituents.  This would be a great help if the Minister has no objection to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have no objection.  It is obvious that any Deputy in a congested area would know all about this scheme before the ink was dry.  That is all the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one snag in the scheme and I am sure the Minister realises it as well as I do.  As the regulations stand, there are only a certain number of areas designated as congested districts and these are set out in section 4 of the Second Schedule: Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, portion of County Clare and portion of west Cork.  I am quite sure that Deputies who represent those areas will agree that it is a wonderful thing that the Land Commission will not alone take the people who are living in congested areas out and give them lands in the midlands, but, in addition, <Col N="757" /> will now give them money to go to other parts of the country and bid against local people for farms of land which come on the market.  If the Minister uses his powers for the purpose of declaring other areas congested districts it will, to a certain extent, relieve the situation.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure he appreciates the position where at the present time if a small farm of land up to 30, 40 or 50 acres, which is considered a small farm in County Meath, comes on the market there will be a number of local people anxious to buy it.  There is the local man, who has an uneconomic holding.  There is the man who has gone to England, who came from farming stock and who has enough money to buy a farm.  There are the people who have been working locally as conacre farmers all their lives and they are anxious to obtain a bit of land.  They will come to the auction and they will bid.  If it were a big farm, they would not have a hope of getting it because they would not have the money, and with competition at the present time they would have no chance of buying it.  Those middle-sized farms to which the Minister has referred in this section, are the ones which the people who wish to become farmers, or who wish to make themselves economic holders, want to get. At present that is the only way in which the people I have described can obtain either holdings or additional holdings.  This section enables people who live in congested districts to go to the auctions in those areas and bid against the local people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I met a small farmer who had his eye on a farm which was expected to come up for sale within the next six or 12 months.  He told me : &ldquo;If it comes up before the Land Bill passes.  I will probably buy it; but if the Land Bill passes before it comes up for sale, it looks as if I will not be able to touch it.&rdquo;  He added something which I think was very true. He said it appears as if we have reached the stage where the only hope the man who lives in an area which is not a congested district&mdash;I refer particularly to Meath&mdash;has of getting land after this Bill passes is when <Col N="758" /> somebody dies belonging to him and leaves him the land.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not have looked at that aspect of the case.  I am not quarrelling with him for introducing this section, but he should have another look at it before the Bill goes through finally.  I am sure he will agree it is going to impose a very serious hardship on a decent, hardworking section of the community, unless the Minister feels it is not desirable that people who live outside congested districts should acquire land. I should hate to think that that was the view of the Minister or the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I do not want to comment on any other portion of the section.  I just want to find out from the Minister if he has considered that aspect and if there is any way in which he thinks he can prevent happening what I have just described.  I assure the Minister that in the areas not congested, we have hundreds of thousands of small farmers living on uneconomic holdings. They may not be living in the dire poverty in which the people in the west are living.  They may be trying to earn sufficient money to enlarge their holdings.  They may be holding on foolishly, under the impression that if an estate is divided, they will be given the attention to which they are entitled, but which, under present circumstances, they are not getting.</P>
    <P>The only hope they have had up to now is to save the money and purchase it.  If this section will prevent that, then I think the Minister is doing a disservice.  The people he is preventing from getting land are the progressive farmers.  I know a big number of them in Meath.  Those people have had to work for the money to buy land or to increase their holding.  Whether they purchase land or whether the Land Commission eventually gives it to them, they usually turn out to be good farmers.  They know what it is to work land.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to say whether or not he considers these people are being fairly treated under this section.  Maybe I have minister-preted the section completely.  Maybe <Col N="759" /> there is an angle I do not see; but reading it as I have, it looks to me as if money will be made available to certain selected individuals living in the congested areas to enable them to bid against the people who require land in areas where there is supposed to be no congestion or which are not listed as congested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The way the Deputy is interpreting the section is wrong.  Subsection (4) (a) provides that the holding of the tenant or proprietor must be situated in a congested area.  In a different district in one of the congested counties, he can avail of the provisions of this section if a farm is going.  Obviously, it would not be in his own parish, because otherwise he would not be scheduled to get help under this section, but in a place where the Land Commission wanted it.  The Deputy also seems to have missed the point that, when the farmer in the congested area is approved by the Land Commission for help under this section, an agreement is made about price, and when he goes to purchase an outside farm, he must tell the Land Commission inspector the farm he proposes to go for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that was obvious to everybody.  If the Deputy reads the section carefully, he will see his interpretation is not correct.  It is true under this section that, if there is a farm in any non-congested area and if the farmer is approved by the Land Commission for the purchase of that farm, they would give him the help contemplated under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with this land problem, the time has come to forget about borders.  Goodness knows, we have enough of them.  One just cannot put a wall around the position existing in any country.  The fact remains that we have these intensely congested pockets in the scheduled areas, and in order to do anything with what is left, some people must come out of these.  This is a way of dealing with the problem. <Col N="760" /> As Deputy Tully suggests, it is not the sons of local farmers who purchase holdings for sale in all cases.  On hundreds of occasions on this Estimate I have listened to the complaint about the man with the long purse buying up these holdings.  If that did not come from Deputy Tully, it certainly came from many Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It was alleged that it was the local man with 300 acres in the Deputy's constituency who bought up all the land available on the market and cut out the small man from purchasing.  Surely this provision is at least a method of dealing with that problem?  I said on the earlier section that the Minister for Lands can schedule congestion in any county outside the congested areas.  Immediately an area is scheduled, under section 4 all these provisions will apply to the full, the same as they are applicable now to the congested areas defined in the Bill.  That is the real answer to the Deputy's fears.  It is not contemplated that the whole of the west of Ireland, or those who would be approved under this section, would suddenly descend on the Deputy's constituency and buy up every piece of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to agree with the Minister that we should forget about borders.  I would abolish the border which says that only those designated here are entitled to this assistance.  If the Minister will do away with that border, he has an ideal opportunity of giving the same assistance to anybody entitled to land who wishes to acquire it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not know whether or not I stated that people with long purses were buying up land.  It is true people with long purses bought land which I brought to the notice of the Land Commission.  They were allowed to buy it.  However, I am not talking about those people.  I am talking about the small farmers and the landless men who have acquired sufficient money to buy land but who will be prevented from buying it because of the operation <Col N="761" /> of this section.  The Minister has not allayed my fears in that regard.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the issue from the Central Fund of the total amount of the Supplementary and Additional Estimates for the current year together with the amount of the Vote on Account for the coming financial year.  It also authorises the Minister for Finance to borrow up to the limit of these amounts and to issue such securities as he thinks fit for the purpose of such borrowing.</P>
      <P>The effect of the Bill is thus to make available the balance of the funds required for the supply expenditure of the current financial year and the amount estimated to be necessary to carry on the supply services next year in the period up to the passing of next year's Appropriation Act.</P>
      <P>It was indicated in the Taoiseach's statement of 23rd October last regarding the agreed arrangements for dealing with parliamentary financial business that the procedure on this Bill would follow the lines of previous years.</P>

      <P>The bill for which the Minister asks is, as all of us know without making any additional reference to it, a record one.  However, it is important in considering the size of the bill that we should compare like with like.  The habit that has grown up over the years&mdash;let me say at once to the Minister that it is a habit in which I concurred&mdash;of comparing in the Book of Estimates the figure for the forthcoming year with the figure for the previous year, as altered by Supplementary Estimates, is a bad one. There will be Supplementary Estimates in relation to this Book of Estimates also and to get a proper comparison of like with like, the comparison should be with the Book of Estimates issued last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the Minister required <Col N="762" /> £26,462,265 for capital services.  This year he required some £3,000,000 more : £29,349,890.  So far as capital services are concerned, we are all clear, I think, that the element of growth that is so necessary requires that we would have as high a programme of productive capital expenditure as the community can sustain.  No one will cavil at the amount of the capital programme.  We may differ about the proportion of that programme that is adequately productive; we may feel the proportion of that programme directed to social investment is not adequate; we may say certain of the items that are in the capital programme produced by the Government are not suitable for inclusion; but none of us will cavil at the amount of the capital programme, properly productive.</P>
    <P>On the capital side, therefore, it is more a matter for consideration at Budget time when we will have before us the White Paper in relation to the entire field of capital development in 1964-65.  I might add that I was at a meeting in the House earlier and I do not know if the Minister announced at Question Time the probable date of the Budget.</P>

      <P>I was going to ask would the Minister announce it now. That means that in a very short time we will get the White Papers dealing with projected capital expenditure during the coming year.  It is better to leave over any discussion on capital services until we see them in that picture at that time.  I must say I still think it is a pity that in the new arrangements we made for the financial business this year, we did not include a separate Capital Budget so that we could discuss separately our capital proposals for the forthcoming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the House are aware that it has always been my view&mdash;and it is even more my view now&mdash;that the amount of capital expenditure tends to rise, as it is rising to-day.  The objection to having our capital expenditure produced at the same time as current expenditure is that, naturally enough, the projected <Col N="763" /> capital expenditure tends to be clouded and overshadowed by the problems of personal taxation which all of us have to consider at that time.  The Minister was, perhaps, circumscribed when he came into office in that he did not feel able to adopt the suggestion I had left behind, and made public, just before the end of 1956.  A lot of water has gone under the bridge since then, but I would earnestly ask him to reconsider that proposal and see if it could be brought into operation, so that we could get a more objective and satisfactory scrutiny of our public capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>Current expenditure in this Book of Estimates is now to run at £16 million more than it was to run in last year's Book of Estimates.  Comparing like with like, we are faced with an increase of £16 million on the Book of Estimates alone.  Of course that is not the only question.  It was made perfectly clear that there is nothing for CIE in the Book of Estimates.  We all know that a substantial sum is bound to be included for CIE.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if I am correct in thinking that the 12 per cent wage round is not included in the Book as printed and, in consequence, some £8 million more has to be included on that account.  I think the Minister indicated in introducing the Vote on Account that it was not included at that time.  I take it I am right&mdash;and the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;in saying that it has not been included since the green sheet of the Vote on Account.</P>
    <P>The total of the Estimates is, of course, further altered by the expenditure of £1,280,000 for the new method of accounting in the Post Office.  The Minister is entitled to make a deduction of that amount.  I saw the Minister being referred to one of the introductory pages of the Book of Estimates in relation to the question of remuneration.  I do not know whether it could happen that any comment in the introductory pages would be on page 6 of the volume because there is no page 6 in the volume that came into me.  Mine goes from page 5 to page 7.</P>

      <P>I have not got a page 6.  As I understood the Minister on the Vote on Account, he said that the remuneration charge all over would mean about £8 million.  If I am right in that, it means that these current Estimates show an increase approximately, for budgetary purposes, of £23 million &mdash;£16 million on the face of the current Estimates themselves, £8 million for additional remuneration, less £1¼ million for the postal charges which are included and which I understand will come in under non-tax revenue.  That is a substantial sum and one which arises to a very large extent because of the policy the Government themselves have introduced.</P>
      <P>Twelve months ago or thereabouts, the Taoiseach and the Government endeavoured&mdash;wrongly in my view&mdash;to take one sector of the community and to impose a wages standstill on that sector.  They were shown that they were wrong and ultimately they abandoned that erroneous policy.  Notwithstanding that, prices remained virtually steady up to the time of the Budget and indeed after the Budget.</P>
      <P>In the Budget debate last summer, and subsequently, we made it perfectly clear to the Government that we felt the type of Budget the Minister had introduced was bound to start an inflationary spiral that would mean that he would be trying to chase it himself in relation to Governmental expenditure and, in addition, there was the gravest danger that such an inflationary spiral might harm the employment of many of our people engaged in the export business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told at that time by the Taoiseach, by the Minister and by the Government as a whole, that the fears <Col N="765" /> we expressed were entirely wrong.  We were told that there was no danger whatever.  We were told that productivity had so increased that it could take account not merely of the turnover tax &mdash;which was the commencement, in my view, of this extraordinary spiral&mdash;but could also take account of a substantial increase in wages.  Indeed, the Taoiseach staked his reputation on the fact that the increases that had come about by Government action and which he urged employers to grant would not involve any increase in the cost of living and would not, therefore, harm anything that might ultimately affect our possibilities and our opportunities to compete in the export market.</P>
    <P>I must confess frankly that the Taoiseach was most successful in choosing his timing and in getting across his propaganda in that respect but the chickens are now coming home to roost.  The Minister has now to face a bill of some £23 million odd. Part of the result of Government policy is the fact that not a single day passes that the newspapers or the radio does not have to announce a tale of soaring prices, soaring all because of a policy initiated by the Government some ten or 11 months ago.</P>
    <P>I warned this House a week before the recent by-elections that bread would increase in price.  The Tánaiste said it was a lying jade.  When I told the House that there would be an increase in the price of bread, it was a nice polite way of saying I was lying.  In fact, I was right.  Within three days of polling day, the price of bread increased.  That was only the first increase in the price of bread. There will be a further increase when the increased price of materials that go into the bread come to be considered in relation to the finished article.</P>
    <P>It does not matter what item of daily use we consider&mdash;bread, tea, sugar, travel, any goods that one buys in a grocery&mdash;every single one of them is going up in price day by day.  The people are now having to pay the piper for this policy foolishly initiated <Col N="766" /> by the Minister for Finance and the Government last year.  Politically, they may have succeeded for a while. Politically, they may have been successful in getting people to judge that the 12 per cent increase had been got by them without an increase in the cost of living but the increases in the cost of living are coming now.  In addition to the people's having to bear the increased costs, the Minister has to find the wherewithal in relation to this Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>Every local authority is facing, in relation to its rates, an overwhelming bill that will cripple the average ratepayer.  At the last moment, we find the Taoiseach making a reference to some new method of financing.  The Minister for Finance did that, as well as I remember, on the eve of another similar situation but nothing ever happened to it afterwards.  The county manager in Kildare has asked for an increased rate of, I think, 6/7d. in the £ and many other counties have found the same situation.</P>
    <P>If these increases are warranted, it seems to me quite clear that there will have to be heavy increases in Vote 21, Rates on Government Property, and in respect of the other charges that fall to be met, such as the relief of agricultural rates, which is a bigger one, and the health services.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned rates on Government property.  I cannot understand why, in relation to that particular Estimate, as rates are going up savagely all round, the Minister believes there will be a decrease in the amount by which he is going to reimburse local authorities for that, even with the £66,000 included for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It does not seem to me that local authorities are being treated in the right way, although from an accounting point of view he may be able to show that what goes in in one way comes out in another.</P>
    <P>We have not yet got the mid-February figure for the cost of living and therefore we have not got the figure on which we are able to base the extent to which the value of our money goes down day by day.  What <Col N="767" /> was 20/- before the war became 11/9 when the war was over, in 1947, and in mid-February of 1963, that 11/9 had gone down to 6/9d.  I venture to say that when we get the full impact of the increases with which we are faced at the moment, we will find that what was worth 6/9d. will probably have gone down to the region of 5/6d. or 5/9d. and it will have gone down as a result of a policy initiated by the Government.  I am not so foolish as to suggest that the Minister and his colleagues deliberately drove up the cost of living.  I think they did it by deliberate policy in relation to initiating an inflationary spiral.  I believe they were foolish people that they did not realise what was going to happen and I charge them in that respect with not being sufficiently foreseeing, as a Government should be, to realise that the effects of their policy were bound to provide that these prices would continue to soar day after day and week after week.</P>
    <P>We only have the beginning of the price spiral that is going to result from governmental action.  We have got what I might perhaps describe as the direct increase.  The indirect increase has yet to come.  The indirect increase arises from the increase in the price of raw materials which are utilised in the finished product.  I am extremely apprehensive that industry will not be able to swallow that ultimate increase and meet its competitors in export markets. If it is not able to do so, then the result is bound to be a serious deterioration on the balance of payments front on the one hand, and on the other, considerable unemployment in those industries which devote, and properly devote, so much of their energies and output to exports as a whole.  Apart from that, those whose employment is secure are going to find it more difficult than they expected a fortnight ago to meet the increases in costs.  A fortnight ago, they were in a beautiful position.  They had to a large extent within their grasp a wage increase and they had been deluded by the Government into the belief that that wage increase would come without any increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> As I say, I commend the Taoiseach for his political timing on this particular occasion but it never pays in public life to be cheap or dishonest; it always comes back in the long run and in the long run, the people will remember that they were "codded" on this occasion into the belief that they were going to get a large benefit with this hand and that nothing would be taken back with the other.  This Bill is a public admission by the Minister that in relation to governmental services alone, the bill he has to face for starting this spiral is £23 million.  The people, in their bread and sugar, their tea and their bus fares, their tinned vegetables and in all the ordinary things that housewives buy day in day out, are finding it, and when that all comes to be settled down, it remains to be seen whether or not there will be any real benefit to anybody.  Unfortunately there will be, I believe, some exports with which we will not be able to compete in the future as effectively as in the past and if that is so, then there will be some people who will not be able to hold the employment they have at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose in view of events during the past six or 12 months, it was inevitable that the cost of Government would increase.  As far as this Book of Estimates is concerned and as far as individual Estimates have been concerned, I must confess that I was not entirely happy that this House has the best opportunity of deciding whether or not the expenditure in certain respects is justified.  On a number of occasions, I have advocated that there should be greater opportunities for a more detailed examination of these Estimates by Committees of the House.  I want to confess for myself that as far as certain of these figures are concerned, I take the Minister and the Government, and the civil servants who prepare the Estimates, more or less on trust.  If the Minister for Finance or any other Minister tells me that he needs £X millions or £X thousands for this or that project and if I believe it is a desirable project and have no severe criticism of it, I say: &ldquo;All right; that <Col N="769" /> is the money you want and we must give it." I believe that the Public Accounts Committee serves a very useful function, certainly for those who are members of the Committee, but Committees of this House should be established which would act as smaller types of Public Accounts Committees for the purpose of examining these Estimates in detail.</P>
      <P>I have been in this House for nearly 18 years and discussion on the Estimates, in the main, entails a discussion on administration.  I very seldom hear from the supporters of the Government in power or from those who happen to be in Opposition questions as to whether or not a particular amount is adequate or inadequate.  We have had the usual criticism that there was not enough for social welfare, not enough for housing, and such services.  The questions that really need to be asked can best be asked, I think, in Committees: they are questions such as: are we spending too much under this particular head or that particular subhead?</P>
      <P>We are not in a position to know at the moment because any Minister, with the best will in the world, cannot in public session, in winding up on his Estimate, give us the real reasons for certain types of expenditure under various heads.  If we are, and again I include the Civil Service in this, to retain public confidence, we will have to be able to give the public an assurance that the moneys the Minister for Finance asks for are necessary.  More important still, we will have to be in a position to convey to the public that the money we give to the Minister is spent in the right way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have an idea&mdash;I must confess I have no real evidence behind it&mdash;that within the Book of Estimates there could be some pruning, pruning that need not necessarily entail hardship on any people, and certainly not hardship in the matter of employment.  But pruning needs to be done.  The Minister for Finance, in respect of the whole Book, and the various Ministers individually, in respect of their particular Departments, are equipped with <Col N="770" /> a certain amount of knowledge and probably know the justification for expenditure under the various heads. The civil servants certainly know.  I think it is important that the public should know.</P>
    <P>My contention is that the type of discussion necessary cannot be engaged in by way of public debate. Let me advocate again to the Minister and to the Government consideration at least&mdash;I do not know whether they have ever given it serious consideration&mdash;of the establishment of Committees representative of all Parties which would behave, in respect of each Estimate, as the Public Accounts Committee do in a general way on all the estimates.  I suppose one should confess as well that those of us who are not on the Public Accounts Committee do not read the reports in absolute detail, but, from the very quick glance we give, we realise some very good and searching questions are asked.  On the other hand, good answers are given by those responsible for answering from the various Departments.  I honestly believe the suggestion I make to-night&mdash; it is a suggestion I have made on other occasions &mdash; ought to be given serious consideration by the Minister for Finance and the Government, and those who advise them.</P>
    <P>This being a general debate, I want to mention just two or three things. The most important one&mdash;the most important issue in the country at the moment and the one that is of gravest concern to the people&mdash;is the question of prices.  As Deputy Sweetman said, the February index figure is not yet available.  Let nobody think it will be any consolation to me, or to any members of the Labour Party, if that figure shows a very big increase.  I suspect that it will show a fairly substantial increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>And the mid-May figure will be much worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who are responsible for keeping homes and who have experience of meeting the public know the November figure showed an increase of something in <Col N="771" /> the region of a little over 2½ per cent in the cost of living.  As far as we can see&mdash;again, we have no evidence until we get the figure&mdash;all commodities seem to have increased in price.  What really concerns the Labour Party is the fact that there does not seem to be even a half-hearted attempt by the Ministers responsible to control prices, to exercise some form of control.  Exhortations are useless.  The exhortation by the Minister for Industry and Commerce recently&mdash;I think it was yesterday&mdash;is absolutely useless.  The people to whom he makes these exhortations are only laughing at him.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach also talked on 9th March, the day before yesterday, about price increases.  He said price increases are likely but increases in all commodities are not inevitable, and he then exhorted people to do this, that, and the other.  He lectures the trade union movement as to what they should do to keep down prices.  He advises manufacturers as to what they should do: they should be able in many cases to absorb certain increases.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been questioned several times in this House since the introduction of the turnover tax.  His efforts have been extremely weak in the matter of price control.  His stock answer recently has been that the Fair Trade Commission have been looking after prices, but he goes on to qualify that by saying that the Fair Trade Commission are concerned only with price increases arising out of restrictive trade practices.  Price increases arising out of restrictive trade practices can be pretty extensive, but the type of price increases we are talking about are increases that could not be pinned down by any court of law and labelled as restrictive trade practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plain fact is that when one has regard to the turnover tax, when one has regard to the increase in wages given to many thousands of workers, one cannot see where certain price increases are justified, but the Minister glibly says that the Fair Trade Commission are watching this and that his Department are keeping an eye on the situation, that certain increases have been brought to their notice, that they <Col N="772" /> are satisfied that they are not abnormal, and they are satisfied that there is justification for them.  I do not know what extra staff the Minister has got into the Department of Industry and Commerce, but this is an abnormal period as far as prices are concerned. In my time in political life, I do not believe there was ever such a crisis in relation to prices as there is at the present time.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he reminds us of the purpose for which the Fair Trade Commission was set up and stresses that the Commission is not sufficient to meet the present situation. I think all of us will admit, although we fought strenuously against it, that, because the turnover tax was introduced, price increases to a degree were justified, because nobody expects those who are selling goods to reduce their standard of living by reducing prices to their own detriment.  All of us admit also that price increases are justified by reason of the fact that an increase in wages was negotiated.  What annoys me, what annoyed me yesterday particularly, was a statement by the Minister for Transport and Power, on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce; the Minister for Industry and Commerce was asked if he would give an account of fluctuations in prices from 1st November to date in the specific commodities generally considered in compiling the Consumer Price Index and whether any other outstanding price fluctuations in other commodities have come to his notice. In the second half of his reply, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I do not quite know what the Deputy means by outstanding price fluctuations.</P>
    <P>I do not know where the Minister is living if he does not know of any outstanding price fluctuations.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>I am aware of increases, consequential on increases in production costs, in the prices of bread, turf briquettes, milk and cement and it was announced yesterday that the price of sugar has been increased by the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> There is no mention, so far, of the turnover tax.  We all know that the increase in the price of practically every single commodity was set off by the introduction of the turnover tax. As a matter of fact, the ninth round of wage increases was sparked off by the introduction of the turnover tax.  The Government appear to be evading their responsibility in the matter of increases in prices and it is a bit "off" for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to blame the ninth round for the increases that have occurred over the past five or six months.  The basis of the agreement negotiated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was compensation for increased production since the eighth round of wage increases was negotiated plus compensation for an increase in the cost of living that occurred from the time of the eighth round of wage increases.</P>
    <P>We have pressed the Minister for Industry and Commerce to employ the machinery which he himself embodied in the Act of Parliament for which he is responsible to this House, the Prices Act of 1958.  Did he ever believe he would have to use that machinery? Surely when he introduced that Act, he foresaw some situation wherein the Prices Advisory Body would be called upon to function.  The time has long gone when the machinery which he created in that Act should have been used.  He said himself, and we all agree, that under its terms, the Fair Trade Commission is inadequate in this situation and there is no other legal machinery by which prices can be effectively controlled except the body for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce was responsible, the Prices Advisory Body.  He said on one occasion he hoped he would be able to pigeonhole this Prices Act and only take it down when it was necessary. He must agree that in present circumstances it is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power, replying today for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, told Deputy McQuillan that there had been no notification by wholesalers to retailers of increases.  I suggest that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="774" /> does not know, he is not doing his job properly.  It is well known in every part of Ireland that every retailer has been sent a circular notifying him of increases in a great variety of commodities.  In the short time allowed to him in a supplementary question today, Deputy McQuillan tried to list some of the commodities.  I have here three lists of commodities that have been notified to retailers as carrying increased prices.  Maybe they are justified.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce does not care whether they are or not because if he did, he would take pains to have them investigated.  Here is a great variety of goods, mainly tinned foodstuffs but including other things, in respect of which increases have been notified.  I do not know whether or not there is justification for these increases.  To the public, the turnover tax will be blamed or the wage increases will be blamed, but the public are not in a position to know what element of turnover tax or what element of wage increases is contained in these increases in prices.  They are entitled to know.</P>
    <P>In the ninth round and in every round of wage increases and on every occasion when they sought an increase in their wages, the workers had to prove their case.  They have to prove a case for increases in income in order to sustain themselves or in order to maintain a certain standard of living. Over the past 14 or 15 years, they have had to go to the Labour Court or to go to open court to prove the necessity for an increase in their wages.  They subjected their case to the criticisms and refutations of the other side, the employers' associations.  They also subjected their case, in the main, to the decision given by the Labour Court and in the vast majority of cases, they accepted the award of the Labour Court, which is leaving it to a public tribunal, to three judges, to decide what wages should be fixed for them.</P>
    <P>It is probably a cumbersome and intricate operation to examine prices of commodities because they run into tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands but I believe the establishment of a prices advisory tribunal in respect of certain essential commodities <Col N="775" /> is imperative.  If I were a supporter of the Government, I would advocate that they do that in order to allay public disquiet because it seems to the public that nobody cares whether or not these increases are justified.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement have made an agreement with the employers which is to obtain for a period of a little over two years. Everybody applauds the general idea of there being a national wage agreement.  That is not to say that we agree with the general wage structure, especially in respect of lowly-paid workers.  However, most people would go along with the idea of a national agreement on wage increases in order to try to ensure stability of prices and manufacturing costs, so that there will be an incentive for increased production.  The workers appear to be determined to do their job and the evidence as far as production is concerned is that they have pulled their weight.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable for the trade union movement to expect the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to do their job in trying to provide stability of prices.  I do not want to provoke or anticipate action; neither have I discussed this matter with the officials of any trade union, but it seems to me that this 12 per cent increase that has been negotiated could be swallowed up very quickly and unless there is some quietening down of prices, unless there is evidence of more serious and stronger action by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government have a very big responsibility in this, in that they introduced the turnover tax.  I do not intend to debate now the merits or demerits of the turnover tax but that increase was responsible for an increase in the cost of living much more than the 2½ per cent.  There were some Ministers in the Government who in April or May last thought foolishly that there would be no increase at all. But even before the ninth round wage increase was negotiated, prices of many commodities went up by much more than 2½ per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> The Government were warned at the time what the situation would be.  They were warned and the country knew that there would be at that stage a ninth round of wage increases and some manufacturers and some retailers put up their prices in anticipation of the ninth round and now some of them are coming along again trying to compensate themselves for the second time for an increase in wages.  That is a situation that needs to be looked at because everybody wants to see stability in prices, and, I am sure, the Government as much as anybody else.</P>
    <P>Talking of this 12 per cent wage increase, the Government seem to have successfully used it in two different ways to their own advantage.  The national agreement negotiated by the trade union movement whereby a general increase of 12 per cent was granted was represented, particularly in the by-elections in Cork and Kildare, as being something for which the Government were responsible.  I must confess that I and my colleagues in my Party tried to disabuse the minds of the people of that idea.  The allegation by some of the brasher members of the Fianna Fáil Party was that the Government had made it possible for workers to get a 12 per cent increase. The inference by more responsible members of the Party was to the same effect.</P>
    <P>That, I suggest, did get them a certain amount of extra support in these two constituencies.  Of course, if the facts were well known to all the people, they were to the effect that if the Government had their way or if the Taoiseach had his way, the national wage agreement would have provided for an eight per cent increase because he is on record in this House as having said that if any more than seven or eight per cent were given by way of wage or salary increase, the economy could not stand it.  Despite what he said on that occasion, the trade union movement, with the employers, came to an agreement for 12 per cent.  He trimmed his sails then and, on another occasion, before or after the election&mdash;it does not make any difference&mdash;he said: &ldquo;Well, a bit of a bonus for the workers may be a good thing as well".</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> There we have the two voices.  On 12th December last year, it would have been fatal to give any more than eight per cent but now that the 12 per cent was negotiated independently of the Taoiseach, he says: "Well, it is not a bad thing that they got the other four per cent".  Who can believe, then, the viewpoint of the economists, which was, that more than eight per cent would ruin the economy, now that we have a situation where another four per cent has been given, and we have not heard a squeak from the economists or from the Taoiseach about the effect on the economy?</P>
    <P>Before the election, they tried to claim credit for the 12 per cent.  After the election, they are blaming the 12 per cent for the increase in prices. But, as I have said, the 12 per cent was to compensate the workers for the increase in production since the eighth round of wage increases and to compensate them for the increase in the cost of living in that period also.</P>
    <P>I want to mention one other thing, that is, the question of employment. Granted, we seem to have more factories, more industrial activity, more persons employed in industry than we had last year, the year before or the year before that, but I do not think anybody should try to give the impression that our employment figures are better than they are.  I do not think anybody should try to give the impression that nearly all our needs are satisfied as far as employment is concerned.  There is the fact that we have 60,000 unemployed.  We had the same figure two years ago.  We had, I think, 67,000 unemployed this time last year but I accept that there were special circumstances, due to the bad weather at that particular time.</P>
    <P>As far as unemployment is concerned, we do not seem to have made a great impression on the figures. There has not been any spectacular reduction and, as far as employment is concerned, I do not think that we can be too complacent.  As far as I can gather from the statistics available to me, some of which were quoted in one of the daily papers today&mdash;I think it was the <i>Irish Times</i>&mdash;and these were from the official census figures&mdash;the <Col N="778" /> total number of persons employed in this country in 1951 was 1,217,108. The total number employed in 1961 was 1,052,539.  At the end of that period of ten years, there were 164,569 fewer employed.</P>

      <P>Employed in agriculture in 1951 there were 493,292.  Employed in agriculture in 1961, there were 376,272, a decrease of 117,020. Again, according to the census of population returns, employed in industry in 1951 were 723,816; employed in industry in 1961, 676,267, a decrease of 47,549.  That, let me say, was up to the year 1961.</P>
      <P>I cannot be absolutely positive about the figures in 1962 and 1963 but the total number employed in agriculture in 1963, according to figures which were elicited by way of Parliamentary Questions by Deputy Tully, the total number employed in agriculture in June, 1963, was 354,900.  So, therefore, as between June, 1961, and June, 1963, there were 21,372 fewer persons employed in agriculture.</P>
      <P>The picture as far as industry is concerned is on the positive side.  The average number of persons engaged in manufacturing industry in 1961 was 167,900.  The average in 1963 had increased to 176,400.  So, therefore, there was a decrease in the two years from June, 1961, to June, 1963, of 21,372 in agriculture and, as far as the increase in transportable goods industries was concerned, the average from 1961 to 1963 had increased by 8,500.  In any case, the net result is that as between June, 1961, and June, 1963, there were fewer persons in employment.  That is a situation we cannot regard as being entirely good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us applaud efforts that are made for the establishment of industry and let us be encouraged by the results we have got as far as industry is concerned in recent years but let us also decide that a greater effort is necessary.  It is not for me to advocate the policy or the attitude of the Labour Party tonight but let me conclude by saying that as generous as State aid may appear to be for the establishment of <Col N="779" /> industry, more is needed and more Government intervention is needed, in our opinion for the establishment of these industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The alarming thing about the Bill before us, presented to us with this Book of Estimates is that it is only an indicator of the direction in which we are moving.  As an indicator, I think it is a very frightening document, so much so that I think the Government must now regret they did not heed the warnings given them on the proposals they made here last year, warnings that these proposals contained the seed of great inflation.  We are now in it.  It is reflected in this Bill and reflected in ever-widening circles, like flood water lapping into the homes of every person in the country.</P>
      <P>A detailed examination of the Estimates is only a waste of time, in view of the awful pattern that is being imposed in the whole of the Minister's demands.  Inflation in itself, the devaluing of money, is a modern, contemporary problem and it does not require any assistance because it is able to generate its own movement, but if it does get any assistance of the kind the Government proposals last year gave it, it becomes more than a trickle: it becomes a flood and we see the evidence of that flood now around us.  I have no doubt that the year's end will show that every pound note we now possess will be worth only 18/-.  I have no doubt this trend will continue because what we have done is to let loose an avalanche of inflation that is resulting in none of us being better off and some of us worse off, and our exports are hit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we did, in effect, in order to win two by-elections&mdash;to put it crudely &mdash;was to raise an overdraft on the future.  That has a very short-lived success.  Now the bills are coming in. I remember the difficulties of fighting these by-elections, of trying to tell the people that a 12 per cent wage increase coming to them was not a real benefit and I remember thinking how difficult it would be to get them to believe that it was against their best interests that these developments should have taken <Col N="780" /> place.  I remember feeling that the task was almost impossible, and so it proved to be.  The Government had a victory. I think it is a real Pyrrhic victory and that the Government themselves now feel that the end did not justify the means they used.</P>
    <P>All the people will pay more, more than the more they get.  The State will pay more for everything it does.  This bill before us shows that local government will cost a great deal more.  Inflation is a very dangerous tiger to let loose and we let it loose last year.  Money will find its own level but many will submerge in the process. I believe the Government are now sorry for any act of theirs to initiate this avalanche but it is now too late. We have now seen in ten years in this House the amount of the Book of Estimates become doubled and as Deputy Corish has said, in that same ten years we find&mdash;and I quote today's <i>Irish Times</i> extract from Central Statistics Office report&mdash;that the number in gainful employment in this country in those ten years has dropped by 164,000 people.</P>
    <P>We have doubled the cost of running the country; we have reduced the value of money probably in the same proportion, and the number employed here is 164,000 fewer.  We should now become thoughtful.  If we could get a modern Hogarth he should be employed to paint a modern Irish "Rake's Progress." As we have inviting vacancies on the walls of this House I think it should be hung on these walls and Budget Day would be a very fitting day for the unveiling ceremony.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish has mentioned the ineffectiveness of the Government's efforts to control prices.  You cannot control prices in the situation that exists here now, any more than you can control flood water.  We can expect prices to go up and we can expect money values to find their own level. It is about time for us all to discover that there are no fairies at the bottom of the garden and that if you fiddle about with the people's money and reduce its value, this is the result.  The electors of Kildare and Cork have, I think, gathered what will prove to be Dead Sea fruit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister introduced what is the forerunner of the most important discussion on the financial provisions of the State in introducing this Bill and so far the situation is that he has had no supporting speaker from his Party.  One would think that, fresh from the hustings, a Party buoyed up by the response they secured by the methods we intend to disclose, would be on its toes to come in behind the Minister and explain to the people the figures of both national and local expenditure which the country is asked to bear at this time.  Just now we have a grand national race in progress, with every section of the community accepting the green light that was shown by the Taoiseach when they were invited to "have a go" at the national "kitty" and try to get from it all that it was indicated was there for them.  But even before we have satisfied the people with the right to draw from that "kitty", the various sections of the community whose claims are incontestable, unfortunately we have before us the figures already involved in paying the piper for the tune that is being played to date.</P>
      <P>We had a visitation in Cork a few years ago by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, the self-announced successor to the Ministry who, we assume, will shortly replace the present Minister and bring a new and glorious light into the financial administration of our country.  He deputised for the Minister for Local Government at the opening of Youghal Bridge.  A very representative gathering was present from both counties Cork and Waterford, including public representatives and a good cross-section of the community.  That day he announced that the Fianna Fáil Government had given long and serious consideration to the situation of the different classes in the community and were seriously disturbed at the fact that a gap existed between the incomes enjoyed by those working in industry and those working on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was to be inferred from this statement?  There could be but one inference, that at last the Government had found a solution to that and within <Col N="782" /> a short time, there would be a bright and happy announcement relating to an improvement in the lot of the agricultural community.  But the party was over; the dining and the wining ended that day and we returned to the House.  What were we presented with? Not a proposal to improve the lot of the agricultural community, but by a proposal from the present Taoiseach to observe a pay pause relative to public servants and relative to all those employed in all other sectors.  Can the vacillating man now responsible as head of the Government explain the arguments he advanced when he advised the country to institute a pay pause in relation to incomes?</P>
    <P>Can the Taoiseach explain the announcement which Deputy Corish has adverted to regarding the limitation of eight per cent which the economy could afford to bear as an increase in wages both in the public service and the private sector without damage to the economy?  He was the man responsible, his Government and his Party were the people responsible for giving the green light to every organised union, to everybody in a position to demand and secure a 12 per cent increase in wages and salaries. How were the people in the regrettable instance of the passing of two Deputies from the House, told of all this, given an explanation of all this?  Outside the polling booths, before their eyes, was just one explanation&mdash;12 per cent.  Did they think then&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two and a half per cent. That did not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It worked, and the 12 per cent worked.  Twelve per cent on what?  On the figures the Minister has presented to the country to pay for both and which he has presented to the county managers for presentation to the county councils to pay for the local rates, in addition to the national bill.  It is now the responsibility of the Minister for Finance and is it not well he is the Minister who will have to shoulder the responsibility of facing up to the situation of which he was warned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He cannot claim he was not warned against it when he introduced the turnover tax, as he was warned when <Col N="783" /> he cut the food subsidies, consequently increasing the price of essential foodstuffs, as he was warned relative to the increased demands made on the private and public sectors for greater production, all this deliberately initiated by Government policy when food subsidies were first reduced and later abolished.  In view of those occurrences, the Minister for Finance left his pronouncements in regard to the introduction of the turnover tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The question of the turnover tax does not arise on the Central Fund Bill.  We are dealing with expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proportion of money voted under the Central Fund Bill arises out of the fact that we have had consequential increases in the cost of living and consequential charges on the Exchequer as a result of the turnover tax.  I want to know whether the Government are satisfied regarding the compensation which has been made to the various sectors of our economy consequential on the cost of living increases as a direct result not of any occurrence outside the shores of this country but of the financial policy of the Government.  I want to know why there is such ill humour, why there is such resentment when the farming community require of this Government not more, but certainly not less than they have been in a position to make or have been purported to be in a position to make in proportion to the incomes of public servants and those employed in industry.</P>
      <P>Is it not a fact that since the Governbent embarked on this insane, crazy financial road they are now traversing, those engaged in agriculture, and small shopkeepers in every town and village, have been faced with increases in their cost of living not caused by any agency other than Government policy; that they have had not alone to bear the impost on their families of higher prices for the necessities of life and for simple luxuries but also have additional increases in the cost of living resulting from the passing back of wage and salary increases to the manufacturers, distributors and retailers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> Can the Government afford to sit back at this time?  Can the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was so coy in relation to the increase in the price of bread that he kept it a secret until such time as his constituents had gone to the polls and did not announce it until the count was well and truly over, aflord to sit back?  How much more have the Government concealed in addition to that little secret?</P>
    <P>I want to know whether the Government are alive to the fact, or whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce is alive to the fact, that there are projected further increases not alone in the prices of luxury goods but in the prices of every essential commodity which any person in the State has to purchase.  Are the Government satisfied in the circumstances that it was fair for them to imply that the increases in wages for industrial workers in the city of Cork and in Kildare and for State servants in both areas were, in fact, real increases in their salaries?</P>
    <P>Is it not true that in the short time since these increases were awarded there have been indications of much of this money being recovered in, for instance, differential rents?  How much will the Minister for Finance take back out of the other pocket when it comes to implementation of his income tax code?  By the time the real effects on the cost of living are felt, by the time the bus fares and the train fares have been paid, how much will, in six months' time, these increases, donated a few weeks ago, be worth in terms of real improvement in income?  How much will be left in the pockets of the beneficiaries of these increases?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce lectures frequently to employers in the country on efficiency, management and control of their concerns.  He advises employers to be more efficient and he advises the workers to respond to the increases and work harder.  In that way, he says, the economy can bear the impact of this 12 per cent increase.  It is implied that unless that occurs the economy is in danger.  I submit that one ounce of example is worth a ton of exhortation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> On the very day that we read in the daily press the statements of the Taoiseach expressing his concern for the first time in the present situation and of the Minister for Industry and Commerce delivering one of his exhortations yet again, we had the announcements from semi-State bodies that they were unable to carry this additional charge imposed on them by increased costs and that they would have to pass it on to the consumer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>How can this Government or the Minister for Industry and Commerce hold their heads up or talk to anybody employing labour in this country, anybody engaged in industry or anybody engaged in providing any service in the State, if they themselves cannot give an example of absorbing by better management, by harder work, the increases within the very body which they are managing?  It is a farcical situation and it takes people with very hard neck to come and talk to the people, as they are talking to them these days, in face of the consequence that arises directly from mismanagement of the affairs of the country.</P>
      <P>I recall, before this Government assumed office, the basis on which they went before the people.  I do not like to weary the House by repetition but the statements made by the present Taoiseach are on record, when he was seeking office, when he went to Clonmel and stated that the level of State expenditure by the Government then in office was excessive and that if he and his Party were given authority for government in this country, by effective examination of all Departments of State, it would be possible to effect such a reduction that the people would not be called on to bear the same level of taxation as then existed.  How quickly that scene changed when he assumed office.  What a different situation exists today and unfortunately, as has been said too truly, this is only the start.  It is only the beginning of the story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Minister for Finance, sitting here now representing the Government, <Col N="786" /> in his first Budget, indicated, and, mind you, he commanded a lot of support in the country, that he was confident he could effect such economies in public administration that we would need fewer civil servants to administer the country.  In consequence, there were leading articles in the daily newspapers the following day commending him for this assurance.  Can the figures revealed in Parliamentary Questions recently support the claim which the Minister made, not after any dinner, not lightly, but in the course of his Budget Statement here?</P>
    <P>I am sure that cool and calm consideration was given to the preparation of the Minister's statement.  What consequences has he to show as a result of the supposed examination that was to be carried out into the operation of every Department?  If he has failed to effect those economies, we can only assume that the Taoiseach was talking through his hat in Clonmel in asserting that in fact extravagances existed in the administration of the Government who were in office before he assumed office.  It is true that the Party now in office secured much support at that time on the basis that they would be more effective, that there would be an abler group of men in the Ministries, to ensure that the expenses of administration would be reduced and that, consequently, the burden of taxation would be lowered.</P>
    <P>Since that time, much legislation has been enacted in this House which was not paid for by the collections of the Department of Finance but much of which was passed back on to the shoulders of the local authorities throughout the country and which are now reflected in the extraordinary demands being presented by county managers in every local authority throughout the country and by city managers, too, in respect of the bills the ratepayers will have to meet during the coming 12 months.</P>
    <P>I know the Taoiseach expressed sympathy and, in the long term, again we must accept this with a grain of salt because of his claim at Clonmel and of the claims of the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement.  The <Col N="787" /> Taoiseach claims, though some time has elapsed since he first gave vent to these feelings of sympathy, that given time, he thinks he can evolve some mysterious solution to the difficulties encountered in the payment of rates. But this Minister for Finance, by a stroke of the pen tomorrow morning, could relieve the ratepayers throughout the country by at least 1/- in the £ on the rates if he exempted from the rates what he is extracting from them in the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, because of the operation of the turnover tax on such items as food and other commodities used in local institutions, and on road-making and other materials used in the maintenance of local services, have to contribute extra revenue to the Central Fund.  If the Minister for Finance is sincere, and if the Taoiseach is sincere in his expressed sympathy for the ratepayers, by a stroke of the pen, they could relieve the ratepayers in the cities of Dublin and Cork and in the administrative areas of all other local authorities throughout the country, to the extent of 1/- in the £ on the rates. There are people who would like to believe that this turnover tax issue is dead and gone.</P>

      <P>The Minister says what the Taoiseach stated is of no importance.  That is clear.  We have that on record&mdash;that what the Taoiseach says is of no importance.  At least we have come to some decision.  The Taoiseach said the economy could bear eight per cent, but the Minister for Finance says that is of no importance. At any rate, the employers fixed the figure at 12 per cent.  It was presented to the people of Cork and Kildare, the people of Dublin and the people throughout the country, that this was a realistic increase.  They were not told that the price of bread was going up by 1d. the following day.  They were not told that bus fares and rail fares were going up but they were told that industry could absorb this increase by working harder.  At the same time, the Government State-controlled bodies passed back on to the shoulders of the community every single penny involved in paying the increase in wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> They expected the people to work harder in industry.  They expected management to be more efficient.  At the same time, the bodies controlled by the Government, on the very same day as the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce made these exhortations and announcements, directed those increases on to the shoulders of the community.  We have already taken back from the people&mdash; it was actually only a loan they got&mdash; what was given to them.  It was given to them only long enough to give Deputy Briscoe a chance of getting payment on the bets he made.  I have no doubt Deputy Briscoe's wagers have been redeemed.</P>

Are the Government alive to the fact that so many sections of our community have not yet got increases in income to enable them stand up to the increase in the cost of living?  Will they ever get it?  What will happen to the person who invests money and depends on what he gets on dividends?  We were told by the Minister for Finance&mdash;not by anybody outside the House&mdash;that in the course of a few years the £ has so deteriorated that today it is worth only 15/5d. compared to five or six years ago and worth only 6/6d. in relation to the values of 1937.</P>

      <P>What will it be worth in five months?  Can we listen to the radio, look at television or open a newspaper without having some announcement of an increase being passed on to the shoulders of the consumer?  Do the Government feel that consumer resistance is completely gone?  Do they feel nobody is concerned?  We remember the wails of woe at the time the loaf of bread was reduced in size by a slight margin.  Is there any concern by the people who were at the wailing wall at that time in relation to the major increases in the price of essential foodstuffs due directly to the Government's financial policy?</P>
      <P>What steps do they intend to take within the coming weeks&mdash;they have to act quickly&mdash;to compensate the people who own small businesses, those who are self-employed and those who have limited incomes from investments, to compensate them for increased national and local expenditure as well as increases in the prices of essential commodities?  I am not referring to the increase in the price of brandy or in the price of any other luxury item.  I am dealing specifically with increases in essential foodstuffs, clothing, medicine&mdash;the things any human being is obliged to buy any day of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="791" /> I want to know in relation to what has been described as the backbone of our economy&mdash;the farming community&mdash;when the Government will get out of the fit of resentment at the fact that these people should make any claim on them to improve their lot.  I want to know when the Government will indicate to them they will be given increases commensurate with the supposed increases which were given to other sections of the community.  I want to know whether the Government will be in a position to convince those who received increases in wages and salaries a few weeks ago that what they got then will be worth as much in five or six months' time.  In our national and local expenditure we are going into an inflationary spiral, in which the non-political managers of local authorities indicate clearly the extent to which the increases they have asked the people to pay are caused by deliberate Government action.  They are not caused by the extension of services but in order to maintain the services of 1963-64 and 1964-65.</P>
    <P>What situation have we in relation to national taxation?  A complete reversal of every claim ever made by the Party in Government of what they would achieve given office.  We have the indications of an occurrence which was clearly portrayed for this Government when they embarked on this road, completely contrary to the claims of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and other Ministers that it was within the province of those in employment and working in industry to create a situation in which the increases could be absorbed without being passed on to the shoulders of the community.  Can this Government stand over the cost of living increases in recent weeks and the cost of living increases which are projected?  How can they stand over the figures that must be released of the cost of living index figures in the months to come?  When that arises will they succeed in persuading the people that the increases they got were real increases?  Can they satisfy the community at large that they themselves in the conduct of their various <Col N="792" /> Ministers and in the influence they exercise on the semi-State companies are giving the example to those whom they exhort, lecture and address so frequently as to how they should run their concerns more efficiently and absorb these increases?</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that is the picture; and that is the picture we will have to face up to.  That situation has been created entirely by the financial policy embarked on by this Government, first when they introduced the turnover tax and, secondly, when they were obliged to meet the increase in the cost of living &mdash;far in excess of 2½ per cent&mdash;by giving the awards necessary to cushion the impact of the cost of living increases on so many people not in a position to demand and secure such an increase.  They have not yet met the demands of huge sections of the community who have had no increases in their incomes to cushion them against the impact of the increased cost of living.  Those are the people now subject to additional increases in trying to meet the awards necessary to compensate those in a position to secure such awards.</P>
    <P>This is the vicious spiral in which we are.  It will be interesting, when the Minister replies to see whether he will be in a position to tell us what measures the Government propose to take to remedy the situation which they alone have created.  What advancement do they propose to offer to those sections of the community who have had no indication of what the Government propose to do relative to the difficulties in which they are?  Some years ago there were boasts in relation to our competitiveness.  Today we hear many protestations of the importance of our maintaining a competitive position <i>vis-a-vis</i> exports.  It is a matter of concern that today we demand a level in our standard of living that must be met&mdash;there is no difference of opinion about this&mdash;by an increased volume of exports.  It is not well that after a long, hard and expensive education, the Government now realise the importance of the store cattle trade and its contribution to our exports? At one time the Government claimed that it took hundreds of years to build <Col N="793" /> up and that it would not take 100 days to destroy.  It is well today that we have that trade, and we are lucky to have it.</P>
    <P>We have also an improvement in the level of our exports as a consequence of the provisions of the 1956 Finance Act which introduced new methods for the encouragement and growth of our exports.  They were adopted by the Government and, indeed, extended by them when they came into office. The Industrial Development Authority was initiated by us and has contributed to the increase in our exports.  We heard protestations by Ministers about the challenge with which we were presented in the export markets and the many factors weighing against us in the various combinations and groupings in the export markets which demanded more and more controls in our costings.  We were lectured by Ministers that it was essential to maintain some control over costs of production and now the Government are acting completely contrary to the principle of keeping down production costs, because they are imposing higher costs on the people engaged in exporting.</P>
    <P>Has the picture changed so radically since the Taoiseach brought in his pay pause proposals?  He claimed that it was essential that we should maintain control over costs.  In what way has the picture changed since?  We have had a complete reversal of the policy he then enunciated.  What has happened since then?  Is the Minister satisfied that the occurrences of the past few months will not make it extremely difficult for our exporters to face growing competition?  If we cannot succeed in resolving this difficulty, we will again have to face a grave imbalance of payments.  In the past, that imbalance was created by something completely outside our control, but on this occasion, the inflation will be a direct consequence of the Government's financial policy.</P>
    <P>We did not wait until the event to warn the Government of these impending occurrences.  We warned them of the results if they embarked on that course.  Our view of the situation is <Col N="794" /> borne out by the Book of Estimates, with increased costs of administration for every Department of State, an increase in the cost of living, and an increase in the cost of operating local councils.  Unless the Government can control the increase in the cost of living and prevent a further reduction in the value of money, life will be extremely difficult for many sections of our people.</P>

      <P>This is a very serious matter for the country and for all sections of the community: business people, workers, professional people, farmers, and people in all walks of life. We have now reached the stage where the Government are allowing the entire situation to drift as if there was neither leadership, nor policy, nor anything to be aimed at.  The only time the Government considered the effects of rising taxation, emigration, unemployment and high prices was when they were out of office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, Sir.  The only time the Government gave any serious thought to the problems facing our people was when they were out of office.  I should like to ask the Minister&mdash;and I am sure he has been asked already tonight&mdash;what proposals the Government have in mind to implement the promises and pledges they gave to the people before the last election to reduce taxation, reduce the cost of living, and give a higher standard of living.  That is exactly what they promised to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall how so many people applauded the Government when it was announced that they intended to undertake a campaign to reduce the number of civil servants in order to save expenditure.  It was clearly pointed out by a Government spokesman that considerable reliefs could be brought about and that the heavy burden of taxation, which at that time they said pressed too heavily on the shoulders of our taxpayers would be considerably relieved. <Col N="795" />  They knew very well that there is a section of the community who like to hear that the numbers of civil servants will be drastically reduced. They knew there were many people who would be inclined to fall for propaganda of that kind, although they had no intention, plan, policy, or scheme, for reducing the number of civil servants.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the point where national and local taxation have gone beyond the paying capacity of the people.  I wonder when the Government will face realities, because it cannot be possible that they are unaware of the fact that serious and grave hardships are being imposed on our people today, on people whose incomes are not sufficient to purchase the necessaries of life.  A big section of our people are unorganised and have no trade union or anyone else to fight for them.  Retired pensioners, people who have to live on small incomes from small investments, people who have to live on incomes derived, let us say, from ground rents, have got no 12 per cent increase.  Seemingly, they are a small section of the community who do not show their strength at election time.  Since they do not show their strength in an organised manner, the Government are prepared to turn not only a blind eye to them but a deaf ear also.</P>
    <P>Those people are in a very serious plight and there are thousands of such people in this country.  They are faced with increases every morning the newspapers appear.  Every evening on the radio, increased prices are announced for practically every commodity.  The most serious of those increases are the increases in the prices of essential foodstuffs&mdash;bread, flour and meat.  Why have the Government stood idly by? Through their own deliberate action, they have been responsible for inflicting severe hardships on the weakest sections of the community who have neither the trade union movement nor any organised movement behind them.  Those people to whom I refer certainly do not count in the opinion of this Government. Their conditions worsen.  They have <Col N="796" /> to meet increased bus fares.  They have to meet increased prices for bread, flour and meat.  On top of all those increases, they have to face a severe and a sharp rise in rates, which must be paid.</P>
    <P>I am now told that the next round of increases is likely to come from the ESB with steep increases in the charges for electricity.  Surely the circumstances of these people must be taken into consideration?  Surely the Government must realise that they have some responsibility to that section of the people?</P>
    <P>Take the section of the community who have been entirely forgotten, as if they were non-existent, the agricultural community.  The Government also appear to be bankrupt of a progressive agricultural policy.  Those who are living on the land and producing real wealth from the land seem to be getting the least margin of profit as a result of their hard work.  Where would we be today if it were not for the export of cattle and our geographical convenience to the British market?</P>
    <P>The increases in the cost of living concern not alone the organised worker but every citizen in the State. The Government are allowing the position to drift.  No action is taken in relation to excessive charging and we do not seem to have a policy to effect price control.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce says he is investigating bread and flour prices.  Can it not be considered a mean, low, savage trick on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance that during the counting of the Cork and Kildare by-election votes, arrangements were being made to have notices printed announcing increases in the prices of bread and flour?  Not alone is it a savage and a mean trick but it must meet with a degree of revenge, long or short.  There was no talk of the increases in prices before the votes were cast in the by-elections.  However, when the Government could say, as a result of the by-elections, that they had the confidence of the people &mdash; which they have not, because they do not reflect one way or another on Government <Col N="797" /> policy&mdash;the people were told of the increased prices.</P>
    <P>The increased CIE charges will involve severe hardships on the working-class people in this city who must get to their work.  Take the person who must get from, say, Kildare Street to Arran Quay.  He must take one bus to O'Connell Bridge for 4d. and another bus to Arran Quay for 4d., making 8d. in all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall raise it on the Estimate, when it comes up. Surely the Minister for Finance must realise that all these increased charges are lessening the purchasing power of the people's pay packets?  When the 12 per cent increase was announced, every wage earner understood it was automatically being granted.  What about the employers who cannot economically run their business and pay the increased wage?  What about the vast number of industrial concerns that say: &ldquo;We shall pay it but at the same time, we must reduce our staff&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>The numbers of unemployed are increasing in recent weeks and are likely to continue to increase.  Certain industrial concerns are already working on a very slender margin of profit. In some cases where they are just keeping their heads above water and managing on overdrafts, the concerns say the only way they can pay an increase of 12 per cent is by trying to manage with fewer men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government urge increased production while endeavouring to handcuff and blindfold the industrial concerns.  The Government ask the concerns to expand and to produce more and, at the same time, in order to exist, they must have fewer people in their employment.  It is a wrong, a disastrous policy.  On an occasion such as this, one would expect the Minister for Finance to have some proposals for the future in relation to employment. As a result of the bungling of our financial situation by the Government I foresee increased unemployment.  Furthermore, a number of industrial concerns <Col N="798" /> such as the woollen and worsted industries, and other industries, will have to meet tariff cuts.  If, as a result of negotiations with outside authorities, quotas of such products must come into this country, our industrialists will find it very difficult to compete.  It will be impossible for them to compete in such circumstances. That is why I say this Government are bankrupt of an economic policy.</P>
    <P>It is said that this Government have the economists throughout the country working for them in an advisory capacity and that they are reaping as much from the present circumstances as the veterinary surgeons reaped from the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme, and that was no small amount.  This country may require a certain amount of advice from economists but commonsense and intelligence are also required.  This Government are bankrupt of commonsense. They seem to have lost all contact with the ordinary people, who are the backbone of the country.  That is why the time has come for a courageous stand in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>If one were to ask the Government what programme they have, either to stem the tide of emigration or to provide employment, we would be referred to the blue booklet on economic expansion.  Many people do not take that booklet seriously. Personally, I think it is a fraud. Paper never refuses ink.  The Taoiseach calls for a pay pause and, a few weeks later, he says the time has now come when there will be no pay pause and wage earners may look for an increase of 12 per cent in their wages.</P>
    <P>That was a political stunt simply because the Government had not an overall majority.  If the Government had an overall majority, they would not say to the trade unions and the workers: &ldquo;Look for an increase of 12 per cent&rdquo;.  They would have resorted to what they did previously&mdash; the Wages Standstill Order the framework of which the late Deputy Norton, when he became Minister for Industry and Commerce, found in the Department in Kildare Street.  That was all the consideration the Government had for the trade unions and the working-class <Col N="799" /> people when they had a majority. I venture to say that within the next 12 or 18 months people who received a 12 per cent increase will find that it has become smaller and smaller each day until it has been completely wiped out.</P>
    <P>Is it not more important to control the cost of living?  The Government are making no effort to control either prices or the cost of living and one of the most serious charges which we have to level at the Government is that no steps have been taken in that regard.  I should like the Minister for Finance, when he is replying, to tell us what prospects he holds out for those faced with emigration today. One notices that in recent weeks no member of the Government or of the Government Party seems to be making any contribution which touches on the provision of employment or the stemming of emigration.  At the same time, conditions are allowed to become more difficult for our people through rising prices.  That cannot be tolerated indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister tell us, since the Book of Estimates has reached an all time record&mdash;unprecedented and unbelievable in regard to the volume of taxation the Minister is presenting to the taxpayers&mdash;what he has in mind in relation to unemployment and emigration?  Do members of the Government think that emigration is at an end and that people are not emigrating?  That may be so, but if it is, it is because all those who were eligible to emigrate have emigrated and there will be no more to go until those who are now leaving school join the list of those eligible.</P>
    <P>In rural Ireland today, you have two sections of the community, the very young and the very old.  The vast majority of middle-aged people are not in the country because they have been forced out of it by the unworkable, unsound and insane Fianna Fáil policy. There is a record bill facing the taxpayer; local taxation is at the point of explosion and the highest rates ever are being imposed by every local authority&mdash;rates which could not even be foretold in Colmcille's prophecies&mdash; and the taxpayer are now obliged to <Col N="800" /> meet what they could never have imagined in their wildest dreams.</P>
    <P>I realise that we cannot discuss the question of the turnover tax in this debate, and rightly so&mdash;we will have another opportunity of doing that&mdash; but we must bear in mind that there are a number of county managers&mdash; the county manager for North Tipperary was one&mdash;who have stated publicly that the reason for the vast increase in rates was the turnover tax, that it was because the price of bread, sugar, flour, butter, and meat for hospitals and institutions under local authorities' control had risen so much and hence the ratepayers have to pay increased rates.  The Minister, in giving assistance to farmers to meet their rates bill, should bear in mind that the burden of rates also falls on city and townspeople.  They get no abatement for agricultural land and are getting no assistance to meet the increase in rates.  I agree that the agricultural community should be given this assistance but what scheme has the Minister in mind to assist the urban and city ratepayer?</P>
    <P>The Government should be asked what their policy is in regard to this matter.  The Taoiseach, speaking at a County Dublin Fianna Fáil convention last Sunday, said that they were considering the whole question of local taxation and rates.  Mark you, they are only considering it now at a time when the whole situation is liable to burst at any moment, when the people cannot pay them, when the bill is too high.  The Fine Gael Party are not sitting down now to consider it.  They have already considered it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, by taking the health charges from the rates, by taking responsibility for health charges from the rates.  That will effect a considerable reduction in rates.  That is why I say the Fine Gael Party are the only Party who have a real policy in regard to rates and taxation.  Not <Col N="801" /> alone have they a real policy but they have shown how it can be implemented with a considerable saving in local taxation.  I should like to hear from the Minister what his proposals are in this regard.  I should not be surprised if he stood up and said he was going to appoint a commission or a board to sit on the matter for five or six years, as has happened in other matters, in the past, and then when they make a report, it will be put on the shelf to be covered with dust and cobwebs for the next ten or 15 years.  This is a time for action, a time for courage and a time when the Government should look into the future with hope and confidence in our people, but bearing in mind the capacity of our people to pay and the extent of their patience which, I feel, is very near exhaustion point at the moment.</P>
      <P>I feel very aggrieved when I see the severe hardships which are being imposed on our people not only in regard to the increase in bus fares and the price of foodstuffs but particularly in regard to increased prices for medicines.  No steps have been taken to control the prices of medicines or medical appliances.  It is a shocking state of affairs to say that if a person wants drugs to cure a beast, let it be a cow or a calf, he can get the drugs without additional cost or taxation but when the life of a human being is involved, he must pay tax.  The Government place more importance on the life of a beast than on the life of a human being.  It is disgraceful.  It is a shocking indictment of this Government that they put the beast in the field&mdash;the cow, the horse, the calf in the shed&mdash;before the baby in its cradle.  That is something that can only engender anger in the heart of every parent particularly the parents in the poorer sections of the community who are put to the pin of their collar to pay for medicines and drugs.</P>
      <P>These are the points to which, I think, attention should be drawn.  The Government have failed grievously. The Government have failed miserably. Their policy is now being found out and, please God, by the time the general election comes, the people will be wiser.</P>

      <P>If I were Minister for Finance in the circumstances in which the Minister finds himself today, I would throw in the towel and leave it to someone else to do better. The Government have successfully hoodwinked the people.  The Government should remember that, having sown nettles, they cannot expect roses to grow; having sown nettles, they can only expect to get stung.  That is what will happen.  By the time the general election comes, they will be a little older and a little wiser, perhaps, but no one will be as wise as Fianna Fáil after the next general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having seen the result of the Kildare and Cork by-elections, I thought that Fine Gael might at last try to be constructive.  All I have listened to for most of this evening is the same balderdash as I have listened to now for the past 40 years or so. Fine Gael never change.  They always make the same speeches.  They always trot out the same old lies, misrepresentation and shibboleths, in the mistaken idea that people will believe them.  Then they sit down, satisfied they have done their duty.  The people, of course, are leaving them, but they do not realise that.</P>
      <P>I have no comment to offer on Deputy Flanagan's speech because there was nothing in it upon which I could comment.  Deputy O'Sullivan talked about people having hard necks.  Fine Gael certainly have a hard neck to talk about exports.  They were in office from 1954 to 1957.  Exports went down.  From 1957 to the present time, exports, under Fianna Fáil, have gone up by 80 per cent.  Now, Deputy O'Sullivan is afraid we will lose our exports because of our policy.  That shows the hard neck of Fine Gael. That just about gives one an idea of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer now to a matter raised by Deputy A. Barry.  He talked about our inflationary policy.  Fine Gael published a policy some time <Col N="803" /> ago; they were going to spend about £50 million more per year, with less taxation.  They would drop the turnover tax, and other taxes, too, and they would spend an extra £50 million a year.  That is the very essence of inflation : spend more but take less. Deputy Barry, with the typical hard neck of Fine Gael, talks about the inflationary policy of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>When I introduced the turnover tax in the last Budget in an attempt to stem inflation, Fine Gael voted against it.  They thought they had a good trump card to go to the country with.  Labour joined them, of course, as they usually do.  I am sorry none of the Labour Party is here now so that I might address my remarks to him. Fine Gael, as I say, thought they had a good trump card.  They opposed the turnover tax.  They went to North-East Dublin and they won.  They began pressing for other by-elections and for a general election.  They got the by-elections, and they lost.</P>
    <P>Now there is another excuse as to why they lost, some other reason altogether.  The people did not realise what they were doing and they, therefore, voted Fianna Fáil in both Cork and Kildare; but, if they get another chance, they will beat us the next time.  It is always the next time and, every time, they want another chance. Ever since I came in here, I have been listening to that story: they will always beat us the next time. On the last occasion on which I spoke here, Deputies on the opposite benches told me I would not be here &ldquo;the next time&rdquo; because the by-elections in Cork and Kildare would mean that out we would go.  Deputies even had the temerity to prophesy that Fine Gael would come back with a clear majority.  Their tails are between their legs now as a result of Cork and Kildare.</P>
    <P>To come to Deputy Sweetman's speech, which dealt with the Bill, and that is more than Deputy Flanagan's and Deputy O'Sullivan's did, he said it was customary to compare the figures for the coming year, as set out in the Book of Estimates, with the figures for the previous year, which is really the current year.  That, of <Col N="804" /> course, is a natural thing for any Deputy to do.  He went on then to draw attention to the changes made this year as compared with last year. He very rightly said that we could disagree on the proportion of capital which is not productive, and perhaps we might agree, too; that is the point. He said we could disagree on the proportion allocated to social improvement.  I think the proportion is very good.  He said we could disagree also on certain items that are now treated as capital which might more properly be treated as current.  Again, I say to Deputy Sweetman we might agree on these things, too.</P>
    <P>He went on to say we should have a separate discussion on capital expenditure.  I do not see any great objection to that.  I would welcome a discussion on capital expenditure.  I do not, of course, want the kind of speech Deputy Flanagan makes; he imagines he is talking to people at the crossroads, to people who are ignorant and who do not understand State finance and State financing, and he knows they do not understand.  When he comes in here, however, he should have more regard for us; he should not try these things on us.</P>
    <P>I would be quite prepared to discuss this Capital Budget with Deputy Sweetman and others.  I think it might be useful if we could get constructive criticism or constructive suggestions from the Opposition.  I certainly would welcome them.  It is quite possible some might say some of our capital expenditure was not necessary or that it was not spent in the right way.  I should be glad to have such observations.  I am sure a suggestion would be made that we should spend capital in other directions, directions in which we are not spending it at the moment.  I would quite accept that from Fine Gael.  Such a discussion would be a useful discussion.  It would help.</P>
    <P>Last year&mdash;we will do the same again this year&mdash;we presented a table of our proposed capital expenditure for the year.  I think simultaneously the capital programme and the current programme should be discussed together, more especially as we have been accused now of implementing an <Col N="805" /> inflationary policy; the subject of inflation can hardly be discussed without discussing both capital and current expenditure at one and the same time. I think, therefore, they should be dealt with together in any discussions that may take place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman was correct in his assumption with regard to certain figures.  Certain figures are given here and certain figures have been assumed. On the face of the Book of Estimates, there would appear to be an increased expenditure of £16 millions required next year over and above what was actually spent in the last year.  A note is given in these Estimates that the ninth round increases are not included. I gave the figure of £7 million as likely to be the figure that would be necessary to cover the ninth round for all who are paid by the Minister for Finance, that is, civil servants, gardaí, teachers, the Army, and so on.  Therefore £7 million has had to be added on.  There are also adjustments in the eighth round outstanding which will require some money.  I do not want to state a sum, although naturally I am trying to keep it as low as I can.  There will be some amount required for that and a sum for CIE.  The amount higher than last year will be at least £23 million and probably a few million pounds more.</P>
    <P>There was a certain amount of criticism from Deputy Flanagan that we brought in here a White Paper in February last year which stated that incomes could not be increased unless there was increased production to cover these increases.  The gist of that White Paper was that if incomes were increased before production was increased, there would be inflation; but, on the other hand, if incomes would increase <i>pari passu</i> with production, there would not be a danger of inflation and in all probability, there would be no appreciable increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>That was a very sensible paper and any sensible man will see it was true. However, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party took advantage of it to say we were trying to peg down wages, to keep down the working man and all <Col N="806" /> that kind of balderdash they go on with on these occasions.  The matter was discussed by the Dáil and that was that.  Deputy Flanagan said that a few weeks later the Taoiseach said there should be an increase in wages. As a matter of fact, it was more than 12 months later when he said it.  That gives you an idea of the measure of Deputy Flanagan's accuracy in a lot of things he says when he calls 13 months a few weeks.  Thirteen months makes a big difference in the life of a nation and in economic trends and it was obvious that a round of wages was due.</P>
    <P>Some people say the Taoiseach thought that 8 per cent was enough. Perhaps he did&mdash;I do not know. I do not say definitely he did because I do not want to wrong the Taoiseach in any way, but I do say that any sensible man might have suggested that 8 per cent was enough.  There is no use in the worker getting higher wages than are justified by production because it leads to inflation and a higher cost of living, with the result that he is not getting the real wage increase he would get if wages were related to production.  If the Taoiseach thought and if I thought that a figure of 8 per cent was enough, then there is no reason why we should not say it because we would be only serving everybody concerned by saying 8 per cent would be a better figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say that. However, we would be expressing only an opinion.  We in this country have not taken power to fix wages.  The wages issue went for discussion between employers and employees.  They argued for a long time and in the end they decided on 12 per cent.  The Taoiseach said, as I said, too, that he was glad to see a settlement because it would mean industrial peace.  Even if it is a bit too high and causes inflation and an increase in the cost of living, at least there is an agreement on this, an agreement which I hope will be a pattern for things in the future so that employers and employees will <Col N="807" /> settle these matters between them and there will be no strikes or industrial unrest.</P>
      <P>In connection with this also, the Taoiseach is accused&mdash;of course Fine Gael would accuse anybody of anything, not alone the Taoiseach&mdash;of saying to the people in Cork before the by-election: &ldquo;You will get your 12 per cent&rdquo; and when it was over: &ldquo;There are certain difficulties.  The cost of living will go up.&rdquo;  Polling in Cork took place on 14th February.  On 29th January, the Taoiseach said this at a meeting of advertisers&mdash;he could not say it to a better crowd to have it advertised:</P>
      <P>That does not mean that the general increase in wages of up to 12 per cent is not going to cause problems.  Though the 12 per cent agreement is for a period of two and a half years it represents a higher annual rate of increase in pay than the expected rate of growth of national production.</P>
      <P>That is exactly what I have just said and that was before polling took place in Cork.  Therefore, the Taoiseach did not keep this back until the Cork polling was over as Fine Gael tried to give the impression.  He went on to say:</P>
      <P>That in itself could give rise to difficulties even if the increase in pay were spaced out so as not to run too much ahead of production. But the 12 per cent is to be paid in full in advance of the achievement of any expansion in output.  This gives rise to particular dangers which it must be the concern of all of us to avoid or minimise.</P>
      <P>I think that is all I need to say about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was warned, I believe, by Fine Gael on the last Budget that I was going to put up the cost of living and I was told that I did not agree with that.  I have stated here before on several occasions that I could take my Budget speech of last year and point out in several places where I said there would be an increase of 2½ per cent in the cost of living.  As a matter of fact, <Col N="808" /> when I went on to deal with all the people who were getting social welfare benefits of all kinds, people in receipt of children's allowances, State pensioners and several other categories, 1,100,000 altogether, I said we had to compensate those people for the 2½ per cent increase in the cost of living which would result from the imposition of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>There was no concealing of that fact because I was quite sure the cost of living would go up by 2½ per cent. Therefore, in that Budget speech, I was correct, but Fine Gael and Labour, who told us the cost of living would go up by 15 per cent, were not correct. When the cost of living index was calculated in the middle of November after the turnover tax had been imposed and when the necessary increases in prices took place, the cost of living showed an increase of three per cent.  There was a half per cent difference.  Fine Gael were 12 per cent out.</P>
    <P>One would imagine, listening to the Fine Gael speakers in this House, particularly Deputy Flanagan and Deputy O'Sullivan who spoke just before him, that the cost of living always remained constant when they were in office and went up when we were in power.  If they go back over the official tables, they will find that from 1954 to 1956 when the Coalition were in office&mdash;the less said about that the better&mdash;the cost of living went up by three per cent per annum and from 1957 to the last cost of living figure given in November, 1963, the cost of living went up by three per cent per annum.  It went up exactly the same with Fianna Fáil as it had gone up with the Coalition.  But look at the difference.  The difference, of course, is that when they were here, they did nothing.  Exports went down.  The national income remained practically static.  Unemployment went up to 100,000; it is now 60,000 and they are finding fault with it.  Emigration went up to 40,000; it is now 20,000 and they are finding fault with it.</P>
    <P>I could go over many items showing increases when the Coalition were in office.  When the cost of living went up under the Coalition, the people got <Col N="809" /> nothing for it.  The cost of living went up under this Government, too, but if it did, the people got a good return for it.  The national income has gone up by practically 50 per cent during the time Fianna Fáil have been in office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish, who spoke after Deputy Sweetman, made what appeared to me to be an astonishing statement.  He said he was always prepared to examine propositions made by the Government and where he found they were good propositions, he would state his approval and would say that we must have the money to pay for it.  My experience of Deputy Corish and the Labour Party, since I became Minister for Finance, is that they never approved of any expenditure&mdash; never.  They would always vote against anything I put up&mdash;not turnover tax alone.  A penny on the pint, a penny on cigarettes, twopence on the glass of whiskey&mdash;it is all the same what you put up to them, they will vote against it.  While they would know that in many of these cases the proposition put up was designed to enable us to give 2/6d more to the old age pensioner, they would vote against the money to pay for it.</P>
    <P>As I have said here before, I say again that we have the courage to give these benefits to the old age pensioners and others.  We have the courage also to go to the people and say: &ldquo;You must pay more in order to give these benefits to the old age pensioners, and so on&rdquo;.  The Labour Party, who talk so much about doing more for the old age pensioners, are not prepared to risk a single vote to do it.  They are not prepared to risk the vote of the man who takes a pint, who smokes cigarettes or who takes a glass of whiskey.  They are afraid that they will lose a vote if they approve of the extra taxation involved.  Of course Fine Gael are the same but they are beyond redemption.  I do not refer to them any more.</P>
    <P>The only plank left now in the Labour programme, as far as I can see, is control of prices.  I am definitely against control of prices because we tried it once and the result was that prices went up.  It is perfectly obvious <Col N="810" /> that prices will go up in many cases if you resort to control.  For instance, take butter in the city of Dublin at the present time.  Everybody knows that butter can be got by any shopper who is prepared to go searching for it at much below the ordinary price fixed for the consumer.  Of course, if it goes to a tribunal to fix a price, the tribunal will have regard to all the costs of transport, the cost to the retailer, the increase in wages on the retailer and there is no doubt whatever that they will put up the price to at least what it is at the moment, if not higher still.  That is what they did in 1940 when we put on control.  They put all the prices up.  I was Minister for Agriculture.  I remember when butter and bacon went up in price because the shops at that time made such a case to the Controller that he agreed with the shops that they had a good case and fixed the price higher than it had been up to that.  The same would happen with other commodities.</P>
    <P>Labour should have some originality.  They should try to think of something else besides this dead horse of theirs they are trying to flog&mdash;control of prices.</P>
    <P>Somebody said that the Government went down to Cork and Kildare and claimed that they were responsible for the 12 per cent increase in wages and salaries.  They had a right to say that they were responsible for the conditions that made it possible to give the 12 per cent.  After all, if the Government had not pursued the policy they did pursue and had not built up the industries and built up the incomes all over, built up exports, and so on, as I have already enumerated, that 12 per cent would not have been possible.  Nobody would think of recommending 12 per cent in 1956, at the end of the Coalition period, because I suppose those who were left in employment at the time were very glad to carry on as they were and glad that they were not put out like many of their comrades.</P>
    <P>Somebody spoke about a State company.  I think he had in mind CIE. I quite agree that manufacturers, for instance, generally speaking, should be able to organise their business to meet <Col N="811" /> an increase in wages occasionally. They should all the time be improving their technique, improving their organisation, and so on, and be able now and again to give an increase in wages and many of them are doing it and have not put up their prices.  But I must say that I cannot see how an organisation like CIE can meet an increase in wages except by putting up the fares. If any Deputy can suggest to them or to me another way of doing it, we would be glad to hear it.  Personally, I cannot see how it can be done.</P>
    <P>We were told by Deputy Corish that we have not made a spectacular reduction in the unemployment figures.  It is not spectacular.  I have often said in this House already that we are not satisfied with our achievement in regard to unemployment, but, at least, we should not be criticised by the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party, considering the figure they left us when they went out of office in the beginning of 1957.  It was 100,000 at that time.  It is down to 60,000 now&mdash;a vast improvement, but not good enough, and I quite agree that we should try to do much better, if we possibly can.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman raised one point, looking for information, with regard to rates on Government property.  The Estimate shows a decrease of £29,000. This is due, I believe, to a payment of £66,800 by the Post Office in respect of rates on premises occupied by that Department.  Without this payment, the Estimate would have shown a net increase of £37,000.  I think that is the explanation Deputy Sweetman was looking for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>Before section 6 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Land Commission shall subdivide and allocate land acquired under the Land Purchase Acts within two years from the date of the acquisition thereof.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment should be adopted by the Minister.  The amendment restricts the Land Commission to a period of two years in which to subdivide and allocate the land.  It is to be noted that the period of two years runs only from the time of acquisition, the date on which the final order of the Commission to acquire the land is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have known cases in which the Land Commission have had land on hands for a considerable time.  In many cases they acquire land and set it on the conacre system and in most cases the lettings run for three years.  A person who takes land for a corn <Col N="813" /> crop usually manures the ground. They have the benefit of the root crop and usually the benefit of the manured ground for a crop the following season. We often had complaints from smallholders who said that while a farm is conacred by the Land Commission at very high prices, the land is what they describe as &ldquo;run out&rdquo; by the time it is allocated.  The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that the Land Commission may not have lands on hand indefinitely.  I think the Minister will agree that we should have this new section which I feel is most desirable. At least, I ask the Minister to consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Although there are a number of points of view on this, the main consideration is the necessity of allowing the Land Commission to acquire a sufficient pool of land in a locality to enable them to distribute the land in economic holdings.  Nobody in this House has given the Land Commission more trouble than myself on the question of speeding up land division but there are times when it is most desirable that the Land Commission be allowed to retain land in order to build up the reserve or pool of land in a locality.  There is justifiable criticism of the inexplicable delay on the part of the Commission in dividing land they have on hand in various areas.  In reply to questions by Deputies, it has been disclosed that the Commission have had land on hand in some cases for ten and 15 years. There is no justification for that but I am afraid, when we specify two years, we may not allow the Commission enough time to do justice to a particular locality in regard to the pool of land which might be available in a period of three or four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hoped that one or two sections of this Bill, particularly sections 5 and 6 which are new sections and which we hope will be administered in an intelligent and very flexible way, will bring to the Land Commission a greater pool of land.  Undoubtedly, difficulties will arise where old people are concerned on the question of title and perhaps on the question of persuading them that it is much better to give up land.  That delay may be considerable <Col N="814" /> and would not be the fault of the Land Commission.  I do not see why, if the Land Commission have one farm available in a locality, they should be forced by law to divide that when perhaps in six months' time two or three farms would come into their hands in the same area which would enable them to do a reasonable job in solving the problems of the locality.</P>
    <P>A great deal of justifiable criticism can be levelled at the Land Commission for delay.  I know that this criticism also comes about because very often the land they hold is so let that its life and richness is drained away. Apparently, no care is exercised about the nourishing of the soil with the result that the land becomes very poor. That happens through constant lettings.  Much of the criticism of the Land Commission over lettings is due to the fact that preference seems to be given to the wrong type of individual. There is justification for that criticism because in some areas it appears that the big man gets the preference in the letting of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is fantastic.  On the amendment, it is completely impracticable.  There was never such a rule at law under the Land Acts and it could not possibly be carried out in practice.  In fact, as a matter of policy, there is a standing instruction from me to the Land Commission that in any case where there is a delay of more than three years, it must be brought to my personal attention.  It would be unrealistic to seek to deal with these cases in two years.  Where migrants' holdings <Col N="817" /> are being carved out, it is impossible to get buildings erected in two years. Quite often it takes very much longer.</P>
      <P>At the present time, it is a very difficult matter to get buildings erected on these migrants' holdings.  As well, I am sure the Deputy who moved the amendment would be the very first to complain if all the people within the mile limit were not approached by Land Commission officers to get particulars about allotments of land.  The Deputy would be the very first to have a motion here if any estate were peremptorily divided without proper particulars being taken of people within a certain radius.</P>
      <P>Under this also comes the question of boglands being acquired.  In such cases, thousands of pounds expenditure would be involved before they could be made accessible to people with turbary rights.  Roads would have to be built and there would have to be large drainage schemes before the boglands would be accessible to the tenants for whom they were intended.  Again, if you had the Land Commission's hands tied in this way, it would be impossible for the Commission to carry on because they would be open to <i>mandamus</i> proceedings.</P>
      <P>Let me make it clear that the Land Commission do not hold lands unnecessarily.  They hold lands for the simple reason that in many cases they are not in a position to proceed with a scheme for their division.  There is the position I referred to on another section in regard to rundale estates where rearrangement schemes are involved. Such schemes entail agreement of all those concerned&mdash;swopping of intermixed lands for new lands.</P>
      <P>In many cases some of the lands left are in fact the hard core of the congested districts where the Land Commission could not achieve agreement throughout the years.  In some such cases, the Land Commission have had lands in their hands for periods of up to 20 years because they could not proceed, being unable to get the co-operation of the people in regard to swopping and exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies can imagine what the <Col N="818" /> position would be if in instances of that kind the Land Commission's hands were tied as suggested in the amendment.  There is also the position where the Land Commission get a portion of land or a holding and they have earmarked a couple more holdings in the same area for acquisition.  I answered a question today in which these circumstances arose.  The Land Commission acquired 45 acres in a certain district and there are proceedings pending for the acquisition of a further 100 odd acres in the same district.  The Land Commission are awaiting the outcome of these proceedings because if they can get the extra 100 acres, they will be in a position to initiate a more workable division scheme.  For all those reasons, this amendment, which would tie the Land Commission's hands completely, is both impracticable and unworkable and, I suggest to the House, should be rejected out of hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When making his case, the Minister avoided, I would say deliberately, cases which would come within the scope of the amendment if it were passed.  I have great sympathy for the mover of the amendment because I feel he was trying to do something which he believes should be done.  The Minister's explanation, and that of Deputy McQuillan before he left the House, showed that there are cases in which the two year limit might interfere with the work of the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>For that reason, I feel we could not support the amendment as it stands, but surely the Minister is more aware than anybody else of the large Meath-estates in my constituency that have been in the possession of the Land Commission, not for three years but for six, seven and even eight years. As far as the local people are concerned, there is no reason why these estates have not been divided.</P>

    <P>They were estates which ran up to 600, 700, 800 or 900 acres.  If there had been any question of title involved, then this amendment would have covered it because it says: &ldquo;within two years from the date of the acquisition thereof&rdquo;.  They were estates taken over but for some extraordinary <Col N="819" /> reason they were retained by the Land Commission.  One of them was the Crowley Estate in Trim.  It was taken over in 1957 and portion of it has been divided recently.  When I put down a question and accused the Land Commission of holding on to those estates in order to make money on them by letting them on the 11-months system, the Minister said it was all nonsense, that in fact the Land Commission were losing money.  It seems extraordinary that the Land Commission should voluntarily lose money on those estates continuously over periods of six, seven and eight years.</P>
    <P>If it were a question of rearrangement, as would arise in rundale areas, I could understand the necessity for a lengthy delay in division or allocation, but in the case of the estates I have mentioned, there was no reason for the delays.  One of the biggest complaints about the disposition of those estates, and one of the things the Minister must look at very closely if he is to deal effectively with land rearrangement, is the fact that estates have been taken from land owners because they did not work them properly.</P>
    <P>They were taken over by the Land Commission who proceeded, over a period of as long as seven years to my knowledge, to set them on the 11-months system.  It is pretty hard to try to make anyone understand that what is wrong for a private individual to do is right for the Land Commission to do.  There are instances of estates where workmen were disemployed as a result of the Land Commission taking over.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the Minister would say if he were in the position of one of those workmen, looking at the Land Commission setting the land on which he formerly got a week's wages, setting it over the years, while he either looked for employment elsewhere or signed at the local labour exchange.  I think the Minister just cannot waive the arguments we have made in favour of this amendment by saying: &ldquo;There are many complications for the small farmers; they are involved in redivision.  We have to take our time and we have not been able to build houses&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> No matter what the Minister says, the facts are that estates have been over-held.  One of the main reasons&mdash; it is not a reason but an excuse&mdash;being given by the Land Commission for over-holding the estates is that where there are a lot of recent applications there is what they like to call local agitation.  The Land Commission hold on to the estates until local people who are expecting to get portion of the estate get sick and tired of waiting.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not allow that to happen.  The Minister would be very well advised not alone to take over the estates and within the quickest possible time re-allocate them, but as well, let the people who apply for land know by return post, if possible, whether or not they are entitled to land.  The Minister has made the argument here that we would be complaining if we knew that everybody who has applied within a mile distance of the estate was not visited.  Of course we complain and of course it does no good for the applicants either.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that on a number of occasions it has been brought to his notice that such people are not visited by the inspector.  The Land Commission may make the argument that they knew they were not entitled to land.  How do they know? Have they a crystal ball which tells them the people were not entitled to land?  That is being used as an argument against this amendment&mdash;because of the fact we have to do these things we cannot divide the land within the period suggested in the amendment.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest sympathy with Deputy O.J. Flanagan in the idea behind the amendment.  The Minister may be correct in saying that in every case it would be wrong to tie it to a period of two years.  But I think the Minister could, before this Bill becomes law, introduce an amendment which would cut the time limit to one which he considers suitable to the Land Commission and which would prevent the abuses which are occurring at the present time.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot sincerely accept the Minister's statement and I regret he is not prepared <Col N="821" /> to accept the amendment.  I moved this amendment because of my own knowledge of the delays which exist in the Land Commission.  I have been associated with the workings of the Land Commission during the 21 years I have been a member of this House.  I find that the delays there in many cases have been very unreasonable and I do not accept for one moment the Minister's suggestion that the Land Commission could not possibly erect buildings and houses within a period of two years from the taking over of the full possession of the holding.</P>
      <P>Here is a case, and according to my amendment, as Deputy Tully has correctly pointed out, the Land Commission shall subdivide and allocate land acquired under the Land Purchase Acts within two years from the date of acquisition thereof.  That goes to show that by the time the Land Commission actually acquires the land they have already had rulings on title.  They have already investigated the proper title, the legal formalities have been gone through and the transfer of the property has actually been effected.</P>

      <P>From the date the Land Commission acquire the land. I quite agree that there may be exceptional cases.  It might not be possible to have the land divided within the two year period, but in normal cases I fail to see why the inspectors cannot interview the applicants and cannot submit a report to the Land Commission and why the Land Commission cannot have a decision to allocate and divide land within a period of two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience of Land Commission inspectors is that not alone are they courteous but they are efficient in the discharge of their duties.  Here we find <Col N="822" /> that the Land Commission inspectors know exactly what the demand for land is before the Land Commission acquire the land.  Otherwise the Land Commission might not have acquired the land on the report of the Land Commission inspector&mdash;that here we have a case of congestion prevailing in this area where we have X number of smallholders and it is on that the Land Commission acquire the land. Surely it is reasonable to put a fixed period, of, say, two years within which the Land Commission must have the land divided and allotted.</P>
    <P>I know very well that there may be exceptional cases, as the Minister says. I quite agree that that might affect exchanges and resettlements.  That could go on for years, waiting for some person who may not fall into line with the scheme.  There may be very special circumstances where the Land Commission may not wish in any way to unduly press that certain applicants may have to leave the district to go elsewhere in order to effect suitable resettlement.  There are exceptional cases in which it might not be done but in the normal run of things the Land Commission inspectors, most certainly the chief inspectors, know quite well the local circumstances when submitting their reports on which decisions are made by the Land Commission to acquire the land.  An inspector also knows the number of small holdings in the area which need to be increased and he knows the family circumstances of every applicant for land in that area.</P>
    <P>Therefore, having all that information, I still cannot understand why the Land Commission cannot, within a period of two years, finalise any one case, bearing in mind that before acquisition they already have that information in their records in the Land Commission.  More particularly, information is available there which will be very helpful in assisting the Land Commission in relieving local congestion.  In the case of granting relief to local congestion, it should be the policy of the Land Commission, it should be Government policy&mdash;and the Minister should so direct the Land Commission &mdash; that in the case of <Col N="823" /> relieving local congestion no delay should normally occur.</P>
    <P>When country people are asked to describe the Land Commission, the description they give it is that the Land Commission is a big body which moves very slowly.  It has the name in the country of moving very slowly. As a matter of fact, it even beats the Board of Works in that respect.  Now that we are modernising the land law such a provision should be included, if for no other purpose than to change the bad name the Land Commission have of putting matters on the long finger.  I do not want to be critical of the Minister.  He knows me long enough to know that I will not be intentionally critical.</P>

      <P>The Minister has gone beyond the time for bedtime stories.  If he cannot sleep within the next two years with a bit of ease, he will not need the assistance of bedtime stories.</P>
      <P>Two years should be ample time for the Land Commission to conclude any deal and dispose of the land. Deputy Tully is right when he says that a temporary letting takes place after the Land Commission acquire the land.  In some cases that has gone on for five or six years.  We are faced with the position of the Land Commission acquiring land speedily but then having it set at very high prices. The Land Commission obtain record conacre prices, not because the local applicants can afford to take the land but because, as Deputy Tully pointed out, some big landowner who needs land comes along with his cheque book and outbids the local applicants, the congests and smallholders.  This can be carried on, not for two seasons, but for three seasons; and I have known cases of the Land Commission setting land for a second three-year period.  To set land for six years which is on the list for division is unreasonable.  I put down this amendment to prevent the Land Commission from doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where land is required for allocation <Col N="824" /> there should be no difficulty in finding suitable migrants, because there is a large number of them in all congested districts.  They are already listed by the Land Commission.  Most Deputies hear from them.  They themselves do not mind getting a twopenny post-card, making their claims and addressing them to the Land Commission.  No Department of State must receive a greater volume of correspondence from congests and applicants for land than the Land Commission.  Therefore, in the case of land for the relief of congestion there should not be a two years' delay, because the information is already on record.</P>
    <P>If a time limit is imposed, the Land Commission officials will face up to the new position and realise the urgency of the situation.  I am not questioning the efficiency of the Land Commission inspectors.  Nevertheless, there is nothing like tying up the matter in such a way that they will have a period of two years in which to complete any transaction.  The Minister can say to them: &ldquo;Now you have this holding turned over to you on such a date.  It is your job to carry out the investigation and have the allocation made before such-and-such a date&rdquo;&mdash;giving them a two-year period.  If that is done, it will eliminate many of the unnecessary grievances in areas where the Land Commission are setting land which the local applicants cannot take in conacre because they cannot pay the higher prices.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look at this again.  He might consult with some of the senior officials of the Land Commission who have knowledge of what takes place at these conacre lettings. Some of the smallholders who afterwards get the land from the Land Commission have to pay up to £120 per season for conacre.  Some of them have already bought out the land with the amount they had to pay for conacre.  This can be remedied by the insertion of the new section I suggest in my amendment.  I am not prepared to press the matter unduly, but I draw the attention of the House to the unreasonable delays which take place. The Minister does not satisfy me when he talks about the poor quality of the <Col N="825" /> land or says that houses and buildings cannot be erected in that period.  We are not dealing with houses and buildings; we are dealing with the allocation of the land.  If the land were allocated, the buildings could go ahead, so long as the lands were in the possession of the applicants within two years.  It is a reasonable case, and I ask the Minister to look at it again.  Perhaps he may have some suggestions to make on the Report Stage?</P>

      <P>According to the Deputy, everybody knows the Land Commission officials are highly inefficient people who do no work and leave lands undivided.  The cases cited here, particularly that by Deputy Tully, were exceptional cases.  Speaking from memory, the Crowley lands were some of the best lands acquired. They were reserved to deal mainly with over-standard holdings, that is, to try to satisfy people with large holdings in the congested counties, to try to get them to migrate.  In fact, they have been used for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully was talking with his tongue in his cheek when he suggested that immediately any person wrote to the Land Commission asking for division, he should be told by return whether he was in or out.  No Deputy in rural Ireland, unless in jocose mood, would make any such suggestion, particularly a Deputy who knows that in the vast majority of cases not alone must the people within the district be considered but that there are about 20 <Col N="826" /> applicants to every three or four congests who have to be considered.  In addition, invariably there are demands from the local GAA for facilities for a sports field, or from the local authority for a place to build labourers' cottages.  All those matters have to be taken into consideration, and to suggest that could be done overnight is completely unrealistic.</P>
    <P>If I saw any merit in the amendment, or in any amendment on similar lines, I would certainly consider it, but I do not see that I would be serving any useful purpose by undertaking to put in something on Report Stage that would completely hamstring the Land Commission in their day-to-day work.  It would be completely impractical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said I was talking with my tongue in my cheek. Surely the Minister will agree that it should be possible within eight years for an applicant for land to know whether he is entitled to get it?  Sometimes the land is being divided before the applicant realises he is not getting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most anxious that the Land Commission should get rid of land as quickly as they possibly can, subject to the other matters I have mentioned.  I have said before, and I repeat, that since I became Minister, I have given a direction that if they have land on hands for over three years from the date of acquisition, the matter is to be brought to my notice.  Deputies have the ordinary procedure by way of motion or question to raise a case where they consider, from their local knowledge, that undue delay has occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is very reasonable now, but I am sorry he was not so reasonable when I asked him a question.  The answer he gave me on one occasion could hardly be termed polite.  I am sure he will remember the occasion if he wants to do so.  He should brush up his knowledge about the estate I mentioned because while I would not say that he was deliberately misleading, his information is not correct.  After eight years, the land <Col N="827" /> has been divided and most of it has gone to a local applicant.  For that I am truly thankful.  However, it does not arise on the amendment and I shall not pursue it.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wishes me to do so after the recess, by way of question, I can give him a series of farms which have been in the possession of the Land Commission for more than three years in Meath.  They have been let for that period, and apparently the Land Commission have no intention of dealing with them.  If the Minister wants to do it that way, I shall be only too glad to oblige.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>Before section 6 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where it is proven to the satisfaction of the Land Commissioners that a farmer or farm worker, even though he be landless, is a suitable person to acquire land either by long lease or credit purchase, he may receive equal consideration with other applicants to whom the present Land Acts apply.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am sure there are cases that would come within the scope of this amendment which the Land Commission would be prepared to consider sympathetically.  There are a number of farms let in conacre at present, have been in the past, and probably will be in the future, which might be leased by their owners to the Land Commission, who could in turn sublet them to farmers' sons or other deserving applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a large number of farmers' sons who are prepared, financed and equipped to work land, and the <Col N="828" /> only drawback is that they cannot get land.  Now that the Land Commission are considering the establishment of a number of schemes, I suggest they should draw up a suitable scheme to deal with those cases.  For example, there is the case of a widow with a young family.  There are many such cases in rural Ireland.  When her family are young, she finds it impossible to pay labour to work the land, and she has to set it in conacre until such time as her family grow up and are able to look after it.  Such a person could very easily come to terms with the Land Commission and, in turn, they could sublet the farm to landless men, farmers' sons, or other deserving applicants who would work it profitably and give it back in good heart when their lease had expired.  The land would then be in a much better condition than if it were let by the owner on the ordinary conacre system for a corresponding period.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why the Land Commission seem to look with disfavour on the question of leasing land or giving it to farmers' sons who may not have a holding of their own.  The Land Commission would be well advised to give special consideration&mdash; whether in congested areas or not&mdash; to the just claims of farmers' sons who are very skilled, who have been working up-to-date, modern methods of agriculture, have attended various lectures, and are prepared to take advice from agricultural instructors as to how to get the best return from the land.</P>
    <P>Most of our farmers' sons, most landless men, and farm workers who are closely connected with the land, are examining ways and means by which they can get the maximum return from the land.  They are familiar with up-to-date methods of laying out the land to get increased production.  It is a great pity the Land Commission do not co-operate to a greater extent with the type of person I have in mind. It should be within the bounds of possibility that every year the Land Commission would look after a number of such people.  There can be as good people working on the land, with a knowledge of farming, who are familiar in every possible way with the land, its <Col N="829" /> workings and its productions but they may not own land themselves.  That is why my amendment to insert this new section asks the Land Commission to lease land or to give such people some consideration because at the present time this Bill in the absence of this new section does nothing whatsoever for such people.</P>
    <P>I find that the agricultural worker and the landless man who has lived his life close to the land and on the land can give as good an account of himself on the land as those who are already in possession of holdings and I recommend that the Minister accept this amendment and agree to insert this new section.  If this new section is inserted it will mean consideration for a number of landless men and a number of farmers' sons who are on the Land Commission list for land at the present time and who can never hope to be successful unless provision is made in this Bill for them to be successful.  I feel that this is a case which will at least give considerable relief to the growing demand for land by farmers' sons and others to whom I have referred in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, if accepted, would not give one rood of land to any landless man in this country as the Deputy well knows.  The question of who is to get land in this country is solely a question of priorities for the Land Commission and Section 31 (1) of the Land Act, 1923, lists the persons or bodies who can benefit under resale schemes.  It is always accepted that the landless men come under clause (f) of that subsection.  Policy lays it down that the relief of congestion shall be the first concern of the Land Commission and they very properly give the bulk of the available land in allotments to congests.  Therefore, if land is available in a particular area, the landless man can and does get consideration.  I have said before that the 40 odd acres needed to satisfy just one landless person could be sufficient to advance four or maybe five existing smallholders in a congested area and to bring them up to the economic level. Deputy O.J. Flanagan would ask us <Col N="830" /> to leave these congests in the mess they are in by providing land for landless men at their expense.</P>
      <P>This amendment in a way is rather typical of Deputy O.J. Flanagan's reasoning to try to go a good distance of the road with every dog that turns. He was arguing earlier tonight in this House that it was completely unrealistic to talk about solving the congestion problem for the 60,000 land congests that are still there and suggested that this Bill was some form of bluff.  Indeed, he said that if we got in the whole of the Six Counties uninhabited we could not make any impact on the land congestion problem under the statistics he quoted.  How much less impact could we make if it were written into the law that landless men would be entitled to be considered on an equal basis with the congests for whom the whole land code has been devised down through the years.  His proposal reads:</P>
      <P>Before section 6 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>Where it is proven to the satisfaction of the Land Commissioners that a farmer or farm worker, even though he be landless, is a suitable person to acquire land either by long lease or credit purchase, he may receive equal consideration with other applicants to whom the present Land Acts apply.</P>
      <P>That is simply throwing the door wide open and is in direct conflict with the policy recommendations made by the people the Deputy is so fond of quoting in this House, the NFA, who have made recommendations on the order of priorities that people should get land in direct conflict with the Deputy's proposal here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the existing law and as a matter of policy, the Land Commission are entitled under the particular section of the 1923 Land Act to which I have referred to give land to landless men if they in their wisdom think fit.  But, land being a scarce commodity in the country, in order to try to deal with the problem we have, and the relief of congestion being the fundamental statutory duty of the Land Commission, the landless men must take their place in the queue <Col N="831" /> when priorities are fixed.  But if, as I said, in the division of any estate, having dealt with the congestion problem in the area, there is a case to be made for landless men the Land Commission are in full power under the existing law to deal with them or to allocate land to them.  This is purely a question of policy.  No such amendment as this is necessary for the purpose of giving land to landless men if the Land Commission so decide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister in the last statement he has made that no amendment is necessary to give land to landless men but since the amendment is down here to be debated I should like to point out a few facts to him which apparently have escaped him.  The Constitution of this country guarantees equal rights and equal opportunities for all.  But the Minister for Lands and the Land Commission have decided that they are the people who should judge on the equal rights and equal opportunities where land division is concerned.  They have tried to make a type of third or fourth class citizen out of the person who, though he has been employed on land all his life, though he knows more about land than any congest who is brought into the midlands, is passed over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware that one of his predecessors, a Fianna Fáil Minister for Lands, and the Land Commission in the mid-1930s gave quite a considerable number of farms to landless men and some of the best farmers in County Meath now are those landless men and their sons.  Why the change took place I do not know.  The Minister can tell us that the pool of land will not go around to everybody and that therefore it must be conserved for the congests. If the Minister for Lands and the Land Commission were getting hold of all the land which they could rightly acquire, and divided it, we could understand his being so careful about the people to whom he gave land.  In view of the fact that they are not doing that, and that more land than would satisfy quite a large number of landless men who are applicants is being allowed to pass into other hands, I am sure the <Col N="832" /> Minister's argument does not carry the weight which he would like to have it carry.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not there is a pet hate in the Land Commission. I do not know whether or not the officials have a prayer which they say every morning: &ldquo;I shall not facilitate a landless man in any way&rdquo; because one of the really extraordinary things is that while the Land Commission inspectors visit all sorts of people and allocate from time to time farms to some really extraordinary people, for the past few years, with very few exceptions, the landless man is passed over.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would like to tell the House how it is that somebody who lives in a congested area and who has only anything from a £2 valuation up&mdash;and a £2 valuation is a pretty small farm&mdash;may be given a full-sized farm even though his knowledge of farming may be almost nil and at the same time he will refuse to give any land at all to a landless man or a man of maybe £5 valuation in the outside areas that are not congested areas when a farm is being divided in the neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>The Minister should change his policy because I believe the position has been reached that landless men are beginning to feel that there is some curse on them and that the Land Commission believe they are people who should not be allowed to exist in any area.  The Minister should be very careful about handling this particular section.  While the amendment goes much further than the points being discussed by the Minister or myself, he should have a good look at the situation where landless men are concerned and should if possible, and in many cases it is possible, give them a share of the land which is being divided.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the people who are brought from congested areas to look at land and who, having looked at it, decide, although it may be first-class land, that it is not what they want.  If the Minister would take a chance on it, he could go to the vicinity of a farm which is being divided and interview some of the landless men and small farmers who <Col N="833" /> live around that estate and hear some of the comments of people who come by bus and car to look at the land and then turn up their noses and depart and he could see whether or not the local people would be prepared to take the same land.  I am sure the Minister must be aware that it is a grave hardship on people who have been dealing with agriculture all their lives, as small farmers, farmers' sons or farm workers.  When a farm is being divided locally, they should receive more consideration than they are getting.  In exceptional circumstances, they do get land but if they do, there is usually a reason which is not the reason I would give if I were recommending them for land to the Minister.</P>

I suppose we will have it for all time. Nobody on this side of the House has suggested at any time that there are not men who are not owners with a good knowledge of agriculture.  Of course they are there and I have come across many of them and know of many of those who make their living by working land which they hold under conacre or letting agreements, from one end of the country to the other. Nobody has denied that these people are there.  From the point of view of the common good, the job we have to tackle in regard to priorities must be recognised.  The State is now providing a very substantial amount of money to try to deal with the congestion problem. I wonder would the Deputy who talks about farmers' sons who are landless ever argue that the taxpayer should also come to the aid of the shoemaker's son, for instance, to provide a living for him, or the small shopkeeper's son or the plasterer's son or all these other people's sons who have to be provided for in this life?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the old argument being made by Deputies in some of these areas and which is a very <Col N="834" /> popular argument against migrants coming in.  It is naturally good politics for a Deputy living in the midlands to say that every mother's son from all over that area should get, as they say in the country, a bit of what is going, no matter what he is at.  Deputy Tully invites me to consider the reaction of local landless men when they see migrants refusing to take land and to ask would the local people take it.  Of course they would; they would need to be locked up in a lunatic asylum if they refused.  Why would anybody not take a gift of this kind from the State if he could get it?</P>
      <P>I know that the Deputy has to make this kind of case here but the people who come to these areas are surrendering their holdings in whatever part they leave.  We cannot compulsorily migrate these people.  We must get their agreement to accept the holdings being offered to them and they have the right to refuse the holding that is shown to them.  In some cases the Deputy and others may suggest these people were very foolish in turning down some of the holdings offered to them.  That may be so, but it is these people's own choice.</P>
      <P>I do not for a moment accept the allegation by Deputy Tully, not for the first time, that many of these migrants have absolutely no knowledge of agriculture, coming from the places from which they come.  I assert that the whole evidence is to the contrary and the quicker we can get it out of the Deputy's mind and out of other people's minds that every west of Ireland migrant is a Baluba who knows nothing about agriculture, the better for the country.  I have had experience of dealing with these migrants and of getting the opinion of people in some midland towns who assured me of the progress made by these migrants.  In many areas they have revolutionised the working system of the farms they have got and many of them have progressed very well from the comparatively small farms which they received by their own hard work to acquiring further land in the areas to which they have migrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me be quite clear on this amendment.  As the law stands, the Land Commission are entitled, if they so <Col N="835" /> wish, to give land to any landless man. The very purpose for which the old Congested Districts Board was founded was to deal with the relief of congestion.  That is the fundamental reason for the Land Commission being in existence.  It is the fundamental reason for these millions that have been voted to the Land Commission since the foundation of the State for the relief of congestion.  Congests, because of their number, must be a first charge on the pool of land available.</P>
    <P>This amendment is not necessary in order to provide land for landless men. Indeed, even if it were accepted, it would not be effective in providing land for landless men.  The policy of the Land Commission is well known. It has been clearly laid down.  I think it is wrong to encourage landless men into the belief that, except in very special circumstances, they will be entitled to participate in the division of land.  On the division of estates, employees of long standing, who are considered suitable by the Land Commission, have been allocated holdings in some instances.  It is also true that, where local congestion problems have been solved and there has been some land left over, accommodation plots and so on have been given to landless men.  I assume that policy will continue.  This amendment is quite unnecessary from the point of view of enabling the Land Commission to give land to landless men, if they, in their wisdom, think proper to do so.</P>

      <P>May I point out that it was the Minister who used the term to which he has referred when speaking about migrants, and not I.  We have literally thousands of them in Meath.  Most are excellent farmers. A small number know nothing whatever about agriculture.  They have locked up their farms and gone to work in England.  The Minister is as well aware of that as I am.</P>

      <P>They could not make a living on a good farm.  The Minister should not talk nonsense.  He knows nothing about it.  May I say that the good farmers are more against bringing in more migrants than I am?  Will the Minister get that into his head? They are the people who say that, if there is a further division of land in the area, they are entitled to it and not, to use their own expression, some more migrants.  It is extraordinary that, while the Minister is prepared to blame me and accuse me of casting a slur on his fellow-countymen, who have come over to Meath, he does not seem to appreciate that what I am saying is that, while the people who are there have been made welcome, we feel the people who are actually living in the county, including those who have come in, should be considered before any more are brought in.</P>

      <P>The Minister expresses horror at the idea of including landless men.  One recalls that there was a period in which his Party encouraged applications from landless men and considered such applications. That did not work too well and it was a countyman of mine, who was Minister at the time, who admitted it was a failure in the circumstances in which the policy had been operated.  I am satisfied there is a category worthy of consideration under this section.  I spoke to the Minister about them and he expressed a certain sympathy.  I refer to the dairymen in the south of Ireland.</P>

      <P>They are classified as landless men and this amendment would give them the recognition they have not got at the moment.  They do not own land.  They rent land and they pay dearly for it.  They spend their lives working it.  They rear families on it.  They are landless; yet, they are not considered.  All their experience and their qualifications demand that they should be considered.  They do <Col N="837" /> not rob the land they work; they put back into it more than they take out of it.  They have very little hope of ever becoming land owners.  They have grown smaller in numbers now and I suggest to the Minister they would prove very desirable allottees.  They are not satisfied they have got a fair crack of the whip.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to recognise the existence of this category.  Because of their high outgoings, they have not been able to save to buy land and I suggest they are entitled to special consideration.  They have proved themselves capable, despite high rents, of increasing production.  Their children are being trained in agriculture and as dairymen and would prove worthy successors of their parents.  When I was a child, there were greater numbers of them than there are today. They have no hope of competing for land in the open market.  I appeal to the Minister to accept these in the category of landless men.</P>

      <P>My question has a bearing upon the behaviour of the Government and of the Board of Works, in particular, in relation to the withholding of certain portraits from this House.  The Committee unanimously decided that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government are usurping the functions of the Ceann Comhairle and of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and thereby are insulting the elected representatives of the Irish people. I make no apology to anybody in this House for making the public aware of the fact that even the Fianna Fáil members of the Committee, including the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="840" /> to the Taoiseach, were unanimous in coming to the decision that what had been done was wrong.  Therefore, the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government stand condemned and there is no need for me to say any more.</P>

      <P>You, Sir, have rightly pointed out that the subject matter of Question No. 9 which Deputy Ryan raises on the Adjournment tonight has nothing to do with any decision which may have been arrived at by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I would say, however, in passing that Deputy Ryan was not present at the meeting and neither was I; but his report of what took place there is incorrect.  I should also like to point out that there is no necessity for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to reiterate the fact that you, Sir, are in charge of any decisions as far as the House is concerned.  I would remind the House, however, that in the final analysis, it is the Government who decide what portraits or busts are hung here or what alterations or additions may be made.</P>
      <P>Be that as it may, a large reconstruction job is taking place in Leinster House.  Every member of the Houses of the Oireachtas, every member of the Press and anyone who has any connections with Leinster House is well aware that there has been a certain amount of upset.  As I pointed out today in reply to one of Deputy Ryan's supplementaries, other pictures were removed besides the three portraits of Michael Collins, Arthur Griffith, and Kevin O'Higgins.

      <P>There was no objection when the other portraits I mentioned were removed and those which comprised the Taylor Bequest.  I was approached by representatives of the building contractors and they told me that if all the pictures in Leinster House were not removed, they could not be responsible for any damage caused.  As I say, the other pictures except the three in question, were also removed.  I am not so naive as not to think that the removal of the three portraits in this corridor might give Deputies such as Deputy Ryan some cause for comment.  Therefore, I was particularly careful to note that the late President Kennedy would be coming to this House to address us on 28th <Col N="842" /> June, 1963, and I instructed my officials not to remove these portraits until the late President had spoken in this House.  I tried to be as fair as possible in that regard.  After the President addressed the House, early in July the pictures were taken for cleaning.</P>
      <P>Some play was made here today by Deputy Ryan with the long delay. I pointed out to the House that the restorer in question, who is also restorer for the National Gallery paintings, was ill and it was only recently that he returned to his office.  We have no knowledge of any other competent persons to do this work.  It may well be that they are there.  But, apart from all that, there was nothing insidious, nothing sinister, in our removing the portraits or in the fact that they have not yet been re-hung.</P>
      <P>I might point out also, in passing, that the portraits of Deputy John A. Costello, former Taoiseach and of former Deputy William T. Cosgrave were commissioned by the Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, in 1960.  If there is a suggestion of bitterness, it emanates from the minds of a very small number of Deputies, and I am glad to say, a very small minority.</P>
      <P>I should have said earlier that quite a major job of reconstruction was done on the staircase leading from the lobby.  As Deputies will recall, there was a tremendous amount of scaffolding brought in; there were heavy weights there for the purpose of testing the beams, and so on and, as I have said, the builders asked me, long before July, to have these paintings removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question, again, that Fianna Fáil have some bitterness or some ulterior motive, I should like to point out that the files and the records point to quite the opposite.  For instance, there was, in 1923, in the front of Leinster Lawn, a memorial commissioned by the then Government to Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins.  That was constructed of lath and plaster.  It collapsed when the Fianna Fáil Government first came into power.  But it is interesting to note that in regard to the obelisk which now stands in Leinster Lawn a direction was given on 16th September, 1947, for the preparation <Col N="843" /> of a design in the form of an obelisk to be erected in Leinster Lawn, the design to include provision for a cross and for medallions of Griffith, Collins and O'Higgins.  That was a decision of a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach and a Fianna Fáil Government. Surely that is not indicative of any bitterness or small-mindedness in any way?</P>
    <P>I have already stated that the Government have decided that portraits of seven members of the Cabinet of 1921, comprised of Eamon de Valera, William T. Cosgrave, Michael Collins, Cathal Brugha, Robert Barton, Arthur Griffith and Austin Stack will be hung in the lobby or vestibule of the new entrance to Leinster House which is known at present as the front office, when the partitions are taken away.  That will be the most honoured place in the re-designed Leinster House and will be, I hope, an example to our generation, as well as generations to come, of the ancient unity which existed at that time and which I hope will exist again.</P>
    <P>I could make a contentious speech here tonight in reply to the Deputy.  I have no intention of doing so.  Neither the Deputy nor I was here at the time the Cabinet of 1921 was formed.  I certainly think that modern Ireland has no time for the bitterness or quarrels of that period and that there is far too much work to be done in Ireland today and all of us, on all sides of the House, have to look to the future.  I am glad to say that there are very many Deputies on all sides of the House who have that spirit.</P>
    <P>I should also like to say that, the seven portraits of the Cabinet of 1921 having been catered for in the most honoured position of the House, there will be put in a place of honour portraits of John A. Costello, a former Taoiseach, the late Patrick Hogan and the late Kevin O'Higgins.  There will be co-operation with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the Ceann Comhairle.  If there has been any lack of courtesy, certainly it is not due to the Government but can be laid at my <Col N="844" /> feet and certainly there was no intention at any time of showing any lack of courtesy as far as the House and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges were concerned.  I intend to co-operate with that body as fairly as possible and to tell them what the Government's intentions are and certainly the Government will be guided greatly by what they may suggest.  It is a Committee comprised of Deputies of all Parties.</P>
    <P>There is so much more which could be said but I intend to refrain from sounding any contentious note.  As a member of the same generation as Deputy Ryan, I am deeply aware of the presence which we all feel in this House of the late President Kennedy. Every one of us was deeply impressed by a phrase which he quoted from Yeats in the course of his magnificent address to the House:</P>
    <P>Let us not casually reduce that great past to a trouble of fools, for we need not feel the bitterness of the past to discover its meaning for the present and the future.</P>
    <P>That expresses the feeling of all well-intentioned people for the future of our country.  At this time, with critical decisions, not only before the Government, but before the Dáil, with regard to the deployment of our soldiers possibly in Cyprus, a matter which has to come before this House, we cannot be unmindful of the maturity which was purchased in blood by our young men in the Congo, and surely it should be possible for people of their generation, like Deputy Ryan and myself and the younger people here, to adopt a more mature attitude and to show that we as members of the Legislature are deeply conscious of their sacrifice and are deeply aware also of our responsibilities to them and to the Irish nation as a whole.</P>
