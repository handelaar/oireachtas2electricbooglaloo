      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Árd-Chláraitheora), and certain Services administered by that Office, including Grants to Local Authorities and miscellaneous Grants.</P>

    <P>Perhaps I should explain at this stage that there is another Supplementary Estimate tabled for my Department, for a sum of £485,000.  I intend, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to mention this proposed provision in the course of my statement, but this second Supplementary <Col N="1290" /> Estimate will not, of course, be moved until the end of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I shall begin by reviewing briefly the more significant vital statistics.  In 1962 there were more births, more marriages and fewer deaths than in 1961.  I am not claiming credit for all that, of course.  The number of births registered was 61,782, an increase of 1,957 on the previous year.  The rate, at 21.9 per 1,000 of the population, was again appreciably higher than in England and Wales where it was 18.0 per 1,000 and in Scotland where it was 20.1 per 1,000. The number of marriages in 1962 was 15,627, an increase of 298 on 1961. The number of deaths was 33,838, a decrease of 925.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heart disease, accounting for 10,974 deaths as compared with 11,064 in 1961, was, as previously, by far the most fatal of morbid conditions.  Next to heart disease, but a long way behind it, cancer was again the greatest &ldquo;killer&rdquo;.  It accounted for 4,897 deaths in 1962, as compared with 4,704 in the previous year.  Of the deaths from cancer, 697 were from those forms of the disease which are grouped under the title of lung cancer.  The corresponding figure for 1961 was 682.  I shall revert to this matter and comment upon it later.  When introducing the Estimate for 1962-63, I expressed the hope that a cobalt unit for cancer treatment would soon be available at St. Luke's Hospital, Rathgar.  I am glad to be able to report that the installation of the necessary apparatus was completed during 1962 and that patients have been receiving treatment at the new unit since November of that year.  Recently I sanctioned proposals for the provision of a second cobalt unit at St. Luke's and for a further unit at St. Agatha's at Cork.  It will, however, be some time before these two new units are in operation.  I may mention here that recently a research <Col N="1291" /> project into the manner in which cancer spreads in the human body from its site of origin has been embarked upon at St. Luke's Hospital. This study is not being financed from funds at my disposal, but important accommodation and facilities for it are being made available at the hospital.</P>
    <P>Simultaneously with the erection and equipment of the cobalt unit at St. Luke's Hospital a new department for the provision of a radio-isotope service was also built and equipped.  The capital and running costs are high and it is imperative that the services it offers should be availed of on a wide scale.  This has been arranged for and the department at St. Luke's Hospital is providing services for other institutions and for large numbers of outpatients.</P>
    <P>Before I pass on to the other matters which arise out of the Estimate, I feel that I should again recall how the recently-issued Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon-General of the United States Public Health Service on smoking and health has highlighted the grave hazards which statistical studies indicate are associated with smoking and, more especially, cigarette smoking.  I do not wish to labour the point but if I were addicted to cigarettes, which I am not, I should accept that report as a very grave warning and change my smoking habits accordingly.</P>
    <P>The total number of deaths from all forms of tuberculosis was 426 in 1962 as against 420 in 1961.  The figure for 1962 is the second lowest on record. The incidence of the disease continues to decline, the number of new and reactivated cases in 1962 being about 200 fewer than in the previous year; thus the number of beds needed for adult respiratory tuberculosis patients on the 31st March, 1963, was 1,648, as compared with 1,883 on the corresponding date in 1962, and approximately 6,000 nine years ago.</P>
    <P>The position is satisfactory, so far as it does.  Nevertheless, it continues to be most important that everybody should make full use of the facilities available for the prevention of tuberculosis. <Col N="1292" /> To encourage them to do so the National Mass-Radiography Association proposes to concentrate more and more on community surveys, in the course of which an intensive effort is made to secure that everybody in a selected area except young children will come forward for X-ray. While, in general, the response to these surveys has been gratifying, it is regrettable that in some areas it fell far short of what was expected.</P>
    <P>The number of maternal deaths during 1962 was 27, giving a death rate of 0.44 per thousand live births as compared with 0.45 in 1961 and 1.32 in 1957.  But the rate in 1962 for England and Wales was 0.36, for Scotland 0.40 and for Northern Ireland 0.30.  It will be seen, therefore, that we have much ground to make up in this most important sector.</P>
    <P>The infant mortality rate, that is, the deaths of infants under one year expressed as a proportion of every 1,000 live births, resumed its downward trend in 1962, being 29 as compared with 30 in 1961 and 35 in 1958. The corresponding rate for England and Wales was 22 in 1962, while that for Scotland was 27 and for Northern Ireland 27.  It is worth noting that the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme was availed of, fully or partly, in respect of 68 per cent of the 59,825 births registered during 1961.</P>
    <P>At the instance of my predecessor in office, the Medical Research Council of Ireland have engaged on a survey into the causes of perinatal mortality, that is, of foetal deaths, occurring after the 28th week of gestation, and of deaths occurring within seven days after birth.  The field work on this survey has been completed, and arrangements are in train for processing the data under expert professional guidance.</P>
    <P>Infant mortality in the city here is somewhat higher than in the rest of the country; and it has been suggested that the prevalence of congenital malformations may be associated with this fact.  Accordingly, I made a special grant to the Medical Research Council, from the Hospitals Trust Fund, and side by side with the perinatal mortality <Col N="1293" /> survey an investigation into the incidence of such abnormalities in infants born in Dublin city is now in progress.  In this inquiry, which is necessarily a long-term one, an attempt is being made to isolate the factors that interfere with normal intra-uterine development.  The survey is proceeding, but I do not expect that anything will emerge from it for some time yet.</P>
    <P>Over the years the incidence of and deaths from gastro-enteritis in children under two years have continued to be exceptionally high in Dublin city and have been the cause of much concern.  The Medical Research Council have interested themselves in the phenomenon and I have made a grant from the Hospitals Trust Fund to finance an investigation which has been proposed.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of maternal and infant care, I should mention that, at my urgent request, the Medical Research Council undertook a special investigation to establish, so far as might be possible, the number of babies born in each health authority area with deformities which could reasonably be attributed to the use by expectant mothers of the drug thalidomide.  The Council have completed the survey and their report is now being studied in my Department.  In the meantime I have requested the National Organisation for Rehabilitation to consider what facilities are required to assist the children involved.  Many of them will require artificial limbs and the Organisation has arrangements in train for the provision of this service at the National Limb Fitting Centre at Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>There has been an overall decline in the incidence of poliomyelitis: in 1962 59 cases occurred with four deaths.  An examination of the cases reported shows that young people are the most susceptible to the disease.</P>
    <P>When introducing last year's Estimate, I referred to the developments in oral vaccination against poliomyelitis in other countries.  I sought the advice of the Medical Research Council on this matter, and it recommended that a prophylactic service using oral vaccine should be organised on a national basis.  However, I thought it <Col N="1294" /> prudent, because of reports received in September, 1962, of cases of poliomyelitis in Canada and the United States following the administration of oral vaccine, to defer the introduction of the service here.  The Medical Research Council have again considered the question in the light of investigations which were carried out in the countries immediately concerned, and have endorsed their earlier recommendation. I propose to proceed in accordance with this renewed recommendation and hope to introduce a general scheme of anti-polio vaccination during the coming financial year.</P>
    <P>Last year I made special reference to the problem which had been presented by the outbreaks of smallpox which had occurred during 1962 in Great Britain and in the Federal Republic of Germany.  Fortunately, no case of the disease was imported into this country but that the public were alive to the danger was demonstrated by the fact that during the first six months of 1962, over 300,000 people were vaccinated against the disease.  Though this fact in itself was gratifying, it would be much better and more effective if vaccinations were accepted as a routine measure rather than as a safeguard to be sought <i>en masse</i> when an emergency has developed.</P>
    <P>As some public anxiety was manifested when it became known that a case of typhoid had been imported into Dublin from Zermatt, I should make it clear that our public health service is organised and fully equipped to deal with occurrences like this, and that, when circumstances warrant them, all necessary steps to prevent the spread of infection are taken.</P>
    <P>I turn now to a second group of diseases, those which disable rather than kill.  Foremost among these is mental illness.  Despite the fact that the number of mentally ill under institutional care was further reduced during 1962, the condition continues to be one of the most pressing problems in the field of health.  The numbers under care increased steadily in the post-war years up to the year 1958, since when there has been a gradual decline.  Notwithstanding that over the <Col N="1295" /> past five years there has been a reduction of 1,800 in the number of hospitalised mental patients, overcrowding continues to be one of the worst features of our mental health services.</P>
    <P>Some of the reduction was secured by transferring to redundant sanatoria elderly patients, who no longer needed psychiatric care, but for the most part, it was achieved by more intensified treatment, leading to earlier discharge, for those admitted to hospital, coupled with the continued rapid development of out-patient services.  On the other hand, the number of admissions to mental hospitals has also tended to rise, partly because of an increase in the rate of re-admissions, but mainly because the improvement in the services has created a greater demand for them.  Patients are coming forward more readily for treatment and seeking it at an early stage in their illness, at which time the prospects of its success are greatest.  The rising re-admission rate is by no means peculiar to this country, and is mainly attributable to the fact that it is now the accepted thing to give a patient his discharge when he has recovered sufficiently to permit this to be done.  Formerly such a patient might be retained in hospital indefinitely.</P>
    <P>More and more, it is becoming obvious that a high level of community services is an essential element in mental therapy; and I hope as trained personnel becomes available to provide these more generally than heretofore. On the other hand, while in-patient care remains a vital part of the psychiatric services, it is no longer generally regarded as the first line of defence; it is now viewed as a service of last resort, to be availed of only when the possibility of keeping the patient within the community and out of hospital has been exhausted.</P>
    <P>Though we have still, I regret to say, substantial deficiencies to make good, conditions in our mental hospitals have improved considerably.  It is, of course, mainly a matter of the large sums of money which are required to repair generations of neglect.  Yet, I believe, I can claim that <Col N="1296" /> with the little we have had at our disposal much has been done.  I have continued to stress to mental hospital authorities the need to upgrade their institutions.  They have been on the whole most receptive to my suggestions, and I am glad to be able to say that as result, considerable improvement works have been completed or are in progress.</P>
    <P>With my approval, a Training School for Occupational Therapists has been set up at the National Rehabilitation Centre in Dún Laoghaire.  This centre now has 25 students.  Next year the number will be increased by a further 30 and in the following year, there will be yet a further increase.  Occupational therapists are not, of course, employed exclusively in mental hospitals, but the availability of personnel, adequately trained in occupational therapy, will considerably enhance the outlook for the mentally ill.</P>
    <P>There is not anything so depressing as the spectacle of large numbers of patients sitting around in day-rooms and corridors of a mental hospital, doing nothing.  As our capability to occupy the patients in more congenial tasks increases, the change for the better in the morale of patients will be accelerated; for nothing produces a more favourable therapeutic response in the mentally ill than to be made to feel that, however handicapped, one is of some use in the world.  The pride and delight which mental patients exhibit in their occupational accomplishments is convincing evidence of the important part which useful and worthwhile employment can play in the cure and rehabilitation of the mentally ill.  Therefore we shall do our utmost to develop and diversify our facilities for occupational therapy.</P>
    <P>Deputies who participated in the discussions on the Health Authorities Act, 1960, will recall that one of the more teasing problems to be dealt with originated in the fact that for the purpose of the mental hospital service the county of Wicklow was conjoined with the city and county of Dublin in the Grangegorman Mental Hospital Board.  Apart from the fact that some reconsideration of the organisation of the mental health services under the <Col N="1297" /> Dublin Health Authority would be opportune, I have taken the view that it would not only be advantageous to Wicklow to have its own mental hospital, but that if it had, the problem of overcrowding in St. Brendan's and St. Ita's hospitals might be a little eased.</P>
    <P>Thanks to the public spirit of the authorities of the Royal National Hospital for Consumption for Ireland, Newcastle, County Wicklow, to whom I, with the people of County Wicklow and of Dublin city and county, am indebted, it became possible to suggest to the Wicklow County Council that they should establish their own mental hospital.  The county council are considering the suggestion and matters are now, I hope, in train for establishing a new mental hospital in the premises of this former sanatorium.</P>
    <P>Other very desirable projects in regard to the services for the treatment of mental illness made some progress during 1963 but it would be more appropriate to deal with these in connection with the Estimates for 1964/65.</P>
    <P>The Commission of inquiry on Mental Illness which I asked to examine our existing mental health services, are still pursuing their task with care and diligence.  At the beginning they were hampered by the inadequacy of the statistical information available.  However, a new system of returns which was introduced on 1st April last will facilitate their researches and will assist us in planning hospital accommodation and psychiatric services for the future.</P>
    <P>How true it is that mental illness is one of our most pressing health problems is borne out by the fact that we still have 19,250 of our people in mental hospitals.  Among European countries we have an unenviable record in this regard.  Why this should be so is not at all clear; but, whatever the reasons, the present position makes a considerable drain on our social and economic resources.  But, as I have just set out, every effort is being made, on the basis of our present knowledge, to remedy the position by continuing to improve and expand our treatment services.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that some <Col N="1298" /> years ago my officers made a preliminary special study of the problem of mental handicap on the basis of which I subsequently issued a White Paper entitled &ldquo;The Problem of the Mentally Handicapped&rdquo;.  That document indicated that among the major difficulties to be overcome&mdash;apart altogether from the provision of additional accommodation and the recruitment and training of staff-were the ascertainment of the number of mentally handicapped persons, the precise nature of the services and the accommodation required for them and the form of training best suited to our circumstances.  With our limited resources, it is of paramount importance to obtain sound and well-considered answers to these problems.</P>
    <P>With this in view, I set up a Commission of Inquiry to look into the whole position.  The personnel of the Commission is expert and representative, and its terms of reference are very wide.  It is, however, faced with a truly formidable task, for there has never before been a planned approach to the problem of mental handicap in this country.  The Commission has been meeting regularly and I am hoping it will be able to submit its report within the next year, perhaps even within this year.</P>
    <P>In the meantime we have been pressing forward with the provision of extra accommodation for mentally handicapped persons.  Thus the number of beds available, which on 1st April, 1962 was 2,703, had risen by 31st March, 1963 to 2,741.  In the nine months ending on 31st December last, it rose by a further 156 to 2,897.</P>
    <P>Included in the figure for the increase in the last nine months mentioned are 40 places provided by the authorities of Peamount Sanatorium for adult mentally handicapped persons who had received training in one or other of the institutions provided for the training of boys.  By accepting these patients, the Peamount authorities made possible the admission of 40 new children to intensive training institutions.  This development is a very desirable one indeed.  It will not detract in any way from the credit which is due to the organisations which have been longer in the field, <Col N="1299" /> if I publicly thank the Peamount authorities for their co-operation.</P>
    <P>Further additions to the accommodation available for mentally handicapped patients are in course of planning but, as in the case of development in the mental hospitals, I think it more appropriate to deal with them when presenting next year's Estimate.</P>
    <P>In recent years voluntary organisations in the cities and larger towns have established services in day-centres, schools and crèches for the mentally handicapped; and these are being availed of by a constantly increasing number of children.  Naturally, I have followed with great interest these developments in community care.  Apart from the immediate benefit accruing to the children attending them, the experience derived from them may be of assistance to the Commission of Inquiry in formulating its recommmendations. I am sure that every Deputy will join with me in expressing appreciation of the zeal and devotion of those who have been associated with them.</P>
    <P>The Dáil is aware of the good work of voluntary organisations in the development of vocational rehabilitation services.  Regulations which I made under section 50 of the Health Act, 1953, enable financial assistance to be given to these bodies.  Other regulations also made by me empower health authorities to pay allowances, where necessary, in respect of trainees to cover maintenance during training. Facilities for training and services for the placement of disabled persons in employment are available through the Rehabilitation Institution Ltd., and the other voluntary organisations working in this field; but existing facilities in vocational schools are also to be availed of in suitable cases.  It should be borne in mind that the regulations concerned with vocational training and placement in employment differ from those concerned with medical rehabilitation. Medical rehabilitation is a separate service and has been developed, under other provisions of the Health Acts, as a part of the hospital and specialist services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> In recent years great emphasis has been laid on the need for greater productivity and efficiency in industry.  It has not been so generally realised that it is equally desirable to secure the maximum of efficiency in the health services.  An unnecessary duplication in this field of accommodation, equipment, or personnel is an unjustifiable dissipation of resources.  If resources become superfluous to a particular service, or if a service may be made more economical by efficient reorganisation and pruning, the superfluities can be readily used in the improvement and expansion of services &mdash; and there are several&mdash;not yet at their optimum.  All those concerned with the services, whether individuals, health authorities or other bodies, must have constant regard to considerations of efficiency and economy.  My obligation as Minister for Health is to ensure that in the allocation of public funds for capital purposes new accommodation or equipment is not provided except where the need cannot be met by existing institutions or by special arrangements for co-operation and the sharing of resources between them.</P>
    <P>Considerations of economy and efficiency are particularly pertinent in the case of sanatoria which, because of the decline in tubercular disease, are under-utilised or are redundant.  Some health authorities are reluctant to permit such places to be put to proper use and will only do so under extreme pressure and after protracted argument. This frame of mind is most unfair, not only to ratepayers and taxpayers, but to those sufferers from conditions, often psychiatric, who are deprived of much needed accommodation by this dog-in-the-manger attitude.</P>
    <P>Sometimes even a similar disposition may be encountered in the authorities of a voluntary general hospital, who frown at any suggestion of sharing facilities or equipment with other hospitals and are almost obsessed with the aim of making their institutions entirely self-contained.  The end result is unnecessary duplication of equipment and wasteful deployment of personnel. When one has met this attitude, it is very gratifying to publicise a development in which economy and <Col N="1301" /> efficiency through co-ordination are being sought for.</P>
    <P>The provision of a reliable and efficient sterilising service for any hospital is a matter of prime importance, but with every hospital doing all its own sterilising work, it is a costly item.  For some time, my Department, though it was hesitant in raising the matter with the hospitals, had hoped for the development of a central service of this kind.  The idea became a practical proposition when a number of Dublin surgeons, who had seen the work of a Central Sterile Supply Service in Glasgow, suggested that a similar service might be set up here, an approach which was warmly welcomed. A meeting of representatives of all the Dublin hospitals, including the health authority hospitals, was arranged and it was agreed that the matter should be further examined by a working party, which was to consist of a number of persons selected at the meeting together with some members from the staff of my Department.  The working party, which met on many occasions, mostly at night, in the Custom House, has presented me with an excellent report confirming the feasibility and desirablility of setting up a central service.  Copies of the report have been circulated to all the hospitals concerned and a meeting of their representatives will be held next week at which they can state their views.  If the project is proceeded with, it should provide a service which from the outset will have a guarantee of absolute reliability and security and, in the long run, be more economical than the present fragmented service. Moreover, such a service could in due course be extended to all hospitals in the State.</P>
    <P>Over three years ago, I authorised resumption of planning on two major hospital building projects in Dublin, to wit, the new Coombe Hospital on which work commenced in August last and the new St. Vincent's Hospital at Elm Park on which work commenced recently.  When I was introducing the Estimate for 1962/63, I commented on the slow progress made in the re-planning of the St. Vincent's project; nothing which has occurred in the <Col N="1302" /> meantime has induced me to change my view in that regard.  However, it is a good thing we have been able to get to the stage that work has been actually resumed on the project.</P>
    <P>Excluding works on county homes, to which I shall refer later, the total value of the hospital building works, the planning of which I authorised, as circumstances following the financial crisis of 1956 permitted, amounts to approximately £10 millions, about £7½ millions of which will be met by grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund.  The estimated cost of works completed or in progress within the £10 millions programme is about £6 millions.  Apart from the two major Dublin projects I have mentioned, this figure covers a wide variety of works throughout the State.  Instances are the extension of Erinville Maternity Hospital, Cork, the installation of the cobalt unit at St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin, a new paediatric unit at the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, major schemes for accommodation of mentally handicapped children at Delvin, County Westmeath and at Cregg, Sligo, various works at Galway Regional Hospital, admission units at Cork and Castlebar Mental Hospitals and other works at the mental hospitals at Grangegorman, Letterkenny, Portlaoise, Enniscorthy, Killarney and Waterford.</P>
    <P>Tenders have been approved for a major extension at the National Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Dún Laoghaire, for a new maternity block at the County Hospital, Castlebar, and a new nurses' home at the County Hospital, Kilkenny.  Tenders in connection with a scheme of extension at St. Vincent's Home for mentally handicapped children at Lisnagry, County Limerick, have just been received and are at present under examination.  The actual construction work on all these schemes, the cost of which is estimated at almost £½ million, should, therefore, commence within the next month or so.</P>
    <P>Projects at the stage at which tenders have been invited but not yet received, or at which it should be possible to invite tenders inside the next six months are estimated to cost over £1.3 millions.  The largest single item in this is the major scheme of extension at Sligo County Hospital <Col N="1303" /> which for certain specialties will then become a sub-regional centre.  Other major items are an extension of the National Maternity Hospital at Holles Street, a new nurses' home at Portrane Mental Hospital, major works at the South Charitable Infirmary, Cork, and Jervis Street Hospital, Dublin, a new admission unit at Clonmel Mental Hospital, and a scheme of adaptations at St. Joseph's Home for Mentally Handicapped at Kilcornan, County Galway.  Of the grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund amounting to £7½ millions involved in this programme, over £5 millions or 66? per cent will be payable in respect of projects in voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>Much has been done, by raising the standards of nursing care, of dietary, of decoration, of furnishing, and of sanitary accommodation in county homes to improve the lot of patients. I cannot say the same in regard to the progress which has been made with the programme of radical improvements which was designed to bring accommodation up to what could be regarded as an acceptable standard. Originally it had been thought that little more than the reconstruction of the existing structures would be required.  On detailed examination of the existing buildings, it was found that many of them had inherent defects which either could not be eradicated at all or eradicated only at very great cost.  In such cases there was no reasonable alternative to new building. The progress of planning has had to be altered accordingly and this has made delays inevitable.  In many cases this re-planning is nearing completion or has been completed, wholly, as in the case of the Home at Mountmellick where construction work is in progress on a comprehensive scheme costing about £250,000; or in part, as in the case of the Home at Stranorlar where new, single-storey, accommodation for 98 chronic sick patients is in course of being built as part I of the major scheme.</P>
    <P>Experience has led me to accept with some reserve forecasts of the time needed before any project can be brought to tender stage; but I can see <Col N="1304" /> no reason at present why it should not be possible to invite tenders for the following works in the periods indicated:</P>
    <P>Before 31st March next: Castleblayney&mdash;Comprehensive scheme.</P>
    <P>In the April/June quarter: Clonakilty&mdash;Chronic sick (100 beds), central services, staff unit and full central heating.  Ennis&mdash;Chronic sick (200 beds), convent, and central heating.</P>
    <P>In the July/September quarter: Athy&mdash;Comprehensive scheme.  Longford&mdash;Chronic sick (94 beds), central services, central heating.  Trim&mdash;Completion of comprehensive scheme.</P>
    <P>In the October/December quarter: Castlebar&mdash;Chronic sick (230 beds), convent, staff home, central services and central heating.  Roscommon&mdash; Chronic sick (200 beds) and central heating.</P>
    <P>The cost of the county homes schemes is met, as most Deputies know, by borrowing from the Local Loans Fund and health authorities have recouped to them from the Vote, half the loan charges involved, subject to an overriding maximum cost per bed.  The aggregate cost of the schemes, which are already in progress or which should go to tender within the next year or so, is of the order of £3 million.  In addition to the schemes I have enumerated, planning is at various stages in relation to other schemes and I expect that after the end of the next year there will be a steady flow of further works going to tender, until all our county homes will have been brought up to an appropriate standard.</P>
    <P>I have dealt so far only with schemes that are included in the approved building programme, that is, schemes for which funds have been promised.  The problem, however, does not end there.  Further schemes, most of them highly desirable, have been put before me, on which the total outlay would be in the region of £15 million.  Moreover, we must budget in the long term for other inevitable expenditures as well.  Without anticipating in any way the recommendations of the Commissions on Mental Illness and on Mental Handicap, <Col N="1305" /> it is probable that they will suggest that greatly improved facilities are required in the fields which they are at present exploring.  Further, if the moneys were available, the position of the teaching hospitals and the accommodation problem in the case of nursing staffs would also merit very special attention.  Thus, to achieve a final solution of our hospital problems in the matter of physical accommodation will entail a staggering financial outlay, beyond our immediate resources.  Consequently, I have no option but to apportion the funds at my disposal in an ordered manner; and this compels me to issue certain warnings to the promoters of hospital projects.</P>
    <P>The first of these I have given frequently already.  It is that it is a waste of time and effort to try the technique of the <i>fait accompli</i>.  I will not in any circumstances pay any portion of the cost of any project undertaken without my prior approval.  To do so would be grossly unfair to hospital authorities&mdash;and there are many&mdash; which abide by the rules.</P>
    <P>The second is that once approval has been given for any project, the hospital authority concerned must ensure that the planning is carried out with dispatch.  In selecting its consultants, the hospital authority should ensure that they will be in a position to proceed expeditiously with the work.  Otherwise, I may not have any option but to relegate the project to the end of the queue or even to cancel a grant already authorised.</P>
    <P>The third warning is that hospital authorities must be practical and eschew any grandiose notions.  In the difficult financial situation obtaining we cannot hope to provide every amenity and every facility that would constitute the ideal hospital.  On the contrary, economy must be the keynote in our approach to hospital building; and, accordingly, we must content ourselves with modest and reasonable standards. The drop in income from the most recent Sweepstakes as compared with the previous year, when coupled with the heavy revenue deficits of the voluntary hospitals, is a forcible reminder that building on a pre-war scale is out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> With regard to the details of the Estimate for 1963-64, Deputies will observe that, including the two Supplementary Estimates, the first of which is now before the House, and the second of which will be taken immediately this token Estimate is disposed of, there is an increase of £1,133,660 over the Estimate for 1962-63.  This increase, to all intents and purposes, is attributable to Subhead G which, with the amount in the Second Supplementary, provides for a total of £11,330,000 in grants to local health authorities in aid of their expenditure on health services. The total revenue expenditure by health authorities in the current year, after allowances for receipts such as charges for services, is now estimated at over £22½ millions.</P>
    <P>Over the past year or so, representations have been made to me from a number of quarters regarding the proportion of the cost of the health services falling to be met from local rates.  As Deputies will be aware, the statutory provisions governing the apportionment of these costs between the Exchequer and the local rates are contained in the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947. This revolutionary piece of legislation was a milestone in the history of the health services; I say &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; because in fact it revolutionised the system whereby the health services had been financed up to that time. Prior to the 1947 Act, local finances had borne by far the greater part of the cost, being supplemented only by modest State grants&mdash;grants which, apart from their modest size, had the further disadvantage that they could not be disposed of as the local authorities themselves might think fit but had to be applied to limited specific health purposes.  In terms of money, the Exchequer grants represented at £900,000, a mere 16 per cent of the total cost of the services being provided. Thus the local authorities were paying 84 per cent of the cost of the health services before the present system of financing was introduced. By virtue of the 1947 Act which I have mentioned, this 84 per cent has been reduced to 50 per cent and, though it is the fact that, partly because of rising costs, including staff <Col N="1307" /> wages, and partly because of greatly expanded services, the actual costs have risen substantially since 1947, the fact remains that the Gross National Product has risen enormously and that proportionately, the allocation of costs has been adjusted heavily in favour of the local rates.</P>
    <P>In the year ended 31st March, 1957, the average rate for health services, including mental health, in county health districts was 12/4d.; this had increased to 15/11d. for the year ended 31st March, 1963.  The comparable figure for county boroughs shows an increase from 16/11d. to 19/9d.  Thus, in the six-year period since 1956-57, the health rate increased in the county council areas by 3/7d., on average, and in the county borough areas by somewhat less.  When due allowance is made for the increase in costs, particularly salaries and wages, and the striking improvements, over that period, in the facilities available for the treatment of the sick in our modern hospitals it can hardly be said that this increase is unduly large.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that interest in this matter of increases in the rates has concentrated largely on the health services, what must not be left out of account is the fact that the local rates in respect of other major services have increased in much the same proportion. A similar upward trend is, for instance, observable in the case of housing; in the year 1956-57 the housing rate in County Carlow was 1/4d. in the £; by 1962-63, it had increased to 5/5d.  In County Donegal, the housing rate was 3/- in the £ in 1956-57; by 1962-63, it had risen to 4/10d.  In Cork County Borough, the housing rate rose from 3/1d. in 1956-57 to 6/5d. in 1962-63; in Dublin County Borough, it rose from 4/3d. to 5/8d.; in Limerick from 5/11d. to 6/5d. and in Waterford from 2/3d. to 6/3d.  Under the heading of General Purposes, the same upward trend is visible; in Longford the rate under this heading for 1956-57 was 6/5d.; by 1962-63 it had increased to 9/7d.  The figures for General Purposes in Louth in the same years showed an increase from 4/5d. to 6/5d.; <Col N="1308" /> in Mayo, from 6/3d. to 8/8d.; in Tipperary (NR) from 7/4d. to 10/8d.; and in Wexford, from 5/7d. to 8/10d.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason for these increases has, of course, been that, in general, the tendency is to expand and improve services&mdash;a movement which, I am happy to report so far as the health services are concerned, the health authorities themselves wholeheartedly support.</P>
    <P>The hospital services are by far the largest element in the cost of the health services.  As will be seen from the details in Part III for Subhead G of the Vote in the Book of Estimates, it was originally estimated that they would cost £15,060,000 in the current year.  To this figure must be added a further expenditure by health authorities of £790,000 in respect of which an additional Health Services Grant is provided for in the second Supplementary Estimate, to be taken in conjunction with this Estimate.  The total anticipated expenditure by health authorities on hospital services in the current year is, therefore, the formidable sum of £15,850,000.</P>
    <P>This, however, does not represent the total cost to public funds, even ignoring capital expenditure, of the hospital services.  To that figure must be added the amount which it will be necessary to add from the Hospitals Trust Fund to make up the revenue deficits of the voluntary hospitals.  It is estimated that that figure in respect of 1963 will be £2,200,000.</P>
    <P>It was never contemplated that sums of such magnitude would be diverted from the Hospitals Trust Fund for the purposes of keeping the revenue accounts of the voluntary hospitals in balance.  The progression in the size of the deficits, year by year from 1956 onwards, is interesting.  The figure for 1956 was £920,000&mdash;I quote the figures to the nearest £10,000&mdash;in 1957, it was £960,000; in 1958, it was £1,100,000; in 1959, £1,190,000; in 1960, £1,440,000; in 1961, £2,040,000; in 1962, £2,160,000; and in 1963, it is estimated as I have said, at £2,200,000. The cost of maintaining patients in the voluntary hospitals, as in the case of the local authorities' own hospitals, has been increasing steadily, in part due <Col N="1309" /> to increased staff costs and in part to advances in medical science which now make it possible to treat and to cure patients for whom previously little could have been done.  The revenues of the voluntary hospitals, however, have not been keeping pace with the expenditures, largely because health authorities, who are liable for the cost of treatment of the vast majority of the patients, pay for them at rates which are completely unreal, and in most cases far below what it would cost them to maintain the patients in their own hospitals, even if they had the facilities to do so.</P>
    <P>While the deficits were increasing at this spectacular rate, the capitation rate, excluding the supplement payable in respect of services of visiting medical staff, paid by health authorities to all the major hospitals in respect of in-patient services rendered by these hospitals, remained at 18/- a day from 1956 until April, 1962, when the rate was increased by 6/- for the teaching hospitals and 3/6d. for the non-teaching major hospitals. These increases were barely sufficient to cover the eighth round of increases in salary granted by the hospitals to their staffs, in line with the increases granted by local authorities to their local staffs, and a further increase in the capitation rates was long overdue when they were again increased, with effect from 1st October last.  These last mentioned increases account for £170,000 of the increase in the Health Services Grant being provided for in the second Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the capitation rates are being further increased with effect from 1st April next but as no provision for any expenditure arising out of that increase is included in the Estimate now before the House, I presume I would be precluded from dealing with that matter until next year's Estimates are under discussion. It is not only for the increased cost to health authorities of services given on their behalf in voluntary hospitals, however, that provision has to be made in the second Supplementary Estimate.  According to the most recent information supplied by the health authorities, the cost of services in their <Col N="1310" /> own hospitals in 1963/64 will be greater by £430,000 than had been originally estimated.  The largest single item in that figure is £170,000 for salaries and wages.  Drugs and medicines account for a further £50,000 approximately.  The balance is spread over miscellaneous heads.</P>
    <P>When one comes to consider the hospital service strictly in the financial context, one must accept that while this is &ldquo;big business&rdquo;, one cannot apply to it the yardsticks which are appropriate to industry and commerce. The businessman can readily assess the degree of success achieved in his year's work by reference to the financial return which it has yielded.  For hospital management there are no such clear guide-lines, and the spur to greater efficiency is, in most cases, the rather crude and negative one of financial stringency.  Yet in spite of the difference in objectives between business concerns and hospitals, they share a need for good and effective administration. Some branches of hospital activity such as catering and laundry work would, of course, pose problems similar in many respects to those met with in commercial undertakings operating in these fields.  Not only in regard to services like laundry and catering, but in all branches of the hospital organisation, there can be no argument about the value of a frank look at each job that is being done to establish the need for it, or of engaging in a painstaking search for the best and most economical way of doing whatever it is clearly necessary to do.</P>
    <P>Since the war there has been growing recognition in business and industrial management of the need for constant analysis and improvement of working methods.  The application of work study methods in the hospital setting has lagged behind but in the past few years both in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland these procedures have been successfully applied in hospitals and many improvements in methods have been secured.  Through the initiative of the Institute of Public Administration an opportunity has been offered to a number of those concerned with hospital management in this country to learn from those engaged in hospital work study elsewhere <Col N="1311" /> something of the methods employed and the improvements to be secured through the application of these methods.  I am satisfied that in the long term the consistent application of modern management techniques coupled with the dedicated work of the medical and nursing staffs will ensure that our hospital services will provide the highest standards of treatment and care for the patients under conditions of maximum efficiency and convenience of operation.</P>
    <P>The expansion and improvement of the health services in recent years is reflected in the increase in the number of medical and other personnel employed. For example, the overall number of wholetime medical staff employed by health authorities has increased by more than 30 per cent since 1958, the greatest proportionate increase occurring in the mental health service.  With increased staffing requirements, it is essential that an adequate supply of suitably qualified candidates will be available for local authority posts.  Difficulty is experienced from time to time in the recruitment of doctors in the house officer grade in our local hospitals.  This may be due partly to a bias which, inexplicably, appears to exist among medical graduates against accepting employment in these hospitals and partly to the inducement offered to our young doctors to accept lucrative posts abroad.  With our limited resources, we cannot compete on equal terms with wealthier countries in the matter of remuneration and conditions of employment.  But to those who wish to live and work in their own country, however, we can say that there are openings in our expanding services which offer reasonable standards of remuneration and working conditions.</P>
    <P>In the last two years, with a view to showing young people studying for the medical profession the scope and standard of the work being carried on in local hospitals, a scheme was introduced under which medical students in their fourth and final years were offered employment in the local authority hospitals during the <Col N="1312" /> college vacation periods.  Forty-six students in 1962 and 84 students in 1963, mostly in their final year, were engaged and the reports on the results of the scheme were so encouraging that it is being repeated this year.  I would stress that the aim is not to replace or dilute the resident medical staff, but rather, as I mentioned, to provide students with an opportunity of acquiring at first-hand, knowledge of conditions so that they will be encouraged to take up posts in local authority hospitals after graduation.</P>
    <P>Because of the limited amount of funds available for dental services and the insufficient number of dental surgeons available to health authorities, it has not been possible, much to my regret, to provide a comprehensive dental service for eligible persons under the Health Acts.  The position in regard to recruitment has, I am glad to say, improved somewhat.  As an essential step in the further development of the service I have approved of the appointment of chief dental officers in Dublin and Cork, and senior officers in Limerick, Kerry, Donegal, Mayo, Waterford and Galway, and hope to persuade the remaining health authorities to make similar appointments, where appropriate.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Estimate for 1962/63, I mentioned that the National Organisation for Rehabilitation had agreed to operate a national hearing-aid service for persons eligible for aural services under the Health Acts.  The service is now obtainable at the organisation's premises in Ballsbridge, Dublin, but I regret to say, despite urgings by my Department, health authorities have been rather slow to avail themselves of it.  It is to be hoped that in the coming year there will be a considerable improvement under this head.  In association with the hearing-aid service, the organisation will provide an educational advisory service for the benefit of children and this will be backed by the arrangements now made by health authorities for ascertaining, early in life, what children have defective hearing.</P>
    <P>I wish that I was able to do much more to ameliorate the condition of those, particularly children, whose <Col N="1313" /> hearing is defective.  But two things are needed for the expansion of the service: money and trained personnel. So far as the latter essential is concerned, we have had to start from almost absolute zero; and it has been slow, sometimes almost frustrating, and expensive to acquire a sufficiency for the launching of the present service. And as for money!  Well, the attitude of the main Opposition, not only toward the last Budget, but even toward the recent Vote on Account, indicates that they will do their utmost to persuade the taxpayer not to provide it; and this is tantamount to denying to those who suffer from deafness, the benefits which we could otherwise make available to them.</P>

      <P>As the question of disabled persons' allowances was the subject of a recent debate, I presume no Deputy wishes me to take up the time of the House by going over the ground again, or by discussing the cognate matter of infectious diseases allowances.  I should, therefore, go on to conclude as quickly as may be, were it not that there are still a few matters, including new developments, which call for comment from me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first is the £4,000 to be provided under Subhead F for the expenses of a Committee on Dental Caries and Fluorides.  My intention was that in co-operation with the authorities of University College, Cork, this Committee, during the next few years, would carry out a special scientific survey to measure the effect on the incidence of dental caries of (a) the use of fluoridated water, (b) topical application of fluoride and (c) a combination of fluoridated water and topical applications of fluorides.  As the work of the Committee is closely related to the question of the fluoridation of <Col N="1314" /> public water supplies, which is at present under consideration in another place, it would, perhaps, be inappropriate that I should enlarge on the matter at this stage except to say that the Committee has not yet been able to commence the Survey.</P>
    <P>The field work associated with the nation-wide survey which the Medical Research Council has undertaken to ascertain the incidence of dental caries in school children has been completed, and three reports covering the Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow area, the Cork, Limerick and Waterford area and the Counties of Louth, Wexford, Laois and Galway have been presented to the Oireachtas.  Reports on the remaining areas are at various stages leading to publication and will be published as soon as possible.  The results are consistent with those recorded in the reports already published and confirm that dental decay is widespread among the school children of the nation.</P>
    <P>While I am on this subject, I would bring to the special notice of the House a use which was made, and one which I did not contemplate when that Act was being enacted, of the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, during the year.</P>
    <P>The Act in question authorises the Minister for Health to establish a body &ldquo;to perform functions in, or in relation to, the provision of a health service or two or more health services&rdquo;. Arising out of the Report of the Visitors appointed by the British General Dental Council on the inspection made by them of teaching facilities and arrangements at the Incorporated Dental Hospital of Ireland, in other words, the Dublin Dental Hospital, it was necessary to make arrangements to alter the constitution of the governing body of the institution.  This reorganisation was primarily one for the Minister for Education.  After consultations with the three teaching bodies concerned, that is to say: University College, Dublin, Trinity College, Dublin, and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, as well as with the authorities of the Hospital, an agreed scheme was settled.  To give effect to this scheme, it would have been necessary in the normal course <Col N="1315" /> either to amend the memorandum and articles of association of the Incorporated Dental Hospital, or to deal with the matter by legislation.  In either case much time would have been required.  It was necessary, however, to bring about the change without delay, and as the hospital, in addition to its teaching functions, provides a health service, I agreed to the use of the machinery of the 1961 Act.</P>
    <P>The Incorporated Dental Hospital passed the necessary resolution for the purposes of the Act on 16th July last and on the following day I made an Order under the Act entitled the Dublin Dental Hospital (Establishment) Order, 1963, and appointed a new Board for the Hospital.  The Board, as provided for in the Order, includes two nominees of University College, Dublin, and one nominee each of Trinity College and the Royal College of Surgeons.  The other appointments to the Board were made in consultation with the Minister for Education.  The temporary nature of the arrangement is emphasised by the fact that the Order provides that the members of the Board will hold office only until 31st December, 1964.  By that date, a decision will have been taken whether the hospital should continue to operate under an Establishment Order or whether special legislation should be introduced.</P>
    <P>I may say that, according to my information, the new body is functioning smoothly.  Considerable improvements in physical facilities for teaching, and incidentally for treatment of patients, pending the building of a new Dental Hospital, planning of which is proceeding, have been effected and the Board has, after advertisement, selected personnel for appointment to a number of senior teaching posts.  The persons appointed will, in accordance with the arrangements made by the Minister for Education, hold appointments as well on the staff of the three licensing bodies mentioned.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should refer is the training scheme for health inspectors.  The House may perhaps recall that in 1962 I mentioned that the question of essential training for health inspectors was under consideration. Subsequently, in October of that <Col N="1316" /> year I set up a special Board, composed of representatives of the Departments of Health, Agriculture, Education and Local Government, of local authorities and the Dublin Vocational Education Committee, to organise suitable courses of training.</P>
    <P>The course, which is full-time, will extend over a period of four years and will combine theoretical instruction with practical training in the field.  In the co-ordination of theoretical instruction and practical training, the Board have the services of a trained Health Inspector Tutor from the local authority service.  Formal instruction is being provided under arrangements with the Dublin Vocational Education Committee; and the students, who are assigned as trainees to the Dublin Health Authority, receive practical training there and with other local authorities as well.  On completion of the course to the satisfaction of the Board and having passed the necessary examinations, students will be awarded a diploma which will be a recognised qualification for the purposes of appointment as health inspector.</P>
    <P>Allowances of £150 per annum, increasing by annual increments of £25 to a maximum of £225, are paid to the student trainees.  In addition, provincial participants receive an allowance towards subsistence at the rate of £2 a week.</P>
    <P>The first course of training organised by the Board commenced in January, 1963.  Ten students selected by the Board after advertisement are participating. A second course, for another ten students similarly selected, commenced during the year.</P>
    <P>When dealing earlier with the maternal and infant care services I referred briefly to the &ldquo;thalidomide&rdquo; problem.  Partly as a result of this problem, and partly as a result of the proliferation and increased use of drugs by the general public, concern at the dangers inherent in the free availability of medicinal substances containing poisons has been increasing, here and elsewhere, over the past few years.  On the other hand, the right of responsible individuals to have reasonable, and, all things considered, inexpensive access to safe specifies and well-tried remedies cannot be disregarded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> To assist me in deciding what restrictive measures were necessary in the public interest, I have asked the advice of Comhairle na Nimheanna, the expert advisory body established under the Poisons Act, 1961.  The Council's first task was to review the existing legislative controls over poisons, some of which go back to close on a century ago.  The Dáil will appreciate that so comprehensive a review cannot be completed in a short time.  I believe, however, that when it is completed, we shall have a basis of a poisons law which will be flexible and adaptable to the requirements of to-day.  Meanwhile, however, after consultation with Comhairle na Nimheanna I made the Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1963, and thereby brought a number of potentially harmful substances in rather more widespread use amongst the general public under control.</P>

I think I have covered all the ground to which these Estimates relate and I hope the House will see its way to pass them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain matters in the long statement the Minister has made on the administration of his Department to which I propose to refer.  We approve and applaud the programme of research into certain aspects of the cancer problem which he informed us has been embarked upon at St. Luke's Hospital.  We believe there is scope for research in this country along those lines, perhaps not on the vast scale that such research has been undertaken in the United States and Great Britain but there are aspects of the <Col N="1318" /> problem to which no doubt we can make some contribution.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the carcinogenic effect which it is alleged cigarette smoking has.  This aspect of the problem has received so much publicity I often think there is a grave danger of overlooking another aspect of the problem of lung cancer which may have equal importance, that is, air pollution.  It does seem to be pretty clear that diesel fumes can create a predisposition to cancer of the lung and I have seen it suggested from a Scandinavian source that it is not impossible that a predisposing cause may be pollution of the air and the precipitating cause excessive cigarette smoking superimposed on the predisposition created by the presence of polluted air.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, necessary to maintain strict vigilance in regard to cigarette smoking but it would be a pity if our attention became exclusively riveted on that possible cause of lung cancer to the exclusion of prudent inquiry into how far air pollution contributes and, if it is established that air pollution makes a contribution, an inquiry into how far we can correct by suitable controls the pollutions which are at present taking place.</P>
    <P>It has to be borne in mind that in the memory of most of us here there was very widespread industrial pollution of the air which precipitated lethal fogs in certain industrial centres.  That became so acute and so manifest a problem as a result of the bronchial symptoms it precipitated that in Great Britain and the United States of America very drastic measures have been taken to restrict the burning of soft coal in certain urban areas.  There are now large areas in both Great Britain and the United States where the burning of soft coal is not allowed at all.  Forty years ago, it would have seemed unthinkable that such regulations could ever have been successfully recommended to the public, but the manifest association between that kind of air pollution and acute bronchial symptoms makes this restriction necessary. The direct connection between diesel fuel oil air pollution and lung cancer may not be as manifest and <Col N="1319" /> obvious but if it is a true source of this terrible affliction, it is very necessary that it should be identified so that we can start the necessary publicity to prepare the public for such measures as might become necessary in order to avoid the continuance of that kind of air pollution.</P>
    <P>I learn with great satisfaction of the striking reduction in the total number of deaths from all forms of tuberculosis.  That is one of those problems in connection with which great risks were taken, great financial commitments entered into.  Great doubts were expressed from the threshold of that campaign as to whether our radical approach to it was not too extragavant and too reckless.  It is a matter of great rejoicing that the resolve to use the sources available to us to the limit of our ability in 1948 and in ensuing years has yielded so abundant a harvest of people saved from death.  It is something of which we have every reason to be proud that we faced that problem when we did and were not afraid to undertake the expenditure necessary and the legislation necessary to produce the eminently satisfactory results on which we can now congratulate ourselves.</P>
    <P>I want emphatically to endorse the appeal made by the Minister today that we should not become indifferent to the remaining problem of tuberculosis. It could be substantially abolished if people would avail of the national mass radiography service.  It would be a tragedy if we allowed a chronic source of infection to remain that could be eradicated if we could persuade the public to collaborate in the measures necessary to control it, and probably one of the most effective of all measures is availing of the National Mass Radiography Association services.</P>
    <P>I think it is important in that connection and I would ask the Minister to remember our history in this respect. I understand that one of the strange manifestations of the present tuberculosis situation is that a good deal of the infection survives in middle-aged people and that when we began this <Col N="1320" /> campaign for the eradication of tuberculosis, we were dealing with the disease of the young.  We are now dealing in a large degree with the disease of the middle-aged.</P>
    <P>Two factors require to be borne in mind in connection with this matter. One is that in the minds of our people tuberculosis is not associated with middle-age.  Most of our people feel that if you have not had tuberculosis in the first three decades of your life, you will never have it.  Therefore, it does not occur to the people in later middle-age, in the fifties and sixties, that they can acquire the disease and can be sources of infection.  I think that fact has to be emphasised so that the public mind may fully awaken to that danger.  What is far more important is that when the middle-aged of today were young, tuberculosis was still a secret thing.  I can well remember when I was young, in any part of rural Ireland, if a young person was found to be suffering from tuberculosis, that person's family stoutly denied the fact and maintained a fiction for protracted periods to the great detriment of the whole family that the child had not tuberculosis at all but was merely delicate.</P>
    <P>The reason for that was that they associated tuberculosis in those days with a fatal illness and we had good reason to know that in all too many cases it was a fatal illness.  Even where it was not a fatal illness, it was associated in the minds of the people with the idea that if they went away to a sanatorium, they were away for years.  The fact now is that with modern drugs and efficient sanatorium treatment, people have been restored to normal activities in an astonishingly short time.  I have known of cases of people in middle-age who were unexpectedly discovered suffering from tuberculosis, who went into a sanatorium and in six or nine months were restored to active life completely cured.</P>
    <P>It would be of great assistance in helping to clear up this problem of middle-age tuberculosis if we could publicise and emphasise the fact that this is no longer necessarily a disease requiring indefinite hospitalisation but <Col N="1321" /> that it can reasonably be expected to yield to treatment in a relatively short time with the restoration of the tubercular patient to a normal life. I emphasise that fact because it is so easy for us to forget the atmosphere that surrounded tuberculosis 30 or 40 years ago and that atmosphere is still enshrined in the mind of the middle-aged patient today.</P>
    <P>I am shocked, as I have no doubt the Minister is shocked, by the maternal and infant mortality rates.  I cannot understand why the maternal death rate here should be more than that in Great Britain, Scotland or Northern Ireland.  So far as I know the services here are just as good.  The Minister has simply said that this is a fact but he has not given an indication of why it is a fact.  I am even more astonished at the infant mortality rate here and I am quite at a loss to know the reason for it.  What is the situation pertaining in this country which justifies so wide a gap between the infant mortality rates obtaining here and those in Great Britain?  Here it is 29 per 1,000 as compared with 30 per 1,000 in 1961.  The corresponding rate in England and Wales is 22 and for Scotland and Northern Ireland it is 27.  Has anybody discovered what is the reason for the vast discrepancy between England, on the one hand, and Scotland and Northern Ireland, on the other?</P>

      <P>I should be glad to hear from the Minister, in the course of his concluding statement, such information as is available to him for this strange disparity.  There are large areas of sparsely populated districts as well as industrial areas in England and Wales, while in Scotland there are also largely populated industrial districts as well as sparsely populated districts. You also have much the same housing conditions in both England and Scotland and yet you have this remarkable disparity.  As the Minister says, it is largely due to scarcity of maternity services in rural areas.</P>

      <P>It is in some degree reassuring to know that the infant mortality rate is on the downward trend.  It is some encouragement to find it at 29 as compared with 30 in 1961 but it is a mystification to me why there should be this wide disparity between the averages in England and Wales and the figures here because I do not know of any inferiority in the maternal care provided here as compared with that provided in Wales and rural England.  However, I suppose the Minister will give us the best information he can when replying.  I am glad to know it is still engaging the Minister's attention, as it certainly engages ours.</P>
      <P>Is there any explanation of the continuing high incidence of gastro-enteritis? We had an alarmingly high figure some years ago and then the figure went down to something approaching normality but it now seems to be going up again.</P>

      <P>We shall all be glad to know the result of the research council's investigations.  Certainly no one will in this House allege that any Party is indifferent to the incidence of gastro-enteritis.  It is our common interest to control it, and it is discomforting to us, especially when we cannot put a finger on its cause, that there should be an increase at a time when we would expect a steady decline.  The Minister spoke of the thalidomide problem in association with births. Have there been a large number of abnormalities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of those disasters that overtake us from time to time, and we can only hope that anything we can do to alleviate the circumstances of the children concerned will be done, and I am sure it will.  I am sure all sides of the House will agree on that.</P>
      <P>There is an important matter in regard to poliomyelitis.  The Minister has announced that, having consulted his advisers, he has now come to the conclusion that oral vaccine for poliomyelitis is safe and effective.  There is one aspect of this matter on which he did not touch, and on which it would be wise for him to touch.  Many of us have had our children vaccinated with the Salk vaccine, and the question arises: does the oral vaccine now serve effectively as a booster to the Salk vaccine as originally administered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it does.  I shall not commit myself until I have verified my impression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who have had their children originally vaccinated <Col N="1325" /> with Salk might be reluctant to use the oral vaccine unless the matter is clarified.</P>
      <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer in connection with the Minister's reference to occupational training, and his reference to provision being made for mentally handicapped children.  In these two contexts the Minister has spoken of occupational therapy and the other devices which are being employed to help mentally afflicted children.  I wonder has his attention been directed to the special problem of the autistic children.  I am told that in dealing with mentally retarded children, you can segregate a type of mental affliction to which the title autism has been given, of which we might expect to find in our society, according to statistical calculations, perhaps 500 or 600.  I understand experience teaches that there would be about three boys for each girl.</P>
      <P>I am informed that if we could identify those children at an early stage, much could be done to prevent them becoming hopeless, chronic mental cases in their maturity.  It is one of those peculiarly tragic forms of mental affliction on children who have an external appearance of normality and, indeed, exceptional physical beauty up to their second or third year.  There then ensues a period of great doubt and difficulty in which it is extremely hard to determine with precision what is going wrong until ultimately it is established that the children are abnormal, and fall into the class of autism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If those children, for a variety of reasons into which it is not necessary to go in detail now, are not removed to an institution where, in the majority of cases they can best be catered for, there is grave danger that unless their special circumstances are catered for, they will deteriorate in maturity to the condition of chronic schizophrenics for whom virtually nothing can be done. If in their childhood they can be given special tuition and training, and if in their adolescence, which is a critical stage, they can be given guided occupational therapy, they can be effectively rescued from the tragic fate of chronic and incurable schizophrenia, and while probably never becoming <Col N="1326" /> capable of restoration to normal society and uncontrolled activity, they will be capable of useful activity and a relatively normal life in a suitable home under trained direction.</P>
    <P>I recognise that much as one's heart is moved by the tragic circumstances of mental affliction in children, one must temper sympathy with reasonable prudence.  I am greatly strengthened in my recommendation to the Minister of special attention for this problem by the knowledge that I am not asking him to undertake some new and heavy financial commitments, because if those children are not looked after in the way I suggest, they will end up as life-long inmates of mental institutions, and in the category most difficult to provide for, requiring constant day and night attention, as chronic schizophrenics only too frequently do.  All I am suggesting to the Minister is that we should have one or two institutions, possibly one in Cork and one in Dublin, for boys and girls, which would, in fact, cater for those patients who otherwise must be catered for in the general mental hospitals, where it is very much more difficult to give them the special kind of attention which could rescue them from the fate of chronic and deteriorating mental affliction.</P>
    <P>If the Minister indicates to me that his attention has already been directed to this problem I hope he will be able to tell us, when concluding, that this special problem does permit of his sympathetic and optimistic consideration, with a view to providing for this limited number of children treatment that would save them from ultimate schizophrenia and chronic mental affliction.</P>
    <P>I note with interest that the Dublin Health Authority has made available to the County Wicklow Health Authority the sanatorium premises at Newcastle as a mental hospital for County Wicklow.  I want to remind the Minister of the time when he used to jeer at us because we were building so many sanatoria.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to remind the Minister of those things.  We took a great risk and spent vast sums of money on building so many sanatoria that we can now boast that some are standing idle for the reason that there are no patients to go into them.  That I regard as the apotheosis of all our hopes and work and from it two facts emerge.  One is that tuberculosis has been reduced to a very minor problem today and we are now engaged in trying to track down and eliminate the last remnants of it.  The second fact is that we were right in believing that when these sanatoria had served their purpose of destroying the hydraheaded monster of tuberculosis, they could be used as mental hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely you are not claiming that you built the Newcastle Sanatorium?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I am claiming that the sanatoria we built can be used to advantage when they have served their purpose of eradicating that dreadful scourge which used to be the nightmare of us all.  I rejoice that the hospital at Newcastle has been converted to a mental hospital.  I applaud it and I think it is an admirable thing to do.  I hope it may be possible that as other institutions of this kind become redundant, we may be able to divert them to such specialised uses under the general mental treatment programme as I have been advocating.  I can assure the Minister that in any difficulties he may have with certain local authorities regarding the conversion of these institutions, he will get all the support we can give him because of our purpose that when these sanatoria had completed their work, they should be converted to other uses in the general pattern of the health services.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would indicate to us, when concluding the debate, whether he considers that sanatoria in any other areas will become available for the accommodation of mental patients both for the purpose of segregation to which I have referred and for the relief of the great pressure that exists at present in many of the existing institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> I heard with great interest the Minister's announcement of the establishment of a specialised sterilisation service in Dublin.  This is a highly technical matter and it is not one on which I wish to express an opinion.  It is almost incomprehensible to a layman who has always regarded sterilisation as a definite matter for those in the operating theatre alone.  I hope the Minister will give us some further information when he is replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be glad to deal with that matter.  The really gratifying aspect of the matter is that it was organised by the Dublin surgeons themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also a matter for the layman for it is the layman who is going to be operated on and he will always want to be reassured.  They will want to have it explained to them how it is that a central sterilisation unit can service a number of hospitals. In the last paragraph on page 20, the Minister says that such a service could be extended to all the hospitals in the State.  I find it very hard to understand how that can be done.  I hope the Minister can reassure the public generally as to how asepsis can be maintained and as to how supplies can be carried to hospitals remote from the sterilisation centre.</P>
      <P>I am going to pass over the Minister's remark regarding the attitude of this Party to the expenditure of money. It reminds me of the attitude of the Taoiseach in Cork claiming that the policy of Fine Gael was a restrictive one which advocated reductions in expenditure at the cost of progress.  At the same time, his son-in-law, the Minister for Justice, was in Kildare claiming that the programme of Fine Gael would involve the State in such expenditure that it would cripple it forever because of the multiplicity of benefits it contained.  I think this little hoot from the Tánaiste belongs in the same category of unrewarding comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter in the Minister's statement which causes me great concern, that is, the programme for the reconstruction of all the county homes in the country.  I want to renew for <Col N="1329" /> consideration by the House a sentiment I have expressed on more than one occasion and I want to renew it with special urgency in the light of this programme which it is suggested will cost many million pounds and which is designed to perpetuate the county home in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have lived all my life in rural Ireland and I know that one of the perennial horrors that affect life in rural Ireland is the discovery that some old friend and neighbour is no longer able to look after himself or herself in his or her old home.  I want to engage the Minister's special attention on this matter.  All of us in rural Ireland are familiar with the picture of the old people, men and women, commonly living, man and wife, together. The man has worked all his life and now they both have got the pension.  Then the old woman dies. He is alone in the house and the neighbours visit him.  Gradually, the normal picture is that the house gets dirty and people concerned more with efficiency than humanity say: &ldquo;Old Charley ought to be got out of that house; he is not able to look after himself&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Those who understand the position better get the nuns to come in occasionally to clean up the house, or a neighbouring woman comes in.  Then, the next day the neighbours, bringing him a bowl of soup, find that he has fallen in the fire.  He is burned.  An attempt is made to provide precautions, but then some other accident happens and the neighbours say: &ldquo;We cannot go on like this; some morning we will wake up to find poor old Charley has fallen in the fire and that he is dead&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Then comes the tragic dénouement: old Charley has gone to the county home.  We can all find an old neighbour like Charley, living in abject misery, cold, hungry, and we say to him: &ldquo;Is it not time you went to the county home?&rdquo;  You will find he is prepared to go to any resort to avoid it.  It is a very common illusion that it is because he does not want to leave the particular hovel into which his helplessness and poverty have reduced him.  I believe that is not the fundamental <Col N="1330" /> cause.  It is the hideous prospect of isolation.</P>
    <P>I know this because all of us in public life from time to time visit such institutions.  I have gone into county homes and been called by somebody in bed who, quite frankly, I thought was dead for years.  He had disappeared from the neighbourhood, had gone through all this agony and had been forgotten and then you discover him suddenly, utterly alone.  He is clean; he is warm; he is fed. Physically he is in much better condition than when you last saw him, but mentally, and in all the ways that matter most, he is destitute, because the last time you saw him he was longing to live and now is he longing to die but cannot die.</P>
    <P>He is longing to die because he feels utterly isolated, utterly useless and rightly feels he is utterly forgotten.  All this could be resolved if we could provide what already exists in many country towns in Ireland, parochial homes.  They are all over the country.  The interesting thing is that they were established by old charities in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and they still survive.  Compare the state of an old person living in those charities&mdash;close to his home, where neighbours constantly visit frequently, where he is able to potter out himself on a market day or go round the town to buy a spool of thread and live in the normal life of the society into which he was born and reared&mdash;with the same person's experience in a county home.</P>
    <P>I do not want for a moment to denigrate or make little of the valiant service that is given by those who run our county homes.  I always remember with veneration and gratitude the lady who was the matron of the county home in Roscommon for many years. I remember going into one of the wards with her on one occasion which was filled with old people, difficult, complaining and, as they often are, unappreciative of her efforts.  I said to her: &ldquo;Mother Paul, I often wonder how it is you spend your life at this&rdquo;, and she said: &ldquo;If I did not see the face of God in each of them, I could <Col N="1331" /> not&rdquo;.  But she did, and devoted her whole life to it most sublimely.  She was wrestling with a problem she could not resolve.  She could feed them, clean them, bear with their crankiness, but the one thing she could not give them was the feeling of being near their neighbours, of being remembered, of being part of the society to which they normally belong.</P>
    <P>Am I peculiar in this?  I think I am right.  What puzzles me is why we set out again on the perpetuation of the poorhouses, which were wholly alien to our outlook, the relic of a deplorable and fatuous attempt to solve the Famine and a wholly mistaken idea of how the Famine problems should be dealt with.  Why is it?  Is it that it is more economical to do it in this way?  I do not think it is.  I believe if you had a parochial home, run on the same lines as the old charities were run, you would get the desirable situation that some of the inmates would help the others.</P>
    <P>If you had a lady superintendent, you would virtually not want any staff at all.  Perhaps you could have the dispensary nurse to help the lady superintendent in such institutions and they, with the assistance of the ambulant inmates, would carry on very well.  I believe such a system would work extremely well.  Everybody would be happy and this perennial horror of moving old people to the county home would be resolved.  The Minister himself must have some knowledge of this detestable situation.</P>
    <P>You will find a young fellow getting married in the family home and his young wife understandably failing to get on with the boy's mother, or very often with the boy's father.  Then there is the horrible story that they have shifted the old mother to the county home.  Mind you, that is a relatively rare situation, but it does happen. There are many homes made extremely difficult by the fact that there is an old woman or an old man in the house with whom the young woman cannot get on, and the family are disrupted and there is a great deal of domestic woe because the old person in the <Col N="1332" /> house will not go because he knows if he goes to the county home what he is going to.</P>
    <P>Instead of that prospect opening before him, he could have this prospect of going into a parochial home such as the charities to which I referred can provide.  If there were institutions of this kind associated with the parish, and perhaps annexed to them three or four flats, you would frequently find that elderly parents would gladly go to them and make some weekly contribution out of their pensions or savings in order to facilitate domestic peace in the old home when the new wife comes in.</P>
    <P>Is it too late to examine this whole problem and see how far we could substitute, if possible, parochial homes for county homes or, if that be impossible on the grounds that certain of the inmates of the county homes are, in fact, really people who require hospital treatment, could we not reduce substantially the number of people who have to live well-fed, well-looked after but in the circumstances which make them long for death because they are lonely?  I am satisfied this is a very great social problem.  I am certain, unhappily, that those most afflicted by it are not in a position to make their voices heard.  I am certain there is not a county home in Ireland where perennial tragedy is not being endured and I am certain we could do something about it and it would not involve intolerable expense.  I should be glad to hear the Minister's reaction to these representations because I have the uncomfortable feeling that, if we commit ourselves to the expenditure of millions on the reconstruction of county homes, we will never be able to face all the social implications of that decision.  We are going on shipping the old and poor into unwanted years of survival&mdash;unwanted by themselves, because such survival is only an ordeal of loneliness where it could be a really happy decline in intimate association with their neighbours and friends and the atmosphere which, taken together, represents home for them.</P>
    <P>I feel very deeply about this, because I speak from a great deal of personal <Col N="1333" /> experience in regard to it.  If there is one duty which I find peculiarly distressing, it is to visit the county home, because I have the feeling that here is something about which I can do very little.  Possibly to see a familiar face does them good, but you sometimes feel when you call on them that it only makes them lonelier than they were. It revives their nostalgia for home and home sickness, and those of us who have been home sick as children know the insufferable agony of that sentiment. I can never go to visit friends in the county home that I do not wonder if I would be better to stay away.  Yet one goes back because one cannot bear to forget them altogether.  The shock which I have had more than once is to be saluted by somebody whom, in fact, I believed to be dead.</P>
    <P>I feel sure these problems are pressing to the minds of other Deputies who live in rural Ireland.  I do not know what the corresponding situation is in the city of Dublin, but I feel that here in Dublin, even if people have to go into institutions, they are near their own.  They are still in Dublin; they hear the Dublin accent around them; the whole life of the city goes on around them, and their neighbours can visit them.  Their problem is not as acute.  But take somebody who lives in Emyvale who goes to Castleblayney, or somebody who lives in Kilmovee and goes to Roscommon or Castlebar. I do not think I need further paint that picture.  It is a living death.</P>
    <P>The old, the poor and the unwanted &mdash;these are the people for whom we should be solicitous.  I am sure every Deputy would feel the same anxiety for them as I feel.  What puzzles me is the paralysis of the will to go out and do something about this.  Is it that we forget it?  If that is the reason, we should not forget it.  If that is the only reason, I think this problem could be, if not completely resolved, substantially mitigated.  I would urge on the Minister, before we are irrevocably committed to very large expenditure for the reconstruction of county homes, to see if some of this could not be devoted to expanding the existing service of charities designed to keep people near their homes where, whatever other <Col N="1334" /> afflictions they would have to suffer, they would not have to face loneliness and home sickness as well.</P>
    <P>The rules of procedure do not permit us to discuss matters which would involve legislation.  Nevertheless, the House will remember that our approach to this whole health problem is different from that of the Minister for Health.  Another occasion will present itself for discussion of the fundamental differences which are not strictly relevant to the administrative matters appropriate to this discussion. I should be grateful, when the Minister is concluding, if he could deal with the matter he has already undertaken to deal with and, most especially, if he could give us his thinking on the future of the county homes and the alternative accommodation which we might be able to make for the old, the poor and the lonely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement was a fairly comprehensive one, and I do not propose to deal with all the matters he mentioned. However, I propose to comment on certain of the problems to which he referred.  We have all our own ideas as to what the priority should be in tackling our health problems.  My ideas may not correspond with the views of other Deputies, but I feel sure the short list I have in mind would meet with the approval of the House.  The House may not accept the list in the order I give it, but I do not think there would be much disagreement about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to one of the points, namely, the problem of our old people, who are being sent to what I can only describe in the majority of cases as dungeons of county homes. Another problem shelved for years which must be faced is the problem of the mentally handicapped child. The third problem of major importance in my opinon is one that will need immediate attention and at the same time is a long-term problem&mdash;the problem of mental health.  The Minister himself, in his statement, has admitted that it is a grave problem in Ireland and it is a pretty serious thing when the Minister, in writing, has to admit that &ldquo;among European <Col N="1335" /> countries we have an unenviable record in this regard&rdquo;.  That is the cause of so much of our mental health problems.  In fact, from the statistics available, I believe that we have the worst record in Europe in regard to mental illness.</P>
    <P>The big problem of the past ten years which various Governments tackled was the TB problem and, to a great extent, the back of that problem has been broken.  The time is now over-ripe when a crash programme, as vigorous and inspired as the TB programme, should be undertaken to catch up with other European countries in their attempts to solve the mental health problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that every effort is being made on the basis of our present knowledge to remedy the position by continuing to improve and expand treatment.  I do not accept that for a moment.  If the rate of progress operating in the mental institutions which we know&mdash;the general ones throughout the country&mdash;is the yardstick by which we measure progress it will be another fifty years before we catch up with our next-door neighbour in solving this problem.  I notice that the Minister has admitted first that our record&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not misconstrue what I said.  I said that the number of persons in mental hospitals constituted the unenviable record, but a great many persons who are in mental hospitals should not be there at all.  They are not ill; they are senile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>And there are many who are not in mental hospitals who have not far to go to reach that condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that present company was excepted.  The Minister has put his finger on one of the difficulties.  We have, up to the present, quite large numbers of people being held in these mental hospitals <Col N="1336" /> who should be released and sent home. I know for a fact that when such action is being contemplated by progressive medical men it is flouted by the reactionaries in control in many of these institutions.  But the Minister cannot excuse the position here by suggesting that, because we have quite a number of old people in our mental hospitals who should be at home, this increases the figure of those shown as suffering from mental trouble over and above the European average.  That is not correct, if we accept what the county medical officers throughout the country say in their annual reports.</P>
      <P>There is a definite problem of mental illness in certain parts of Ireland.  I think the Minister will admit it has nothing to do with age groups.  I should like to know if the commission of inquiry which is examining the problem of the mentally handicapped is examining into the causes of mental illness.  Is it examining into the problem in Ireland as to why the percentage of those suffering mental illness is higher than in other countries?  Surely it should be the other way about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much boasting is done in this country that the suicide rate is lower than in certain other places that have a higher standard of living and perhaps far better social services, but that is poor consolation if we have a higher percentage of mental deficients in Ireland.  Why is that?  Is an examination being made of the causes of that or are the Government afraid of such an examination?  A proper examination should be made of the sections of society who suffer from mental illness and the various categories of it.  The sad position is that when you look at the various sections today under treatment in the mental hospitals, in certain categories there is a large percentage of breakdowns?  Why is it that the stress of living is hitting so many people here although we are not such a highly developed community industrially? If our position is so serious and we are not a highly developed country&mdash;if it is accepted that the more developed the country is and the faster the pace of life, the higher the rate of mental trouble&mdash;why is our problem <Col N="1337" /> greater than in many countries that are highly industrialised and where the stress of living is so arduous?  What will it be like if we are brought fully into the 20th century by proper expansion of our industry and agriculture?</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that there is not anything so depressing as the spectacle of a large number of patients sitting around in day rooms and corridors in a mental hospital doing nothing.  What does he mean by that? To whom is it depressing&mdash;to him and those who come in as onlookers, or to the patients themselves?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has clarified that point.  Is he satisfied everything possible is being done in the mental hospitals without doing any building work to ensure that lack of activity is remedied?</P>
      <P>I have gone on a hot summer day to visit a patient in a certain mental hospital.  The doors and windows on the outside were all locked and in the community room were about 80 patients, women from the age of 16 up, walking up and down, sitting on chairs and looking at the ground or looking at the walls.  There were one or two nurses inside reading newspapers or magazines while there was a broiling sun outside.  To my mind, that is criminal so far as the treatment of patients is concerned in mental hospitals.  It does not involve the expenditure of large sums of money to solve, or at least ease, that problem. A little commonsense and understanding would solve it by getting somebody to open the doors and bring those patients out for a walk on the lawn or even let them sit outside in the sun.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder that so many people become depressed and institutionalised in mental hospitals.  They are locked up and that is the end of it.  I do not say that that is the position in all our mental hospitals.  An excellent outlook is apparent amongst those in charge in some of them and every effort is made to make life easy and to ensure a rapid turnover in the numbers being treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I only hope that the example set by <Col N="1338" /> the top-class mental hospitals will be followed without delay by the other institutions or by the mental hospital boards in various centres.  Very often, it takes quite an amount of prodding to get these people moving.</P>
    <P>At some of the monthly meetings of boards of mental hospitals, the main items of discussion can be the amounts paid for different types of meat and arguments about whether such meat should be produced on their own farm. I have often seen at a mental hospital board meeting a big detailed list of the commodities purchased by the farm steward and wondered whether it was an agricultural meeting or a mental hospital board meeting.  Sometimes, the last thing thought of at such a meeting is the welfare of the patients. Such matters need examination.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have no compunction about giving a rap on the knuckles to those boards which are not doing their duty.  He is not very shy about giving raps on the knuckles to local authorities, very often on the wrong issues.  He is not suffering from shyness when it comes to this matter. The Labour Party will put no obstacle in the way of the Minister in respect of financial accommodation in any steps he takes to improve the situation in the mental health field.</P>
    <P>The problem of disabled and mentally handicapped children is very serious and very sad.  I can talk at this stage only for the west of Ireland, particularly my constituency.  What I say may sound parochial but I hope my experience is not the experience of other Deputies in other parts of the country.  I shall be interested to discover if that is so.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a local authority for the past 12 or 14 years. During that time, I have used whatever influence I had, through criticisms and through prodding, to bring home to those in charge the necessity for increasing accommodation for mentally handicapped children and for increasing the number of trained teachers to look after them.  There has been very little improvement in the past 12 years in that respect in my county.</P>
    <P>What must be thought of us as a <Col N="1339" /> nation when we are so neglectful of our weaker and younger sections such as the disabled or mentally handicapped child?  I have letters from parents, month after month, begging me to use my influence to get a child into some institution before it is too late so that treatment will be given to it.  If the Minister consults the Roscommon local authority he will find that my experience is, I presume, that of every county councillor on that local authority.  The staff of the county council are most helpful so far as trying to persuade the few institutions available to take in such children is concerned.  The county medical officer of health in Roscommon has admitted that many children in the county today will never be placed in institutions in time to give them a training or a chance in life.  The sad part of it is that it is not such a terribly expensive job.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from considering the welfare of those unfortunate and unlucky youngsters who are disabled or mentally handicapped, there is the terrible problem that parents fear for the welfare and safety of the other children in the family.  In quite a number of homes, a mentally handicapped or disabled child may be a danger not only to himself but to his brothers and sisters.  I know of no priority for such children to be taken away and given a chance in life.</P>
    <P>I argued this point a few years ago in this House and pointed out that we would have to go outside the existing channels available in our institutions. I was told that the situation in England would not be adopted here and that we should be delighted to have the Brothers of the Order of St. John of God to do this work.  I am well aware of the excellent work they are doing but if these Brothers have not the facilities to look after all of the children I speak for, then the State must step in and see that people who have a vocation for this type of work are allowed to train and are given jobs in Ireland in this very important field.</P>
    <P>There is a shortage of accommodation and of therapy instructors in the <Col N="1340" /> west of Ireland to look after mentally handicapped and disabled children. The Minister should lose no time in facing this problem.  He spoke here of running up against difficulties in finding other uses for some of the sanatoria&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No&mdash;there is no difficulty about finding other uses but there is a difficulty in getting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there is a difficulty in persuading local authorities to put vacant sanatoria to other uses.  The Minister cannot be blamed if he can say that local authorities are preventing him from using accommodation which is lying idle and which could now be used for the rehabilitation and training of these children.  If that is true, if the Minister is accurate, he has a duty to tell the House where these health authorities are and let public opinion deal with them.  If the public knew the facts, knew that a local authority was holding up the transfer of an institution which could be used for these sad cases which I have mentioned, they would deal with the members of that authority in no uncertain fashion at the next county council elections.</P>
      <P>To come nearer to the west of Ireland, the Minister has been pressed by Roscommon County Council to consider taking over a building or an institution in Galway for the training and accommodation of these children. I should like to know from the Minister if he has made any progress in Galway.  The suggestion by our local authority was that there should be a regional centre in Galway which would cater for the surrounding counties in Connacht.  I know that there has been an improvement in the Sligo area but as far as Galway is concerned, if an existing establishment were taken over and staffed, it would solve the immediate problems in Roscommon and other parts of the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to move in that regard because it is depressing to have to wait for ten or 12 years and see no apparent improvement and at the same time see the waiting lists there each year.  It is disgraceful that <Col N="1341" /> public representatives should have to say to parents: &ldquo;I am sorry, I can do nothing about it.  I am not in a position to get a bed for you in any of the existing institutions; they are packed out and there is no hope of your child getting in in the next two, three or four years.&rdquo;  That is a terrible answer to have to give to any parent.  I would not mind if it only had to be given once but to have to give it year after year to different parents is inexcusable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the problem of old people in county homes.  I could not agree more with him in regard to the necessity for dealing with this problem.  I am not, of course, in agreement with his solutions but I am in full agreement regarding the extent of the problem and the sadness of it, particularly in rural Ireland, because I cannot speak for the city areas.  In Roscommon, we have a county home which dates back into history.  For the past ten years, the local authority have been pressing the Department to sanction a new building to house the old people who are in the existing home. I do not know where the blame for this delay lies but I should like the Minister, if it is not too much trouble, to let us have the facts in the course of his reply because I can tell him he is being blamed for the delay.  As far as the local authority are concerned, they are told that the Department are considering whether there should be ten or 15 more beds in it and each time the local authority officials are pressed about the matter by the county councillors, they tell them that the Department want another consultation. There are nothing but consultations going on between the officials of the county council and the Minister's officials. As far as I am concerned, and as far as the people of the county home are concerned, there does not seem to be any improvement or any prospect of finality.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister stated that he hoped to see accommodation for 200 people built around October.  I want to put it to the Minister that in the planning of this accommodation, the greatest possible consideration should be given to the comfort and the happiness of those who will be housed <Col N="1342" /> there and who will end their days there. In my opinion, it is not necessary to build a fortress or to use the normal methods of building construction in order to provide an excellent hostel for old people.  The Minister is aware that there is a new building technique available now which would halve the cost of putting up an excellent hostel.  This question of cost has been brought up time and again by the Minister and by other people who say that the country cannot afford this, that or the other thing.  I suggest to the Minister that he can provide a first-class building with first-class accommodation by the use of new building techniques and can do that at half the cost of building by normal methods.  I want to emphasise that the adoption of this new type of building should not mean any delay in planning.</P>
    <P>The situation in Roscommon is pretty grim.  It is sad to go into the county home and find the old people segregated.  The impression we get when we go in is that we are in an institution.  There is no feeling at all of its being a home.  That is a very important thing to remember; it is a problem that must be solved.  I know that the good Sisters who run county homes do their best but their best is not good enough.  As far as I am concerned, whatever may be said about the vocation of looking after county homes, the main thing to remember is that we must ensure that the old people in them are happy.  Their lives in the county homes must not be purely a matter of the next world, for at least while they are in the homes, they must be given some little comforts.  I do not like to see old people being kept indoors and practically locked up and only let out once or twice in the week. That is a disgraceful way to treat people when they go into a county home.</P>
    <P>We have to face the fact that many people, many of the younger people, take the view that old people are a burden to them.  The first thing they consider doing is putting old people into the county home.  I cannot give the Minister a solution to that problem. To me, that is a sign of sickness in the minds of our people.  Our <Col N="1343" /> mentality with regard to disabled people and mentally handicapped children is disgraceful.  Our outlook on the matter is disgraceful.  Our outlook towards old people is equally disgraceful.  In other words, if I may put it this way, we have, I think, no Christianity at all in our approach. Our neighbour who has been described as pagan, or whom a great many hypocrites in this country anyway, like to describe as pagan, is far more sympathetic towards the needs of the weak, the old, and the disabled, far more understanding of their problems, and far more willing to sacrifice, shall we say, little luxuries in order to ensure that those who are weak get the benefit.  Here, in Ireland, if one asks that something should be done for old people, or that they should be helped, the answer is: &ldquo;We cannot afford it.&rdquo;  It has been the case over the years that, whenever there is a saving to be achieved in the rates, one can always be sure that the county home gets a rap.  I do not know what one can do with that outlook.  The only thing we can hope for is that those who know better will set a good example, and the Minister and his Department should try to set an example in this regard.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the new type of building technique which is available to the Minister.  Apart from utilising this for the county homes, he should also, I think, remember that in hospital building a far closer watch should be kept on the advisers, on the architects, and on the engineers.  I know that the Minister is a layman. I know that a layman is not in a position to decide finally, perhaps, what type of building should be erected, what type of accommodation should be made available in a regional hospital.  In fact, huge sums of money have been wasted in the methods used and in the planning and building of regional hospitals in this country.  I shall give the Minister an example.</P>
    <P>The Regional Hospital, Galway, was built to cater for a big area.  Those who planned it were alleged to have the foresight to know what the demands on <Col N="1344" /> that hospital would be, the extent to which it would be used, and the number of beds necessary.  That hospital is now overcrowded and there is no possibility of reshaping the building to accommodate more patients.  There are long corridors there which could be turned into first-class wards, long corridors over which one would need skates in order to get up and down in any kind of time.  There is a whole series of private wards, single bedded. These rooms are slightly too big for one and too small to hold a second bed, even in case of emergency.  They show a lack of proper planning.  If these rooms had been made smaller they would still be big enough to accommodate one patient; if they had been made slightly bigger they could accommodate two beds, if necessary. Their present size is wasteful.  That clearly shows bad planning.</P>
    <P>There is bad planning in many of these hospitals from the point of view of the siting of the kitchen and the provision of cooking facilities.  It strikes me no consultation at all takes place between the planners and the people who must use these particular hospitals. I refer to those who have experience in big hospitals of the problems of staff, of cooking, of long distances between various wards, <i>et cetera</i>.  Is the advice, I wonder, of these people taken into account at all by these brilliant architects, engineers and officials when they get together round the conference table to make a final decision on the building?  I do not believe it is, but there is nothing so valuable as the experience of those who have a practical knowledge of running these institutions, or hospitals, and I suggest to the Minister that he could save quite an amount of capital outlay by consultations at the proper time and by paying heed to those who will have to work in these hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his statement to the position of the voluntary hospitals and to the fact&mdash;it is, in my opinion, an extraordinary situation that he should have to admit this&mdash;that they are not too anxious to co-operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall quote the Minister:</P>
      <P>Sometimes even a similar disposition may be encountered in the authorities of a voluntary general hospital who frown on any suggestion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;sometimes&rdquo;. The Deputy made a general comprehensive statement bringing in every voluntary hospital authority, which is not what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept what the Minister says: not every voluntary hospital is included.  The position, however, is bad enough for the Minister to mention in his report that, sometimes, certain voluntary hospitals are not prepared to co-operate &mdash; I will accept that&mdash;although the State is paying the deficits of these voluntary hospitals each year.  This is a situation the Minister will have to have examined very carefully.  He has stated that for the present year the figure for deficits of the voluntary hospitals that will have to be met by taxation up to 31st March is £2.2 millions.  The Minister says, and I shall quote him because I want to be very accurate in this:</P>
      <P>It was never contemplated that sums of such magnitude would be diverted from the Hospitals Trust Fund for the purpose of keeping the revenue accounts of the voluntary hospitals in balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each year the figure for deficits in the voluntary hospitals is mounting and, as we know, the Minister has no control whatever over these hospitals.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs <Col N="1346" /> that large sums of money, and this is something that was never contemplated, are handed over to the voluntary hospitals while, at the same time, no control good, bad, or indifferent, can be exercised over them. Wherever public money is being spent the Minister, or the State, has a right, in my opinion, to see that that money is spent properly.  The State has a right to intervene to ensure the money is spent properly and no institution can describe itself as voluntary if it is dependent to the extent that the voluntary hospitals are now dependent on the public and on the State for the payment of their debts.  They cannot have it both ways.  The Minister should have this matter very carefully examined with a view to seeing that those who pay the piper call the tune. There is nothing unreasonable about that proposition.</P>
    <P>The final point I should like to make to the Minister is in connection with the cost of drugs.  He has stated that in the present year the increased cost will be £50,000.  That is a heavy increase but even without that increase, the cost of drugs is exorbitant.  I believe the public are not able to pay the cost of these drugs, especially the middle-income group.  It is heartbreaking for families to have to pay for very expensive drugs and, as the Minister knows very well, all the prescriptions are very dear here.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably say that he issued a circular to the local authorities which enables them to ease the burden on the middle-income group where drugs are prescribed over a long period; in other words, that a limited medical card may be given to such a person.  The fact is that that circular would never have seen the light of day were it not that it was dragged out of the county council officials' files.  They were forced to agree that such a provision was there.  The general public are not aware of this and it is only the rare case that is getting the benefit of that power which the Minister states the local authorities have to give a limited medical card.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal with this question in detail but I do want to <Col N="1347" /> emphasise that the Minister himself should inquire into the possibility of bulk buying of these medicines.  I am told that quite a number of these drugs can be bought in bulk at far lower cost than they are available here at the present time.  A number of hospitals in England do their own bulk buying outside Britain, and one leading hospital in Britain is able to buy abroad its requirements in medicines and drugs at half the price at which they could acquire them through the normal channels in Britain.  I should like to know if the Minister and his Department are probing into the possibility of acquiring from abroad these very costly drugs and medicines in bulk form at the most economical price. Something will have to be done in that regard and I hope the Minister will have something to say on that.  There are other matters in the Minister's statement with which other Deputies will deal and I shall leave any further comment in the general field to a colleague of mine.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister and his officers for the manner in which they have presented their brief.  It is well spaced which is a great convenience to people like myself who wish to make notes on it.  I would commend the clear presentation of this brief to the Minister's colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated he was alarmed at the incidence of deaths from gastro-enteritis in children which is exceptionally high in Dublin city.  Deputy Dillon mentioned that when housing improved ten or 12 years ago, the incidence dropped and he thought that might have something to do with it. The Minister pointed out that it was a matter of the germ.  I would say to the Minister it might be the milk still and it would be well worth while to check on all the pasteurisation places around Dublin to see if they are pasteurising milk according to the standards expected by the Minister's Department. That is the first thing.  Then&mdash;I have some public experience in this&mdash;it might be that the young mothers might not be using the facilities that are there for them in their new houses of scalding everything they use.  It would <Col N="1348" /> be no harm for the Minister to make inquiries along those lines.</P>
    <P>As regards mental illness, a group of people in my constituency of Waterford are doing great work for mentally handicapped children.  I shall not take the Minister to task in this regard because I know the great problem with which he is faced in staffing the institutions for rehabilitating these children.  I know the Minister will help these voluntary organisations in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and elsewhere because they are composed of people who have the right, Christian idea.  They are prepared to give their time, money and attention to this problem.  I know there will be requests to me from those people in my constituency and I would ask the Minister to give them well-deserved attention.</P>
    <P>There are many people in our mental hospitals, some of whom are old and senile but others of whom are not really mental patients at all but are there because they are unwanted at home and have nowhere else to go. That is a problem for the local authorities who do not want to put these unfortunate people out.  It is dreadful that many people, when their fathers and mothers get old, only want to get them out of their way.</P>
    <P>That brings me to what Deputy Dillon said about the care of the old and about the county homes.  I have visited county homes in my day.  I have always felt the staffs of the county homes are doing the best they can and show great devotion to the people under their care.  I think it is something that came down from the old system.  I do not know whether it is the system or the rigid discipline. Many of those old people might have been very rich, entertained people at home perhaps, and then found they had no better place to go than the county home.  They brought their independence with them and the regulations were such that many of them reached a stage when they only wished to die.  They were always dissatisfied and, I may say, grief-stricken when people from their own area called to see them.  There is something to be <Col N="1349" /> said for having these kinds of homes in various places and I am sure when the Minister goes to his officials, they will reiterate what I am about to say.</P>
    <P>In Waterford city, we can proudly say that the people have shown themselves to be more than generous.  From generation to generation they have shown themselves to be more generous than in any other part of Ireland.  We still have a great many homes for old people in Waterford.  Some of them were left to us by merchant princes. Some of the homes were left by very decent Protestant gentlemen and Protestant charities, and by retired sea captains.</P>
    <P>We still have a great many of these homes.  They are well run.  We have the Little Sisters of the Poor who, when they came to Ireland, paid us the compliment of coming to Waterford first.  There they knew they could make a start.  They have a fine institution and they look after people from all counties around.  The people are happy there and are well looked after.  They have a certain amount of freedom and can go out to the pictures.</P>
    <P>Then we have another type, a charity which was set up by moneys left by Captain Walsh and it is a substantial building.  Old ladies have flats there and have a matron to look after them.  They get a small sum of money every year but they bring in money with them.  They look after themselves and can go and come whenever they like, the only restriction being they have to be in by a certain time of night.  This is the type of institution I would recommend.  We have an institution which was left to the parish priest of Ballybricken and the Christian Brothers.  Old ladies are looked after too.  We have the Widows' Committee of the Burton Institute and the Matthew Shea money left by Captain Shea.  The men have their own rooms and can go out to the pictures, and so on.  The freedom they have is of great help to them.  When they are ill their companions look after them under the supervision of the nuns.</P>
    <P>The last one I propose to mention is worthy of mention because of the way it has endured and come down to us to do the great work it is doing.  It is <Col N="1350" /> known as the Holy Ghost Hospital. We have that since the dissolution of the monasteries.  When the monasteries were dissolved here in Ireland by Henry VIII an enormous amount of people were unwanted because the monasteries were a refuge, not only for the poor but for the rich people or anybody who happened to be around, but especially for homeless people.  A Waterford merchant offered a sum of money for the great friars of the Franciscan Abbey to the King's Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The King himself accepted the offer and gave some adjoining lands to help maintain it and the Abbey was to be opened for a home for old people. Mass was to be offered and the rosary said every night for the donor.  It was one of the extraordinary places where Mass was offered at all periods during the Elizabethan persecution and the Cromwellian persecution and continued until the middle of the last century when the Abbey buildings were in a bad way.  Great men, such as Edward Leamy, came and pulled the estate together, and were able to make it pay to such an enormous extent that they were able to apply to the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests for help and they built the new building known as the Holy Ghost Hospital.</P>
    <P>It is a beautiful building on the Cork road.  There are 12 cottages surrounding the building.  They are semidetached cottages with a living room, bedroom, w.c. and a little kitchenette. They are for old couples, while inside, in the building proper, the men, or the women, have their own rooms, their own church, their chaplain and two John of God nuns to look after them. Revenue comes from the rents and the governors are the Aldermen of the City of Waterford and the Bishop of Waterford and Lismore and the Bishop of Cashel, that is, the Catholic and Protestant Bishops, and a Life Master is Mr. J. J. Walshe who happens to be a namesake of the founder.  But there it is.  The people, instead of having to suffer the agony of going into the County Home, and having to go long distances away from their homes, would, if there were homes like this, <Col N="1351" /> run in the same way, and under the supervision of the Government, be able to live in their own rooms and go to the dining room and get their meals or, if they wished, cook their own meals.  They have freedom which is not given in the county hospitals.  They can go out to the pictures, to sports fixtures, football matches, and so on. I might add the inmates still recite the rosary every night for the donor, who happens to be Henry VIII.  I told that to a Franciscan once during a discussion on the Abbey when he mentioned Henry VIII.  I said: &ldquo;Of course they say the rosary every night for Henry&rdquo;, and he said: &ldquo;Good God, you do not tell me they do that, but maybe the poor man would want it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It would be a good thing if it did as we might get a subvention from the Minister, such as Henry VIII gave us to run a home for old people.  I say the Minister would have to be in the position of Henry VIII and would have to give a subvention. Then maybe the people would say the rosary for the Minister.  Perhaps he will need it sometime.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that the rates went up on other services besides the health services.  He said:</P>
      <P>A similar upward trend is, for instance, observable in the case of housing; in the year 1956/57 the housing rate in County Carlow was 1/4d. in the £; by 1962/63, it had increased to 5/5d.  In County Donegal, the housing rate was 3/-in the £ in 1956/57; by 1962/63, it had risen to 4/10d.  In Cork County Borough, the housing rate rose from 3/1d. in 1956/57 to 6/5d. in 1962/63.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Dr. Ryan, invited the local authorities to a central region to get their co-operation in the health services.  The local authorities of Munster were invited to Cork, and I had the honour of being selected by my local authority to go to Cork.  The then Minister specifically told us in Cork that the <Col N="1352" /> charge would be 2/- in the £ on the local authorities if they adopted the health services.  That was definitely said, and it was definitely the reason the local authorities agreed to the terms of the new health services.  Some members who were there, including myself, asked the Minister was that the figure, and he said it was.  I asked was there any danger it would go up to 3/-, and the Minister said: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  I asked was there any danger it would go up to 4/-, and he said: &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;  I could show the Minister cuttings from the various newspapers which appeared the next day.  I would have had them with me today but the Estimate took me somewhat by surprise.  I have them on my file.</P>
    <P>In 1952, the rates struck for the health services&mdash;I know they were not very good health services&mdash;ran from 1/3 to 1/6 to 2/- in the £.  The health services are now costing the local authorities around £1 in the £ and, in some cases, 26/- in the £.  It is not the Minister's privilege to wash his hands of that whole business.  I know the health services are exceptionally good, and I know the local authorities are prepared to play their part, but, in view of the Minister's undertaking, the local authorities consider they are carrying too much of the burden.</P>
    <P>The health services of which I have had experience are excellent.  I should like to pay tribute to the specialists, and I should like to pay tribute to the Minister's Department for the specialist services.  They are doing wonderful work.  Some wonderful operations have been performed, and children whose limbs were deformed have been restored to health and made perfectly normal.  Those are wonderful operations.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned doctors, health inspectors, dental surgeons, and various persons connected with the health services, but I notice he did not mention the nurses.  When replying, would he tell us what his policy is towards the nurses, and if he is prepared to meet them in what they are looking for?  We often brag about things about which we have no right to brag and say we have the <Col N="1353" /> best in the world of such a thing.  We can proudly say our nurses are among the best in the world.  They are welcome in every country, and their hours and conditions of pay should be equal to any in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I seldom listened to a statement by a Minister with such interest as I listened to the statement made by the Minister this morning. With the exception of one or two minor comments of his own, which might have been left out, and with the exception of the fact that the Minister has a flair for using three big words where two small words would do, I think the document is a very fine one. It is a factual statement, and it will be very useful to Deputies for comparison purposes in years to come.</P>
      <P>The Minister might have put a little more emphasis on the killer diseases.  I am sure the public would be shocked if they realised the situation.  For instance, there is the fact that there were 10,974 deaths from heart disease in 1962.  In the previous year, there were 11,064 deaths from the same disease.  Every medical effort should be made to try to find some preventative because, apart from the number of people who die from heart disease, there are thousands who are crippled for life, and who become eventually a burden on the State.  During the past year, a lot of attention has been given to cancer, particularly lung cancer. Last year 697 people died from lung cancer&mdash;a not inconsiderable figure. When we compare that figure with the number who died from heart disease, we find that the real villain of the piece is heart trouble, and the State must make every effort to try to find some remedy for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody said this morning that the tempo of life may be responsible.  It is a fact that over the past few weeks an enormous number of relatively young men and women have died suddenly. I know one area where five people who appeared to be in the prime of life passed out like a snap of the fingers. Surely this is a serious situation and one in respect of which the Department of Health must bend all their effort to find out why the figures of these sudden <Col N="1354" /> deaths should be so high.  We have all been horrified by the deaths on the road but compared with the number of people who die from heart disease, the number of deaths on the road is nothing.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Deputy Dillon's view regarding the causes of cancer and I believe that diesel fumes are a far greater danger than cigarette smoking. I do not know if the law is loose about this matter but there is nothing more irritating than driving mile after mile behind a lorry which is belching out diesel fumes without any consideration for other users of the road. There can be nothing more dangerous and CIE buses frequently come into this category.  If there is an effort to do something about lung cancer, something should also be done about air pollution by diesel fumes in our cities and towns.  In the country districts, the fumes do not linger very long.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on trying to have something done about cancer but we seem to be taking things very easily.  Recently a voluntary body was set up to assist in this effort and, while we must give the greatest credit to people who are prepared to assist in these matters in their spare time, it is my personal view that this is a matter for the State.  The scourge of tuberculosis has been almost wiped out because of positive action by the State and if dealing with the cancer problem is going to cost a great deal of money, that money should be found by the State.  In the long run, it will cost the State much more if we allow the present trend to continue.  Hospitalisation for long periods, assistance in various forms, and the human tragedies that occur because of the two killer diseases I have mentioned will eventually cost the State very much more.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to tackle this problem in the way in which a previous Government tackled the other problem of tuberculosis.  That is the only way in which it can be dealt with.  Mass X-ray is helping greatly in finding people who are suffering from tuberculosis but quite a number of suspects are not inclined to avail of this service.  They are not inclined to <Col N="1355" /> disclose the fact that they might be suffering from tuberculosis and are scared to death that they might be found to be so suffering if they had themselves X-rayed.  That is a tragedy, and it should be brought to the notice of the general public that it is in everybody's interest that anyone who might be remotely connected with the disease should have an X-ray as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the figures given by the Minister with regard to maternal and infant mortality.  It is difficult to understand the difference between the figures for England and Scotland and those for this country. The races and the climatic conditions are very similar but possibly the fact that they have different health services may give them a slight edge over us.  I should like the Minister to indicate if the figures for infant mortality are not due to a large extent to congenital diseases and that the children in many of these cases would not have lived anyway.  These may be children who would not be helped even by the most modern medical treatment.</P>
    <P>It is not clear from the Minister's statement what he means by the number of malformed children born. Does he mean that there are more of them born in Dublin?  Take also the incidence of children suffering from gastro-enteritis.  I do not know what is responsible for the high incidence of that disease in the city but I would suggest that there are still too many sources of infection in our towns and cities.  Perhaps I may be saying something that will not be too popular in certain quarters but it is a shame that piggeries and such other sources of infection should be allowed in the middle of housing centres. Where you have this sort of thing, there is much greater danger of young children taking infection.  It is a shame to see the most modern blocks of flats being built and within 50 yards of them, people feeding pigs and throwing food, dirt and filth all over the place.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised to find that there were quite a number of thalidomide <Col N="1356" /> babies in the country.  I feel sure the Minister will do everything possible to give them the necessary assistance when they come to the age to benefit by it.  I was glad to hear that polio appears to be on the way out.  However, would the Minister say if any general instruction with regard to the new type of protection&mdash;the oral vaccine&mdash;has been sent out to the local authorities?  I suggest that there is still need for an all-out effort during a certain period of each year to ensure that all children are protected.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to increased costs in voluntary hospitals. I do not know whether the Minister is aware of it or not, but I am informed the costs of patients in voluntary hospitals have increased by from 45 to 50 per cent in the past two years.  That is a substantial increase, and while there may be an explanation for it, I do not think the Minister's explanation, that these hospitals did not benefit by any increases for some time, is the entire story.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister say, &mdash; he referred to it in passing&mdash;if it is because of reduced sweepstake income or because more money is being channelled into the building of hospitals?  If that is not the reason, I should like to know why such an extra heavy impost has been put on local rates.  I am one of those who believe that when a person is ill, the important thing to do is to give him proper and prompt treatment in whatever place that treatment is most easily obtainable.  That is the policy guiding most of the local authority and voluntary hospitals throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Speaking for my own local authority, they are prepared fully to facilitate patients who live in districts nearer the voluntary hospitals in Drogheda or Dublin, if they can be treated there.  The fact that during recent years we have always found the hospitals in Navan practically full means there is no objection by anybody to having patients treated in outside hospitals.  However, in view of the tremendous cost to the local <Col N="1357" /> authority, this has become a very big problem.</P>
    <P>During the past few days, Meath County Council have been discussing the rates for the coming year.  We find there will be a further steep rise.  One of the main reasons given is the extra cost of sending patients to the voluntary hospitals.  When I asked why this was so, I was told it was because the Hospital Sweepstake funds were no longer available to the same extent as in earlier years.  If that is so, I should be glad if the Minister would explain why.</P>
    <P>Both local authority and voluntary hospitals are giving an excellent service, excellent treatment.  When the Minister stated the voluntary hospitals are still able to give treatment in many cases at less cost than the local authority hospitals, I feel sure he must have been aware that certain local authority hospitals include some of the cost of maintenance and hospital repairs in their overall charges. That, in fact, presents a lopsided picture.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe that the people in country districts who are now getting treatment under the Health Act to which they were not entitled some years ago have not very much to complain about in the matter of payment. I do not think that in fact they do complain very much but we find this aspect often arises and I would ask the Minister for an explanation.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to hear that some local authorities do not treat patients in the same way as we do in County Meath. Some local authorities insist on their medical card patients going to the county hospital, which may be 20 or 30 miles from where they live, while at the same time there may be one or two voluntary hospitals beside them. They are taken away from beside these voluntary hospitals to the county hospitals. To my mind, that is an unfair, unchristian, system and I would ask the Minister to use his influence to stop it. I know some hospitals are not always full and that the local authority may feel it is a good thing to bring patients to the county hospital, no matter what discomfort it may involve for the patients.  I repeat it is unchristian and <Col N="1358" /> unfair and I hope the Minister will intervene and stop it.</P>
    <P>The question of county homes has been raised and in this matter I agree with Deputy McQuillan.  However, the Minister has given a long list of homes about to be repaired, included in which is the home in Trim.  Wonderful work has been done over the years.  In all senses of the word, it has been a home for the people who have gone there. One or two things, however, make me uneasy.  Deputy McQuillan referred to the fact that if a man and his wife go into a county home, they are put into separate quarters and may not see each other again in this world.  If one goes into a county home any day, one will find groups of old men&mdash;not so much the old women&mdash;sitting around doing nothing but twiddling their fingers.  It must be an awful long day for them.  It is quite true they may go out and walk around the town, but I think some more entertainment should be provided for those in the last days of their lives.  As far as accommodation is concerned&mdash;food, clothing and all the rest of it&mdash;it could not be surpassed. The good nuns look after them excellently.  When paying a tribute to them and to the nursing staffs, the Minister ignored the work being done by the domestic staffs, the wardsmaids and the porters.  They are the people who really do the work of catering for the old people in these homes and I think they deserve this tribute.</P>
    <P>In some areas we have the suggestion that as the county home is not paying, as it is getting dilapidated, it must be knocked down and replaced by a modern building to be erected in any part of the county where it suits the county council.  That is not a good idea.  In my locality&mdash;not in my constituency&mdash;in Drogheda, something like that has been suggested.  I submit it is wrong that old people from Drogheda should be uprooted and sent to the other end of the county where none of their relatives or friends can visit them.</P>
    <P>I should point out here that everybody who goes to a county home is not an outcast, a person who has been thrown out of his home.  It is true there are quite a number of people <Col N="1359" /> who have gone into county homes voluntarily because they feel they would be better looked after and happier there than struggling on their own trying to make do with the minor social services available to them.  In most cases they are well looked after.  I understand the cost of keeping them in a county home can run to £3 or £4 a week.  It surprises me that somebody has not thought of giving them a few pounds extra at home, where they might be able to carry on better than in the county home.</P>
    <P>Mental illness has been referred to. The Minister made a comment which I do not think it would be fair to allow pass.  He said:</P>
    <P>How true it is that mental illness is one of our most pressing health problems is borne out by the fact that we still have 19,250 of our people in mental hospitals.  Among European countries we have an unenviable record in this regard.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be fair to let that pass without comment.  Unless we know the standard with which the Minister is comparing us, the wrong picture could be given.  We could have some of the English Sunday newspapers highlighting the fact that we have in Ireland a high incidence of mental illness.  I do not think that would be quite true.  I should like to know from the Minister how many of those 19,250 are people who were committed to mental hospitals when they were mentally ill but who now have nobody to take them out.  For that reason, they have been left in the mental hospitals, even though they are saner than many of the people in Cork and Kildare.</P>
    <P>In addition, would the Minister say whether we in this country are inclined to put people into mental hospitals far earlier in their mental illness?  Are we prepared to put in people who are perhaps only slightly mentally deranged?  In other countries I have visited, it is quite common to see in practically every village one or two of those people previously known as the village idiot.  Nobody seems to worry much about them.  Here they are very often put into a mental home and left <Col N="1360" /> there.  When the Minister is making his comparison, is he taking that fact into consideration?</P>
    <P>I know that recently most mental hospitals have been trying to segregate the children who, up to recently, have been left with the adults.  I hope this trend will continue.  It is shocking to see a boy of 10 or 15 years in the same ward as a lot of old men who are mentally defective while the boy may be only slightly deranged mentally. There are also the type of people who, for one reason or another, become mentally deranged now and again.  I am told there are certain drugs, which, if properly used, can prevent the attacks from recurring for a long period or possibly prevent them altogether.  I know a number of these people.  They are excellent citizens, most of them very hard working.  Then they become affected.  For some reason it appears that the drugs are not always available. It is only when they have got treatment over two or three months that they are told at the end of it that the doctor will now supply them with the drugs and that they may not have to come back.  The drugs have effect for a period, but eventually that dies off and the situation is worse than before, with the result that these people have to return to hospital for costly treatment. Is there any hope that the people who suffer in that way would receive continuous treatment or that there would be a periodic check to find out whether or not they are receiving treatment?  It should not be left to the patients to decide.  The onus is upon the medical authorities of seeing to it that the treatment is carried out properly.</P>
    <P>As far as buildings are concerned, I honestly believe a number of the mental hospital buildings could do with a lot of renovation.  It is true the cost will be colossal, but we are dealing here with the needs of human beings.  No matter where the money comes from, it should be found to try to deal with people who are ill.</P>
    <P>A number of people from Louth and Meath have come together in Drogheda to set up, with the assistance of the local clergy of all denominations and the local doctors, a school for <Col N="1361" /> mentally handicapped children.  It is an excellent idea, and I would recommend to the Minister that the State should give every possible assistance there.  At present it is being maintained by voluntary contributions by people who have guaranteed a certain sum per year for three years.  I hope that before the three years are up the Department will have taken it over completely.  I understand similar schools are in operation in other towns.</P>
    <P>There is one tendency which should be closely watched in this connection. There is a tendency to take children who are easily collected and, in some places, to take children who come from a certain class of home.  It would be a pity if the excellent progress being made is spoiled because one or two people at the head of affairs are inclined to pass over the poorer type of child in order to ensure that others receive the treatment which is, of course, required by all.  The number of children of this type who can be dealt with by the teacher is very small.  It is very costly to run a school of that kind.  Therefore, every possible assistance should be given by the State to have the school properly run.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the amount of money being spent on the hospital building programme and referred to the reduction in the income of the Hospitals Trust Fund.  It would be a great pity if the Fund were reduced to such a state that it was unable to carry on its excellent work.  If there is a suggestion&mdash;I am assured there is not &mdash;that the hospitals should be built and that the money given to the voluntary hospitals should be reduced, that is not a good idea.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said in his speech:</P>
    <P>The drop in income from the most recent Sweepstake as compared with the previous year, when coupled with the heavy revenue deficits of the voluntary hospitals, is a forcible reminder that building on a preWar scale is out.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would give a little more explanation of that when replying?</P>
    <P>The burden of the Health Estimate <Col N="1362" /> on the rates is referred to here.  When we talk about giving hospital treatment to those entitled to it in rural areas, we should remember that the amount of money collected by the local authority hospitals over the year is in most cases incredibly small compared with the number of patients treated.  This bears out the argument that a very good service is being provided by the local authorities for the amount of money paid in rates for the treatment.</P>
    <P>I see a remark in the Minister's statement that the eighth round increase in wages was responsible for increasing very substantially the amount which the hospitals were charging.  While that is to some extent true, we must not forget&mdash;although some people forget&mdash;those three letters, TOT, because the turnover tax also played a big part in the increased cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions on inhabited islands were investigated by an inter-departmental committee as a result of which the Government approved, in August, 1961, of various measures, particulars of which were given in my reply to a question tabled by the Deputy on 6th December, 1961. Since then, the Gaeltacht bottled gas scheme has been extended to non-Gaeltacht islands which have little <Col N="1364" /> prospect of getting electricity; telephone facilities will be available shortly on four additional islands namely Inishmeane, County Donegal, Achillbeg, County Mayo, Inishturk, County Galway and Long Island, County Cork.  Exchequer aid has been made available to extend the quay at Kilronan on Inishmore in the Aran Islands and improvements in landing facilities at other islands are under consideration; more help is being given for island roads; State scholarships have been made available for children in certain Gaeltacht islands; and local authorities have been asked to pay particular attention to island housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree now that it is five years since he said in this House that we should sit down and have a look at Gaeltacht problems?  It appears from his answer that he has not completed his examination.  Would he not agree that one of the main difficulties confronting the smallholders on the islands is that they have to sell their butter at 2/6d. per lb. which, the Minister will agree, is an entirely uneconomic price and, if so, would he not accept the assertion of the island holders that they are entitled to some subsidy on their production of milk and butter on the islands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That consideration has not come before me in regard to milk production on the islands but I was referring the Deputy back to the reply given in August, 1961 and I went through all the items that were promised at that time to show that most of them have now been implemented or, are about to be implemented.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, has indicated that the subsidisation of the dairy industry has cost the Exchequer more than £6 million, while the island small-holders have not benefited by one penny from that sum?  Surely the small farmers on the islands are entitled to something more than the uneconomic price of 2/6d. per lb. for butter and are entitled to some share of the money devoted to subsidisation of the dairy industry by this House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are ready to go ahead with this work but, before they can do so, it is necessary to acquire certain foreshore property and interests.  The negotiations for purchase have not proceeded as well as we would like because of difficulties of title etc. and it may be that legislation will be necessary.  I can assure the Deputy that the matter is being pursued and a start on the work will be made at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>The works are primarily for fishery purposes and are not designed to cater for the Irish Lights vessel.  The matter of berthage facilities for their vessel has recently been raised formally by the Irish Lights Commissioners and is being considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is of course willing and anxious to help all Irish citizens in need, but distribution of State funds for this purpose on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to various individuals, organisations and areas in Britain could <Col N="1367" /> not be effectively and equitably administered. Equity and reasonable control of the expenditure of the tax-payers' money require that the distribution of State funds to groups of Irish citizens claiming assistance should take place here in Ireland in accordance with the rules which govern our noncontributory social services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter that should concern all of us.  I should like to ask the Minister, if the possibility of making financial assistance to individual voluntary organisations who are concerning themselves about this matter is not practicable, would the Minister consider the possibility of supplementing the personnel of these <Col N="1368" /> voluntary associations that are trying to look after some of our people who have got into trouble in England?  This might be done either through defraying essential expenses or through something analagous to the United States Peace Corps, voluntary workers from this country who would go and supplement the personnel of voluntary bodies like the Legion of Mary that are already working and offer to supplement the probation services of some of the police courts in England that are at present unable to provide adequate probation service and where, if they were available, many boys and girls who are in danger of getting into trouble could be rescued from the danger of falling into the hands of the law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to debate this subject at Question Time. I have dealt with it on a number of occasions.  The matter has been dealt with extensively on the Estimate for my Department.  I am hoping that we can get the Estimate in as quickly as the Government can make provision for it and we can have another debate on it.  I would be anxious that everybody would see the matter as I see it. Although we would like and want to treat Irish people in need, the only place it can be done in a satisfactory way is here in Ireland.  Once we start it on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis for our own people in Britain and appear to give them an established right to call on the Government here in great numbers or to call on the Irish people to sustain them abroad, I am afraid we are in for trouble.  I have thought about this for many months.  I see no way of doing it at Government level.  If it has to be done, it must be done in a voluntary way.  Money will have to be collected voluntarily here.  They have to make arrangements to see that it is not misspent.  It could easily be that with a number of people demanding money over there and saying a lot of exaggerated things about this situation, if they get the money the Irish people in need over there would not get it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving out the question of providing money to organisations in Great Britain if that <Col N="1369" /> is impracticable&mdash;I do not think it ought to be dismissed at once, but, if it were&mdash;is there any means by which, positively, we could help in providing voluntary personnel whom they have not got at this time but whom they could very readily use to help in their work of contacting boys and girls from Ireland who are in trouble and who want some sympathetic assistance to get them back out of trouble?  I suggest the Minister should consider this&mdash;where the Legion of Mary are operating with 20 people, if ten more were added to them; if the city police courts in England, having a certain number of probation officers, would accept voluntary help of four or five additional ones whom we would provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there is a Peace Corps in the United States. They go to Africa.  The Africans have no moral claim on the Americans. Nobody in Africa can ask in the American Congress why such a man in Africa got only 2/6 when another man got 5/-.  We know what would happen if the Government here assumed responsibility for payments to individuals or to individual organisations or to individual areas in Britain.  Some of the areas most talked about have a very high density of Irish people who, in fact, are helping themselves.  There is a great exaggeration by some gentlemen on this issue.  We are not all saints in Dublin, in Belfast or in London but the situation regarding the misbehaviour of the Irish people in England is very largely exaggerated.</P>

      <P>I have dealt with this several times.  There was a vague proposal that we should give some body £200,000.  It was not itemised.  It was not clear where the money would go: who would be the people who would control the building; who would be let into the building; at what cost.  There are many voluntary societies over there operating hostels.  We get letters complaining that those in charge of the voluntary hostels, and so on, are not treating people well.  If it was done on State money, the stack of letters every Deputy in the country would receive would be terrible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from my reply to his question of 4th December, 1962, to which he refers, and to the Deputy's further question of 16th July, 1963, on the same subject, the difficulties in connection with accession by this country to the OECD Convention on Third Party Liability in the field of nuclear energy arise from the possible conflict between some of the provisions of the Convention and our domestic legislation.</P>
      <P>The supplementary Convention of 31st January, 1963, to which the Deputy refers, provides that additional compensation should be paid out of public funds to the victims of nuclear incidents.  It does not, however, remove the obstacles to our ratifying the Convention.</P>
      <P>An additional Protocol to the Convention, which was opened for signature on the 28th January, 1964, stipulates that Accession to the Convention will be accepted only if they are accompanied by ratification or confirmation of the additional Protocol.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the 20th March, 1963, I have been advised by the proprietors of eight flour mills that they had decided to cease milling wheat and surrender their milling licences.  The quotas of these mills totalled 298,378 barrels and represented approximately 9 per cent of the global flour milling quota of 3,313,773 barrels.  I have arranged for an increase of the milling quotas of the remaining flour mills by 7½ per cent to 3,241,551 barrels.  Milling of wheat by the flour mills in the cereal year ended 31st August, 1963, amounted to 2,998,421 barrels.  This represents approximately 90 per cent of the current quotas.</P>
      <P>In referring to wheatmeal milling licences the Deputy presumably has in mind the annual wheatenmeal percentage licences granted under the Agricultural Produce Cereals Acts to the licensed mills.  The total quantity of wheatenmeal authorised to be produced in 1945 was 186,525 barrels and the current authorised production is 172,859 barrels.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to interviews which were held in Letterkenny in August, 1963, for positions as trainee installer in my Department.  The qualifications required for these positions were aptitude for and interest in technical work.  The age limits were 16 to 25 years.  No candidate was exempted from these age limits. The twelve candidates who were appointed as trainee installers as a result of the interviews were regarded as the most suitable for the job.  It would be contrary to practice to furnish information about the qualifications of individual applicants.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that any such practice exists.  May I remind the Deputy that, since the passing of the 1960 Act, it is a condition of the renewal of any licence granted to a hotel, as such, after that Act became law, that the hotel be registered in the Register of Hotels kept by Bord Fáilte Éireann.

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a disadvantage in this debate on the Health Estimate, a disadvantage for which I am not blaming the Minister, in that it is rather out of date now and, because of that, the whole discussion must be of relatively little value. However, for what it is worth, I shall comment on some of the points contained in the Estimate.</P>
      <P>I suppose it is a good thing that discussion on the Department of Health Estimate has tended over recent years to become less explosive and less controversial, the reason largely being that a considerable advance in thinking has been brought about in various ways directly and indirectly.  The end of the whole thing will be, between all the different points of view that are held in this House, that eventually we shall find that the then Minister will have only the physical needs for a good health service such as hospitals, medical and nursing personnel, and so on, but also the legislation, which is about the only thing we need here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take the Minister's first point on Page 3, which shocks me, that is, his reference to the Advisory Committee of the Surgeon-General of the United States Public Health Services on Smoking and Health which, he said, had highlighted the hazards, and so on.  Then he went on to say: &ldquo;I do not wish to labour the point.&rdquo;  May I ask the Minister why he does not wish to labour the point?  The Minister has <Col N="1388" /> evaded the implications of this development in public health for many years now.  I have been asking questions for a long time here, since 1957 or 1958, on cancer and health. At that time, quite obviously we had nothing like the information we now have and it was probably forgivable on the part of the Minister to hold his hand and ask for further proof.  Quite clearly, decisions in regard to remedial action in respect of this vast problem could not be taken in a hurry and could not be taken without mature consideration, nor could they be taken without irrefutable evidence that the decisions to be taken were completely justified.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I understand the need for caution which has existed for some years.  I do not think that anybody with any kind of objective approach to this very serious problem could now say there was any residual doubt in anybody's mind concerning the very definite relationship between smoking and not only lung cancer, which is the one with which I was concerned over the years, but heart disease and acute chronic bronchitis.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now faced with a very serious problem indeed and one which will require from the Government as well as from himself a tremendous amount of courage if they are to deal with it as it should be dealt with by a conscientious Executive.  It is quite clear that the pressure operating against action is formidable, and the method by which one should act is not absolutely clear.  I do not pretend it is clear as to how one should proceed because the Minister has in the past mentioned the danger of creating a sort of cancer hysteria by over-publicising the relationship between cigarette smoking and cancer of the lung, heart disease and bronchitis.</P>
    <P>At the same time, some steps can be taken in order to make it clear to the public that when they smoke cigarettes, they are taking very serious risks with their health, that, in the light of the most recent findings of the Royal College of Physicians of England and of the Advisory Committee of the American Surgeon-General, however difficult they may find it to do something about cigarette <Col N="1389" /> smoking something must be done, if they are responsible adults, responsible parents, if they are conscientious people who do not believe it is right so to abuse the human body as to bring about these likely end results, this dreadful disease of cancer, the very disabling disease, bronchitis or heart disease.</P>
    <P>I know and the Minister knows&mdash;he has probably studied the problem more thoroughly than I have&mdash;that a difficulty exists.  Occasionally the man in the street gets high-powered frights or shocks from the different reports which are published in the Press and I must say that, with the exception of one or two newspapers, the Press have handled the subject with remarkable fairness in so far as they are so dependent on the tobacco companies for their revenue.  I think it got as good coverage from the newspapers as it was possible to get in all the circumstances.  However, that publicity is short-lived.  It is none of the functions of propaganda media such as the newspapers, television and the radio to run campaigns of this kind.  This is the responsibility of the Department of Health.  It is the sole responsibility of the Minister and his Government and it cannot be unloaded on to anybody else.  Once these other people announce the facts as they see them, they have discharged their responsibility to the public.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has discharged his responsibility to the public. Smoking is a very difficult habit to break.  I know because I had to do it myself.  The Minister probably does not know because he is a non-smoker. He is a very lucky man.  From the point of view of the smoker, it is a very hard habit to break because of the compulsion around him all the time not to break this habit.  It appears to be relatively harmless.  It appears to be possible to continue it within moderation.  The average person, far from having any incentive to discontinue or reduce the amount of smoking, finds the compulsion is all in the other direction.</P>
    <P>That is why I say it is a fair charge against the Minister that he made no attempt at all to counter the tremendous <Col N="1390" /> pressure on the average unfortunate man or woman who is trying to stop smoking.  He made no serious attempt to help them.  Because he failed to make a counter attack, to some serious extent, against universal, very costly and extremely clever, advertising carried on by the tobacco companies, I believe he is failing in a moral responsibility.  He has a moral responsibility to the average man or woman who is in a difficult position trying to give up this habit.  He is not being helped by the person upon whom he should be able to depend, the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>The Minister's usual gambit, so long as I have been asking questions, is to accuse me of being a dictator and wanting to impose my will upon everyone else.  Obviously, that is not true. However, the Minister must know that there are many precedents for action by his Department, and by any Department of Health in any civilised and well-ordered society.  They can decide that certain objects or certain substances are dangerous if consumed by the public in one way or another and for that reason the public are not permitted access to those substances, and to the various dangerous drugs of addiction.  No one is permitted to have access to them or to use them, by a decision made by the Minister, and the Minister is not a dictator because he makes that decision.  Whatever Minister he may be, he is merely doing his job, the job he is paid to do.  He is telling the people: &ldquo;I know more about this.  It is an insidious habit.  It is a dangerous drug.  If you start taking it, you will find it difficult to stop. While it may look as if I am interfering with your authority as an adult to decide for yourself, I believe that in the public interest you may not have access to this particular drug.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can go so far as to attempt to stop cigarette smoking.  That would never succeed, but he could make a serious contribution by curtailing the advertisements in the usual propaganda media, the newspapers, television and radio. Those advertisements are misleading in many ways, but they are misleading basically because they conceal from <Col N="1391" /> the consumer, or the prospective consumer, the fact that what they are trying to sell is a dangerous substance, a substance which could cause one of three diseases, lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, or coronary heart disease. All three are, in their own way, fatal diseases.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the tobacco companies to take any altruistic interest in public health matters.  That is not their business.  Their business is selling cigarettes.  It is the Minister's business and his responsibility&mdash;and I keep harping on this because it is important&mdash;a moral responsibility which he cannot escape.  I do not think he has taken any serious, significant, steps to counter the tremendous flood of propaganda in regard to cigarette smoking.  The only positive step he has taken is the propaganda to children in schools.  That is better than nothing.  It is better to have it than not to have it.</P>
    <P>I do not follow the reasoning that says: &ldquo;Let us not bother about the adults.  They are hopeless.  Let us look to the children.&rdquo;  I do not agree with that even in theory, but let us say there is a case for looking to the child and seeing he does not become an adult smoker.  One of the attractions of smoking for young children is that it is a prestige symbol.  Most of us know that when you first smoke it is horrible.  The first two or three cigarettes are most unpleasant, but to young people, smoking is a sort of status symbol in regard to having grown up.  It seems to me that so long as adults continue to smoke, particularly on television and in public generally, it is very difficult to expect children to take advice which adults do not appear to be able to take themselves.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it is wrong for a parent to go to a child and say: &ldquo;Do not do this; it is a bad habit,&rdquo; with a cigarette in his hand.  The paradox is obvious.  Obviously the proposition must appear to the child: &ldquo;If it does not do him any harm, why should it do me any harm?  If it is bad for me, why does he do it?&rdquo; The best argument to use to the child <Col N="1392" /> is: &ldquo;We are adults and we are continually telling children we know better than you.  We do not smoke because it is bad or dangerous, and for that reason you should not smoke.&rdquo;  The effect is completely vitiated if the person lecturing to others about smoking has a cigarette in his hand.</P>
    <P>The present programme, while it is better than nothing, is not good enough.  The Minister has said he cannot possibly compete against the tobacco companies' advertisements because of the cost.  He certainly cannot, and he would be foolish to do so, but he has an alternative.  He has the alternative that he can prevent the appearance of advertising on television, radio and newspapers.  He has done that in regard to the sale of all sorts of dangerous drugs.  So far as I know, no Irish newspaper is allowed to take advertisements for contraceptives, and for various other things which are prohibited by the Minister because they are not in accordance with the wishes of the community, or whatever it may be.  There is no doubt that he can take that power.  If he has not that power there is nothing to stop the House taking the power &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to do that, but I should prefer the Minister for Health to do it because that would carry more prestige and influence. However, I hope I shall get an opportunity of doing that.  If the House votes against it, naturally I shall accept the ruling of the House, but it is a matter which should be considered by the House.  If the Minister would take on that responsibility, it would be very much more valuable than if I do so, but I shall be glad to do it.  If the Minister feels he cannot, he can at least tell the tobacco companies that they must carry in their advertisements&mdash;I <Col N="1393" /> know this sounds a bit outrageous or outlandish but it is a clearly proven fact&mdash;a notice that what they are selling contains a dangerous substance which could lead to various forms of ill health.  In that way the Minister would have an advertising campaign which would not cost him a penny. The cigarette companies would be paying for it.  If the tobacco companies do not want to carry that truthful information in their advertising material, that merely corroborates what I have suggested, that the tobacco companies are deliberately concealing that fact from the public by the misleading type of advertising in which they indulge.</P>
      <P>The Minister should, if he is not doing anything about advertising, try to see to it that the advertising material on television, radio and in the newspapers should not be directed towards the young people.  For quite a while the people concerned with alcohol were doing this and it was quite disgusting, with all the hypocrites that there are involved in the liquor business, to see them appealing to the youngsters.  For some time now the same approach has been made in relation to cigarette smoking.  The Minister should lay it down that no attempt will be made by the cigarette companies to direct their advertising to the young people in an effort to make young people smoke. There used to be advertisements of young people gathered around smoking cigarettes and the appeal to them was that they were adult and grown up when they did so.  The Minister should stop that type of advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Minister is faced with the problem of where to get a substitute for the revenue from tobacco if he does seriously curtail the smoking of cigarettes.  The Minister for Finance would be seriously concerned about that and it is a practical consideration. It might help if the Minister set up one of his many commissions to see how much the permitting of unlimited cigarette smoking to continue costs the Minister for Finance in lost man hours. The figures which I recently got in relation to the death rate from lung cancer show that it increased from 298 in 1950 to 648 in 1960, 682 in 1961 and 697 in 1962.  I think the figures in <Col N="1394" /> relation to coronary disease rose from 209 in 1950 to 4,000 in 1960, 4,200 in 1961 and 4,500 in 1962.</P>
    <P>We can ignore the 1950 figures and I shall go along with the Minister in saying that it was a low figure but one reason for that may be that diagnostic methods were not as good then as they are now.  However, the 1962 figures, when considered with other recent figures tell us that the rates of heart disease and lung cancer have increased, <i>pari passu</i> with cigarette smoking, very much over recent years.  To me that means that we have a very much increased preventable death rate because presumably those people need not have died.  They were relatively young people, highly skilled in technological matters but this disease is the great leveller.  Those people have been prematurely denied to us and to society and that is an economic consideration if the Minister wishes to think of it as such.</P>
    <P>The most striking of our figures is the one which has been given in relation to man hours lost due to chronic bronchitis.  That affects the public in a very definite way and it also affects the Exchequer.  Not only are man hours lost due to this disease but there has to be some contribution from the Department of Social Welfare to pay these people while they are out of work.  I know that cigarette smoking is not the sole cause of this disease but to the extent that it is the cause of it the Minister has a serious responsibility to deal with it.  A case could well be made out that even if the Minister is not concerned with the morality of the situation he must be concerned with the economics of it.  The case could well be made that the Minister for Finance would not lose as much money as he thinks he would if he took some serious steps to help these unfortunate people in their attempts to stop smoking.</P>
    <P>I am amused and amazed at the Minister's suggestion that it is a form of dictatorship on my part to insist on a certain line being taken by the Department of Health because the Minister thinks it is in the public interest.  The Minister is, as we all <Col N="1395" /> know, at present engaged in the Supreme Court at considerable cost to the public in relation to the fluoridation case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely you do not suggest that I am responsible for the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is surely responsible for the policy which dictates that, if the appeal is won, we are all going to have fluoride in our drinking water.  I think the medical case for the fluoridation of water supplies is relatively equivocal so the Minister is on poor ground in his reference to my dictatorial intentions in regard to cigarette smoking.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that there is a continued drop in the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis and I should like to ask the Minister if he thinks it is worth while going on with the mass radiography scheme.  I had intended to find out how much it cost to find a single case of active consumption. This is a relatively big organisation and, while I never had any great enthusiasm for it from a strictly medical point of view, I felt it a good thing to introduce it when such a good case could be made for it.  I wonder if it is desirable that it should still be carried on at the present rate.  Is it a very expensive thing to find an active case of tuberculosis through the mass radiography service?  As the Minister knows, one of the things that keeps people away, that they fear, is that they have got the disease; or is it the reverse of fishing in troubled waters?  Is it that you will get people who are happy and pretty sure they are free of it attending and that the people who fear they are ill are staying away?  Is it just a question of whether the Minister feels it is worth carrying on along these lines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very glad to see that the rate of infant mortality is being reduced. However, the figures are still a bit <Col N="1396" /> high as compared with other countries, but the fact that they are being reduced is something.  Again, my view on this is so well known as not to need repetition.  When eventually somebody has the courage to introduce the Minister's excellent scheme for dealing with infant mortality, and indeed mortality among youth in general, we shall see the end of it.  In relation to poliomyelitis, could I ask the Minister if he is quite happy about the oral administration of protective vaccine?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Not so happy, but I am accepting the best advice available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all the Minister can do.  I hope the oral vaccine is as safe as MRC tell us it is because one of the difficult things for parents is the tremendous number of injections the unfortunate child is asked to have. If we could reduce the number for such things as mumps, measles, diphtheria and smallpox, the better it would be for everyone.</P>
      <P>Of the cases that occurred of children who died from poliomyelitis, to what extent were these cases vaccinated? Were there any cases among people who had the full course or part of the course, and would the Minister tell us whether any of the people who died had the full course?  Could I also ask the Minister if he is in a position to say yet in what way he hopes to carry out this general scheme of anti-polio vaccination?  Is it to be on the lines of the existing scheme, free to certain groups, or is there to be a scheme free to all sections?</P>
      <P>In regard to mental illness, the problem is, as the Minister quite rightly says, a vast one.  It is a great thing that he is taking such an interest in it.  The extraordinary situation over the years, in all countries and not just here, is the indifference with which this reality in every society has been treated by every section of the community.  The public have been terrified by mental illness and people who ought to know better, the medical profession, have been relatively indifferent to mental illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I went through medicine, I <Col N="1397" /> think we had half a dozen optional lectures and a very short course. Certainly it was a very limited course in mental illness, and as a result I honestly admit I knew little more than the average layman.  I think that is a shocking thing.  It is wrong that Dublin University, for instance, have no course in mental diseases, that the courses which are being initiated are relatively new.  It is a tribute to University College that they have established a course in mental illness and try to create an interest in it and, at the same time, endeavour to build up the personnel needed to encourage young medical people to go into mental diseases, to upgrade the status of mental diseases in the curriculum.</P>
    <P>Certainly, in my time, the most neglected aspects of medical training were mental illness and, I suppose, tuberculosis.  The Minister has made a significant contribution, a significant advance in relation to legislation on mental diseases.  As far as legislation is concerned, it is the obverse of what happens in general medicine.  In the general medical services, we have the hospitals, the nurses, the doctors and the equipment but not the legislation: in the mental disease field the hospitals and the staffs are very short but the legislation is good.  At least, we have an important part of the armament needed in order to deal with this frightfully complicated problem.</P>
    <P>There was a time when I have no doubt I would have been happy to dogmatise on what the Minister should do in relation to mental illnesses but now that I realise I have a very limited practical knowledge, I am not at all sure.  In fact, all I know is that it is a frightfully complicated business and I think the Minister is making progress to deal with it and that I should not tell him how to carry on.  When he said &ldquo;next year&rdquo;, I hope he meant this year in relation to when the Commission is likely to propose what is the right line he should follow in his approach to mental disease.  There is a wonderful change taking place in chemo-therapeutic methods of all kinds.  They have been greatly improved but there is very much more <Col N="1398" /> that can be done for the mentally ill than was done in the past.</P>
    <P>This, in turn, has repercussions in that the public are no longer frightened of the disease as they were in the past, no longer ashamed of the mentally ill. Being treated for mental illness has come almost to the level of getting an appendix out or of being treated for typhoid, though, of course, mental illness is less serious than typhoid.  I agree with the legislation aimed at encouraging the idea of the voluntary patient.  It is very much better than the compulsion in the past to have a development towards a person coming for treatment and, within reason, being able to get up and walk out as soon as he feels better.</P>
    <P>This has done two things.  In the first place, it has opened the doors of the mental hospitals which had been shut like prisons in the past.  Secondly, it is becoming more and more necessary that the standard of treatment&mdash; not only the medical treatment but the physical care of the patients in the institution&mdash;shall be very good.  The quality of the food served, the quality of the nursing, the quality of accommodation&mdash;all must be good.  Clearly, it is like the case of a bad hotel, the patient will go once but will not go back the second time.  This business of letting a person go to see what treatment in a mental hospital is like has a dual function.  If the medical and nursing staff are satisfactory and if the general conditions are good, the patient will return if he has a relapse.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is to produce, as he has done, this kind of progressive legislation, he must very urgently do something about the general quality of the building as well as increasing the personnel. The difficulty, of course, at the moment is that the staffs are terribly overworked and simply cannot give as much care to the patients as they would like.  The ratio of doctors to patient is still far too high.</P>
    <P>The serious point to be dealt with &mdash;and we will have to wait for the Commission on this&mdash;is whether the Minister will need as many hospitals as he thinks he will need.  There is a general feeling to try to keep these <Col N="1399" /> people out of hospital if at all possible. First of all, empty the mental hospitals of the old senile dementeds put in there in the past&mdash;people not really insane, who could be more properly looked after in the county homes or the good type of old people's institution. Then try to see how many of these people could be treated as outpatients. That would save the Minister a tremendous amount of money. Instead of embarking on a very expensive hospital building and reconstruction programme, he might find that what he really needs is a wide extension of the clinic facilities he has already provided for in his legislation and which have developed to some extent over the past ten years in various areas.</P>
    <P>This is a good development.  The general feeling among psychiatrists and such people has been to keep them out of hospital, if possible, and to try to get them at the clinics as outpatients.  That has obvious advantages. The cost of running a hospital is one thing; leaving the person with his family is another.  This question of mixing them in with the general hospital patient gives them the feeling that they are just another ill patient, not an exceptional patient, and that there is no odium attached to being mentally ill.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is up against is the provision of considerably extended clinic facilities.  <i>Prima facie</i> it appears to me there is a great need for more accommodation.  But I do not know whether a survey would show that that problem is quite as serious as we think.  I sympathise with the Minister in his reference to the county homes.  Whoever built them appears to have built the mental hospital and the prisons, because there is very little difference between the three.  I do not know how we could do anything about them with their cut stone granite walls about five feet thick.  If I had my way, I think I should use a bulldozer on them.  I do not know how the Minister is going to make inexpensively any useful changes in the mental hospitals. Because of the appallingly tiny windows <Col N="1400" /> and their massive granite structure, I do not think they will ever look anything else except what they were intended to be&mdash;prisons of a kind.</P>
    <P>This is a problem which has so many facets to it that it requires the advice of a competent commission.  We shall all look forward to the advice of that commission.  As far as I can see, the problem is not really one of hospitals.  It must be dealt with before these people get to the hospitals.  The real problems are the stresses that create these mentally ill persons, and these are social and domestic problems. There is the problem of what to do with them when they leave hospital in order to prevent relapses.  If they go back to the conditions which created the initial illness, the Minister will have them back in hospital in a relatively short time.</P>
    <P>The Minister's problem is not in the remotest way a building problem.  It is a very much bigger problem.  I believe it is the biggest social problem anybody could be confronted with.  If the Minister is to attack this problem seriously and deal with the post-hospital care of these people, the number of social workers needs to be multiplied by dozens in order to help keep these people out of hospital.  That means we must stop people going into hospital and prevent them coming back.  It is there the greatest expenditure will be.  Occupational therapy may be a very valuable occupation&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but I think training for alternative trades would probably be wiser than simply making them something which sometimes takes a long time to make and is of very little intrinsic value when you have made it.</P>
    <P>On the whole, this question of the rehabilitation of the disabled person is again a very serious problem.  Where one has 60,000 unemployed people, healthy, able-bodied people, obviously you will not get employers looking forward to employing a one-armed man, a blind man, a person mentally slightly unstaple or liable to get epileptic fits.  You will have difficulties so far as the trade union movement are concerned.  They have this responsibility to find work for their able-bodied <Col N="1401" /> people.  How you are going to have a rehabilitation service that really works, I do not know, unless you have a society in which there is full employment. That, again, is a social problem.</P>
    <P>There is one small point which I wonder if the Minister would look into.  A temporary civil servant, who might be asked to have mental or psychiatric care, has only a limited period of leave for ill health.  There are probably administrative reasons for it, but it is not a good thing.  The Minister can take it that, medically, it is a bad thing that a doctor should be faced with a patient who tells him: &ldquo;I do not know if I can come again because I have exhausted my ill-health leave period.&rdquo;  It is not a simple problem, and I cannot offer a simple remedy. The Minister might consider treating temporary civil servants on the very generous basis which, to my knowledge, the permanent civil servant is treated in regard to ill health.  He may be treated in that way at present, but I understand he is not.  From the doctor's point of view it is an undesirable dilemma to have the patient telling him: &ldquo;I must get back to work because my ill-health period has expired.&rdquo;  Even if the person could be allowed to get whatever treatment he needed and not be paid but have his job kept open for him, it would be of tremendous help to the patient in any illness, and particularly in mental illness where depression has become an important factor in causing the illness.</P>
    <P>The problem of the mentally handicapped child is the saddest problem. <i>Prima facie</i> the Minister's problem appears to be beds.  I think his marginal increase from 2,741 to 2,897 is no achievement if he is really interested in making progress.  If he really wants to provide beds for these children, he should make much more energetic efforts.  The difficulty again is that there is a difference of opinion, apparently, on medical grounds as to whether mental deficients should be treated at home or go to a clinic; whether the better thing is to increase the number of clinics.  If that is the answer&mdash;I do not pretend to know&mdash;it is a saving for the Minister.  Listening to <Col N="1402" /> people talking about this, they give one the impression that above all it is important that the person, whether child or adult, should be kept in the home environment and allowed to go once, twice or three times a week to a clinic, which would be staffed by doctors and nurses, psychiatric workers and so on.  That is a healthier way of approaching the problem than locking these children in institutions.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the answer is but it would be a great help, from the Minister's point of view, if it were found that to increase the number of clinics in the community answered the problem to a very considerable extent because that would reduce very much the number of beds the Minister might have to provide.  The great tragedy with children who are mentally deficient&mdash;and they can vary from one or two or three grades&mdash;is that the parent has to face the inevitability of the time when he or she will no longer be there.  What happens to the child?  Must it go to an institution?  I hope the Commission which is considering this whole problem will provide a solution as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent we may talk about the general pattern of our health services.  Naturally, it seems to me that in order to get maximum efficiency, one must provide the prerequisites of a health service, the doctors, nurses, hospitals, clinics, dispensaries and so on, as well as legislation.  It is the legislation we lack at the moment.  Since there is a Dáil Committee sitting on this whole question, I suppose we could leave aside the general principle under which the services should be organised for the time being.  My views are so well known that I suppose I do not have to reiterate them &mdash;that the 1947 Health Act was the best piece of legislation that we have ever put through this House and that the best thing in it was the mother and child scheme.  I hope the Minister will re-introduce it in the future. He would certainly have all my support. Is there any hope of putting it through the House, I wonder?</P>
    <P>This may invade the sphere of the <Col N="1403" /> Minister's responsibilities but I wonder would he even briefly think about it.  He speaks of the difficulty of getting general voluntary hospitals to share facilities but is there anything he can do about the present medical curriculum in the universities? May he even suggest&mdash;I know he cannot interfere&mdash;to those who care for our medical curriculum in the medical schools that they should take a second hard look at the medical training for doctors in the universities.  To me it seems the present position is absolutely invidious from the point of view of the unfortunate youngster who wants to go through medicine.  The course becomes longer and longer through having additions added at one end while nothing is taken away at the other.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister's powers are very limited in this respect but could he go to the extent of suggesting to these people that they should consider the whole question of medical education and see to what extent they could reconsider the course as it is at present and do something about, say, the two years of anatomy.  That, to me, seems crazy when there is such need for physiology and need to take account of other changes in chemo-therapeutic medicine and the advanced means of acquiring knowledge of chemistry, physics and other subjects which are relatively lightly treated compared with subjects like botany and zoology which I think are over-accentuated.  I know the Minister is in a particularly delicate position in this matter but I think somebody should do something about it in the interests of medicine generally and of trying to streamline the course and get a more accomplished and efficient doctor at the end of it.  One of the difficulties here has been the fact, as the Minister says, that the authorities of the voluntary general hospitals are reluctant to share facilities.  There has been growing up a multiplicity of tiny hospitals doing reasonably good work but virtually ignoring the fact that specialisation has become absolutely essential, a specialist being a person who knows <Col N="1404" /> more and more about less and less. That is the old aphorism but at the same time specialisation is absolutely inevitable.  Where one has a multiplicity of relatively small hospitals, you will have all the doctors carrying out practically every operation from removing an in-growing toe-nail to dealing with a brain tumour and that is bad for medicine and for the doctors themselves.</P>
    <P>Where there is a very highly-skilled surgeon, he should be in a hospital where he will get as much of his type of specialised work as there is in the country.  That is a general trend in other countries but is it taking place to any substantial extent in Ireland?  The only serious specialisation I know of is in brain surgery, genito-urinary work and in relation to anaesthetics which have certainly progressed in recent years.  I consider there has been no serious attempt to streamline the working of the hospitals but there is no reason why the volume of work which these men do should drop. It would merely mean that they would do more of their own particular speciality and do it better.  It is like tying a bootlace: the more frequently you do it the better you become at it. The same applies to an intricate operation. In the case of a team of surgeons, no matter how technically skilled they may be I think it is wrong for them to carry out complicated operations very infrequently, wrong from the patients' point of view, because I believe the essence of efficiency in this case is team work, working together, and in that way becoming so good at the operation that a patient is at minimum risk.  That is the only thing that matters.</P>
    <P>In that regard, as a specific proposal to the Minister, is there anything he can do regarding the establishment of an accident service in our cities?  One reads every weekend the appalling news of road crashes and one notes the increase in the number of cars on the road and the increase in accidents of one kind or another.  We are not geared, so far as I know, in our hospitals to deal with this question of an emergency accident service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> I do not like asking the Minister to talk sense to a bag of cats&mdash;and I do not mean that disrespectfully to the people concerned&mdash;but there are tremendous vested interests concerned. The increase in motor accidents, which will continue, is very serious.  We should have special centres staffed by people of the highest possible calibre. The general rule is to have the main accident centre where you have consultant opinion and then satellite centres which can carry out any major or minor operation and then smaller subsidiary centres where minor work is carried out.</P>
    <P>The important thing about an accident is that a vital decision may have to be taken in a hurry.  Sometimes terribly important decisions have to be taken on the spot which should not be left to anyone but the highest level consultant.  The problem is how to get such a person to stay on duty from Friday to Sunday morning.  Somehow, it should be done.  It is wrong that a registrar or a house surgeon or a house physician should have to take one of these very serious decisions. With the best will in the world, he has not the training to do it.</P>
    <P>Maybe the Minister might have the temerity to suggest to these consultants that they should do something about providing some form of really high-level accident service.  In the public interest, some steps should be taken to establish some form of efficient accident service in the country.  This, obviously, must be taken together with the organisation of an ambulance service.</P>
    <P>I have heard complaints about the ambulance service.  I do not know whether they are as bad as people say they are.  On the whole, I never had any trouble with them.  In view of the many appalling accidents now taking place, is the Minister satisfied that the type of ambulance service which he has, based on the average local health authority, is sufficient for the needs of a serious accident where a couple of people are badly knocked out?  Are the people who man the ambulance competent for the work?  Would the Minister consider that he should try to establish some kind of ambulance <Col N="1406" /> service, based on a regional service, staffed perhaps by lay nursing and medical personnel&mdash;I do not know&mdash; who would be able to do the right thing at the time of a bad accident case?  You can kill somebody by doing the wrong thing.  If you lift a person with a broken back you can give him paralysis of the lower limbs and there are very much more serious things than that.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see some progress being made in regard to the county homes.  They were the worst things I was aware of in our general service.  In fairness to the Department of Health, it should be said that, generally speaking, the hospital section of the county home was reasonably satisfactory. As far as I know, the Department had to pay a certain amount of the cost.</P>
    <P>My recollection of Mountmellick, unless I am mistaken, is that it was the second worst.  It had one bath with verdigris on the bottom and one cold water tap.  Longford was the worst, with an open sewer running across the yard.  I am glad to see that they are doing something in a number of places about the county homes.  Longford is not mentioned.  Has the work been completed there or is it that they have not decided to do anything yet about it?</P>
    <P>A tremendous amount needs to be done in regard to the county homes. It seems to me to be the test of a civilised society how one treats the aged.  Anybody who is in any way complacent about our society here should go to Sweden to see the places there where the old people live.  They are the most lovely hotels, effectively, of the highest quality, attached to hospitals and old people are living there with dignity.  They are very happy to go into these old people's homes.  Their relations come to see them.</P>
    <P>It is no good to say now that you should keep the old people in the home.  The Minister is a great believer in that and so am I but there are occasions when they cannot have any real comfort or the peace or isolation that they want.  It is an evasion of our responsibility if we do not speed up <Col N="1407" /> the provision of adequate accommodation for our old people.  One of the things that shocked me was the dreadful attitude to the old people.  Their clothes were dreadful but, leaving that aside, there is the point mentioned by Deputy Tully of breaking up the family&mdash;the wife going in one direction, the husband in another direction and sometimes the children in a third direction.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to know, when dealing with all these problems, whether the provision of adequate accommodation for old people should not be the first responsibility of any community, because their life span is short.  I do not know if the Minister has visited many of these places.  Unless they have changed very much since my time, most of these places are desperately cheerless&mdash;an old barrack-type building with inadequate heating, undecorated, very sparse and very spartan bedrooms.  The cooking facilities are often terrible.  I remember the Longford home particularly, where there was a big boiler into which everything was poured.  The unfortunate nuns who were trying to run the place were working under the most primitive conditions. Everybody here praises the various Orders who look after the county homes and say they are doing wonderful work.  They are doing wonderful work but there is no reason why they should be crucified doing it. It is like the teachers in the schools. I do not see why the nuns should be asked to work under substandard conditions.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister seems to be making some progress in regard to the provision of more county homes and I know that he is restricted by the interest shown by the local authorities which sometimes is pathetically inadequate. Their interest in their responsibility to old people is sometimes pathetically limp.  Again it comes to the question of who is to pay, a question of the rates and of all that.  As far as I can see, that is the basis of the Minister's difficulties.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister is going to do about the recruitment of <Col N="1408" /> dentists and doctors.  The attraction away from the country is tremendous. The British, who are drawing away our people by the salaries they pay, are at the moment deeply concerned about what they call their own &ldquo;brain drain&rdquo; so that it is very difficult to know what the solution to the problem is going to be.</P>
    <P>While it is a good idea to get young people to go into our various services, it is equally good to encourage them to travel and then to come back.  That is where the Minister must use his strongest incentives, to try to make it worthwhile for these people to come back into our services when they have been away for a while and have gleaned useful information which can be of advantage to our people when they find employment in our various hospitals and in the general health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opening remarks on this Estimate, I should like to refer to the disabled persons' allowance.  The disabled persons' allowance was created for the purpose of providing an allowance for those unable to work.  I take it that the original intention was to make it freely available, so far as it was possible to those entitled to it, those people who were unable to work and who were never likely to be able to work.  I find that in general the attitude of local authorities, who are the assessors as to whether a person is or is not entitled to this allowance, is to implement the Act in somewhat the same way as the Old Age Pensions Act is implemented, in that they have a very rigid means test as to whether it is payable or not.  I do not think that was the original intention of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows my views on the 1952 Health Act, on the previous Acts, and on the amendments thereto. I believe this was one of the things which was of considerable benefit to the public as a whole.  I want to put to the Minister that the ordinary person who is entitled to the disabled persons' allowance and is living at home is usually unable to do anything and finds that he is a burden on the home.  It seems to me that such a <Col N="1409" /> person who is living on a farm of 25, 30 or even 40 acres, or even has relations who are in a small way in business, should not be disqualified from getting this allowance.  There is a far too rigid interpretation of the means test.</P>
    <P>To take the other angle, if the relations feel that they could no longer keep the disabled person in the house, it means that he will have to go into an institution.  Recently in a reply to a question here, the Minister stated the expenses of maintaining a person in an institution and showed that even in rural Ireland the expense was as high as £8 a week.  Surely there is no sense in turning down persons over 16 years of age, when they can be given a £1 a week, maintained in their own home, happy and content and feeling that they are contributing to the house and that at least they have some small means of their own, and forcing them into an institution, which is what is happening.</P>
    <P>I am not putting the blame on the Minister for this.  I am just pointing out that it is the administration of the Act which is at fault.  I do not think it is peculiar to my own constituency but is common throughout the country.  It would be all right if the Minister indicated to the local authorities that they should not rigidly adhere to the means test.  It would be of benefit not only to the country's finances but it would also represent a saving for local administration.</P>
    <P>Another matter about which I want to speak is in relation to the retarded child.  I spoke on this subject the other day on the Estimate for the Department of Education.  As I know the position, mentally retarded children are divided into three categories.  The first is the child who is unable to do anything for himself and who must be maintained, looked after and nursed constantly.  This type of child is nearly always found in big families. Then there is the child who is able to learn a certain amount, not very much, but who is capable of being educated to the extent that at some period in his life he will be able to contribute something towards the nation's production and welfare and to his own wellbeing.  Then there is the third <Col N="1410" /> type of child who under special provision is able to develop and carry on the same as ordinary children.  I have seen proof of that in children I have seen at the Stewart Institute and at the St. John of God special school and in other places.</P>
    <P>The second two categories are not the immediate concern of the Minister for Health and are not under his jurisdiction.  The first type of child, however, is incapable of doing anything and needs to be maintained.  It is really impossible to divorce the two categories, one from the other.  As the Minister probably knows&mdash;he may dispute my figures which may not be absolutely accurate&mdash;we have in the 26 Counties some 24,000 children who are mentally retarded.  This includes all categories from beginning to end. As I said, the greater number of those are not the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  I do not think there is any shame in having that number of retarded children here.  The rate in Germany is tremendously high; in the United Kingdom, it is very high, and I do not think our proportion per population is actually as high as in other countries.  As far as my information goes, we are at the moment able to maintain fewer than 3,000 in our institutions or about ten per cent of the total.</P>
    <P>I heard with interest the other day that the Department had taken over Woodlands in Galway which would be capable of maintaining perhaps another 300 or 400 children.  We shall hope for the best anyway.  If the Department of Health have not taken it over someone has, the Department of Health having facilitated and helped that someone.  I take it that whatever relief can be given in that area will be confined to the particular area in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Now, time is passing, time does not wait for these unfortunate children any more than time waits for any man. I hold a medical qualification and, because of that, I am perhaps approached rather more frequently than the average public representative and I know that there is a lengthy waiting list in the case of the Sisters of Charity, the St. John of God, the Stewart <Col N="1411" /> Institute, and so on.  I was told recently by the head of one of these institutions that he is constantly rung up by doctors asking &ldquo;For pity's sake, can you take such-and-such a child in because the parents are absolutely driven distracted?&rdquo; With the best will in the world, the answer has to be &ldquo;No,&rdquo; because there is no accommodation.</P>
    <P>There is a change for the better now in the incidence of tuberculosis and many of the institutions are closing down or being used for some other purpose.  If the Minister could dovetail these institutions into a scheme for the purpose of accommodating these children who are incapable of ever doing anything, who have to be hospitalised, taken off their parents' hands, so that they can be looked after by those competent to look after them, by those who devote their lives to this very beneficial and humanitarian work, some progress could be made. The best approach would be to have an institution covering every three or four counties.  If the Minister were able to siphon off certain groups from existing institutions, institutions in which there are educational experts, that would leave a good deal more room for other cases.</P>
    <P>I notice from the Minister's statement that something on these lines has been done in one of the mental institutions.  An area has been cordoned off where children can be taken. The numbers of these children are increasing.  Very often one finds as many as two in one big family; one even finds two different types in the one family, one capable of being educated and the other not.</P>
    <P>The problem is paramount and it ought to be approached at a national level.  The Minister will tell me that he has set up a Commission.  I have taken some interest in this subject.  I have discussed it with a great many people who are actively concerned. They have asked me to raise the matter.  I should have done so in any case, as I am particularly interested in the subject.  People do not want the problem left in abeyance until the Commission reports.  It may be that the Commission is manned by people <Col N="1412" /> who are well competent to make findings, but time is passing.  I think the Minister said the report of the Commission is expected next year.  If it is anything like the report of the Commission set up in relation to education, I do not know that it will advance us very far along the line of doing something practical.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that aspect.</P>
    <P>I was very anxious that Newcastle in County Wicklow should be used to cope with this problem.  I gather it is to be used for another purpose because of the overcrowding in mental institutions in Dublin.  The Minister could look towards the big ancestral homes that are being sold all over the country.  I would prefer to see these turned into institutions catering for retarded children rather than see them falling into the hands of aliens.  Many of these would be admirably suitable for development as institutions.</P>
    <P>I should also like to remind the Minister that the inflow into institutions is continuous while the outflow is almost static.  The Minister is as good an expert on gravity as I am and he knows that inflow without outflow invariably leads to difficulties.  Very often children improve sufficiently to be removed from institutional treatment, after a good deal of tuition, and so forth, and put to useful work; at the same time, they are not fit to be removed out of the environment with which they are familiar and sent back to their original environment.  Indeed, that could lead to a relapse into their original condition.  I would suggest&mdash; perhaps it could be done by private enterprise&mdash;that they could be placed somewhere where there is land attached, land on which they could work under supervision, being minded by some of the experts whom they have grown to love and respect in the institutions.  Recently I had the experience of seeing a band manned by retarded children.  The way they watched the St. John of God Brother who was in control, the devoted attention they paid to his orders, showed they were dependent on him utterly and completely; it also showed that they will progress and prosper under such conditions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> The Minister mentioned private institutions and the encouragement, <i>et cetera,</i> he gives to their efforts.  We are trying at the moment to do something at both ends of Wexford in regard to this problem and the question arises as to whether it will be possible to obtain the required personnel.  I do not think we have sufficient personnel to expand. I believe that if some philanthropist came along with a couple of million for the purpose of expanding our institutions for retarded children, we would be faced with a problem from the point of view of personnel.  The problem might not be of such great magnitude from the educational angle but, from the medical angle, I do not believe we would have the staff.</P>
    <P>When it comes to replying, would the Minister indicate if there are any plans for training personnel?  If I were to give him a couple of million tomorrow, would he be able to service these institutions?  It is generally argued that a good matron will be able to procure the staff she requires.  I am doubtful if the staff is there.  We seem to be very backward in this matter. That may be due to force of circumstances, and so on.  The subject has agitated the minds of the people only in comparatively recent years.  There has been a good deal of evolution with regard to the treatment of mental cases and I think any available staff are very rapidly absorbed.  Perhaps the Minister would give us a detailed reply on the subject of retarded children, the views he has on the matter, and the plans he has.  I can assure the Minister the official record will be read with the widest interest by an increasing number of people in every part of the country.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the difficulties into which we seem to be running in regard to staff.  Those difficulties are no different from those encountered elsewhere. The position in England at the moment is, I understand, that they cannot get a European doctor to act as house surgeon in a hospital.  They must rely entirely on Asiatics, Africans, and so on.  That, of course, is nobody's fault.  It is the evolution of the times. Previously it was easy to get plenty of people to study medicine.  It was considered <Col N="1414" /> a good and honourable profession but not a very lucrative one. Now people are not prepared to go into professions such as the medical profession and work hard by day and by night while perhaps, a brother or other relation in business by taking up the telephone can make a few hundred pounds overnight.</P>
    <P>It will become increasingly difficult to get people to enter not only the medical profession but the nursing profession. We have a particular problem in this country in that as the situation becomes more difficult in the United Kingdom and in America our trained personnel can be siphoned off to those countries and to the English-speaking world as a whole.  In fact, many of our personnel are even going to Africa and places like that where they can be offered better terms than at home.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the answer to the problem is.  I have not consulted anyone who would be in a position to know whether we are running down in personnel in our medical colleges here or not but I do know we are running down in the supply of medical personnel who are prepared to stay here and work here. Some action will have to be taken by the State.  I am not a person as the Minister knows, who is keen on advocating that the State should take over any more functions than it is absolutely necessary for them to assume but if our young doctors are going to pack their bags and clear out as soon as they qualify because they can get a better living in the United States or elsewhere, we shall find ourselves without sufficient doctors here. Perhaps the Minister would consult with the Irish Medical Association or the Hospital Doctors Association or other medical associations in this country to see if some kind of subsidy could be granted in order to encourage more people to enter and qualify in the profession, making it a stipulation of the State subvention that will be given for that purpose that the person who takes advantage of it will have to practise for a certain time in this country.  Having been a doctor both in Ireland and in England &mdash;this applies to anybody who has worked in this country for a certain <Col N="1415" /> period as a doctor and has worked in England as well&mdash;I think I can say that if a person gets an opportunity of making a choice he will come back and work here every time.  If they were anchored here in the way I have suggested, we might not lose personnel as heavily as heretofore.</P>
    <P>The nurses' problem is a difficult one also in that they have to compete with the high scales of pay of other countries, the many opportunities that present themselves there, the many different varieties of nursing, the degrees of specialisation, shorter hours and better conditions.  Nurses, who I always think give the most devoted service, do not work trade union hours.  The natural tendency is that when they see people alongside them spending five or six hours in an office and pushing off to enjoy themselves for the evening, they do not see why they should have to stay in the hospital.  I have no immediate answer to this serious problem except to suggest that as in the case of the doctors some assistance by way of subvention from the State might be granted for training on the understanding that the nurses who would be turned out in these institutions would stay here.  It is much dearer for a student nurse to train in Ireland than it is anywhere else.  It is very hard to get into the nursing institutions here. Many people who are not able to pay the fees are inclined to go away.  If they go away, they are lost to us and they do not come back.  Therefore, those who are in training here we ought to hold as best we can.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred briefly to the question of smoking.  A new feature has presented itself in regard to smoking. I think we can take it that the problem is a cigarette problem.  A greater number of people tend to smoke cigarettes nowadays than they did before.  We very seldom see people with the old familiar pipe as we did in the past.  I am one of those who have always felt we must not be hysterical over smoking.  It alone is not responsible for lung cancer.  It is certainly a contributory cause.  I do not know anybody who claims to know the cause except that it is an overgrowth of tissue <Col N="1416" /> induced by irritation in some form or another.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to the view, which I have expressed on previous occasions in the House, that another very important contributory cause of cancer is oil fumes and nobody seems to be particularly concerned with trying to control oil fumes in any way.  The statistics in the Royal Navy go to show that there was a tremendously high incidence of lung cancer among stokers in that service.  Of course, nearly 100 per cent of ships are oil burning nowadays. Therefore, those fumes are constantly being inhaled.</P>
    <P>The general public are also inhaling oil fumes and it must be as much a contributory cause as, perhaps, smoking.  It is an irritant contributory cause.  It has also recently been definitely proved by those who are in position to do so that coronary thrombosis is associated with smoking.  I would be very much inclined to think that smoking is more inducive of coronary thrombosis than of lung cancer.  There is no doubt that an extra strain on the heart is induced by heavy smoking.  That, in itself, would contribute towards a coronary thrombosis condition.  I do not know if any investigations have been carried out in this country, and I do not know if any statistics have been taken, but it is something the Minister might bear in mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no reference to diet.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware that in the United States of America very intensive research is going on with regard to the question of diet, and the relationship of fat to heart diseases, coronary thrombosis, and so on.  One of the things which has helped the emergent countries perhaps more than anything else is the fact that in America there is a greater tendency now to go in for vegetable oils rather than butter fats than there was heretofore. That has helped to expand their economy considerably.  The theory in the United States is that the high rate of heart disease is due to butter and protein fats and, therefore, vegetable oils are becoming much more popular. That is not confined to the United States of America.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" /> The death rate in the Federal Republic of Germany from heart diseases is appalling, and tests are going on there as well.  It is only fair that if those are the modern trends to try to deal with the difficulties and dangers that mankind has to face nowadays, the Minister and his devoted servants should give us an opportunity of knowing these things.  The Minister should be briefed so that he could give us the benefit of expert advice on that subject.</P>
    <P>I want to speak now about the difficulties and dangers created in this country by itinerants, or as they are more familiarly called, tinkers.  Every Deputy will agree they are a very serious problem.  I do not know what is the full function of Departmental officers such as medical officers of health in regard to itinerants.  At present they are a positive menace in North Wexford.  Groups of them stay in certain places and when they leave, perhaps after a fortnight, they leave behind them the most appalling dirt and filth.  Are there regulations to deal with that problem?</P>

      <P>I am speaking to the Minister for Health who is responsible for the health of the community. One of the things that filth and mess and muck are said to be responsible for is the dissemination of anterior poliomyelitis or infantile paralysis.  The other day I passed a place in my constituency, and the chaos and mess had to be seen to be believed.  The Gardaí tell me they have no authority and can only tell the itinerants to move on.  If they do not go, the Gardaí can do nothing about it.  In Dublin city and its environs, the problem is probably a great deal worse because of the agglomeration of people. The problem should be taken up, and if the Minister has no direct responsibility, he should talk with his colleague, <Col N="1418" /> the Minister for Local Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am continuously doing that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it that they are still going freely and untrammelled around the country, making what I can only describe as a scandalous mess?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They are human beings, and I cannot corral them as if they were animals.  They have the same liberty of movement as the Deputy or I.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Minister's intervention, it appears that he has no answer to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I could have an answer.  Should I put them inside four walls?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could very easily pass legislation. I know I am not allowed to advocate legislation on an Estimate but I am suggesting to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to be a DMP man telling them to move on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that under the existing law, itinerants can stay in public places and make a mess which is detrimental to the health of the public.  The Minister holds the important office of Minister for Health&mdash;I understand he is likely to be there still next week&mdash;and I am asking him to do something about that problem which is a universal and a serious one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health is not really responsible for that sort of thing.  He is not responsible for what are known as environmental services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>But he is responsible for the health of the people.  I am suggesting he should make use of that great brain of his and have consultations with the Minister for Justice, if necessary, and the Minister for Local Government to try to clear up what is becoming a public scandal.</P>

      <P>As a layman I am probably at a disadvantage on an Estimate such as this.  We have had the views of various members of the House, doctors particularly, on mental ailments and other forms of ailments. My concern is with physical disabilities. To my knowledge, at one time the medical profession did not look on physical disability as an ailment.  They considered it a natural process, and so long as the disabled person's heart and lungs were all right, they were none of the medical profession's business.  The proof of that is that it was left to what were known as &ldquo;quacks&rdquo; to help disabled people in the past.  It is only of late that the medical profession have taken this problem seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the only doctors competent to deal with this problem are known as doctors of physical medicine. I am told there are not a handful of them in the whole country, and there are only two or three in Dublin.  If it is true that physical disability is an ailment that only doctors of physical medicine can prescribe for, there should be more of them.  Physical disability is a serious matter.  Mentally afflicted people may be a social problem, <Col N="1420" /> but they may not be suffering.  As a member of a local authority, I visit mental homes regularly, and in their own way those people enjoy themselves. They kick football and chat, and in their opinion they are not mad but we are.  There is no evidence that they are suffering.  As I say, they may be a social problem, but other than that they may not be suffering.  Even a person with TB may not be suffering. He may not feel very strong, but he can live a normal life.  However, we have dealt with the problem of TB to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>Physical disability entails a life of suffering as anyone who knows anything about it can tell you&mdash;and I can assure you that I do.  Let us visualise the normal body.  It is made up of muscles and nerves, all of which are balanced.  If machinery is not balanced, it will wear out in one part and throw the whole machine out of order.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 25th February, 1964.</P>
