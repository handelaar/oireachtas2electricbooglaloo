    <P>*These figures relate to the period 1st June to 31st December, 1961&mdash;the figures are not available for the year ended 31st December, 1961.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> The Tipperary South Constituency consists of (1) the administrative area of Tipperary (SR) County Council except for the Dispensary District of Kilcooly and the District Electoral Division of Clonoulty East in the Kilpatrick Dispensary District, and (2) six whole dispensary districts and part of three other dispensary districts in the Waterford Health Authority area.</P>
    <P>The statistics kept by the health authorities relate to dispensary districts as a whole and they are not in a position to furnish the information required in respect of portions of these districts.  Consequently, the information given in the reply relates to (a) the administrative area of Tipperary (SR) County Council except for the Dispensary District of Kilcooly and (b) the area comprising the nine dispensary districts in the Waterford Health Authority area which are wholly or partly in the Tipperary South Constituency.</P>
    <P>Tipperary (SR) County Council state that the large number of medical cards withdrawn is explained by the fact that during the three years the General Medical Services Register was in process of comprehensive review and re-compilation and that in the period the figures for number of medical cards withdrawn are inflated by the cancellation of cards of people who had died or left the health authority area since the register was first compiled in 1954, but whose cards had not been cancelled at the proper time.  Waterford Health Authority state that the increase in the number of medical cards issued for the years 1962 and 1963 is due to a comprehensive review of the General Medical Services Register undertaken in these years.  The figures for medical cards issued during these years include cards reissued following the review; but the Health Authority is not in a position to indicate how many cards were issued to new applicants and how many were renewals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the Commissioners of Public Works are required, prior to carrying out drainage work on any river, to give notice of their intention to landowners and farmers whose lands border the section of the river affected by the proposed works; if so, what notice; and what opportunity is given to such landowners and farmers to protest against the carrying out of any such works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, each drainage scheme with maps and schedules must be exhibited locally for a period of at least one month and a notice, indicating when and where the scheme may be inspected by interested parties, must be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in one or more newspapers circulating in the area concerned.  In addition, the Commissioners of Public Works are required to serve notice on every person named in the scheme as the reputed owner or occupier of lands or rights proposed to be acquired or substantially interfered with and to allow such persons a month in which to submit their observations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that the landowners adjoining the River Nenagh had no objection to this work being carried out?  It was only after the work had been carried out that the damage was done.</P>

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will describe in detail the precautions taken by the Commissioners of Public Works when planning or carrying out drainage work to ensure that such work has no deleterious effect on land in the vicinity through flooding or through cutting <Col N="811" /> off the water supply or natural drainage from such land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Drainage works are directed to the prevention of flooding and the provision of improved drainage of lands.  Every effort is made in the planning and execution of schemes to keep interference to a minimum.  It is inevitable, however, that in isolated cases, some damage must result.  Each such case presents different features and has to be considered on its merits. Examples of the type of precautions taken to prevent flooding and interference with natural drainage are: provision of embankments; pumping installations; openings in spoil heaps; improved outlets for field drains; improvement of weirs and sluice gates and provision for passage of flood flows during construction works.  Where water supplies are interfered with they are, where possible, restored by remedial works such as provision of weirs, lowering or extension of intake pipes and provision of filters.</P>

    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether compensation is paid to landowners and farmers by the Commissioners of Public Works for any damage caused by their agents or servants in the carrying out of drainage work; if so, by what means the amount of such compensation is decided; and if he will state in how many cases compensation was paid by the Commissioners in each of the past ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 compensation may be paid to any person who suffers loss or damage by reason of the execution of an arterial drainage scheme.  The Act provides that in the assessment of compensation regard should be had to the benefit which the scheme has brought to the property of the claimant.  The amount of compensation payable is a matter for negotiation between the claimant and the Commissioners of Public Works, but there is provision for arbitration, if agreement cannot be reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The numbers of compensation claims paid in each financial year since <Col N="812" /> 1954/5 were:&mdash; 1954/5, 21; 1955/6, 36; 1956/7, 33; 1957/8, 62; 1958/9, 35; 1959/60, 56; 1960/1, 55; 1961/2, 67; 1962/3, 75; 1963/4 to date, 85.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that, in the carrying out of drainage work on the River Nenagh in the Ballycommon and Ballyartella area, County Tipperary in 1956, the agents and servants of the Commissioners of Public Works caused considerable damage to crops in the area; that, by raising the level of the river, they caused permanent damage to the natural drainage of the area with resultant flooding of land at frequent intervals; and that no compensation has been paid on account of this damage; and whether he will investigate thoroughly the actions of the Commissioners of Public Works in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have investigated this complaint.  I am satisfied that the works carried out under the drainage scheme in this area did not raise the water level or worsen flood conditions &mdash;on the contrary the embankments built there have given full protection from flooding and the back drains provided behind the embankments afford an adequate outfall for drainage of the land in all conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that considerable damage was caused to this man's property, to a crop of wheat and another tillage crop which he had in the ground at the time, and is he aware that his Department have pleaded the Gaming Act as regards compensation and that it is actually statute barred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Our Department could have pleaded that.  In fact his claim was statute barred.  In August last year, the claimant's solicitor said they would go to arbitration.  Since that time nothing has been heard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Parliamentary Secretary but will he now notify the landowner who has lost <Col N="813" /> a vast sum of money, more than he could afford going around to various solicitors and so on, that they are prepared to meet him?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>May I remind the Deputy that on <Col N="814" /> December 3rd, 1963, the Dáil passed the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that taking account of the establishment in June, 1963, of the Commission to examine the pension schemes and the sickness benefit payments for the regular wages grade staffs of CIE consideration of the position of the existing pensioners should be deferred pending receipt and consideration of the Commission's report&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the levels of pensions for superannuated men must bear some relationship to current pensions.  It is reasonable to expect that they should.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers (for the Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>Aluminium foil for milk bottle tops is produced by only one manufacturer in this country. The normal delivery period is four weeks from the date of the order.</P>
      <P>During the past six months seven orders for this material for use in three dairies in County Tipperary were transmitted by the IAWS to the manufacturer. In two instances orders from one of these dairies were not executed within the normal period.</P>
      <P>On one occasion when delivery was not effected until six weeks from the receipt of the order for a very small quantity of foil in an unusual width, the manufacturer had to defer production until a minimum economic machine load could be made up from orders received from other customers. On the other occasion delivery took place in five weeks from the receipt of the order.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with the service given by the manufacturer who, incidentally, has an export trade of aluminium foil for milk bottle tops.  I, therefore, see no reason why duty-free imports of this material should be permitted.  As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, users of foil can import this material on payment of duty should they elect to do so.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there has been over five weeks' delay in the supply of this foil in the case of the dairy in Nenagh? Is he further aware that, when the foil was applied for, the dairy operators were told that the type was unusual and not readily available, whereas, in fact, the type applied for was the type supplied to every creamery in the Twenty-Six Counties?  Is the Minister also aware that certain suppliers are bringing in foil, with the permission of the Minister, from outside the country? Does the Minister think that a dairy supplying bottled milk can afford to wait five, six and seven weeks before getting a supply of foil for capping milk bottles?</P>

      <P>As I have already indicated, the Minister for Industry and Commerce made inquiries in regard to this matter and found, as a result, that deliveries were satisfactory in relation to a number of orders which passed through the IAWS.  There were two exceptional cases.  One company had some teething troubles in the early course of manufacture.  These teething troubles are now over.  I do not think the Deputy will find any need to complain in future.  I think he will find supplies up to date.</P>

No proposals for the acquisition of sites by agreement were received.

A public local inquiry was held on 28th November, 1963, to consider objections to the Order.

      <P>It is not a fact that the widow referred to in the Deputy's question has received no pension since the beginning of January.  She has had in her possession a widow's pension book containing orders at the rate of 37/6 a week, which was the rate of contributory pension appropriate to a widow who has no qualified children. This rate of pension was increased to 42/6 as from 3rd January, 1964, under the provisions of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1963. Payment of the increase was effected by the issue to the widow of a supplementary 5/- pension book on the 17th December, 1963, but it now appears that that book was lost in the post.</P>
      <P>On the 10th January, 1964, the widow wrote to my Department to say that she had not received an increase in her pension.  In reply she was informed that a 5/- pension book had been issued to her on 17th December, 1963, and she was asked to confirm that she had not since received it.  A duplicate book was subsequently sent to her when loss of the original book was confirmed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> Under Section 12 of the Land Act, 1950, the determination of lands to be acquired is an excepted matter and the Minister for Lands is not empowered to regulate or control the exercise or performance of the powers and duties of the Lay Commissioners in such matters.</P>
    <P>I understand that the decision of the Lay Commissioners in the case in question was based on all the circumstances disclosed in the sworn evidence tendered for both the objector and the Land Commission at a public hearing on 30th October last.</P>
    <P>A transcript of the hearing is not available but, in accordance with normal practice in such cases, a summary&mdash;which does not purport to be a verbatim note&mdash;of the submissions, evidence and findings is made for record purposes.  In the event of an appeal on a question of law, this summary is available, to the parties directly concerned only, as an appendix to the report furnished by the Lay Commissioners to the Appeal Tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister, when he states this document will be made available to those interested, what category of people does that cover?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>As in every other legal case, it will be made available to the parties before the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is well aware that the congests, the small farmers within a mile or two of this estate, were not before the court.  In view of their very deep interest in this estate, would he now say whether or not this document will be made available to a representative of these people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  This is a matter regulated by law between the individual owner and the Land Commission. I would suggest that the Deputy is well aware that in cases of this kind the Land Commission are the representatives of the small owners in the immediate vicinity of the lands. That is their purpose in acquiring the lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="825" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest of the Land Commission in the 30 smallholders in the vicinity with valuations under £18 was proved by the Land Commission allowing this first-class farm to pass into the hands of a man who does not know what to do with all the money he has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, because of his own vicious spleen against the veterinary surgeon in question, is using the privilege of this House to make this attack.  The fact remains that under the law there is the right to private property.  The Land Commission, taking proceedings of this kind for the purpose of acquiring land for the relief of congestion, must go before a court set up by this House, where each side can put their case.  That has been done in this instance.  If the Deputy or any other Deputy wants to take away these powers from the Land Commission&mdash;they are a reserved function of the Commission&mdash;and transfer them to the political head of the Department, that can be debated in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay by asking further supplementaries, but I want to ask the Minister this question.  Is it a fact that the Minister is acting on behalf of this veterinary surgeon, to whom he has referred, and against the interests of the small farmers, in view of the fact the Minister is bringing in legislation now which will enable him to get rid of the small farmers and leave the land to these people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is venting his personal spleen against this veterinary surgeon.  I hope at the next election this veterinary surgeon and his friends in Roscommon will remember that for the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was dealing with the obsession of this Government, as shown in the Blue Book, <Col N="830" /> with entrance to the EEC and, in particular, their dedication to private enterprise as the means by which the increased expansion in industry and agriculture would be achieved.  A Government who depend to the extent this Government do on private enterprise to achieve the enormous expansion in industry and agriculture which is essential if emigration and unemployment are to be solved, in other words if full employment is to be achieved, are not fit to hold office any longer.</P>
      <P>The country has had 40 years now of this dedication to private enterprise, this belief that private enterprise is the only solution to our problems.  Private enterprise has been pampered, petted, induced by grants and by taxes on the public.  Every possible inducement has been offered to private enterprise so that our young people would have an opportunity of making a living in Ireland.  We have seen the results of the activities of private enterprise in one million Irish-born citizens now living in Britain.  Only within the last month, we saw how dissatisfied very prominent people in public life and in church life in particular localities are with the fruits of private enterprise.  In January, according to the newspapers, the Bishop of Clogher made a public call on behalf of the people in his diocese to the public representatives in Monaghan to bring industry to that area, to Monaghan, which is one of the black spots with regard to employment. Things have reached a serious stage when a Bishop has to make public criticism of two of the most distinguished Deputies in this House.</P>
      <P>I quote from the <i>Irish Independent,</i> Friday, 3rd January, 1964, the day after the call was made by the bishop to the public representatives of Monaghan.  The heading in the paper is: &ldquo;Support for Bishop in call for industry&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>There was warm support in Monaghan yesterday for the Bishop of Clogher's call to Monaghan's public representatives and businessmen to make a greater effort to attract industry in Monaghan town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various people in business life in <Col N="831" /> Monaghan commenting on the Bishop's statement said it was true, that it was well timed, that the situation in Monaghan was very serious.  One person said it seemed hard to believe that, with such distinguished representation as they had in the Dáil, they had fared worse in regard to industry than neighbouring areas.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear I am not criticising either of the two distinguished Deputies, one the Leader of Fine Gael and the other a Minister in the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am not criticising them as individuals because I believe they have both done their utmost as individuals to bring industry to the Monaghan area.  However, the results are there, or rather the lack of results is there.  When the Bishop in that area has to say publicly that something must be done by the public representatives does it not prove that to depend on private enterprise to go to areas like Monaghan, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway, Donegal, West Clare, Cork, Kerry, and all these other places, particularly west of the Shannon, is a waste of time?  It is worse than that because, while we are depending on or hoping for development in these areas by private enterprise, the young people are moving out continually for Britain, America and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The answer to this problem is for the Government to step in and take an active part in this industrial development through State bodies or State-sponsored bodies.  The Government must, if these industries are not willing to go there, direct them to do so.  If there is Irish money in them there must be some power in the Government's hands to see that they go to the west.</P>
    <P>I give the Taoiseach, while he is here, one example of an industry that was forced to go west and it is a very useful industry today.  The Taoiseach himself has sought for years to suggest that the inducements offered by way of grant and loan were sufficient to attract industrialists to Galway, Roscommon, Mayo and all these other places.  Is it not a fact that a very big industry which is now established in Athlone was given Government <Col N="832" /> assistance and was told: &ldquo;Unless you go west, we shall not give you financial aid.&rdquo;  That group fulfilled the requirements by crossing the Shannon.  The factory is welcome there but they only went as far as they need go physically. It did not move any further west.  We must find some means of stabilising the population over there.</P>
    <P>In 1952 this Government brought in the Undeveloped Areas Act which at the time I said&mdash;and I have no hesitation in repeating what I said&mdash;would not prove successful and would be a failure as regards bringing industrial development to the west.  This is 1964 and in the intervening period the Undeveloped Areas Act was, shall we say, sabotaged and the limited amount of good it was doing has been destroyed by the very fact that the facilities which were available under the Undeveloped Areas Act earlier on are now available to the rest of Ireland.  There is no incentive whatever to any industrialist to go to the congested areas or the undeveloped areas. If an industrialist can get a grant for setting up a factory in Dublin do you think he will go to Charlestown, Boyle or Tuam?  Do you think he will go to Donegal if he can get the same grant, the same facilities, the same credit, by setting up the factory at Tallaght, Swords, or some other place near Dublin city?</P>
    <P>The results of that policy have been seen in the past three years in the fact that for every £1 now spent on industrial grants by Foras Tionscal in the west of Ireland, £4 is being spent in the Dublin area.  That is the comparison and it shows that this Government have lost interest in the industrial development of the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I dealt in great detail with the Government policy on industry and their outlook on the Common Market. As regards this 50 per cent expansion which they say must be achieved in this decade to keep in line with other members of OECD, lip service is paid to the fact that agriculture must play a main part in achieving that increase but there is nothing but the most hazy idea as to how that increase will be achieved in this Blue Book, this <Col N="833" /> alleged programme which they have produced.</P>
    <P>It is very welcome and very encouraging to find that an organisation such as the NFA have produced within the past week an excellent blueprint for the development of agriculture. Many of the proposals contained in the NFA document have been part and parcel of Labour Party policy over the years.  In fact, to use an expression which has been used elsewhere, many of the very important suggestions and proposals made in that document are &ldquo;old hat,&rdquo; so far as the Labour Party are concerned.</P>
    <P>It is a very welcome sign to find such a very prominent and influential body as the NFA taking a very broad view of the economy generally outside their own farming interests.  That shows they realise the importance of State control in the development of agriculture.  When I say &ldquo;the importance of State control,&rdquo; I mean the importance of State control over the people who are intervening between the producer and the consumer.  We are not looking for State control to put the farmers into a straitjacket so far as their production is concerned. What we are aiming at&mdash;and I presume the NFA are aiming at the same thing in their reference to boards in this document&mdash;is that boards will be set up to protect the producer from the exploitation to which he is subject at present by those people who are in between him and the consumer.</P>
    <P>We think these boards should try to regulate development and expansion in the various spheres of agriculture, so that both the producer and the consumer will be protected and, in addition, these State boards, with the aid of top-class salesmen and technicians, should be enabled to go into foreign fields to secure the top-class markets which are available if we go out to get them.</P>
    <P>In this Blue Book, the Government show their true feelings, and give an indication of their true outlook on farming when they say:</P>
    <P>The contribution of agriculture to <Col N="834" /> economic expansion will be the greater if effort is concentrated on these products for which the market prospects are best.  Cattle, live and dead, is our principal farm product, both in total output and in export value ...</P>
    <P>It is apparent that the idea of the Government is: &ldquo;Let us concentrate on expanding the cattle trade, on producing more beef for export.&rdquo;  I welcome any expansion of the livestock industry, especially if it means more processing of livestock, and an increased dead meat trade as a result of an increased cattle population, but it is a fallacy to suggest that an expansion in the cattle industry, or in the number of livestock, will be an aid to the keystone of the Irish economy, namely, the small farmer.  He must have other means of livelihood than the production of cattle.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the Government are aiming at 45-acre holdings while, at the same time, saying that the output of cattle will get priority.  In other words, the small farmer is for the emigrant ship, if he likes to take his place in the queue already forming, according to these OECD reports, in Greece, Italy, Spain, Finland, Norway and other countries, to move into the heart of Europe for industrial employment. In the European countries, the aim is to get people out of agriculture because there is too much congestion on many European farms.  The position in Ireland is that we have huge tracts of land which are unused and undeveloped, and we have a population ready and willing to use them if given the opportunity, instead of being prepared by Government policy on agriculture for the emigrant ship.  They will not be absorbed into industry if they leave the land.  They will have to leave the country.</P>
    <P>The contrast between the forthright policy expressed by the NFA and the hazy policy of the Government will strike the farmers as very significant. It shows a lack of thinking on the part of the Government in respect of the interests of the farmers.  The Government have taken the view that cattle are No. 1 on the list so far as <Col N="835" /> increased output is concerned; No. 2 is the 45-acre farm.  On that basis, we are doing away with the idea of cooperation.  The Government evidently want the farmer to stand on his own and not mind his neighbour. They want to make the farmer practically self-sufficient on a 45-acre holding, and they want him to carry on without cooperating with anyone.</P>
    <P>The Government say that they have asked for a report on the cooperative movement.  Is it not a fact that with a cooperative system, farmers with proper planning could make a livelihood on perhaps a good deal less than 45 acres?  We have the Government talking about 45-acre holdings, and in the next breath talking about a system of cooperative farming.  I do not know where they stand, and I do not think they know themselves.  They are prepared to try any gimmicks to stay in office for another few months.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believe there is hope for the small farmer, and a possibility of keeping him on the land and giving him a reasonable livelihood, provided he has security of tenure, gets a reasonable price for his products, and continuity of sales of his products.  We also believe there is an outlet for his products, provided there is continuity of supplies to the markets, that the product is in top-class condition when it reaches the markets, that it is attractively packaged and so forth.</P>
    <P>It is very encouraging to find a prominent farming organisation anxious to see an increase in the number of State boards associated with the farming industry.  That is a tremendous development.  Up to now, we have had nothing but horror expressed in the House by all the major Parties at any idea of State interference in the farming industry.  We have heard it said that it is wrong for a Government to interfere in or to control any aspect of farming.  Here we have the farmers' representatives themselves saying that if this primary industry is to expand, there must be some State interference.</P>
    <P>One of the boards referred to in this <Col N="836" /> blueprint is that set up in connection with horticultural produce.  We have had the position in recent years of the Irish Sugar Company interesting itself in this aspect of farming, particularly in the fruit and vegetable lines, but we have also had serious pressure by private enterprise, mainly with headquarters outside the country, to thwart the efforts of the Sugar Company in relation to the processing of homegrown Irish horticultural produce.  We had the sorry situation in which a number of private enterprise groups were importing horticultural produce from abroad and processing and canning it here.</P>
    <P>As I have said, many of these groups are controlled from outside.  They are getting protection here on the home market, and yet an Irish company with Irish capital, depending on the Irish farmers, is told it cannot sell that line of produce here except to a limit of 10 per cent.  How can the Government reconcile their action in preventing an Irish company from selling produce on the home market, while, at the same time, doing all in their power to tear down tariff walls?  On 1st January last they took off ten per cent from import quotas.</P>
    <P>We heard several times during the past 30 years that if an Irish company is to engage successfully in the export market it is essential for it to have a firm home base&mdash;to have a considerable home market first before launching into the export business.  That has always been the No. 1 recommendation for an Irish industry.  Is it so as far as the Irish Sugar Company is concerned? It is not.  The Government have no plans for helping the Sugar Company or other Irish groups who at the moment are deeply interested in the growing of fruit and vegetables.  We have the case of the Glencolumbkille enterprise sponsored by Father McDyer, which deserves such great credit.  This is a venture worthy of the utmost support and encouragement from the Government; yet we find that a grant of £25,000 which, I believe, has been sanctioned, has not yet been paid on the ground that the officials are not satisfied the necessary requirements have been fulfilled.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> The farmers there are keenly interested in growing the necessary produce on a contract basis, but, to my mind, the Government are more interested in increasing the number of cattle than in giving a decent livelihood to a number of small farmers through the growing of fruit and vegetables.  What has happened there, of course, is that the Government do not believe the venture will be a success.  Let us be frank about it: they are afraid it will not be a success.  I cannot understand the mentality of a Government who say they are interested in the welfare of the small farmers and who withhold a grant of a paltry £25,000 which would help an enterprise on its feet, while at the same time they hand out £200,000 to a small Dublin group interested in the bacon industry.  Are the people of Glencolumbkille not also interested in the bacon industry? I see no justice or any real Government planning here, only favouritism.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion that the distilling industry be examined and put on a proper basis.  Is it not a nice commentary on one of our major industries to say that the quantity of Scotch whisky consumed here is as great as the quantity of Irish whiskey exported?  That spotlights the disgraceful position of an industry which could, if run on a proper basis, put half the small farming community on a first-class basis in a guaranteed market, instead of leaving the industry in the hands of private enterprise, of a group of people who do not give a damn so long as they get a good dividend each year.  It is time there was a change of Government, if only to bring about the necessary reform in that industry.</P>
    <P>There is another recommendation by the NFA in which the Labour Party have been deeply interested for years&mdash;the necessity for a changed outlook abroad as far as our main industries are concerned.  The NFA suggest the provision of planned staffs of trained agricultural experts for stationing abroad in Irish embassies, linked with the Irish Marketing Board.  I do not like going back to other days but it is necessary to do <Col N="838" /> so at times in order to show the exhortations along similar lines that were made some years ago.  I quote from volume 160, column 641 of the Official Report for 7th November, 1956:</P>
    <P>Mr. McQuillan asked the Minister for External Affairs if, in respect of the embassies in London and Paris, he will state the number of officials engaged solely on work connected with the expansion of our agricultural export trade.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave was then Minister for External Affairs and he gave a long reply in which he made it clear that as far as he was concerned quite a number of officials were, apart from other duties, engaged in trade duties, but he added:</P>
    <P>At present there is one such officer serving in Britain.</P>
    <P>There was only one such officer in the field of agricultural expansion in the embassy in London, and there was nobody at all in Paris.  I do not think the position has improved very much in the intervening years.  The emphasis as far as this Government are concerned is on prestige abroad&mdash;the big building, the luxury appearance, a good front and it does not matter what the background is like.</P>
    <P>In this Blue Book, the question of credit for farmers receives scant consideration as far as Government planning is concerned.  We all know that credit at low rates of interest is essential if agriculture is to make the necessary progress, the required expansion. One of the arguments put forward here in connection with agriculture is where the money is to come from.  It is said that we cannot afford it because we are not an industrial country.  Most of the money in this country that is available for investment is invested abroad. Looking at the assets of our commercial banks, it is an eyeopener to see the amount of Irish money that is invested outside Ireland.  When it was suggested that these assets should be reinvested in Ireland, we had from the Fianna Fáil Party, and from Deputy Childers in particular, the criticism that these assets were a standing army <Col N="839" /> in Britain, ready to guard us if this country ever went bankrupt.  Deputy Childers omitted to mention that along with the standing army of bank notes in Britain, there was also a standing army of Irish boys and girls working in factories in Britain, factories set up by the Irish money invested in Britain which should have been invested at home.</P>
    <P>The farming community in this country depend for credit on the Agricultural Credit Corporation and any farmer who has managed to prise a few hundred pounds out of that corporation would need to go to Ballybunion or Salthill for a fortnight to relieve the strain on his mind and body.  That is not the way to deal with the farmer who needs credit.  I will do everything possible in support of the suggestion made recently by the farmers' group that a farmers credit company or corporation should be set up, that the Agricultural Credit Corporation should be re-organised in such a way that credit facilities will be made available and within easy reach of every farmer.</P>
    <P>The commercial banks have premises in every town in Ireland but how do they cater for the needs of the farmer who wants credit to expand? We have heard a lot of talk about competition but will the Taoiseach tell us if any competition exists today in banking circles?  As far as I can see, the only competition between them in Ireland is in the setting up of palatial buildings all over the country.  Is there any competition between them as to who has the friendliest handshake or with regard to the attractiveness of their terms for the farmer who needs credit?  There is none.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been one change in the attitude of the commercial banks to the farming community. Suddenly many of these banks who have their headquarters outside Ireland and who take their policy directives from outside Ireland are making money available to farmers who want to go in for cattle production.  We see that trend running through the Government's Blue Book also and it is noticeable that three or four years <Col N="840" /> ago the banks said they were prepared to lend money for the production of livestock.  Six or seven years ago, they were prepared to give money to people to erect cattle marts all over the country and it was no trouble for them to find £20,000 or £30,000 to set up these marts.  It is no wonder that Dr. Knapp, in his report to the Government, has stated that there were too many of these marts going up and that there was too much money being made available for this line of progress.</P>
    <P>Why was that done?  Why was money given for the production of cattle and why was it so difficult for a farmer to get money if he wanted to go into pigs, or horticulture, or any other line of agricultural production? It is time the Government exercised some control in this matter.  I do not know how true it is but I have been told by people who think they know that this policy of the commercial banks of inducing the farmers to go into the livestock industry is the result of a policy directive by the British livestock interests who have a big influence in banking policies in Britain, interests which have a number of directors on the boards of the commercial banks in Britain, particularly those banks which have offices in Ireland.  It is said that they were responsible for the idea that this country should be kept in the production of cattle.</P>
    <P>The time has come when whatever Government are in office will have to take steps towards making credit available at a reasonable rate of interest to the farming community.  The savings of the Irish people are being sent out of the country.  I am going to give my own experience in this matter. I could not count the number of occasions on which farmers have come to me on different matters and have told me the amount of money they have in the banks.  They may have it there for their daughters' dowry or some other reason.  They are getting interest at the rate of one and a half per cent on this money.  We see the bank managers acting like spiders to get these farmers into their webs and telling them how wonderful it is that they should leave their money in their <Col N="841" /> banks, but no sooner have they left the manager's office than their money is invested outside the country.  Their deposits appear on one side of a ledger in a bank in England while the farmer thinks his money is still in this country because he is in a position to withdraw it the following day if he needs it.</P>
    <P>If the farmers' money is not invested in a bank in England or in some other group outside Ireland, it is invested in a national loan.  If it could be brought home to the people in rural Ireland that if they would make available the few pounds they have and put the money directly into a national loan or into a credit bank controlled by the State and farmers combined, it would be doing a better job for them and the State.  But until we deal with the commercial banks who are giving a wrong slant to the community in general on the question of credit we are not going to get the confidence of the farming community or the community at large to an extent that will induce them to put their money into Irish industry or agriculture.</P>
    <P>To me it is a tragedy to find that money which would bring in a nice return each year to people in Ireland is not even benefiting the community but benefiting those outside the country. I am anxiously waiting to see if the Government will take any action on the question of credit for the farming community.  It is too serious a matter as far as development is conconcerned to be allowed to go any longer.  God knows, the tinkering that has been done and the alterations that have taken place in the credit system, particularly in the Agricultural Credit Corporation, have been done over a sufficiently long time to enable the Government to assess the needs for further improvement if they are not prepared to believe what is being told them by many experienced people in various fields whose advice is available if the Government are willing to listen.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment again, without delaying the House much longer, on the absolute necessity of getting markets if and when we do increase the output from the land.  It <Col N="842" /> is now accepted that the greatest possible amount of exports should be processed before leaving Ireland and in order to get rid of the pessimists here who have the idea that there is no scope now for horticultural exports, for pig-meat or butter or other exports that we have at present.  With a proper and energetic marketing system the openings are still there.  The position in England at present is that despite our close association geographically we are supplying only 5 per cent of Britain's total food imports.  That is fantastic and evidently the Government are prepared to accept that we are not able to break through the 5 per cent barrier because their talk is: &ldquo;Let us get into EEC; we can do nothing in Britain.  Let us concentrate on cattle.&rdquo;  They are hoping, because they think there is a shortage of cattle in Europe, that we should be able to sell cattle in the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that we should allow this five per cent limit of Britain's total food imports to stand. We should be in a position, without any trouble if we had the right men in the right places, to double that and make it ten per cent in a very short time.  If we consider the impact such an increase would make on Irish agriculture we can see it would be one of the greatest encouragements towards that expansion which the Government say is necessary if we are to catch up with other EEC countries by 1970.  We have the shameful position in Britain that the Danes outsell us ten to one in bacon products despite the fact that there is a ten per cent tariff operating in our favour.  Can we attribute that state of affairs to the Irish farmers? Is it not a fact that it is sought to attribute it to our farmers instead of blaming those responsible.  I shall not deal with it in any detail, but I maintain there is a huge market right beside us, and a very varied market, in Britain if we have the interest, energy and intelligence to go into it properly.</P>
    <P>We have one tremendous advantage in that market&mdash;there is no language difficulty.  In spite of that we are making a hopeless bid.  Where would we stand in the European Market even if we had goods and could compete <Col N="843" /> when we would not know what they were talking about?  It is time that for these marketing boards which must be set up now no matter what Government comes in, we should select the right men.  I am very much afraid that over the years when boards have been set up they have antagonised the public to a great extent.  If we set up a board that may have to take very strong decisions, perhaps hard decisions, is it not necessary to put people on the board who will not have a vested interest in seeing that no change is made?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to point out that the personnel of these boards should be selected with the greatest care and, in addition, the policy of these boards should be, to a greater extent, subject to this House.  I want to see what Fianna Fáil call the democratic process properly carried out and instead of the present position, where this House cannot question the functions, activities or the policy of any of the existing companies, that situation must be changed and democratic procedure established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are not dealing democratically with the people by suggesting that Deputies are not entitled to ask what is happening in such a company.  The most common expression <Col N="844" /> used in the ministerial Benches here in regard to State or semi-State companies over the years has been: &ldquo;I have no function in the matter.&rdquo; I am sick and tired of hearing that from every Minister of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I have heard it also from the Ceann Comhairle who is good enough to send me letters saying: &ldquo;Dear Deputy, your question is out of order.&rdquo; I have a file a foot high of questions disallowed by the Ceann Comhairle &mdash;I am not blaming him personally &mdash;on the ground that the Minister has no function.  If I were to count the number of replies I have got from Ministers in which they have used the same expression, I could be at it until 10 o'clock tonight.</P>
    <P>That policy on the part of the Government leaves State companies open to very grave criticism and it is high time that whatever Government are in office in the next few weeks should get down to the task of bringing these State companies more under control of this House and deal also with the question of setting up new ones.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much point in exhorting this Government to change their tactics.  Their race is run. If the Taoiseach was serious in his pronouncement in Kildare the other night that if the Government are beaten in the two by-elections, he will go to the country.  I would ask him, as a favour to the country, whether or not he is beaten in the two by-elections, to go to the country with the greatest possible haste so that the public may have an opportunity to analyse the various new policies that have been put before them and to see for themselves that the day of private enterprise and pampered protection is over and that the State must now move in and do the job which has been neglected for the past 40 years, namely, to expand Irish industry and agriculture in order to give a hope to the young people that they will be able to make a living here at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Vote on Account affords the first opportunity in the financial year for discussion of the policies and the results of those policies during the past year and for <Col N="845" /> consideration of the programme put before the House and the country for the coming financial year.</P>
      <P>It would be impossible, indeed reckless, in a Vote of the magnitude of the sum which has been put before the House by the Minister for Finance to select or suggest certain items which might be deleted or otherwise because the full consideration of a Vote of this magnitude must obviously await detailed explanation by a Government and by Ministers who have available all the facts and all the data.  For these reasons, it is quite outside the scope of an individual Deputy to suggest any major changes.  But, in relation to this Vote it is the responsibility of Deputies to consider the whole question of financial and economic policies and to discuss the results of the policies that have been pursued, not merely over the past year, but over a number of years.</P>
      <P>The really significant fact about the Vote on Account is, not merely the size of it, but that it appears from the interjection made by the Minister for Finance yesterday that additional demands will be made on the taxpayers in order to meet the full effect of the &ldquo;ninth round&rdquo;.  It seems, therefore, that the total Vote which will have to be considered by the House and the country exceeds the sum mentioned initially yesterday inasmuch as a sum of over £7 million will have to be added to it.  When that is added to the Vote which has been presented together with a further sum of approximately £42 million for the Central Fund, the total bill will amount to over £230 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering that figure account must also be taken of the very substantial increase in rates which will occur this year.  It is very likely that the increase in the demands made by all local authorities will exceed any increase which occurred previously. This year most local authorities will make demands in respect of the effect which the turnover tax has had on their finances.  It is appropriate to mention that at this stage because of some comments made here yesterday about the cost involved in the programme <Col N="846" /> published by the Fine Gael Party.  However, I will deal with certain aspects of that matter later.</P>
    <P>The steep rise in the cost of living has affected all sections of the community and the reaction of those in employment has been effectively demonstrated by the negotiations between the Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers which have resulted in the arrangement whereby a 12 per cent increase has been agreed or a minimum of £1 a week in respect of categories covered by that agreement.  In turn, the State has accepted, and rightly accepted, responsibility for increasing the pay and emoluments of the various categories of persons covered by the general description of State employees or persons for whom the State is responsible, such as civil servants, Gardaí, the Army, teachers, Post Office employees, and so on.  In turn, local authority employees will be covered by some similar arrangement.</P>
    <P>That agreement has covered adequately the categories affected by it and, undoubtedly, the majority of those employed in industry, the large numbers for whom the State has responsibility, such as civil servants, teachers, and so on, will all benefit by that arrangement.</P>
    <P>I believe that one of the most satisfactory arrangements that have been worked out here in recent years was the decision to establish the National Employer-Labour Conference.  That was founded on the realisation that the interests of both parts of industry are to a very large extent complementary and that these interests as well as the wider interests of the community were best settled and discussed by a joint conference.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions we have discussed here the question as to whether or not the system that is operated here is the most satisfactory from the point of view of the community generally. Attention has also been paid to the system operated in certain other European countries.  In some of these countries, for instance, in the Netherlands and Sweden, a somewhat similar arrangement exists, with, of course, variations and differences that it is not <Col N="847" /> necessary to mention at this stage, but the State is also involved in it.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the State is to be involved in these negotiations, it should be on a fixed and defined basis. There is nothing worse than the haphazard intervention, such as was made by the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government some months ago in order to create the impression that responsibility for these negotiations rested with the Government rather than with the trade unions or the employers. If there is to be Government intervention, it should be on a fixed and defined basis.  Otherwise, it is open to the suggestion at any time that the Government intervened because of political, economic or some other considerations.  However, this agreement has been welcomed by all who are concerned for the orderly regulation of wage and salary matters on the basis that not merely does it affect those employed in industry and in the other categories covered by it but also because it has an impact on the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>There are in the community very great numbers of persons unaffected by that arrangement.  Their incomes have not and will not increase to compensate for the very substantial rise in the cost of living.  The November figure showed only part of the effect of the turnover tax but undoubtedly it will be reflected more fully in the figures for mid-February. It is significant that the figures for mid-November showed a rise of 4.91 points compared with mid-August and a rise of 29 points compared with mid-February, 1957.  This rise in the cost of living hits the weaker sections in the community most.</P>
    <P>On a few occasions last year, the Taoiseach discussed the need for a wider diffusion of social benefits. There were quotations from recent Papal Encyclicals on the need for the State to do more in this regard.  For these and other reasons, I raise the whole question of the Government's attitude to pensioners and retired persons.  Nobody will seriously suggest that the modest increase granted <Col N="848" /> in the Budget, and which took effect from last November, adequately compensates for the rise in the cost of living due to the effects of the turnover tax.  I refer particularly to the essentials of life&mdash;omitting housing and responsibility for rent&mdash;food, clothing, footwear and medicine. The increased prices for these four items press harshly on pensioners and retired persons.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside entirely the social welfare categories who have got some inadequate increase to compensate for the rise in the cost of living, there are great numbers of persons in this community who, for historical and other reasons, live on fixed incomes: retired persons, persons who through their own exertions or the exertions of relatives accumulated some small savings, persons in receipt of pensions other than State pensions, small shopkeepers and traders, small farmers, self-employed individuals who sell their skill in a variety of ways and who because of the nature of their work are unable to pass on the increase to compensate them for the rise in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I believe the attitude of the State to the categories of persons I mention has been complacent.  Indeed, some persons have described it as callous. Many feel they have been overlooked because their bargaining power is weak.  Many feel that their power to influence political and other events is not commensurate with their numbers. They are dispersed in every locality. Many, because of their age and circumstances are incapable of organising themselves and of making their view effective.  Others, because of their avocation or trade or calling are unorganised and are unlikely to be organised into any sort of cohesive group.  All of these people have been forgotten in the arrangements which have been made and the adjustments in course of being worked out in relation to wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>There is need now for a national decision that a rise in pensions substantial enough to compensate for the increase in the cost of living will take place and will cover State and other <Col N="849" /> pensioners.  If this country is to lay claim to the assertion that we are anxious to implement the proposals outlined in the EEC programme on social matters, as well as the views expressed in the Encyclicals and elsewhere, we should adopt the system which is in operation in certain European countries of revising pensions in the same way as wages and salaries are revised when there is a rise in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Every Pensions (Increase) Bill introduced by the Minister for Finance is always making up for a time lag.  It is not peculiar to the present Minister. A pension based on the rate of pay at retirement seemed not merely reasonable but the only satisfactory and sensible method of assessing it.  In the past, that system was adequate because changes in the cost of living were rare.  Nowadays, and in particular since the war, there has been a continuous and steep rise in the cost of living.  The old system which still operates in relation to pensioners has undoubtedly caused considerable hardship.</P>
    <P>Deputies of all Parties have been approached by retired State pensioners. For instance, a man who served in the Army and retired six months, or a year or two earlier than a colleague, who then filled the same post, who attained the same rank, private, NCO or officer, finds that his pension is substantially lower than is the pension of his colleague at present because of subsequent increases in pay and emoluments, due to the changes that have taken place in the cost of living.  I believe that system should be reviewed in order to compensate the weaker and weakest sections in the community.  The pensions should be adjusted on some automatic basis similar to that being worked out in regard to wages and salaries under the Employer-Labour conference and which is applicable to other categories as well.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme For Economic Expansion</i> has already been referred to.  One of the factors about this Programme which has already been mentioned is that it is based in the <Col N="850" /> main on estimates made by the OECD teams for member countries.  This OECD investigation of the economic conditions of member countries may be satisfactory enough for the organisation itself but it is inadequate and in some ways inaccurate in assessing economic prospects here.  It is also unreliable in so far as there can be any assessment or forecast for the prospects of these aims.</P>
    <P>Considerable play has been made by Government spokesmen with the substantial increase in exports and the substantial expansion in industry.  Everyone welcomes that expansion.  It is equally true that the prime incentives to that development were given by reason of decisions taken and policies adopted by inter-Party Governments in the past.  The establishment of the Industrial Development Authority, the incentive in regard to exports which was introduced by the last inter-Party Government, and the industrial grants which were also introduced by the last inter-Party Government, have all played a most significant and stimulating role in expanding exports, production and output.  I noticed today in the supplement in the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;and I suppose it is not without significance that this supplement appears during the present by-election campaigns&mdash;that the Director-General of CTT listed what he would regard as the principal factors responsible for the growth of exports in the past ten years.  He mentioned incentives to export by way of tax relief, technical assistance, re-equipment and other grants.  He then went on to list other reasons.  I have previously referred to the comments made by Professor Carter of Queen's University on the effect tax remission had on stimulating industrial expansion and on its contribution to the expansion which has occurred not merely in output but in particular in exports.</P>
    <P>One of the factors which is the subject of comment in the OECD report is the question of prices and the effect of prices on the trade of member countries.  At page 25, in &ldquo;Policies For Economic Growth&rdquo; there is the following comment:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="851" /> The passage of the Trade Expansion Act by the United States and the prospects for further expansion of trading opportunities by the lowering of tariff barriers and other impediments to trade on a multilateral basis will help in this direction.  This growth of interdependence brings benefits but it also poses problems.</P>
    <P>Member Governments entered the 1960s with the benefit of the lessons learned in the 1950s.  But they also brought with them a legacy of unsolved problems.  In particular, at the beginning of the 1960s, most countries find themselves still faced with the problem of stabilising prices....</P>
    <P>I do not know whether any assessment has been made in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> of the effect which the turnover tax will have on industrial prices.  One of the factors that has not been considered to any extent is the very substantial rise in rates which affects not merely private householders but also industrial concerns. If we compare the rates collected by the local authorities for the year 1956 with the year 1962, the latest figure available, we find that the totals were £17,746,000 and £23,123,000.  This year the rates will increase further and every local authority has already foreshadowed, in the presentation of their accounts, the very substantial increase there will be due to the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>It is therefore impossible to consider this Programme without considering for a moment the serious effects which the lack of stability in prices will have on our capacity to trade.  It is true that one of the matters referred to in the Blue Book is the need for stability in prices and the avoidance of any influence which will alter our capacity to trade competitively. One of the matters that has been referred to here previously is the fact that so far as EEC countries are concerned, our trade with them is heavily adverse.  I suggest that the time has arrived for a general review of the trade agreements <Col N="852" /> we have with the EEC countries.  In round figures the trade between this country and the member countries of the EEC would indicate that, last year, we bought approximately £40 million worth of goods from these countries and exported to them about £10 million worth.  These figures may be adjusted slightly in the light of more up-to-date information but, by and large, they represent the position.  These trade agreements have been in operation now for ten years, or so, and the time has arrived for a general review of the terms and conditions either on a multilateral or a bilateral basis.  It is obvious that, with no definite prospect of membership of the EEC before us, we cannot continue to trade on the basis of buying from member countries over four times what they buy from us.  In certain circumstances, there may be valid reasons why we should buy particular goods from individual countries, but, on the whole, the pattern of trade with these countries suggests review is urgently necessary.</P>
    <P>One of the estimates made in the Blue Book is that, as a result of the increase in productivity and the rise which is expected to take place by the end of the present decade, there will be a net increase in employment of 78,000.  I cannot understand why any figure is put into that book in view of the experience we have had as a result of the previous plan announced by the Taoiseach, when it was promised 100,000 new jobs would be provided and, in fact, the figures indicate that there are now fewer people in employment than in 1956. I have here the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for 1962.  The total numbers at work, taking those in non-agricultural occupations as well as those employed in agriculture, would indicate that, in 1956, 1,127,000 were employed and in 1961, the latest year for which the figures are available, there were 1,090,000, which indicates a drop of 37,000 or 38,000.  I know that in this particular publication the figures quoted related to the year 1960, when the figure was 1,058,000.  The figures I have given are a year later.</P>
    <P>One of the matters that has been the <Col N="853" /> subject of comment in the <i>Economic Statistics</i> is the unreliability of the figures which were used.  I want to pose the question now as to why certain figures are rejected and others are allowed to remain.  One of the Tables published over the years was Table 16. That gave the figures for the various categories in relation to the estimated number of persons at work in non-agricultural activities.  Another Table gave the agricultural ones.  That Table would indicate that in 1956 there was a total of 718,000 odd engaged in non-agricultural economic activity; in 1961 the figure was 710,000.  In the publication for 1962 that Table is dropped and a combined Table is substituted. One turns then to page 15 of the publication where it says:</P>
    <P>While the relevant material from the 1961 Census is not yet available, and will not be ready for some months, present indications are that the estimates hitherto published are even less reliable than anticipated. It appears there was a gradual but cumulative over-estimation of the total number of persons at work throughout the intercensal period. Sufficient data are not available to justify the publication of revised estimates at the present time, but it is expected that it will be possible to prepare such estimates as the necessary material becomes available later in the year.  At the moment, it is possible to examine only certain sectoral data in this field.</P>
    <P>One of the claims the Minister made in the course of his introductory remarks was that emigration has declined.  The suggestion, in fact, has been made that the natural rise in the population, plus the reduction in emigration, has resulted in an increase in the total population.  I do not think anybody has any desire to use incorrect statistics, but we should, at least, endeavour to get the same basis of comparison.  I object to some figures being deleted from these publications on the basis of their being inaccurate while others are left unaffected.</P>
    <P>One of the figures recently published in the report of the Overseas Migration Board for 1962 would indicate that between 1961 and 1962, <Col N="854" /> 91,287 persons emigrated to Britain for the first time while 28,673 who had been previously there emigrated again.  These figures are contained in Table 6 of the Report.  It would appear, therefore, that there is a considerable gap between the figures given by the Minister for Finance and other Government spokesmen and the figures published in Britain.  No claim is made in this publication that the figures are absolutely accurate, but the gap is too significant to allow it to go without comment.  I believe there should be some liaison between the Department of Social Welfare and the appropriate Department in Britain in an effort to reconcile these figures.  So far as I can see, there was very heavy emigration in both 1961 and 1962, as well as re-emigration on the part of some who had emigrated previously. A total of 91,000 emigrated for the first time and 28,600 also emigrated who had emigrated previously.  These figures indicate that something went wrong with the plan the Taoiseach announced, the plan which was supposed to be enshrined in the first <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> We find a continued heavy rate of emigration and fewer persons actually employed here than were employed previously.</P>
    <P>One of the matters that requires urgent action, as well as the social welfare changes mentioned earlier, is housing.  Much play has been made in this debate, and earlier debates, on the record of the inter-Party Government and that of the present Government. Facts are the only test of any policy.  Facts indicate that, taking the past three years, which presumably are regarded as the most favourable for the present Government, and the last three years of the inter-Party Government, approximately little more than half the number of houses were built by local authorities and reconstructed with State assistance in the two periods.  During the period of inter-Party Government, in the years 1955, 1956 and 1957, 31,000 odd houses were built compared with 17,000 in 1960, 1961 and 1962.  These figures are to be found in the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> at page 204.  At the present time there is a long waiting list in <Col N="855" /> every local authority, particularly in the cities and towns.</P>
    <P>Now I want to refute immediately any suggestion that we blame the Government for the houses falling down in Dublin.  No one would be so silly as to suggest any Government could have responsibility for that. These houses have reached the end of their tether. It is obvious the effect of the severe weather last year precipitated an abnormal number of house collapses.  What is important is that the rate of house building has not been maintained, that the drive, the initiative and the incentives there previously have not been maintained.</P>
    <P>In the course of his introductory remarks yesterday, the Minister for Finance used the figure of £16 million as being provided for housing, both building and reconstruction.  It is not lack of money that is holding up building.  It does not matter what is the cause, the result is the same for those affected by it.  Administrative delays, examination and re-examination of plans, bureaucratic direction and interference of one sort or another, either by the Minister or by the Department under the responsibility of the Minister&mdash;all these things are delaying the building of houses by local authorities.  Members of local authorities who discuss the matter, either with themselves or anyone interested, soon see that what is holding up the implementation of house building policy is the number of times plans have to be submitted or re-submitted because of slight variations in the lay-out or some other slight changes suggested by the Department.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency of Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, at least 500 houses are required to meet the demands of really pressing needy cases, not to mention those on the waiting list in every locality each year.  The Government should be honest and say that it is administrative action rather than lack of the provision of money that has delayed the implementing of a progressive and enlightened house building programme.  The facts are the <Col N="856" /> only test, and the facts prove that little over half the houses have been built in the last three years compared with the last three years of inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>The publication last weekend of their policy by the Fine Gael Party has, we are glad to notice, evoked considerable comment.  We published that on the assumption it would be discussed and debated not merely in the House and in the course of the by-elections but that responsible persons in the community would express their views and examine it critically.  I notice comments in the <i>Irish Press</i> and somewhat similar comments made by a couple of Ministers to the effect that they feel it is not worth discussing. Yet, two of them devoted a great part of their speeches here yesterday to criticising that policy.  If it is not worth discussing, it is hardly worth the very strenuous criticism expressed about it. When I was speaking in Athy on Sunday night, I gathered from those listening that the Taoiseach, who gave an address there the previous night, spent most of his time criticising Fine Gael.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It had not been published then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Criticising Fine Gael, not the policy.  That part of the speech probably was not included in the script. In any event, it was not included in the published accounts.  But I understand that is what the audience heard. I suppose it is appropriate that the Minister for Justice said they were not going to steal any of the policy.  Having already stolen parts of previous policies, he has decided the larceny is going to stop.  Of course, this may be deathbed repentance.</P>
      <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i> today, in a very full analysis of the policy, expressed general approval of it.  I believe one of the comments, at any rate, deserves to be repeated.  It said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reduction of rates by grasping the nettle of health services and roads; fiscal reform founded on the wide-ranging recommendations of the Income Tax Commission: these will have to come sooner or later, and there is no reason why they should <Col N="857" /> be postponed&mdash;they call for hard work and hard thinking rather than hard cash.  The major, indeed revolutionary, schemes for health and social welfare are as feasible as they are desirable; they will cost money to establish but no more, it is fair to say, than was squandered during recent years in speculative industrial development, and being based on insurance they should not be a perpetual liability.  These four proposals offer a new deal to the salaried worker, the pensioner and all who live on the verge of poverty. We believe, with Fine Gael, that they can and should be implemented.</P>
    <P>When a responsible journal, representing a wide section of the reading public, expresses confidence in the proposals which have been put before the country, it acts as a stimulus to the consideration we have given of these matters and to the realisation that the proposals are practical and capable of realisation when implemented.</P>
    <P>One of the matters that has received insufficient attention in the course of the Minister's remarks, and, indeed, in the course of the debate generally, has been the amount it is proposed to spend as well as the policy it is intended to implement in respect of education.  It is recognised in the OECD Report there is a general recognition that there is a close connection between education and economic development all over the world.  There is, first, a growing social demand for education for its own sake. According as living standards rise, parents will demand better and more extended facilities for education for their children.  Secondly, it has been discovered that rapid economic growth and social progress depend to a very considerable extent on the educational foundation necessary to sustain it.  This means a number of countries&mdash;in particular, two countries with which we have close economic and other links&mdash;will be spending substantially more on education in the years ahead. It has been estimated that in France the expenditure on education will double over the next decade.  The Robbins Committee Report in Britain has already foreshadowed very substantial <Col N="858" /> increased investment.  Indeed, the proportion which will be expended on education and the increase in educational expenditure there is at present the subject of considerable discussion and comment both in political and educational circles.</P>
    <P>In this country we have few natural resources.  Most of our natural resources are already developed or in the process of developing.  Compared with other countries we have no great wealth of raw materials or minerals capable of being exploited.  We have, however, a highly intelligent people capable of being trained and qualified for technical and other employment if afforded the opportunity.  Our people are adaptable.  They have distinguished themselves in many spheres at home and abroad.  If we compare the investment we have made in material things, such as industry, agriculture, roads, housing, and so on, we find we have not made a comparable investment in education.  In fact, if we examine it, by any standard it will be seen our investment is less.</P>
    <P>I have previously quoted here the Supply Estimates figures for recent years as well as for 20 or 30 years ago and the proportion as distinct from the actual expenditure is less now than it was 30 years ago.  Admittedly since the war, State expenditure in other spheres has increased very substantially.  The investment that has already been made in agriculture, in industry, in housing, in the various State companies, will depend in the future for successful exploitation on the competence and skills of the persons who run and are employed in these enterprises.  In order, therefore, to exploit to the full the potentialities of these undertakings&mdash; most of them are in the process of growth; some of them are in a state of rapid expansion; and others have been developed to a very considerable extent&mdash;whose prospects depend on the overall skill and efficiency with which they are managed, it is imperative that we should increase the financial investment in primary, secondary, vocational and university education.</P>
    <P>Great stress has been laid in recent times on the need for competitive skill <Col N="859" /> and efficiency in the application of scientific and technological knowledge and training to agriculture and to industry in order to meet the challenge of the competition which this country must face if we are to export goods and produce competitively with the best offered elsewhere.  One of the factors we discussed earlier is that despite the efforts made, there still is a very substantial drain by emigration. That drain is likely to continue for a considerable time with large numbers of our people being obliged to emigrate.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that although there is a need for better trained and equipped personnel here, those who emigrate have better prospects of good employment, of stable jobs, of economic and social advancement, if they are trained and qualified for particular positions. Those who secure employment here will, by reason of their better qualifications, be assured of positions of higher standing.  Those who emigrate will be trained and equipped to withstand the training and equipment which those they compete with for positions have, both in Britain and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is vital therefore that a more enlightened and progressive approach should be made to the whole problem of education.  The matter has been the subject of a number of commissions in recent years and one of them is at present sitting.  It appears to me, however, that the delay inherent in these commissions, the procrastination involved in endeavouring to get agreement among a wide variety of people represented on them, is causing unnecessary postponement of the implementation of an approach that would provide the basis on which our future plans must be founded.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I wish to refer because it has been the subject of some comment by the Taoiseach recently, as well as by other Ministers, that is, the question of women and women's rights in the community.  There is general agreement that the part women play in the community is very considerable and that their employment in many <Col N="860" /> spheres reflects credit on their ability and skill as well as on their knowledge and capacity to fill the positions assigned to them.</P>
    <P>By our application for membership of the European Economic Community, we accepted, by implication, the directive laid down in the Treaty of Rome of equal pay for men and women for equal work.  As I understand it, it is agreed national policy that that decision should be put into operation.  However, recently there was a case where an arbitration award was made in respect of clerical officers employed by local authorities and for the first time a differential was introduced between male and female clerical officers.  I believe that decision is contrary to agreed national policy and, therefore, should not be implemented and that the Government should indicate clearly and unmistakably that an arbitration of this sort is contrary not only to national policy but to the principle to which, by implication, the House and the country agreed in the application which was made for membership of the European Economic Community.  I believe the award which was made is contrary to that principle.  It should be rejected and whatever action necessary taken in order to ensure that an award is made which will respect the principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy Cosgrave on having made a sensible speech which was in sharp contrast with the earlier speeches delivered in this debate by members of his Party, particularly that of his leader, Deputy Dillon.  As I could not be in the House yesterday I asked the Minister for Finance how the debate on the Vote on Account was going.  He told me it was the dullest debate in the history of the present Dáil, which rather surprised me because I thought that, in a by-election atmosphere, it would be somewhat different.  Apparently the spark of life which the Opposition Parties showed in the session before Christmas has died out rather abruptly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave rightly said that the Vote on Account affords a <Col N="861" /> suitable opportunity for reviewing the state of the economy, its progress in recent times and the prospects for the future.  I do not think any of us want to go into an elaborate examination of all our statistics.  The general picture emerges clearly enough. 1963 was a fairly good year.  The country went ahead.  The momentum of our progress which had faltered somewhat in 1962 picked up again.  Production increased in all sectors.  Our exports increased by £22 million or just 13 per cent over the 1962 figure.  Employment increased; the population increased.  An encouraging thing is that all indicators point to the probability that 1964 will be still better.  External and internal conditions appear to be combining to give us the prospect of at least maintaining the present rate of development and possibility of improving on it.  As Deputies know, it is customary for the Government to promise less than they expect to perform.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Corish speaking on Telefís Éireann last night about unemployment and he quoted the current number on the unemployment register as suggesting that something unusual and undesirable is occurring in that regard.  The fact is that for many of the weeks of this year so far the number on the unemployment register has been lower than for the corresponding week at any previous time.  I agree that that very favourable situation is in large measure due to the weather conditions which have prevailed and which obviated any interruption in outdoor constructional activity such as usually occurs at this time of the year.  What is perhaps more interesting is that manufacturers who have been asked to forecast their employment requirements during the year anticipate a rise in industrial employment, just as persons engaged in the construction industry also anticipate being able to afford increased employment this year.</P>
    <P>All the signs are that the objectives which we have set ourselves in respect of higher national production, higher employment, and an improvement in the living standards of the people, are <Col N="862" /> likely to be realised in this year, in reasonable measure.  It is, of course, inevitable that the effect of higher wages and rising employment on the level of internal trade will be beneficial and our retail traders are entitled to look forward to something in the nature of a boom year.</P>
    <P>Because the increase in wages and salaries which has been arranged, the 12 per cent which is now being generally applied not merely in private employment but to the public services, exceeds our reasonable expectations of the increase in national production during the two-year period for which the agreement operates, there will be some effect on prices.  This is inevitable. The important aim of policy must be to ensure that this effect on prices will be offset, so far as it can be done, by increased productivity and more efficient methods of operation everywhere.</P>
    <P>When we were discussing this matter before Christmas, I informed the Dáil that my view still held that a general increase in wages should not exceed the anticipated increase of national resources, and assuming that we would achieve a four per cent per annum rate of growth in national resources, or thereabouts, an eight per cent or nine per cent increase in wages over the two-year period would be appropriate, although, as I pointed out to the Dáil then and subsequently to the parties engaged in the negotiations, I considered some premium would be worth paying for the sake of a national agreement.</P>
    <P>The fact, however, that the rise in personal incomes is likely to be higher than the rise in resources means we have to expect some effect on prices. I have been exhorting manufacturers and producers generally, both in public and in private, to seek other solutions to the problem of rising costs than pushing up prices.  I am quite certain this can be done in very many instances; that by measures which will increase productivity, the effect of rising costs on prices can be minimised or eliminated&mdash;not in every case, but in many cases.  It would, of course, be a serious matter for the realisation of <Col N="863" /> our aims of national economic development if a rise in manufacturing or producers' costs here should have an adverse effect upon the expansion of our exports.  Indeed, notwithstanding the very encouraging jump in exports last year, it is important that we should achieve a not dissimilar increase this year and in each succeeding year.</P>
    <P>I have expressed the view that by adopting measures to offset the effect of rising costs on prices and taking note of the fact that price movements are also occurring in the countries to which we consign our goods, the relative competitiveness of our exporting trades and industries could be preserved.  I am not trying to suggest that all the problems have been solved.  Far from it.  One problem which has given the Government very considerable concern has been the difficulty of maintaining equivalence in the increase of incomes for persons engaged in agriculture and those engaged in non-agricultural pursuits.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that the ninth round of wage and salary increases will tend to widen the disparity between the incomes of farming families and of those engaged in urban occupations. One consequence of the ninth round is that the financial resources of the Government which might be deployed in some effort to rectify that position have, in part at least, to be diverted to the fulfilment of our ninth round obligations.  This is not a problem peculiar to ourselves.  It is one that has presented itself to the Governments of most countries in the world.</P>
    <P>Only a few days ago, President Johnson of the United States of America pointed out that in the United States the average incomes of farm families was only 55 per cent of the average income of urban families. In Great Britain, the amount spent by the British Government in price supports for agriculture has been reduced by £64 million.  The British Government appear to be running into some difficulty in the fulfilment of their policy of transferring the burden of maintaining farm prices from the Exchequer to the market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> Deputies are, no doubt, aware that in the European Economic Community, the desire of the national Governments to avoid any course of action which would have a detrimental effect upon farm incomes has been one of the complications in the completion of their agricultural marketing arrangements.  It is clear, therefore, that when far more wealthy and powerful countries than this have been unable to resolve this problem, it would be highly optimistic for us to expect we could do it.  Indeed, the difficulties are much larger here because of the much higher proportion of our total national income derived from agriculture, and the extent to which our agricultural prices are dependent upon conditions prevailing in export markets.</P>
    <P>No doubt Deputies will have seen the interesting document published by the NFA which sets out a number of proposals for the improvement of agricultural production and marketing arrangements.  This document is obviously the product of a great deal of work and thought and it is, therefore, deserving of very full and very careful consideration.  I do not wish to make any off-the-cuff comment on it except to say that the proposals in it are all being subjected to full and meticulous examination.  It is our intention later to have discussions with the NFA in advance of the finalisation of the Government's detailed policies for agriculture in the context of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>These discussions, however, must be directed not only to an examination of the soundness and the practicability of the proposals put forward but also to considering how the aims of improving agricultural production and of higher farm incomes can be achieved within a practical limit of cost.  I do not object in the least to the NFA or any other farming organisation putting forward schemes and ideas which would involve heavy charges on public funds &mdash;even impossible charges, when we consider the resources available to the Government.  That is their function, and they do not have to think where the money can be got.  That is the <Col N="865" /> Government's responsibility.  The Government will have to relate all these schemes to the taxation they may involve and to what is economically and, indeed, politically possible in respect of taxation even for the most desirable purposes.</P>
    <P>Financial possibilities are clearly very decisive and limiting factors in all these matters.  To the extent that agricultural development schemes involve a continuation or an extension of State subsidies, they have to be limited by financial considerations and the matter of priorities will also arise.  Again, it would probably be difficult for a farmers' organisation like the NFA to agree that any particular sector of agriculture is more important than another, or more urgently in need of Government aid.  In the last resort, the Government would have to take the decisions on that matter also.</P>
    <P>I think I can say with justification, having regard to the figures available to the Dáil, that the Government have given evidence of our intention to provide the necessary aids and support for Irish farming at this time when aids and supports are required. I do not know to what extent any part of the farm aids or price supports now available are included in Deputy Dillon's calculation of what constitutes wasteful expenditure.  The question of the extent to which taxation should be imposed for the purpose of supporting economic development in agriculture or elsewhere is a matter of acute political controversy at this time and I am sure that the National Farmers' Association are not unaware of our political situation.  Until that argument is settled, decisions on the proposals of the NFA or on other such schemes involving Government expenditure and further taxation must be postponed.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputy Dillon, who scoffed loudly at the agricultural targets set out in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and who declared them to be unrealisable, will have been disconcerted by the fact that the National Farmers' Association think we set our sights too low and that a much higher rate of expansion is realisable.</P>
    <P>During the course of the Christmas <Col N="866" /> recess, the Minister for Agriculture and myself had a series of meetings with representatives of the NFA designed to settle procedures for regular and useful consultations with the Department of Agriculture and the Government.  I think I can say that the outcome of these discussions was satisfactory.  The Government are concerned at the lack of unity and cohesion amongst farmers' organisations, and this applies particularly to the National Farmers' Association and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, which creates practical difficulties in the making of satisfactory arrangements for that type of close and regular consultations with farmers' organisations which it is considered desirable to have established. We do not regard it as our responsibility to bring about greater unity among farmers' organisations but we will continue to urge it and, particulary, that the NFA and the ICMSA should endeavour to resolve any difficulties there may be between them and so facilitate the holding of full and effective consultations with the Government on behalf of farmers generally.</P>
    <P>We recognise that the NFA has a special status amongst farming organisations insofar as it is interested in all branches of agriculture and we made it clear to them that we welcome the prospect of regular comprehensive consultations and discussions with them in connection with the formulation of agricultural policies in the broad sense as well as their practical co-operation in respect of the different aspects of agriculture.  This special status will be taken into account by us in appointing farmers' representatives on boards and so on.</P>
    <P>One of the matters we agreed with the NFA was that, when that body desired consultation with the Minister for Agriculture on any specific matter, with their agreement we should ask other farmers' organisations to be present and participate in these discussions, and this applies particularly to the ICMSA.  Similarly, when the ICMSA seek consultation with the Minister we will ask their agreement to have representatives of the NFA <Col N="867" /> present.  This, of course, cannot restrict the power of the Minister to convene joint discussions with two or more farmers' organisations, or to meet the representatives of any organisation.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the Government will arrange an annual meeting with representatives of the NFA to survey the general position and prospects of the agricultural industry.  This will not be an annual price review in the British sense, and the agenda will be prepared in agreement between the NFA and the Minister.  It is the common desire of the Government and the NFA that these meetings should develop along the lines of a broadly based annual review of our agricultural prospects.  It will be the ordinary practice of the Minister for Agriculture to invite representatives of the NFA to discuss with him pending changes of policy and proposed new schemes and to consider any representations they may make to him.  Of course, that may not be feasible in respect of arrangements that have to be made quickly or in other special circumstances.  The Government will continue to give financial assistance to the NFA to send their representatives to international conventions of farmers' organisations. In the applying of any particular plan for the improvement of agriculture when special understanding of the problems is required amongst farmers, the Minister for Agriculture will welcome the assistance of the NFA.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave today and Deputy Dillon yesterday spoke of the prospect that rates may rise in the coming year. I think that rising costs will make this very likely.  The Government have long been concerned with this problem of constantly rising rates, with particular reference to the rural counties. It was this concern with the constantly growing burden of the rate charge which led to our decision to increase agricultural rate reliefs, to provide more generous assistance to the cost of housing and sanitary services, of vocational education scholarships and of amenity expenditure and so forth, pending some more fundamental solution of the problem, if one exists.</P>
    <P>I think it right to point out that the <Col N="868" /> impact of rising rates on farmers has been eased greatly by the substantially improved allowances under the agricultural rates relief legislation.  The total amount of rates levied on agricultural land, because of these extended reliefs, in the current year is less than it was in 1956-57.  As Deputies are aware, the agricultural grant is allocated on the basis of the rates assessed on land each year so that the amount provided by the Government rises as the rate charge rises.  To that extent farmers are cushioned against further rate increases.  The whole problem is growing in acuteness and some solution must be sought.  I do not think a solution will be easy.</P>
    <P>The most direct method of preventing the rate charge in any county from being increased is to avoid increasing local authority expenditure.  I think I should say that, amongst those with whom I have had discussions on this matter, I found no general desire, even amongst those who are most vocal about rate increases, for any curtailment of local authority services.  On the contrary, there is a far more general desire for their continuing expansion and improvement.  The usual suggestion which is made, that of transferring some of the charges now falling on local rates to the Government, is not quite as easy as it sounds. The principle of local responsibility and decision in respect of local services is sound and to give authority to spend to local representatives who had not, and would not have the obligation of finding the revenue, or some part of the revenue which would be required, would lead to an unsatisfactory and unacceptable situation.</P>
    <P>Some movement of the burden of the cost of these services from the local ratepayers to the general body of taxpayers has been made and that movement will probably continue but the process must necessarily be slow and would have to be related to the general Budget situation which can never be ignored.  In this connection it may not be generally understood that the proportion of the cost of local services met by the Government has been steadily increasing.  Rates have been meeting a diminishing proportion of these costs.  In the case of county <Col N="869" /> councils, rates accounted for 45 per cent of the cost in 1938; 35 per cent in 1961 and 28.6 per cent last year.</P>
    <P>The suggestion of having a standstill in rates which the NFA have put forward would solve nothing, unless alternative revenues were suggested.  If the revenue from rates to local authorities is to be restricted in that way, a very sharp contraction in the scope of local services would be unavoidable.  There may be a possibility of opening new sources of revenue for local authorities.  If this could be done in a way that would be fair and practicable, it would seem on the face of it to be a better course.  An examination of these possibilities, including the study of how other countries have met the same problem, is now in progress.  The difficulties of providing a satisfactory level of local services in counties where the yield from rates is less than average are also being examined but in this matter also there is, I think, less than adequate appreciation of the extent to which the Government have taken action to share the load.</P>
    <P>Grants and subsidies paid to county councils in 1962-63 met 73 per cent of the expenditure in Leitrim; 63 per cent in Donegal and Mayo; 62 per cent in Galway and Kerry as against 52 per cent in Meath, 50 per cent in Louth and 28 per cent in Dublin.  This matter of the rising burden of local rates, as I said, is having very careful consideration and has been receiving it for some time and the inquiries which we have put in train are now nearing completion.  I certainly do not want to be taken as suggesting that we see at this time either an easy or quick solution.  The expectation of higher rates this year must be faced and only by a contraction of local expenditure may that be avoided or can the increase be minimised.  The Government are, however, very well aware of the problem and intend to push to a conclusion the investigations and examinations which are now proceeding so that firm decisions may be possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave said that the Fine Gael policy or programme, whatever they call it, is of such obvious interest <Col N="870" /> that people are commenting on it.  Let me say that if this is the policy or programme that they thought somebody might want to steal, they can now put their minds completely at rest.  The former Taoiseach used to tell a story about a Chinaman who stood on a street corner in Hong Kong holding up a dead cat and offering it for sale.  The people said: &ldquo;Who would want to buy a dead cat?&rdquo;  And he replied: &ldquo;I do not know.  I do not suppose anybody does but if you know somebody who wants to buy a dead cat, I have one for sale.&rdquo;  Deputy Dillon can continue holding out his policy like that Chinaman and I promise not to disturb him in the least.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say in this regard that I am glad that some distinction between our two Parties has at last been made.  Deputy Dillon's policy statement has made it quite clear that he conceives the business of Government to be that of tinkering with things, making adjustments there, putting a patch here and a twist somewhere else, whereas we think of it as an obligation to devise and execute a bold and comprehensive policy.  Even the leader-writer of the <i>Independent</i> saw that significance in the Deputy's policy statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the Deputy is still refusing to fulfil, what must be fulfilled by one who has his hopes of becoming Taoiseach in the near future, a very obvious obligation and that is to say what, when he becomes Taoiseach, he is going to use for money and how any of these vague ideas he has outlined or suggested are going to be financed.  Ninety per cent of the business of Government is deciding what it is possible to do in terms of money. Any of us could draw up elaborate schemes which anybody would say are magnificent and desirable but the problem is how to get them into operation, what priorities to establish when some regard must be had to financial resources.  A Party which will not face up to this responsibility should not expect to be taken seriously. All these wordy generalisations which <Col N="871" /> are contained in the small print of that document are completely meaningless, unless there is an intention on the part of the Party or its leader now, or sometime, to express them in terms of money or proposals for providing money.</P>
    <P>This has been a perennial problem with the Fine Gael Party.  They left Government in 1957 rather than face up to the big Budget deficit they foresaw in that year.  Deputies will remember that, as Deputy Corish reminded me recently, they had not been defeated.  They still had a majority vote here.  There was no obligation on them to seek a dissolution of the Dáil.  What happened was that they ran away from their responsibilities.  They knew from the circumstances at the time that they were certain to be defeated and they took this easy way out rather than face up to the problems of meeting the financial obligations of their Government.  They left the deficit for the Fianna Fáil Government to put right which we had to do by taking measures which were not regarded as popular but which certainly started off the economic revival which is now going ahead.</P>
    <P>The one fact which I think Deputies opposite must grasp if they wish to be taken seriously at all is that national progress in any sphere is not possible without money.  As far as I am concerned, I have no desire to stay in Government except to carry through a comprehensive programme of economic development, which cannot be done for nothing.  If the people of this country are not prepared to accept the sacrifice involved, which means accepting the taxation required, then, as far as I am concerned, I am quite prepared to bow myself out.  We cannot do the things we want to do here, increase employment, reduce emigration, develop industries, help agriculture and expand education and other social services, without money.  So far as we are concerned, we are being quite frank with the people: if they want these things they will have to be <Col N="872" /> willing to pay for them and the Government will certainly devise methods, including the taxation, of achieving them.  We will, of course, be concerned to ensure that the burden of taxation is never too heavy, never so heavy as to put a brake upon national progress.  This means, therefore, that we cannot do in any one year all the things we would like to do in that year.  We have to wait until the growth of the national resources makes it possible to provide the revenues required for the purpose.</P>
    <P>I would have some respect for a Party that would go out to the people and clearly say: &ldquo;Stop this progress just to save money, just to avoid the necessity for higher taxation.&rdquo;  That would be a logical position for any Party to take up.  It is one we could debate reasonably and sensibly.  But, if that is what the Fine Gael policy statement means, why have they not the moral courage to say it openly? There is one of our minor poets who once spoke about a man who wove himself a web of words to clothe his nakedness.</P>

      <P>It would be true to say that, while he did attempt to cover quite an amount of ground, the speech the Taoiseach has made is about the shortest speech on record from a Taoiseach, from the present Taoiseach in any case, in a debate such as this. Whether or not there is significance in the fact that there will be two by-elections next week, I do not know, but the speech he has just made was one of the Taoiseach's most reasonable speeches.  He may have method in that. <Col N="873" /> He is making his peace with the national farmers.  He appears to be trying to make an extra peace, should I say, with the trade union movement and, like a good politician, he has his eye on the electorate for next Wednesday, and for that nobody blames him.</P>
      <P>There has been quite an amount of talk recently about the production of policies, as if it were possible for Parties who all have more or less the same objectives to be able to distinguish in words so that one policy would look green, one would look red, one would look white.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, we agree with the objectives contained in this booklet.  There is no doubt in the world about that.  We do take exception to the method by which the policy would be pursued and how the money necessary to finance it would be raised.</P>
      <P>I am not here to defend the Fine Gael Party.  They have enough men within their own ranks to defend themselves.</P>
      <P>I do not regard what is called the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> as a policy, the type of policy the Taoiseach is asking of other Parties, a policy in which one describes how things are done.  That Programme does not describe how things are done. It is a statement of laudable objectives. Whatever may be the view of anybody else on this, as far as we are concerned, we agree that these objectives, and more, should be attained or that we should attempt to attain them.</P>
      <P>When this <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was introduced, it was suggested that the First Programme had been eminently successful. It was not successful.  I would give credit, as I have often given it before, to all Taoisigh and Ministers of State for the attempts they make to improve national production and consequently the standard of living of our people.  I do not think that there was anything revolutionary in the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> because the evidence is there that while national production went up by a certain percentage at the end of the five-year period, there were problems that were even greater than when the programme was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="874" /> The Taoiseach's predecessor often said that a Government can be judged to a very important extent by the number of persons who are employed and the number who are unemployed. I shall not dwell at length on the figures for unemployment but I should like to mention to the Taoiseach that during the period that the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was designed to cover&mdash; 1958-1963&mdash;100,000 persons emigrated. Granted, the Taoiseach may say that the Coalition Government were in office for so many years and so many more emigrated.  There were fewer persons at work when that Programme was finished than there were when it was started.  Therefore, I do not think it can be said that the First Programme was eminently successful.  Six years later, there are something like 61,000 unemployed.</P>
    <P>The position has not improved.  As a matter of fact, it is slightly worse, to the extent perhaps of hundreds, than the unemployment problem we had in 1962.  Emigration has been reduced. There is no doubt about that&mdash;the figures show it.  Again, we should be realistic and not say, as some Minister said yesterday, that the unemployment figures were something like 10,000 or 11,000 when on the same day a Government publication showed that emigration was still at the rate of over 80,000 per year.  Therefore I say that even this <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> with its very laudable objectives, is not a solution. Action is necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not know what action the Government will take.  They talk about consultation with the National Farmers' Association.  There is consultation with the National Economic Production Council.  Action may be taken there but nothing has yet emerged.  It is, if you like, cooperative effort between the trade union movement and the industrialists to get greater production but there is no new plan, and it is dishonest of Fianna Fáil to pretend that within this document there is some new plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that. What appears to me to be one of the two urgent problems is the finding of jobs quickly for our people.  I do not think the Taoiseach would say that we have been successful in providing jobs quickly.  I admit that as far as industrial employment is concerned, we have not done too badly.  We have increased jobs in industry but, on the other hand, in speaking about employment in the rural areas, we cannot console ourselves by saying that the flight from the land is a problem that is not peculiar to Ireland.  The fact that the problem is not peculiar to Ireland is of no consolation to people who need jobs. I would say that <i>vis-à-vis</i> Germany, France, Great Britain and other countries, the flight from the land in this country is greater and, therefore, we have a dual problem.  It is not being realistic to boast about the increase <Col N="876" /> in industrial employment unless we include the problem in rural employment.</P>
      <P>I say that as far as the objectives of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> are concerned, we certainly would go along with it.  The Taoiseach may say that we have not the responsibility.  We may not have responsibility in the near future for determining these things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that I welcome the Deputy's statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think that it is very ambitious of this country to say that we will have 78,000 more jobs by 1970?  I think that is a declaration of a vote of no confidence in ourselves.</P>
      <P>If that is the minimum, all right&mdash; but to say in black and white that the objective is to provide but 78,000 jobs by 1970 is a vote of no confidence in ourselves&mdash;and that, not any increase in 1970 compared with 1964 but an increase over 1960.  This is not full employment.  Full employment may appear a myth to all people or desirable to other people.  We should always attempt to get full employment for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is full employment. It is less than three per cent, which is full employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>My calculations are that it would provide for an unemployment problem of 3½ per cent.  I do not take issue with the Taoiseach on the half per cent.  It also provides specifically in this document that our annual emigration would then be running at about 10,000 persons per year.  If that figure represents those who would normally go, I accept it.  I have no information as to the normal rate of people leaving this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of bringing back people who have emigrated gets worse and worse as the years go by.  Because of the smallness of our population, we should try not alone to provide work for our people here but to attract some of our people back.  Those people who emigrated, particularly during the war <Col N="877" /> years, had an idea for some time that they could come back but many of them married and reared and educated their families in Great Britain and they may not now have a keen desire to come back.  Those who emigrated in recent years may have a hankering to come back and we should also keep our eyes on them.</P>
    <P>This booklet says the objective is to improve our living standards.  It provides for an increase in our national production.  Even if the objective is attained, we shall still have a standard of living far lower than that of Great Britain even at present or even two years ago, according to one of the tables here.</P>
    <P>It will take a tremendous effort to provide anything near full employment. It will take a tremendous effort to induce our people not to emigrate even to the extent of 10,000.  It will take a tremendous effort to improve production so that our living standards will approach those of Great Britain, France, Germany and other Common Market countries.  It is for that reason that I think the targets were set too low.  The late Deputy Norton said of the first programme that the targets were set too low, and the comment of the Taoiseach was that we were unrealistic.  He gave the lie even to himself because the objectives he set in 1958 were an improvement on what was stated in that programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as production was concerned, they were achieved. The First Programme provided for a gross rate of two per cent while actually four per cent was realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> We have advocated from time to time the need for greater planning.  I think the Taoiseach believes in planning. Whether or not he can get that through his Cabinet, I do not know. We were encouraged when the Taoiseach announced some 18 months ago that Government policy was due for a shift to the left.  Unfortunately, when he made that speech he compressed that remark into one sentence and never elaborated on it.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach will find a difference between the members of the Labour Party and himself regarding planning and Government intervention rather than the usual methods of assisting and guiding.  We have need for planners.  I do not suggest that the front bench of Fianna Fáil or of any Government would be capable of constituting the planning body we require. There are many men in this country who are experts in their own fields and in various fields whose abilities are not being fully utilised.  I am sure the Taoiseach knows the persons I have in mind.  They are brilliant men who can plan and advise Governments.  They may do so unofficially but not directly. These men could be used on a planning board.  Let them be independent of Governments but let their plans be subject to the approval of Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and even the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance here have so much to do already that they could not apply themselves to the general problem of planning for prosperity.  I could rattle off a dozen names of suitable men. Some are in semi-State companies. They have made the companies so successful that they now preside over them and the machine they created is running.  The abilities of such men could be utilised in a planning body to ensure that we would have a far greater increase in industrial and agricultural production than is envisaged.</P>
    <P>Many people may argue, as was mentioned by the Minister for Finance, that civil servants are the advisers. They collect the information and make the plans.  I am sure the members of every Party in this House who were in Government have the greatest <Col N="879" /> respect for civil servants and know their ability and devotion to duty but I do not think they are capable of the planning for industry and agriculture that our situation demands.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 115 of this document states that the Government propose to obtain the views of different organisations. The Taoiseach on that occasion said he would welcome comments and criticism.  Whether one regards the document as good or bad, it is unfortunate that there was very little comment on it.  I was one of the few who commented on it when it was published some time ago.  I did not notice that people from many organisations went into print or made speeches about it. Maybe the intention is that there would be discussion among different organisations and that the culmination might be a national development council.  However, the document did not create a great furore.  Even on the face of that document, I would welcome discussion from all organisations so that the Taoiseach and the Government&mdash;no matter what Government it might be&mdash;would have the views and, more important, the goodwill of these people, because I would hate to have any document like that regarded as a Fianna Fáil document, a Fine Gael document or a Labour Party document.  The intention should be to produce a document, even if it is only a statement of objectives, that would be accepted by the people and having been accepted by the people, would have their goodwill.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat surprised recently to read in one of the newspapers a speech made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in which he said something to the effect that the economy of this country depended on private enterprise.  I do not think the economy is dependent on private enterprise, or not absolutely dependent, but as I read that speech, that seemed to be behind the remark made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>This country has shown over the past 25 or 30 years that public enterprise has filled a big gap in the development of our economy.  For that reason, my colleagues and I in the <Col N="880" /> Labour Party have consistently advocated that we should engage more and more in public investment and public enterprise.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, as long as private enterprise is seen to be able to do the job, and as long as it produces the goods and gives employment, there is no necessity for any Government intervention, no necessity to think of nationalisation or any sort of interference.</P>
    <P>Private enterprise has an important part to play in the economy in this country&mdash;I do not know anything about any other country&mdash;but it has not done the job to the fullest extent. One can mention a score of industries in which private enterprise has done a tremendous amount for the economy but one can point to other sectors in which the job has not been done.  We should not be squeamish about this. We have to provide employment for our people.  In cases where private enterprise is not doing the job, the Government should intervene.</P>
    <P>The Government in this Blue Book said that their purpose is to assist, guide and persuade.  I do not know how many branches of private enterprise would be guided.  There are many firms who would not stir, despite any attempts made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to do this, that or the other thing.  We will have a particularly difficult situation if we are to continue stripping ourselves of tariffs in preparation for the Common Market, and certainly for free trade, when we remember the examinations carried out by the Committee on Industrial Organisation and the recommendations they made.  Are we to stand aside if these recommendations in the interests of employment are not accepted?  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce has rejected any suggestion of intervention.  In cases like that, in an attempt to preserve employment for Irish people, there must be intervention.  When people hear the term &ldquo;Government intervention&rdquo;, they throw up their hands in horror and there are references to either Communism or Fascism.  There is no such element in this.  The only element is justice.  Our responsibility is to give people the necessary means in order <Col N="881" /> that they may have a good standard of life.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in regard to these objectives that the Labour Party goes along with them but thinks that they are too modest.  We are particularly concerned about the development of education and training as mentioned in this Second Programme.  The Taoiseach was gracious enough about 12 months ago to pay a compliment to the Labour Party for the production of a comprehensive educational programme.  Shortly afterwards, a programme was produced by the Minister for Education, the one about which he spoke last week.  There was quite a lot in common between the two.  Again the Labour Party&mdash;I suppose because it is the Labour Party&mdash;want to go a great deal further in this matter of making education available to more people.  We trust that he and many others will come around and that there will be greater generosity by all concerned in order to provide education for the greatest number of people.</P>
    <P>The Blue Book envisages an increase in taxation.  I know that Fine Gael in their policy statement, and the Labour Party in many statements, and Fianna Fáil, know in their hearts that if new schemes in industry, agriculture or elsewhere, are to be introduced, they must be paid for.  We recognise that need.  I could get many a sharp retort about voting for this, that or the other in debates on recent Budgets, but as far as the Labour Party are concerned, they have established a principle with regard to taxation. We were accused on one occasion of voting against an increase in tax on cigarettes or something like that.  We did not vote for it because we believed that the moneys which would be raised would not be devoted to what we regarded as a needy section.  A fundamental difference between the Fianna Fáil Party and the Labour Party, and possibly the Fine Gael Party, is that we believe in a greater degree of direct taxation than is being employed at the moment.  I know the Taoiseach said that there was no great wealth in the country.  I admit that we have no business <Col N="882" /> tycoons or dollar millionaires as there are in the United States, nor have we the type of wealthy people they have in Britain, but there are a lot of people who could afford to pay more. The Taoiseach shakes his head and says &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  To him what might be procured by way of super-tax or excess profits tax or corporations profits tax or anything like that may be a mere bagetelle, but I believe as far as the turnover tax was concerned, that he took the easy way out.</P>

      <P>I know.  I refuse to believe that the Fianna Fáil Party are so bereft of ways of raising money that they had to resort to the taxation of these commodities which we mentioned over the past 12 months&mdash; the Taoiseach may say we mentioned them <i>ad nauseam</i> but this is still a live issue.  I wonder why the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach say that their policy is to increase indirect taxation more and more.  On that point let me say that there is indirect taxation and indirect taxation but the worst form of it is when you go down to tea, bread, butter, sugar, flour, clothing, medicines and such items. The Minister for Finance said that if he had to exclude food, the turnover tax would be 2/&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Ceann Comhairle told me that we could not discuss these things in detail.  I would hate the Taoiseach to think that I wanted to avoid the question of raising money.  In any case, the Taoiseach has heard, in the last few general debates, the general policy&mdash;I will not say the particular policy&mdash;of the Labour Party with regard to their method of raising money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may come back to industry for a moment and the seeming reliance of the Government, and particularly the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on private enterprise, I believe that there could be some method whereby <Col N="883" /> industry would be directed to particular areas.  I say that deliberately. I know the Government have, as part of their policy over the past ten or 15 years, persuaded, by very direct and persuasive methods, industry to certain parts of the country&mdash;to the west, for example&mdash;by frankly giving industrialists more money.  That was another way of attracting them.  I gave my views on that.  I do not think they were in accord with the views of the Government.</P>
    <P>Now, there are various areas which need industries and industries do not seem to be attracted to them, for what reason I cannot say, but these are places wherein you have skilled labour.  You have, first of all, a population, houses, schools, roads, electricity, water supplies, gas and so on.  These are valuable assets to a community. These are valuable assets to a nation. In such a situation, where a town appears to be declining, surely some action can be taken.  I think the Committee on Industrial Organisation recognises this.  They advocated the zoning of industry, the establishment of zones wherein industry would be located.  We will, I think, have to come back to that particular recommendation of the CIO and see how we can implement it.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many towns would be in the position I have described, except one, but there are many country and provincial towns which, for some reason or another, do not seem to be participating, despite all their efforts, in the industrial movement that has undoubtedly gone on over the past ten or 15 years.  As I say, they have assets&mdash;population and amenities&mdash;and an effort should be made to try to ensure that these towns will not alone keep their place, so to speak, but will move forward in the general industrial revival we are experiencing at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan has reiterated our oft-expressed view of foreign investment and I do not wish to labour this, but I honestly believe we are very generous both to our own and to those who come here from abroad in the <Col N="884" /> grants and loans we give.  I am not concerned with Government control in small industries, industries established at the £100,000 mark.  I believe, however, that in undertakings such as the Avoca Copper Mines and the Verolme Dockyard, big projects to which we give millions by way of loan, or otherwise, we should have some interest.  It seems we have no interest in the determination of policy and general administration.  That was exemplified particularly in the case of the Avoca copper mines in relation to which&mdash;the Government may have had other information&mdash;the people opened their newspapers one morning and discovered the project was gone.  I am not going to talk about reasons for that but I believe that in any case in which we give substantial amounts of money by way of loan or grant, we should make it appear, at least, that those who provide the money, the taxpayers, have some control or influence.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach seems to have reconciled the differences he appeared to have with the National Farmers' Organisation. He announced here today that he has had discussions with this organisation and that he proposes to have further discussions with them on the general promotion of the agricultural industry.  I have never taken exception to the amount of money spent on agriculture, but I have always had a feeling&mdash;indeed, I have some evidence and experience of it&mdash;that this money does not appear to be applied in a proper way.  That can be said, of course, in regard to industry and other things as well, but it is particularly true in regard to agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is always dangerous in this House to call a farmer &ldquo;a small farmer&rdquo; but, for the purpose of what I want to say, I shall describe as small farmers those with anything from 50 acres down to ten.  These are not getting their due proportion of the moneys being devoted to agriculture.  There are some &mdash;I do not know how many&mdash;who, because they have money, seem to be able to avail of every single grant and loan that is going.  What I say may appear to be advocating a means test, not in the strict sense in which it is <Col N="885" /> applied in the social services, but the moneys that are available for agriculture should be concentrated to a larger degree on the farmers who really need financial help.</P>
    <P>I will give the Taoiseach an example.  A farmer with 500 acres or 1,000 acres&mdash;a pretty substantial farmer&mdash;wishes to engage in some project which will cost £1,000.  The Government will give him a grant of £500 and he will be well able to avail of it because he has the initial £500.  On the other hand, the small farmer with ten or 15 acres, who wants to engage in a project costing £100, cannot avail of a grant of 50 per cent because he has not the initial £50 capital.  The bigger farmer, with a grant of only 25 per cent, would still be treated very generously.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I have made myself clear, but the Taoiseach, and some of his colleagues behind him, must know there ought to be an examination of the application of these moneys to the agricultural industry to ensure that the more modest farmer, as I shall describe him, gets his due share in accordance with his means in order to engage in the better production we all want.</P>
    <P>We have not much information&mdash; whether the Minister for Finance has it, I do not know&mdash;about the development of the major fishery harbours.  I suppose it is a cliché for me to describe it once more as the cinderella of our industries, but that is what it is.  Any money spent on developing our fisheries and on marketing our fish will be money well spent.  The programme, while it mentions fisheries, does not give any definite proposals or any information on the mooted development of four major fishery harbours over the past few years.  There will also have to be a better system of protection of our fishermen and their interests, especially if the limit is extended to six miles.  It was pathetic last week to hear the Minister for Defence state it was impossible to man another corvette.  If it means these chaps should be paid more, then it would be money well spent.  Our fishermen need to be protected better than they have been.</P>
    <P>Housing has been mentioned. <Col N="886" /> Those who need houses have been scandalously treated over the past number of years.  Housing is to some degree responsible for emigration.  The usual pattern in the provincial town is for the young married couple to go into a flat or live with their in-laws for three or four years before they are housed.  That is the type of accommodation to which they are doomed in the first years of their married life.  It seems to be very difficult to get down to the problem.  The responsibility is jointly held between the Minister for Local Government and the local authorities, and it is impossible for anybody to say who is at fault.  I think a reorganisation is necessary.  If we are to have development in industry, we shall need happy workers.  We must have contented workers.  A man who has been without a home for three or four years, plagued by a wife to get a job maybe, cannot be a good worker in industry.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has often said that as far as housing is concerned and as far as its relationship to industry is concerned, there is no problem from the point of view of money for capital development.  I would suggest one of the biggest problems we still have is the provision of housing.</P>

      <P>That is what I have said.  The Taoiseach has acknowledged that as far as capital development is concerned, money is no object.  But I wonder why in my town of 12,000 people in 1964, 19 years after the war, there are still 400 houses needed.  I would not be prepared to blame the local authorities.</P>

I am not suggesting it is the manager's problem or even the Minister's problem; but it <Col N="887" /> is a scandal to say there are still so many houses needed in Dublin, and Limerick and Cork have their problems as well.  We will still have this problem unless there is a great breakthrough. The Minister for Local Government is a reasonably successful Minister.  Being in the Opposition, I could not say more than that.  He seems to have energy enough.  But much more energy is needed to get finished with this problem once and for all.  Will we ever reach the stage when a young couple, who decide in June they are going to get married the following June, will know there will be a house for them?</P>

The damage was done because in the matter of building houses, continuity of employment was not provided. These chaps building houses who were laid off for three months could not put up with that sort of thing.  They wanted 12 months' work a year and they went to where offices were being renovated or reconstructed so that they could get continuity of employment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach talked about the possibility of an increase in the cost of living.  He suggested that a rise in prices seemed inevitable.  I am sorry he made a public statement about that.  This, again, may be a go-ahead signal for some people, although I am not saying the Taoiseach intended <Col N="888" /> it as such.  He has announced his intention in public and private to try to control prices by various methods, but he failed to mention the responsibility&mdash;maybe not the overall responsibility&mdash;the Government have for this.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, acting, I suppose, in accordance with Government policy, seemed to think it was something almost sacrilegious to attempt to control prices.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce will have to show himself stronger in this respect.  Undoubtedly, there was profiteering consequent upon the announcement that there was to be a turnover tax.  I am told that even yesterday some manufacturing firms notified increases to the extent of 12 per cent.  Surely 12 per cent, even in view of an increase in wages, is not justified in the case of many of the products made here?</P>
    <P>The weak warnings that have been given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce have been laughed at by the trade and by shopkeepers.  I do not think there is anything wrong in investigating prices.  The Minister thinks there is.  The workers have accepted unanimously, one might say, the agreement negotiated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions at the conference recently which gave them an increase of 12 per cent.  The Taoiseach thought in December that if they got anything like eight per cent.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That was not the impression here and it was not the impression of the Congress.  The workers through their trade unions, have agreed that this agreement will be in operation from two to two and a half years.  If the workers give a guarantee that providing everything goes well, they will not seek a tenth round increase for 2½ years, there should be some declaration from the Government to the effect that they will keep their eyes on prices and, where necessary, will investigate and control them.  I do not think that is unreasonable.  The Taoiseach must know the workers of Dublin better than I do.  If there is, in fact, an abnormal increase in the cost of living&mdash;I am not trying to provoke trouble&mdash;the unions will be forced to go for another increase.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it is too much to ask the Taoiseach this.  He seems to be wedded to a turnover tax. The Tánaiste said in Dublin&mdash;I understand he is not allowed go to Kildare &mdash;that the people had now accepted the turnover tax.  I do not know whether that is true or false.  Suppose it is true that they have accepted the 2½ per cent, will they accept five per cent?  If we are speaking in terms of stability of prices and wages, does the Taoiseach now say the turnover tax is to be a permanent feature of our taxation machinery?  Will the Taoiseach give a guarantee that in the next Budget the turnover tax will remain at 2½ per cent or will there be an increase?</P>

He cannot give a guarantee that it will remain at 2½ per cent for all time.  Fine Gael and, in particular, the Labour Party have denounced the turnover tax as an imposition on certain items.  The Taoiseach should try to mend his hand in that respect and even, at this <Col N="890" /> late stage, consider taking the turnover tax off the necessaries of life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four major criticisms that can be made of the Government's economic and financial policy.  The Government have failed to undertake any proper economic plan.  Instead, they have contented themselves with what they call an economic programme.  Secondly, the Government's economic programme is based on a decline in social investment. Thirdly, the Government's fiscal policy is based on a preference for indirect as against direct taxation.  Fourthly, it has failed to make any improvement in our banking system.</P>
      <P>It must be made clear, because discussions sometimes take place in language loosely used, that in fact the Government's programme is what is called and defined in its Blue Book as a programme.  It is not an economic plan.  In the statement published by the Government, after certain criticisms had been made of their programme, they stated on 30th August last year that what they had just produced was a general statement of the principles and objectives proposed in the economic and social field for the period 1964-1970.  On page 9 of its programme it defined what it meant by the term &ldquo;programme&rdquo;.  It said:</P>
      <P>Objectives and priorities are outlined but the programme does not&mdash;</P>
      <P>And this was a masterpiece of understatement.</P>
      <P>&mdash;in every instance specify targets and how they are to be attained but rather is it educative and indicative ... Targets may be set for the main sectors of the economy but it would be unrealistic to break these down into targets for individual enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words &ldquo;economic planning&rdquo; are not used in the document at all until the second last page and then only apparently in a rather loose way and almost, it would appear, inadvertently. The distinction between economic programming and economic planning is not merely a question of nomenclature. We are not just engaged in a semantic exercise.  There is very considerable difference in the techniques involved. <Col N="891" /> Economic programming is merely a statement of the aims and objectives; economic planning is conscious management of the economy in order to obtain these economic and social ends.</P>
    <P>In the statement which the Government issued after the Second Programme was published and after the Taoiseach had his press conference, it was stated that there would be a further document.  It was stated that it would be published &ldquo;early next year&rdquo; giving as much detail as was reasonably practicable of the policies to be applied in the major sectors.  This supplementary publication would also contain projections of the public capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that the Government did not know that its First Programme was going to come to an end.  One would have thought that the Government did not realise that it was only for a specific number of years.  In fact the Government allowed their First Programme to run out; then produced their second one and said : &ldquo;We are not yet ready with the details of the projections of the public capital expenditure.&rdquo;  They were promised in August of last year &ldquo;early this year&rdquo; and now we are told by the Taoiseach that it is intended that they will be published in May of this year.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the discussions going on in the National Industrial Economic Council will produce good results but the major criticism which has to be made against the Government in this regard is that, in fact, all the Council is intended to do is to try to ascertain what these general targets are, and whether the various sectors of the economy will be able to reach these targets.  There is no conscious effort at proper economic planning to ensure that these targets are realised.</P>
    <P>It was rather extraordinary to see the Taoiseach's statement at the inaugural meeting of the National Industrial Economic Council, where he said that its first task would be to advise the Government on how the targets could be realised or, if possible, surpassed.  Perhaps it would be a useful <Col N="892" /> thing for a Government to have a council such as this to advise it as to how their targets could be realised but certainly it is the task of the Government, if they are doing the work properly, to plan adequately for the achievement of the objectives which none of us is against and which all of us would like to see surpassed.</P>
    <P>If the economy were expanding at a satisfactory rate, if full employment had been achieved and if emigration had been brought to a standstill, then it would be unnecessary to advocate economic planning, but we are far from achieving those ends.  The figures which have been quoted here on many occasions indicate that notwithstanding the improvement in industrial employment over the past two years, the overall picture of the numbers of persons at work in this State indicates a decline each year.  Notwithstanding the improvements in certain sectors of the economy, such improvements are not matched by improvements elsewhere. There was a state of decline over the years in the numbers of persons at work, coupled with large-scale emigration.</P>
    <P>One of the things about emigration is that at some stage Government spokesmen will say : &ldquo;You cannot use the figures for net passenger movement. They are unreliable.  You must wait for the figures in the census which are produced only every five years or so.&rdquo; Government spokesmen will say that when the figures for net passenger movement indicate a high level of emigration but when the figures for net passenger movement go down, the Government use those for the purpose of suggesting there is a drop in emigration. It would be most desirable that that type of practice be dropped and if it were made plain and specific by some independent economic survey exactly what figures can be relied on.</P>
    <P>The figures very frequently quoted in this connection are the figures produced by the British authorities.  I have seen criticisms made of these figures but, of course, the figures produced by the British authorities, as Deputy Cosgrave points out, give a very different picture from that given <Col N="893" /> by the figures of the net passenger movement by sea.</P>
    <P>Although there has been this improvement in the past few years, we are not anything like approaching what we need in respect of employment opportunities.  If we were, it would be unnecessary to suggest this economic planning which I believe is necessary to bring about this situation. In this connection also, it is important to take note of the progress of the economy in the past few years.  There have been increases in the gross national product over the past few years but the trend is important.  The increase in 1959 was 4.5 per cent; in 1960, 5.6 per cent; in 1961, 4.8 per cent; in 1962, 2.5 per cent.  There has been since 1960 a serious decline in the rate of progress in our economy and in 1962 the rate of progress was only 2.5 per cent over previous years.</P>
    <P>From the quarterly report of the Central Bank, we obtained yesterday provisional figures which indicate that perhaps last year the economy had again picked up, as the Taoiseach said, and had expanded perhaps by 3½ to four per cent.  These figures, of course, are provisional.  Figures which the Central Bank quoted in its report last year were revised, and revised downwards when the national income figures were produced.  The point is that we have had a steady decline in the rate of growth in the past few years, that we did in fact have an expansion in the years 1959 and 1960 and then this decline was brought about which has been noticed and commented upon.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank at page 7 of its report last year referred to it and pointed out that the slowing down in the rate of development could be attributable to less favourable conditions in the United Kingdom and a gradual weakening of the factors which contributed to the more rapid growth of earlier years, such as the availability of unused productive capacity.  The figures which the Government trot out saying: &ldquo;Oh, you take an average; you strike an average; and find an average increase of four per cent since 1958&rdquo;, are not reliable in that they <Col N="894" /> start off for the period which the Central Bank referred to as a &ldquo;period of unused productive capacity&rdquo; which we have now used up.  We are now facing a situation where the rate of economic growth is declining.</P>
    <P>The report of OECD on Ireland last year pointed out the same thing.  Paragraph 25 reads:</P>
    <P>But certain particularly favourable factors have been operating during recent years and it is important that growth should be able to continue even though some of them are likely to weaken from now on.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, in my opinion, it would be a dereliction of duty to do nothing but merely hope for favourable conditions to return.  Last year the rate of increase was four per cent or 3.5 per cent.  The year before it was 2.5 per cent.  What are the Government doing?  Did they do something in 1962 that they did not do in 1963?  The answer is that they did not.  The answer is that the Government are jogging along, depending largely on conditions in the British market&mdash;if conditions are buoyant in England, conditions in this country are favourable.  That is not good enough.  If we could produce conditions here without the necessity for large-scale planning, it would be all right, but I think the figures clearly indicate that we are in a position where our rate of growth is not by any means ensured.  We have provisional figures for an improvement last year, but they may not be proved accurate, and if they are, there is no guarantee that the improvement will continue this year.</P>
    <P>One further very important aspect of the problem of our economic development to which not enough attention is given, is the fact that such a small percentage of our gross national product is devoted to fixed capital formation.  A very distinguished economist from the Economic Research Institute produced a paper which dealt to some considerable degree with the problem to which I am referring.  The author pointed out that fixed capital formation in this country in relation to <Col N="895" /> gross national product was well below the investment achieved in other countries.  I know there has been an improvement since then.  It was written in 1959.  I know the provisional figures produced yesterday would indicate that we are getting close to the European average, but it is quite clear that we cannot allow a position to continue in which we are not investing enough in the country to produce sufficient wealth and sufficient employment opportunities.  We cannot merely continue to carry on without organising our economy properly.</P>
    <P>That fact is very frequently lost sight of because of the figures in the Government's capital Budget.  We see figures in the Government's capital Budget each year, and we think the Government are investing a great deal of money in the country on capital items and worthwhile developments. In fact, the figures in the Budget are very misleading because quite a proportion of the so-called capital Budget is not investment at all.  It is merely an accountancy device in regard to unpalatable taxation.  I refer in particular to the amount of money spent on the eradication of bovine TB.  I am not saying for a moment that it is wrong that that should be treated as a capital item.  I am saying it is misleading to take figures in the capital Budget of the Government and say that because of those figures, you are increasing the capital formation of the State.  Quite a portion of the capital Budget does not create fixed capital formation at all.</P>
    <P>I therefore advocate that we should establish a Ministry of Economic Affairs.  Under that Ministry, there should be a fully qualified expert planning board, and the Minister for Economic Affairs and the planning board should be responsible for drawing up and carrying into operation detailed economic plans for all sectors of the community.</P>
    <P>The second criticism which I make of the Government's policy is that it is based on a principle which I believe is wrong, the principle that there should be a deadline in the social capital investment.  That is the fundamental <Col N="896" /> basis of the Government's economic programme.  It is stated very clearly and specifically in the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> which was published and repeated in the second.  On page 8 of the First Programme, it is stated:</P>
    <P>The social capital investment of past years has given us an &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; of housing, hospitals, communications, etc., which is equal (in some respects, perhaps, superior) to that of comparable countries. What is now required is a greater emphasis on productive expenditure which, by increasing national output&mdash;particularly of goods capable of meeting competition in export markets&mdash;will enable full advantage to be taken of that infrastructure and in due course make possible and, indeed, necessitate its further extension.  The expected decline in social capital expenditure in the coming years will afford an opportunity&mdash;and underlines the necessity &mdash;of switching resources to productive purposes.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment wish to suggest that we should not make money available for productive investment, but I say that principle is wrong, the principle that our social capital investment must decline.</P>
    <P>It is to be noted that that underlying principle is again referred to in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> which was produced last year.  Paragraph 109 states:</P>
    <P>In the sphere of capital expenditure, public authorities will observe the fundamental principle laid down in the first programme that priority must be given to capital outlay which is not merely necessary but also productive in the sense of yielding an adequate return to the community in competitive goods and services.</P>
    <P>Social capital investment is not productive in the sense of &ldquo;yielding an adequate return to the community in competitive goods and services.&rdquo; Quite clearly, what the Government were saying there&mdash;but saying in a rather elliptical way&mdash;was that they were continuing on this basic principle <Col N="897" /> that social capital investment would decline and more money would be available for productive investment.</P>
    <P>The Government were highly successful in that policy, and I can give figures to prove it.  In 1956-57, Dublin Corporation supplied 1,564 dwellings; in 1960-61, that figure had declined to 277.  There was a drop in social capital investment in Dublin city and elsewhere.  The Government were successful in putting through that policy.  I disagree with those who say the Government are not responsible for the housing situation in Dublin.  Some Deputies have tried to blame Dublin Corporation.  We know that what has happened in the local authority in this city has happened in the local authorities throughout the whole country.  They are directed and controlled by the Department of Local Government, and that Department have been putting into operation the declared Government policy that there will be a decline in housing.</P>
    <P>The third major criticism that can be made against the Government is that they are favouring indirect taxation as against direct taxation.  It is part of the Government's financial policy that if they have to increase taxation, it will be by indirect taxation rather than direct taxation. That was made specific by the Minister for Finance in the financial statement last year.  Again, when addressing the dinner of the Dublin Stock Exchange on 21st November last year, the Minister, referring to the increased corporation profits tax, said that this represented a limited and exceptional departure from the fiscal policy of recent years of reducing direct taxation.</P>
    <P>It can be argued that a reduction in direct taxation helps to stimulate savings and initiative.  I know the type of argument that can be put forward to justify a reduction in the rate of direct taxation but the fact is that if the Government believed that they would not have increased the corporation profits tax last year.  If the Government believed that by increasing the corporation profits tax <Col N="898" /> they would have curtailed production in the country, they would not have done so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not go into any further detail, Sir, except to say that the Government have reduced direct taxation and increased indirect taxation.  That is economically harmful and it is nonsense to suggest, as the Tánaiste has tried to do, that increases in direct taxation are going to hit the workers more than anybody else just because there might be more people who have to pay income tax.  The fact is that it is the poorer sections of the community who are hurt by a policy of indirect taxation.</P>
      <P>It is very significant that the statement which the Taoiseach made, providing for a move to the left, was made at a time when the Government were embarking on a most reactionary financial policy.  That statement was an endeavour to hide the reality that the Government's financial policy was bringing about conditions which were harmful to the poorer sections of the community and that they were being hurt for the benefit of those who were well off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also referred to the banking system in this country.  This is not any doctrinaire request for State control over our financial institutions but it should be borne in mind that our banking system is unique.  There is nothing like it anywhere else in the world.  There is no advanced country, and we like to think of ourselves as an advanced country, whose Government have not got control over the credit policy of the commercial banks.  Our Government's power is only a power of exhortation and it has no way other than by exhortation of influencing the <Col N="899" /> credit policies of the commercial banks.  That is one of the most important difficulties in our economic development.</P>
    <P>If we are to get sustained development, our banking policies should be integrated in our national economic policy to ensure the maximum rate of economic growth.  We are going to run into balance of payments difficulties again.  It is in the nature of things that we will have these difficulties from time to time.  Now is the time to get the machinery ready to deal with that crisis, not when the crisis is upon us. It is obvious that we have only very crude and unwieldy instruments at hand to deal with such a crisis if another one came upon us and, if it does, measures may have to be taken which would be excessive because our banking system is not integrated in our national economic policy.</P>
    <P>If the commercial banks start losing their external assets, they start reducing loans and investments at home thereby causing a deflationary situation. That could be avoided if we had a proper banking system.</P>
    <P>The criticisms which I have made of the Government are fundamental. They are intended to show that the Government are unwilling to accept the consequences of their own actions. As Deputy Corish pointed out, there is not much point in talking about the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  That programme was drafted by economists and the economists who drafted it are to be congratulated on their work but this is not an economic policy.  It is merely an economic exercise as to how we could best achieve the target of 50 per cent increased production proposed by OECD for the Irish economy.  We want more than that.  We want a policy which will give us sufficient production to give proper living standards to our people.  The Government are not willing to accept the consequences of their actions; they do not want to adopt the policy which is necessary if our people are to get decent living standards.  Because they are not prepared to do that, the sooner they leave office to those who are prepared <Col N="900" /> to do it the better it will be for the country.</P>

      <P>In case the public might be under any illusion, it is well to warn them that this debate is being dealt with on the basis of the forthcoming by-elections and quite apart from the usual discussion on the Vote on Account.  The issue in Cork and Kildare is a very simple one.  The question for the people in those areas to decide is whether they want Deputy Seán Lemass to continue as Taoiseach of this country or whether they wish to replace him by Deputy Dillon.  The personalities of the candidates do not enter into it to any great extent.</P>
      <P>The statement of the Taoiseach informing the voters in what circumstances he would have a general election has changed the whole aspect of this campaign.  I do not think there are many people who honestly desire a general election but it is as well to bring home to those people concerned in these vital by-elections that they have a very heavy responsibility on this occasion and, as the Taoiseach has stated, if we lose the two by-elections, there will be a general election forthwith.  It might well be&mdash;I do not know if this would be unique&mdash;that if Fianna Fáil lose the two seats, the successful Opposition candidates would never take their seats in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I submit the country cannot afford to lose the leadership of the Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass.  It cannot afford an interruption in the economic programme and planning initiated by him in the main.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, the Leader of Fine Gael issued a manifesto stating what the Fine Gael policy was.  This was a very belated effort and it was only after considerable prodding by members on this side of the House, by political correspondents of newspapers and, I understand, by his own Party members that it was decided to publish this election address or statement of policy.  As the Taoiseach referred to it recently, I do not want to go into it in detail.  Few people <Col N="901" /> read these long-winded statements. We would read them to see if we could catch them out on anything; their own supporters would read them; but the ordinary man in the street will not wade through long documents going down to the small print which is somewhat like a hire-purchase document, only the conditions are far more onerous and, at least, in a hire-purchase agreement, if you do read the small print, you know your commitments. From this bill of sale, the Fine Gael statement on the Utopia they promise, there is one serious omission.  They give no indication of what form of taxation they intend to adopt or by what means they intend to raise the necessary revenue to fulfil their plans.</P>
    <P>I think the Fine Gael policy statement has done them a lot of damage. Nowadays, we who fight elections realise that voters are becoming more astute and the reaction to the Fine Gael manifesto was, to some extent, one of cynicism.  The ordinary citizen will not be fooled by these promises of a Fine Gael heaven-on-earth. He has been educated to understand that any progressive plan which necessitates spending a substantial sum of money must be accompanied by measures to finance the development.  That is elementary and people do not want it repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>.  I think it is generally agreed that distaste is the reaction to the belated effort of Fine Gael in putting this policy before the people.</P>
    <P>I watched Deputy Corish, the leader of the Labour Party on Telefís Éireann last night and listened to his two candidates, Mr. Norton and Mr. Hurley.  It was interesting to watch; I thought they were quite good.  He did make the suggestion that there was no direct relationship between the turnover tax and expenditure on housing and schools and the economic life of the country generally.  He suggested that Fianna Fáil were dishonest and misleading the public in suggesting these very important social developments were dependent on the turnover tax.  He could not be allowed to get away with that statement.</P>
    <P>We know that if loans are raised for <Col N="902" /> housing from the public, these loans, whether spent on housing or schools or other forms of capital development, must be funded.  We also know that is not done from capital but from current expenditure and taxation in the main.  If increases are given to State employees, those increases are not paid out of capital but must be met out of current expenditure.  I have found Deputy Corish to be reasonable and fair in political argument or discussion. He will agree it is very important that it should be realised that the funding of the social welfare payments comes from current taxation.  If social services are increased by £5 million or £6 million, that must come out of taxation. It is as well to remind him and other Deputies and the people generally, particularly the voters in these vital elections on 19th February, that the turnover tax and taxation generally have a very direct bearing on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish has pressed the Taoiseach time and again for clarification on certain points.  The Taoiseach has answered him to the best of his ability, possibly not as fully as Deputy Corish would wish at times.  On the other hand, I feel that Deputy Corish should clarify his position to the Irish people in a better manner than he has done up to now.  There are people who have supported the Labour Party and will continue to support them who are anxious about what the political set-up might be in the future.  That, of course, is hypothetical and may be slightly outside the terms of the debate but I do think that Deputy Corish, in criticising us as a Government, might pay attention to the negative policy of the Fine Gael Party and should accept the responsibility he has to state what his position and his Party's position would be in the unlikely contingency of Fine Gael depending for support on a substantial group not within their Party.</P>
    <P>I could answer to a very large extent for, I would say, over one half of the Labour Party whom I personally know. I know that they would not vote for Deputy Dillon to be Taoiseach of this country but we have to look ahead and each political Party has to make its <Col N="903" /> position abundantly clear to the electorate.  I submit that Deputy Corish has not fully performed that exercise as yet.  There are doubts as far as he is concerned.  There are no doubts as far as some of his followers are concerned.</P>
    <P>I think the Labour Party, in the main, and their supporters throughout the country would not tolerate another conglomeration, another form of coalition Government but the last paragraph in the <i>Irish Times</i> interview with Deputy Corish was weak enough.  Perhaps some of his followers, before this debate concludes tomorrow, will be more explicit.</P>

      <P>The Vote on Account comes every year and I suppose this time next year there will be further changes.  However, I think I have stressed the point sufficiently and when Deputy Corish reads what I have said he will appreciate the point and try to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave, in a very sound and reasonable speech, suggested that one of the drawbacks of the Government today was that we were not spending enough money on education. Everyone will subscribe to that.  Yet, as the Minister for Education has pointed out, more is being spent this year on education, on grants to universities and grants to vocational education committees than ever before. The number of schools being built at the present time is an all-time record and it appears that in the years ahead there will be an annual upsurge in the number of schools built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I wish to make is that on the one hand there is this very vehement condemnation of Government spending by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Dillon, and on the other hand the more or less contradictory suggestion by Deputy <Col N="904" /> Cosgrave that the Government are not spending enough money on education. It would be well for the Fine Gael Party if their Leader, Deputy Dillon, and Deputy Cosgrave resolved their differences as far as their attitudes in regard to the spending of money are concerned.</P>
    <P>In passing, I might say that Deputy Cosgrave should remember that the Government of which he was a member, the last Coalition Government, cut the capitation grants for secondary schools by ten per cent, which was a substantial amount.  I can imagine the uproar there would be in this House if the Fine Gael Government were to cut capitation grants for secondary schools by 10 per cent.  In fact, all the urging nowadays is that the State is too niggardly towards secondary education and the cost of building secondary schools.  We have been urged on all sides to increase the subventions and to allocate grants on the same basis as applies in the case of national schools.</P>
    <P>I pass over the rhetorical question: Who wants an election?  Do Fine Gael really want one?  I know some of their supporters who do not.  Possibly the Front Bench of Fine Gael may want an election.  That is human nature. They are quite entitled to hope and to have ambitions like everyone else. There is nothing wrong in that.  I have found from discussion with Fine Gael supporters&mdash;with very many of them, I am glad to say, particularly those in business&mdash;that they do not want a general election.  They are satisfied the country is economically sound.  They do not want the progressive plans interrupted.  They consider it would be the wrong time to have a general election.  I think each and every one of them knows in his heart that there was never a time when the Irish people were so well off and when we could say there was a new air of prosperity in the country.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party must admit that general elections are upsetting not only to us politicians but to the economy of the country.  Some thousands of young voters have come on the register for the first time on this occasion.  I suppose there are some <Col N="905" /> thousands who, since the last election, will be voting for the first time and, before that, some thousands cast their votes for the first time.  It is our duty to remind these young people of the position when we took over Government in 1957.</P>
    <P>We recall that the Coalition Government was not defeated in this House.  We recall that they left office two years before their time was up&mdash; leaving not alone a deficit of some £11 million to be met by their successors but the unprecedented figure of 97,000 unemployed.  There was a financial crisis.  The Government of the day was responsible in the main for the mismanagement of their financial affairs and the economy of the country suffered accordingly.</P>
    <P>It would be well to remind the people concerned in these by-elections that they have a tremendous responsibility as to their decision.  They are not voting for personalities or individuals.  Let us put it clearly. They are voting either for Deputy Seán Lemass as Taoiseach of this country or Deputy James Dillon.  Let us get down to those basics.  Anything else is absolutely irrelevant.  Amidst no protest, I said I wondered how intelligent men&mdash;and they did have and do have intelligent men in the Labour Party&mdash;could succumb a second time to the temptation to join a Coalition Government.  One would imagine that their experience in the period 1948 to 1951 would have been enough for them.  For them to return and take part in the fiasco of the Coalition period from 1954 to 1957 is beyond comprehension.  I do not think a member of the Labour Party, in the light of experience gained, could in any way in the future have any truck with Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>Remember, the whole mentality of the Fine Gael Party is opposed to the worker: Deputy T.F. O'Higgins might disagree with that.  The whole image of the Fine Gael Party in the public mind is that of a tired Party with a negative policy.  The image is of many of their members seeing no future for Ireland and constantly weeping and wailing but with no cures for an improvement in the welfare of the country. <Col N="906" /> I welcome the Labour Party's appreciation at long last that they could no longer be political bed-fellows with Fine Gael.  We recall statements by some of their leaders&mdash;leaving Deputy Dillon out for the moment.  We think of their former Minister for Industry and Commerce who said quite openly and unashamedly that it is not the function of a Government to provide work for anybody.  Does Deputy T. F. O'Higgins subscribe to that view?  It is the avowed policy of Fianna Fáil that it is the responsibility of a Government to provide employment for their people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;here at home. We have been remarkably successful in the past few years.  I am amazed at the audacity of Deputy T. F. O'Higgins even to inject a sarcastic remark, in view of the fact that he was a leading member of the ill-fated Coalition of 1957 which left 100,000 unemployed and which ran from Government before the time was up.  At the same time as the 100,000 unemployed were here, we had emigration at an unprecedented rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the unemployment figures today are anything but such as would allow us to be complacent, they are within manageable proportions.  The old cliché that there is nobody left to emigrate will not cut any ice.  The figures for emigration today are far less than one-third of those which obtained in Deputy O'Sullivan's Government's period of office.  That is why at last your former friends in Labour have deserted you.  That is why the writing is on the wall for the Fine Gael Party.  Above all, the young people today are logical.  I have often heard them say at various discussion groups of a non-political nature, at Tuairim meetings and university debates: &ldquo;How could Fine Gael be a good Government when they were not even a good Opposition?&rdquo;&ldquo;It is no function of the Government to provide work for anyone&rdquo;&mdash;are the words still uncontradicted, of the former Fine Gael Minister for Industry and Commerce who is still a member of this House.  Indeed, the same Minister was <Col N="907" /> described by the late Deputy Norton, ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam, as an industrial tank going around the country levelling factory after factory until there was very little left of industrial Ireland by the time he had carried out his operations.</P>
    <P>But that is not all.  Almost in the same breath the same Fine Gael Minister for Industry and Commerce went further.  He said people might have to die in this country and that it was not the Government's responsibility to make the necessary provision to see that they did not.  If this is the uncontradicted policy of a Party which is now trying to gain control of the Government of this country, then if the people swallow that they are welcome to them and they deserve them.  I do not think that will happen.  It is our duty to see that it does not and it is our duty to try to remind the voters and the people generally of this policy. We do not want to fight any of these old wars, be they civil or any other type of war.  We want to get the policies of the different Parties over to the people and if a Party such as Fine Gael refuse to publish their policy, or to state their policy, it is the duty of the Fianna Fáil Party to try to show the public what that policy has been and could be again and to show that any relationship between this small print publication, this hire purchase agreement, which was published in the last few days by them and the Fine Gael policy in past years is purely coincidental.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish mentioned private enterprise and he purported to quote from a speech by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and suggested the Minister said that the whole economy was based on private enterprise. The Minister did not say that. What he did say was that it was the policy of this Government, and has been their continued policy, and that we accept the principle, that private enterprise was to be encouraged; that we accept the principle of private enterprise and the profit motive, but that only where private enterprise was unable to bridge a gap, or were not interested, or were unable to carry out <Col N="908" /> their function, would the State step in. By reminding some of the Labour Party&mdash;and they need reminding&mdash;of some of our ventures, and in the main very successful ventures, into State boards or State bodies, I think they will realise that we would not hesitate to initiate such State developments, should we find them necessary, as we have done in the past.  I was reading the figures the other day and I was amazed to find that there are some 60 State or semi-State boards, bodies or such organisations today.  It is quite a large number.  Admittedly, some of them are of an advisory nature, or charged with promotional activities as opposed to purely commercial functions, such as in the case of Irish Shipping, Aer Rianta or Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  It is a matter of pride for such men as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dr. Ryan, that these tremendously successful State enterprises were nearly all initiated by a Fianna Fáil Government. You could name them in a few minutes : Irish Shipping, the Sugar Company, Aer Lingus and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I said at the outset, the issue in the election boils down to whether the electorate require Deputy Seán Lemass to continue as Taoiseach or want him to be supplanted by one such as Deputy James Dillon.  Nothing else counts.  Let there be no illusions.  That is the issue, the only issue, and the Fine Gael Opposition will not dull the mind of the electorate by attempting to cloud the issue on this occasion, and I am sure they will not be found wanting in that regard in the two by-elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to refer to a statement made by Deputy Dillon here yesterday.  He said: &ldquo;There was a disreputable Fianna Fáil tactic which suggested that the economic development and industrial expansion of this country depended exclusively on the presence of a Fianna Fáil Government in office.  Such propaganda, if widely disseminated, could do real damage to the economic prospect of the country.&rdquo;  I want to ask a question.  It is a question many outside this House are asking.  &ldquo;Such propaganda, if widely disseminated, could do real damage to the economic <Col N="910" /> prospect of the country.&rdquo;  Who is spreading this propaganda?  Is it not Deputy Dillon, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, and his supporters? They are the only people initiating this campaign.  One has only to read &mdash;it is in very small type&mdash;the statement of policy to discover that the Fine Gael Party is not a Party with a policy of expansion.  In no uncertain terms it sets out, beyond yea or nay, that its declared policy is not continuation based on the second <i>Programme of Economic Expansion</i> but a policy, rather, of contraction, very substantial and very serious contraction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, too, was worried because people in industry are getting this 12 per cent increase.  What I am about to say now is something which is agitating not only the minds of people in this House, their supporters, and the public generally, but it is also agitating the minds of the voters in these two vital areas, the voters who carry such a tremendous responsibility on their shoulders.  I want to ask a question: is it correct that Deputy Dillon&mdash;he did not say so &mdash; will cease forthwith the agreements which are now taking place whereby various categories of workers are obtaining the ninth round wage increase?  Silence from the Fine Gael benches.  I have asked a direct question.</P>

      <P>I do not mind. Deputy O'Higgins and I understand these little asides.  Because we are what I might term &ldquo;political fanatics&rdquo; in this House we do not always appreciate the fact that the ordinary man in the street does not pay a great deal of attention to reports of political speeches.  In the main, politicians are themselves to blame.  My side of the House is not above reproach.  I myself <Col N="911" /> am not above reproach.  I read a statement the other day by a prominent member of the Government and there was not a full stop in 206 words. The phraseology has become &ldquo;Civil Servese&rdquo; or &ldquo;journalese&rdquo;, if one might so describe it.  By simple, short, staccato sentences, the man in the street has to be reminded of and educated on topical important issues. Deputy O'Higgins would resent, of course, what he would term the &ldquo;rhetorical question&rdquo;.  He has not answered it.  Is it true that, if Deputy Dillon does become Taoiseach, the ninth round will cease, the 12 per cent will not be paid, and those who have received it will have to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon was not satisfied tilting at the Government Front Bench.  When he ran out of arguments, he had to look to Britain and America for further data.  According to him, the Tories are making a mess of things; even President Lyndon Johnson is making a mess of things in America.  Everyone in every country is making a mess of things.  The only salvation for all the ills is to put Fine Gael into power with Deputy James Dillon as Taoiseach.  Would Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan agree that the people today are working harder, that they are more prosperous than ever before, that they are producing more, exporting more and that their living conditions are better than they ever were? Would he concede that all the implications are that that is the road along which we are travelling and that that is the likely pattern for the foreseeable future because of our approach to the 1970s?  I hate to refer to this, but I preface my remarks by saying &ldquo;God forbid&rdquo;.  God forbid, but if anything <Col N="913" /> sudden should happen to the Taoiseach, Deputy Seán Lemass, look at the headlines in the papers.</P>

      <P>Look at the public reaction among all sections of the community, irrespective of their political affiliations&mdash;one of gloom and despondency that we should have lost such a leader.  That is the point I want to bring home to the people in Cork and Kildare.  They could be guilty of political assassination if they do not study the issue, and study it closely.  They will have a grave responsibility to themselves and their children if, by their votes, they condemn the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Government to a political wilderness.  Are we to interrupt our programme?  Are we to replace the present Taoiseach, with his 30 years of experience in this House, during most of which he held ministerial office, with Deputy Dillon with his limited experience in Government&mdash;and the experience he had a very doubtful asset indeed?  I stress that we are not interested in fighting civil wars again, but we have a duty to remind the people of what economic chaos might result again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When we do remind them, we will also remind them of the responsible controls exercised &mdash; the controls on dividends&mdash;in 1945, the time to which the Deputy alludes.  I was talking about the last Coalition Government, in which the leader of the Fine Gael Party played such a part, when they filled as they were never filled before since 1847 the emigrant ships leaving our shores, when they emptied the houses of Cabra, Ballyfermot, Finglas and other parts of the country.  Then they boast in public that they had houses to spare at the end of their disastrous term of office. They had houses to spare all right because the people ran out of them. <Col N="914" /> They were hungry and they had to run to Britain, Canada and elsewhere to try and earn a livelihood.  It was said by the Leader of the Opposition that there was no hold-up on money. Deputy Flanagan would say that.  They are saying it now in Kildare and Cork.</P>

      <P>When it comes to housing, Deputy Flanagan and I will be on very unequal terms because that is one aspect about which I know something.  Deputy Cosgrave made a very responsible and statesmanlike speech today.  Do not have any doubts about it&mdash;that is my interpretation of his remarks today.  He said he appreciated there was no shortage of money today for housing.  He conceded that there is not.  But it is entirely misleading for Fine Gael to suggest that there was neither a financial crisis nor any hold-up in the building industry in the disastrous 1956-57 period.  Does everyone not know that the Government, in which a Fine Gael Minister was Minister for Finance, were bankrupt? Does not everyone know that the Minister for Local Government&mdash; a Fine Gael Minister, Deputy Pa O'Donnell&mdash;could not alone sanction plans but could not send on the money to the local authorities?</P>

      <P>You flash that letter out of your pocket and you will see in the last paragraph what I told you. There is more money spent per annum today on the Special Employment Schemes and on every section of the Special Employment Schemes Office than at any period during the period of office of the Deputy's Coalition Government. <Col N="915" /> I was referring to this point that Fine Gael are now trying to put over, that there was no hold-up in money for houses.  Let me put on record again what Deputy O'Donnell, the then Minister for Local Government, said at column 2027, volume 160, of the Official Report of the 6th December, 1956:</P>
      <P>I have said that, making due allowance for areas where housing needs have been met....</P>
      <P>This is the important part:</P>
      <P>That does not mean that I can sanction immediately all pending projects and give an assurance that the money to finance them will be available as and when required.  It would be quite unrealistic to expect that, at a time of exceptional economic and financial difficulties, public bodies should have such absolute assurances as that.  The State itself has no such assurance.</P>
      <P>I said earlier that everyone is entitled to aspire to be Taoiseach, to aspire to form a Government.  Not only is it human nature but there is absolutely nothing wrong with it and just because we might disagree with Fine Gael does not prevent our supporting them on that score alone.  However, I wonder are the Irish people sold on the idea that the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Dillon, has changed his tune, his outlook and the mentality which he possessed back in the Coalition days? Would he continue as Taoiseach to be as vague and nebulous?  Would he continue to be incapable of making a definite statement of policy on specific matters?  We have heard sweeping statements from him in the past few days.  He promises the electorate cuts in extravagant spending but he does not cite where that extravagance has been evident.</P>

I can say, however, that the Irish people would be very proud, were it £300,000, for Deputy Seán Lemass, the Prime Minister of this country, to have entertained in such a fitting manner the late President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy.</P>

Deputy Cosgrave went back much further and into far more detail than I have done to-day, though I do concede that possibly what Deputy Cosgrave had to say was more interesting to the listeners and not as politically contentious as the contributions of his colleagues.</P>
      <P>I have already paid tribute to the success of Aer Rianta, one of our most successful State enterprises.  I also mentioned Shannon Airport because it was a case in respect of which Deputy Dillon did make a specific statement which turned out to be quite correct.  He did say he would scrap the jets, the transatlantic airliners.  We do know the effect keeping that promise had, not only on those who would have gained their livelihood at Collinstown and Shannon Airport but on the position of the country generally.</P>
      <P>I asked a question, a most pertinent one indeed; Deputy O'Higgins has already given a categorical &ldquo;no&rdquo; when I asked him would his leader refuse to honour the 12 per cent increase. I now ask him would his leader sell the jets for the second time?  Is there any reply?  Would Fine Gael sell the Aerlinte jets?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are airports in Cork, Shannon and Dublin.  It is tremendously important that subsequent speakers should throw the light on their policy, if such exists, in relation to the airports.  It is not referred to in the small print in their statement of policy published in the past few days.  What is their policy so far as the air services are concerned?  Will they continue the jets?  Will they continue to do all in their power to continue the employment in Collinstown, Cork and Shannon?  This is serious.</P>
      <P>It was bad enough that they sold the jets.  They were in office from 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1957, and we were left trailing behind.  The question of the construction of a jet runway at Shannon was under consideration.  It was shelved and then turned down by the Coalition.  That added to the delay and the hold-up in our progress in the transatlantic race.  Immediately we came back into power in 1957, Deputy Lemass, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, sanctioned the construction of a jet runway at Shannon Airport but it took a long time to construct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the annual figures which we can read in the reports of Aerlinte, was it not one of the most serious economic decisions taken by any Government to scrap the transatlantic jets?  They failed to live up to their responsibilities and they did not appreciate the fact that the mode of travel in the modern world is aircraft.  Was <Col N="919" /> it not up to them to be big enough&mdash; and not small-minded or narrow-minded&mdash;and say: &ldquo;This is a Fianna Fáil conception but we will not scrap it.&rdquo;  Look at the admiration they would have received.  One may have political opponents, but there are times when one is in a position to admire outspokenness and fairminded statements from one's political opponents.</P>
    <P>The newspapers today are indicative of the mentality of the modern Ireland. They have a responsible attitude in most instances.  The <i>Irish Press</i>, the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the <i>Irish Times</i> and the <i>Cork Examiner</i> are the four main Irish daily papers.  Up to a comparatively short time ago, it was a recognised and accepted fact that they had very definite political affiliations.  The new generation are not interested in reading reports which might be biassed and might have a distinct slant&mdash;I do not say that is all cured&mdash;but as a result of a process of natural evolution, it would be hard to tell who did the political reporting, and who wrote the interpretations of the political proceedings here, apart from the fact that there are distinguishing marks in the print, except on certain occasions.</P>

      <P>We in Fianna Fáil do not think we are the greatest things that ever hit this country.  We do not think we have a monopoly of all the brains in Ireland.  We never thought that.  We are open at all times to constructive criticism.  We appreciate that there are sensible people of all political persuasions who speak not only at public dinners but in discussion groups.  There is a new sense of responsibility and I am glad to say that trend has been towards the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to dwell unduly on Shannon Airport and the failure to keep the jets.  I just want to remind the House and possibly the voters of it.  I say it straight out.  I am directing my remarks to the people who are responsible for what has happened in the past, through the mentality of <Col N="920" /> Deputy Dillon, the leader of the Fine Gael Party.  He has given no indication that his mentality has changed in any way, or that his thinking has changed in any way on these big issues, on these vitally important matters affecting so many thousands of our citizens.  I invite him or any subsequent speaker to state the new policy, if there is one, on such matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has become more careful, I admit, in the Sixties than he was in the Forties but he is a bit more careful to be a bit more vague this time.  That is not enough.  Is the honest truth of the matter not that it is agreed that to vote for Deputy Dillon&mdash;I am not talking about Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;is to vote in the dark?  That is what is disturbing the man in the street and particularly the uncommitted voter.  There are people who vote Fianna Fáil, just as there are the diehards in Fine Gael.  No matter what was done, they would stick to us, or to Labour, or to Fine Gael, through thick and thin.</P>
    <P>Elections are decided, rightly or wrongly, by this swaying voter, this uncommitted voter.  I am not talking about the man who says, when you go to canvass him: &ldquo;I have no politics.&rdquo;  You know he will vote against you, that he is a definite opponent.  I am talking about the person who is genuinely uncommitted. That is what our canvassers have found in Cork and Kildare; that is the report which has come in to the Taoiseach, because naturally the Taoiseach is interested in the outcome of these elections as is every member of the Fianna Fáil Party and of every other Party.  That is the consensus of opinion&mdash;that the uncommitted consider that a vote for Dillon is a vote in the dark.</P>

In Cork and Kildare, what they have to decide is the choice between these two leaders of political opinion.  If I have taken over-long to deliberate on the issues, I regret doing so.  I do not think I have contributed a major speech here for a long time, but I do say now that there is a responsibility out of all proportion to the people of those two areas on this occasion.  I sincerely trust that the people of the two areas will not forget that one of the most important things in a leader is experience.  I submit, and I hope the electorate will accept my advice, that the 30 years' experience of Seán Lemass will outweigh anything that could be offered by the leader of the Opposition Parties.</P>

He has not been very convincing as to why that should be done, but he certainly regards it as necessary.  It is true, as he has said, that very shortly the people will get an opportunity, fairly and freely, without intimidation, to decide who they want to lead this country, and I hope the decision will be made in the secrecy of the ballot box, not as a result of the bargaining behind closed doors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are discussing here the Vote on Account, though one might not have appreciated that from what the Parliamentary Secretary has been saying.  We are concerned here with an increase in the Supply Services of close on £15 million.  To this increase apparently must be added at least a further £7 million which is not provided for in the Estimates.  Therefore, in the 12 months about to be embarked on, the Supply Service in this State will cost £22 million more.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the total increase cannot fully be estimated because a great deal of consequential Supply Services increases will arise from the imminent increase in local rates.  That must provoke in the minds of Deputies and, I hope, in the public mind, questions as to the necessity for an increase in expenditure of this kind.  The Minister said yesterday that the increase was attributable to extra requirements for health, social welfare and for education.  The total increase for health, in so far as one can gather from the Minister's speech, is £2 million.  There is an increase of £5,200,000 for social welfare payments and of £3 million for education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to examine the basis of these increases.  If, in relation to health, the people were getting £2 million more of health services, if there was an expansion in our health services, then one could justly say that some progress was being made.  But, in fact, there has been no progress in the quality of our health services in the past 12 months.  We are paying more for what we had.  No one can suggest that there has been any special progress in the line of health. There has not.  The same applies in relation to education.  The increase <Col N="924" /> under the heading of education is required, and I do not suggest that it is unnecessary, to pay increased salaries to teachers.  Again, there has not been an improvement in the educational facilities available to the people. What was there already is costing more.</P>
    <P>Again with regard to social welfare, there is an increase of £5.2 million but this increase in benefits is specifically claimed to have been introduced in order to restore the real value of the social welfare benefits which recipients had before the turnover tax.  No one claims that the increase in social welfare benefits does anything more than restore the position so far as the recipients were concerned prior to the imposition of the recent turnover tax.</P>
    <P>That poses the question which should be present to everybody's mind as to what is the object of the kind of budgeting we have seen in recent years. so far as I can see, somebody in Government starts a process which causes an increase in the cost of living. The increase in the cost of living makes the lot of State servants and local institutions more difficult and there is inevitably a move to compensate civil servants for that increase and the necessity arises to provide more money to maintain local institutions.  All this leads up to new taxation so that the result of the increase in the cost of living is new taxation which leads to further increases in the cost of living and this process then leads to more taxation.</P>
    <P>Seven or eight years ago, the cost of the Supply Services in this country was £100 million.  Today the cost of those services is £200 million.  The actual quality of the services has not been enlarged.  We have the same health services, the same educational facilities and there has been no increase in their magnitude or quality.  Back in 1957 some member of the Government, in order to save £7 million, decided that it would be a good thing to abolish the food subsidies.  They were abolished. The subsidies on flour, butter and bread were wiped out and immediately the seventh round of wage increases became necessary followed by a steep increase in the cost of living.  That in <Col N="925" /> turn led to increased taxation and the process continued.</P>
    <P>Last year, the Minister for Finance came into this House and said he was facing a deficit of close on £7 million and that it would be necessary to introduce a new system of taxation, a broadly-based tax on expenditure which he called a turnover tax.  In order to meet that deficit of £7 million, the turnover tax was introduced and what has the result been?  Immediately the tax was introduced, compensatory payments had to be made and now we are ending up this financial year with a deficit of £10 million.  Everybody has been taxed; living costs have gone up; and nobody is any better off.</P>
    <P>It is such matters that concern the people at the moment.  They are not particularly interested in the meanderings into the past of the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Malley.  We are concerned with the present and with what will happen in the future.  All of us in this country are living in a small community.  We are all trying to earn our daily bread and it is no satisfaction to any member of this community if, every year, the pounds he earns fall in value.  If that continues, it will mean that while the apparent earnings of the community have increased, in fact our earnings will be depreciated.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said yesterday that in the last twelve months there was only a slight increase in the cost of living.  He went on to say that it was not as great as in the previous year.  The fact is that in the past six or seven years, the cost of living has risen by close on 30 points.  That means that it is costing everyone more and more to maintain the same standard and it is in such a situation that we have to consider what our future is likely to be.  It may have been all right in the past three or four years when this country was fortunate enough to be able to sell goods abroad under favourable circumstances.  Although our own costs of production were rising, the terms of trade were favourable to us.  There are signs that that happy situation is now beginning to change and, as a country, we shall have to take stock of what is happening here at home.</P>
    <P>I mentioned stability.  I believe that <Col N="926" /> is the need of the country&mdash;stability in relation to the earning power of the people.  That can only be achieved by aiming at a situation in which these fabricated, inspired rises in living costs are prevented.  It is on that account particularly that we joined the issue with the Government in relation to the turnover tax.  We thought it was not only foolish but dangerous from a national point of view to tax food, the necessaries of life, in such a way as inevitably further to increase living costs at a time when the national requirements dictate stability in costs at home.</P>
    <P>We opposed the tax on that ground and we propose shortly to repeal that tax if we are given the opportunity. Whatever taxation is required, whatever revenue is required must be raised, but it can be raised other than by such means as involve an inevitable tax on the food of the people.  I suggest that with this vast increase in expenditure which has taken place in the last seven years that the lot of individuals in the State has been in no way improved. Under the present Government good times are always coming but they never seem to arrive.</P>
    <P>I saw a Fianna Fáil advertisement in the papers a couple of months ago canvassing the necessity for the turnover tax and stating, among other things, that it was necessary to pay for better health services.  Where are they?  When will they come?  It will be Tibb's Eve, unless there is a change of Government. This advertisement went on to say the turnover tax was necessary to provide for better educational facilities for the people.  When, where and how?  Tibb's Eve again?  It is always jam tomorrow, as far as the people are concerned, and never jam today.</P>
    <P>I wonder if all this talk about prosperity around the corner is a deliberate political device.  I think the House would be interested to recall that in the last seven years we have had a plethora of programmes and plans; we have had a conglomeration of commissions searching and inquiring into different problems, education, the Irish language, the itinerants, health services, ground rents and a variety of other similar problems.  Whenever a problem <Col N="927" /> becomes acute politically, the Government set up a commission to inquire into it and for the next 12 or 18 months, anybody who asks about that is told: &ldquo;It is being examined by the commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The commissions are sitting and tied up all over the country.  They will report.  I am sure the people who go on these commissions are serious, upright, dedicated citizens but irrespective of what reports they make, the problem remains and nothing changes.  Has that been a deliberate political device?</P>
    <P>Most of us really believe that there is a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow. There are certain expert political psychologists who operate on the basis that people really believe these things. Perhaps one can paint a careful picture with wonderful colours like the rainbow and keep on talking about the prosperity that is to come when our plans fructify, when our ship comes home.  If you continue to do it, you may make the public believe that you will get somewhere, but those are the people who believe there is a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow.  There are more people today who are concerned with the present; people who live in tents in Clanbrassil Street; people who have to eke out a winter in a tent pitched in a Dublin street.  It is no good saying to them: &ldquo;Hold fast; hold on; we are having a great housing drive in the green belt and it will start in 12 months' time&rdquo;.  These people are concerned with the evidence of action now to deal with the problems which are present to their mind.</P>
    <P>It is in that respect, in my view, that the Government have failed dismally to better the lot of ordinary people.  The previous speaker talked of people having a taste of prosperity now.  He was probably putting himself in the position of the Leader of the Tory Party in England some years ago when the slogan used was: &ldquo;You never had it so good.&rdquo;  It is a silly slogan to use and it is particularly unwise for any Fianna Fáil spokesman to use it in the present circumstances, because whatever sense of prosperity may be experienced, it is prosperity <Col N="928" /> for the few and for those who rarely have been without a great share of this world's wealth.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that when he commutes between Dublin and Shannon, he might examine the lot of the thousands of our citizens who live in small farms and holdings in the midlands.  If he examined their conditions, he would find that in the past seven years or so the real bite of poverty has been experienced in many homes in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>They talk about prosperity.  Is there anyone who could suggest that an Irish farmer today is doing well or has any prospect of doing better?  The fact is that most people are fleeing from the land.  The farmer works from morning to night for a mere pittance at the end of the week; his sons are not going to share that which they see their father bearing but the Parliamentary Secretary can stand up in the Parliament of the nation and talk about prosperity for all.  For whom? Where is this elusive prosperity that we are supposed to be experiencing? It certainly is not in provincial Ireland; it certainly is not in the back streets of the city and I have little doubt that it will be very evident next week that it certainly is not experienced in the city of Cork.</P>
    <P>I think the popular desire for a change is not irresponsible.  It is the result of a profound conviction amongst ordinary people.  They want to see some evidence of a Government in action.  They want to see an effort being made to provide realistically here a better health service for the country.  They want to get away from the present system under which a domiciliary medical service is denied to the vast bulk of the people.  They want to see social progress of that kind and it is because of the need, popularly felt, that there is a popularly expressed desire for a change of Government.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to keep referring to the Parliamentary Secretary but he did cover at great length the same point time and time again, seeking to suggest that the present Taoiseach was in some way essential to the country. That is a very unwise approach.  It has <Col N="929" /> been tried time and again by the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is part of the political gimmicks that they use.  Indeed, the Parliamentary Secretary went so far as to invite us to imagine the position if, as he said, &ldquo;something sudden happened to Seán Lemass.&rdquo; There was a sob in his voice and we were supposed immediately to slump in our seats in the gloom of dejection. I think that is rubbish, absolute rubbish. I do not believe that anyone inside this House or outside it would be impressed by that sort of approach.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to praise the name of James Dillon or the name Dillon in this country.  It is not confined in 30 years' experience in this House.  It is a name that is part and parcel of the history of Ireland.  If the Irish people, being given an opportunity, select James Dillon as the leader of Ireland, they will be putting into office a man with the ability, the tradition and the courage to lead this country safely out of any difficulties that might arise.  Indeed, I think it is fortunate that we should have in this country two men leading the two major Parties who are of sufficient standing and ability to lead this country under any circumstances or under any difficulties.  There is no monopoly on either side in relation to matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>May I deal with one other matter before I conclude, that is, what Fianna Fáil have been saying about Fine Gael policy?  I do not really know what they want.  I do not really know what they are saying.  Up to last week, the situation apparently was: &ldquo;You have no policy&rdquo;, and then when our programme was published fully in the national newspapers, it obviously acted like a gadfly to a herd of cattle, so far as Fianna Fáil were concerned. They went panicking all around the place and the Tánaiste declared that the policy was &ldquo;only the same thing as they had before&mdash;do not worry about it&rdquo;.  The Minister for Justice came in saying: &ldquo;This is a hastily contrived thing just for the by-elections.&rdquo; We had the Parliamentary Secretary here today describing it as just nothing, just a hire-purchase document.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> I do not know what the correct appreciation of it may be but it consoles me to see the concern it has caused to Fianna Fáil.  I wonder if the Taoiseach, when he went to Athy last Saturday night, had any inkling that printed beside his speech in the Sunday papers would be the full policy of the Fine Gael Party.  If he could have bitten off his tongue, he would have cheerfully done it on Sunday morning but he had committed himself to a course and the course, in fact, has been universally welcomed throughout the country.</P>
    <P>People see now quite plainly a clear programme and a clear policy, an opportunity for an alternative Government, for a new team, for a change and they are going to be given the opportunity.  If the objective of the Taoiseach's speech was to stampede people into supporting the Fianna Fáil candidates, it has failed.  In fact, on a canvass, when I called at a house two or three days ago, a person came out and said: &ldquo;I was not going to vote until I saw the Taoiseach's statement but now it is worth while and I am going to vote.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The result of the situation that has been created is that there will be a large vote in both constituencies and a very strong vote against the Government. It may be, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, that the two Fine Gael Deputies who will be elected will never reach Leinster House.  That is an intimation that this Dáil will be dissolved tomorrow night week.  Well, if that is so, let it be.  It is worth recalling that precisely this time ten years ago, there were also two by-elections, one in Cork and one in Louth, and that the Fine Gael candidates won both of them.  It is also worth recalling that the then Fianna Fáil Taoiseach cried &ldquo;Horror&rdquo;, dissolved the Dáil, went to the country and said, in effect: &ldquo;Nobody else can rule but I.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am answering the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and reminding him that what happened then can well <Col N="931" /> happen again.  I do not want to sin on the grounds of length in the same way as did the Parliamentary Secretary.  I feel on this debate on the Vote on Account that we would all be doing a better service if we were really speaking in either of the constituencies to the people of which we are all obviously directing our remarks.  It is perhaps inevitable that that should happen in the present political situation.</P>
      <P>Whatever the results of the by-elections may be, and we all have our wishes and our guesses, I have little doubt that the people can be trusted to decide political issues fairly and responsibly.  I have little doubt that the politician of a political Party who seeks to belittle the intelligence of our people is not serving his Party well. If the people want a change, they will bring about a change.  They will do it out of a deep regard for the welfare of the country.</P>
      <P>Woe to the person who thinks that he alone knows what is good for Ireland. Woe to the political Party who seek to suggest to our people: &ldquo;You had better have us because there is nobody else.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;It happened before and it could happen again,&rdquo; said Deputy O'Higgins.  I should like to follow him through on that.  Deputy O'Higgins stopped at 1954.  Two years later, in 1956, it happened again for a second time with a Coalition Government. Let Deputy O'Higgins, when he talks about something happening again, remember that.</P>
      <P>However, having said that, I, too, like Deputy O'Higgins should like to look to the present and the future rather than to the past.  I, too, as Deputy O'Higgins professes and in one part of his speech did&mdash;and with that serious part of his speech I shall join issue with him in a moment&mdash; agree we should try to look at it objectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall put two questions to the House.  As Deputy O'Higgins said, we are all talking to the country at the moment.  The two questions I want to put as objectively and as fairly as I can are these.  Supposing we are to <Col N="932" /> have a change of Government, what are the alternatives?  Leave personalities out of it.  Leave ability out of it.  Leave programmes out of it for the moment.  We are concerned with the provision of a Government who can function effectively as a Government. What are the alternatives?</P>
    <P>The situation, as I see it, is: You will have the present Government and if not the present Government, you will have one of three things: You will have a minority Fine Gael Government supported by, say, the Labour Party and the Independents in the House.  If not a minority Fine Gael Government, so supported, you will have a minority Labour Government supported by Fine Gael in the House. If you have neither of these two, you will have a Coalition.  Now, I do not know if my logic is faulty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The only fault in my logic is if you assume that anyone else will get an overall majority. Do you tell me here now, in the realms of practical fact and facing this in an objective way and facing realities, that any Party other than Fianna Fáil at this present moment can get a working majority?  I am not saying that in the future things will not change.  I am not making any extravagant claims. However, take facts as they are.  What are the chances, if there is a general election the week after next or in a month's time, of Fine Gael getting an overall majority?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one point in Deputy O'Higgins's speech which interested me and that was his argument &mdash; if I understood him correctly &mdash; about the <Col N="934" /> spiral of expenditure and revenue, and so forth.  There is admittedly a big economic problem there: I have not all the material to discuss it in detail at the moment.  However, I shall admit that I could understand Deputy O'Higgins's taking the view that we must not let prices or costs go up, if he is prepared to go through with the logic of his attitude.  I can understand that old conservative approach and I would be prepared to argue with Deputy O'Higgins if that is the conservative approach he is taking up.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is quite clear that the policy the Government have been adopting is to meet an expanding situation by expansion.  I disagree with Deputy O'Higgins that there has not been expansion, and profitable expansion, here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>All right; I shall refer the Deputy to a certain supplement which was published this morning and he can get some idea from that.  The point I want to make is that if Deputy O'Higgins is saying, as Fine Gael said in 1948 and at other times: &ldquo;We are taking a conservative stand,&rdquo; then I can understand him.  But does he mean it?  Because on two occasions before these protestations were made and on two occasions in a Coalition Government dominated by Fine Gael that policy was not implemented.  That is a fair comment to make and it is not made viciously.  Is the attitude to be conservative, keep controls, do not expand?  All right.  There is room for an economic argument on that but let us have the matter out in the open and let us know where we are.  Do not let us have what we had before, these protestations that that type of policy was going to be carried out&mdash;like the selling of the airliners and so forth&mdash; and then we finished up with a greater expenditure than ever.  That happened during the time of the first Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the policy let it be clearly stated and give us some evidence that <Col N="935" /> there is sincerity behind the statement and that an effort will be made to carry out that policy.  Subject to these two qualifications any reasonable man is willing to consider any serious proposals but Deputy O'Higgins will pardon me if I am somewhat sceptical about the Fine Gael Party in such matters having regard to the experience of two Coalitions in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins pointed out that his Party had published their programme. Very well.  They published their programme and they are definite that they will abolish the turnover tax. There would be consequences following on that decision.  The country is entitled to know how these consequences will be met and catered for. Deputy O'Higgins was somewhat fulsome about the programme, as he called it, which was published last Sunday.  Frankly, I thought it was just another election manifesto.  However, let us assume for the moment that it was a thought-out programme which is capable of implementation.  Then let us discuss it; come out and say precisely what you are going to do to meet the consequences?  You abolish the turnover tax.  If you do there will be a question of the revenue required to continue the economic expansion that has been under way.  You can do one of two things.  You can either adopt the conservative policy which by implication you preached earlier and say &ldquo;as you were&rdquo;, and stop expanding, stop development, try to save money and cut your coat according to your cloth, or else you will have to raise the money by some other means.  There is only one way in which money can be raised and that is by taxation in some form or other.  It does not fall from the skies.  The country is entitled to have that information in order to have an intelligent discussion on your policy.  I understood Deputy O'Higgins to complain that some of us were not taking the Fine Gael declaration of policy seriously. Speaking for myself, I must confess that my reaction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, I will accept the Deputy's correction if he puts it that way.  On the other hand, if we are taking it seriously we are entitled to ask a few questions.  If these can be answered and answered effectively, I can think of no better way of putting over your policy.  The difficulty confronting you, the difficulty which we all have to face, either as a community or as individuals, is to find the wherewithal to do what we want to do.  The Government during the past year considered the various alternatives. It was quite clear that taxation on such things as tobacco, drink and so on&mdash;the so-called luxuries-had reached the limit and, in any event, were an uncertain prospect.  I cannot conceive Deputy O'Higgins suggesting that he will find the money he wants for his programme from such sources. It was quite clear to the Government that income tax being of general incidence on society would not provide what was required nor from the social point of view would increased tax be good.  It is now realised that the incidence of income tax, because it hits the whole community, can have social implications and since PAYE came in it is no longer open to certain people irresponsibly to suggest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins, in a sense, came to what I regard as the kernal of the debate, and I should be very glad if both of us had our material to discuss in a friendly way the two approaches to this problem, for two approaches there are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two approaches.  One is the approach which says that expansion means spending money to expand and that brings in its train inevitably rising costs that require yet more expansion and further expenditure, if I understand the Deputy's argument aright. That is the conservative approach and all I ask the Deputy is: if you take that approach, is there any alternative to saying that you must stop expansion? If you take that approach, are you not committed to saying: &ldquo;Right; we will stop expenditure and we will hold the value of money at what it is&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that, if you interfere with living costs, you start a process which destroys everything you are aiming to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If you take that point of view, then what is the remedy? If you take that point of view, surely you are advocating stopping expansion, stopping the cause, and trying to peg down and hold expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy is regarding inflation as the same as expansion and expansion as the same as inflation.  They are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, they are very closely related.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately the problem is to keep the expansion and to hold it within certain inflationary bounds.  On the other hand, you can take the bold course and attempt <Col N="939" /> to build the economy by investment. That is the course this Government are taking.</P>
      <P>The question I should have liked the Deputy to clear up is what precise stand he is taking here.  In other words, you do know what this Government are doing.  They are asking for expenditure here on this Vote on Account.  They have stated where they propose to expend the money. That is in the Book of Estimates.  They have stated the means by which they propose to raise the necessary money, notably the turnover tax.  You know where you stand with them and all I shall say for this Government is the public know what has happened in the past seven years, and what the trends are today, and it is up to them to decide what they will do next.  Very good, so far, with us.</P>
      <P>Now what about you?  You say you put forward a programme.  You go this far on the negative side: you will abolish the turnover tax.  But what policy will you offer and implement? You have published the manifesto. Let me not be less charitable than I have been to it.  You have not answered the question as to how you will put it into effect, and I think that is a question that should be answered because it is only fair to the electorate that it should be answered.  They have had experience of both of us. You may claim it is luck both ways, but there has been the experience of two Coalitions which broke up internally, in disastrous circumstances, for which the country had to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether it is luck, or whether it is coincidence, the fact is that so far, during the past number of years, the story has been rather better in this country under a Fianna Fáil Government than it was under the Coalition Governments.  I think that is a fair statement.  You may tell me it was your bad luck in 1955 and 1956, your bad fortune, but the facts are there, and I think the electorate are entitled to have some assistance in coming to a decision in such circumstances.  They have not got that assistance from Fine Gael.  But for the fact that the Chair <Col N="940" /> has ruled me out of order, I should have liked to pursue my analysis of the alternatives.</P>
    <P>I, like Deputy O'Higgins, will not take up any foolish attitude with regard to any particular group having, so to speak, particular rights, but there is one advantage this side of the House has over that side of the House, and I say that without any reflection whatever either on the Parties or the Deputies concerned, for some of whom, at any rate, I have a great respect, and Deputy O'Higgins is one of them. There is this difficulty&mdash;it is a difficulty that grows in proportion to the sincerity and the purpose of the Parties concerned&mdash;that there are fundamental differences of viewpoint.  There is a lack of homogeneity, and the advantage I claim for our Party is that, so far, they are capable of furnishing a homogeneous Government.  Again, without any personal reflections on the Deputies who formed it, I believe now, as firmly as I believed in 1948, when the issue first became a really live one, and not alone do I believe, but I am utterly and absolutely confirmed in my belief by our own experiences, and I believe that many of the Deputies who took part in the Coalitions share in my belief, that Coalition Governments are inherently weak and have in themselves the seed of their own destruction.</P>

But when it comes to replacing a Government or making representations to the people <Col N="944" /> of this country, they should be honest about it.</P>

      <P>There is no disrespect whatever.  As Deputy O'Higgins has left the House and as I was addressing my remarks specifically to him, I think I have said all I have to say.  I shall conclude with the remark that a certain and vital question has not been answered.  We have had two experiences of Coalition Government and I feel that, in view of these experiences, I am on firm ground in suggesting that the present Government should be continued in office until such time as it is possible for an alternative Government which will adequately carry on the work to take its place.</P>

      <P>This is the Vote on Account and we are told that there is an increase in the Estimates.  That was to be expected.  If there are millions to be handed out for education, millions for housing, if there is to be £5 million for social benefits, if all those requirements are to be met, it is quite obvious that there must be an increase in the Estimates.</P>
      <P>As a member of a city council, I have had to sit and listen on many occasions to reasons why the rates should be increased.  There are good grounds for these increases because that council, like this House, finds that there have been great increases in the wages of its employees.  We have been discussing increased rates as well as other matters in this debate and most of the increase in the rates over the past number of years has been due to increased wages.  These increases in the rates have not been due to mismanagement or to any foolish expenditure. They are due to increased wages for doctors, nurses and other employees in the health authorities and to increases to the local authority employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could avoid increases in the rates by refusing to give to local authority employees the same increases as have been given to employees in industry.  No one would suggest that <Col N="945" /> we should do that and therefore we have to put up with increases in the rates.  Similarly, the Government are faced with increases in social benefits, increases in State pensions and increases in the salaries of their employees and therefore there must be an increase in the Estimates.  Last year, the rates in Dublin were 47/- in the £ but in 1940 they were only 19s. 5 1/2d. in the £.  It is the natural thing for our Estimates to increase and for the rates to increase because our economy is developing and we are giving our people a higher standard of living.  All that has to be paid for.</P>
    <P>It is the same at local authority level.  If people do not want the rates to increase or do not want the Estimates to increase, they can always propose that we do not give any increase to State employees.  You cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>There is nothing strange about an increase in the Estimates.  There will be an increase practically every year and it does not matter whether a new Government are returned to office or not.  The Estimates will keep going up because of greater demands.  I recently looked back on the Dáil agenda since I came into this House and I noticed in the name of the Opposition at least 20 motions asking for substantial increases for one thing or another.</P>
    <P>It is good politics to be able to say: &ldquo;We will give this and there is no charge.&rdquo;  There was a famous nightclub queen in America known as Texas Guinan.  She was well known for her wit and she invented the word &ldquo;sucker&rdquo;.  When she was asked to define it, she said: &ldquo;Someone who looks for something for nothing, and I have no mercy on them.&rdquo;  The Opposition are promising things wholesale.  They are really trying to make suckers out of the public.  If this Government were defeated and a new Government came into office on the strength of such a policy, then the people would deserve what they got.  As Texas Guinan would say: They deserve no mercy if they think they will get something for nothing.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael policy statement starts off by saying that it is wrong to tax the necessaries of life and if they are <Col N="946" /> given an immediate opportunity to from a Government they will repeal the turnover tax.  They say nothing about how they intend to raise money. Last night I listened to members of the Labour Party.  A few well-intentioned young fellows spoke but being rookies&mdash;and I cannot blame them for that&mdash;they did not offer a single word as to where they would get the money.</P>
    <P>This Fine Gael programme refers to health services.  There are comments about free doctors, free medical services, free this and free that.  However, it states in the introduction to this section on health that there will be an insurance scheme.  It is not that I would be against the proposal&mdash;it might be a good thing&mdash;but the impression any uninformed person would get is that everything is free.  In fact people would lose by this because at the moment a very large number of employed people have the blue card and already get most medical services free.  Under this scheme, they will have to pay and no one will get the services for nothing except the old age pensioners and the unemployed who have these benefits at the present time.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael state that they will carry out a complete reorganisation of the health services and then they go on to say that this will relieve the rates. What they mean by this is that whereas heretofore the local authorities paid a substantial amount towards hospitalisation, and so on, for those on the blue card, the ratepayers will now be relieved of a substantial part of that burden.  If that is so, someone else must pay that money and quite obviously the workers will pay instead of the ratepayers.  By means of an insurance scheme, they will all have to pay, including those who are at present getting services for nothing on the blue card.</P>
    <P>There is nothing for nothing in this world but the impression that simple people get is that if there is a change of Government, they will not only get all these services free but increased wages which will not cost anything either.  There is only a percentage gain. The workers have made a substantial gain in the 12 per cent increase which means anything from £1 to £3 a week, depending on income.  It must be <Col N="947" /> remembered that workers are getting this increase in wages on top of increased social benefits which they secured last year.  When these two things are combined and weighed against the 2 1/2 per cent increase due to the turnover tax, it will be seen that the people have three or four times more money in their pockets than the total cost of the turnover tax.  The standard of living has considerably increased and therefore it is ludicrous to criticise the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>It is hard to understand the attitude of the Opposition towards the shopkeepers. Some months ago when the turnover tax was being discussed, they were all for the shopkeepers but when it came into operation, they turned against them and said the shopkeepers were robbing the people.  Now they are sympathising with the shopkeepers in regard to the increase in rates.  The Opposition appear to be in agreement with all things and all persons.</P>
    <P>As regards the increase in rates, I would say that half of the people whose rates will be increased are people who will have received anything from 30/- to £3 a week increase in their wages.  The ordinary workers do not purchase houses.  It is only people with a fairly good job, those say, in the £12, £15 or £20 a week class.  Anyone in that category will receive anything from 30/- to £3 as a result of the 12 per cent increase.  The average person who buys a house of, say, £10 valuation will pay about £20 a year in rates.  It is ludicrous to complain about an increase of a few shillings in the rates when pounds are being gained.  The business people have been accused of rubbing it in with the tax.  At least it has been said they are gaining more than 2 1/2 per cent.  If that is so, they should be well able to pay any little increase in the rates.</P>
    <P>The only people who might find it difficult are a small number of people who are now retired.  They might not amount to five per cent of the total, and in many cases you may bet that retired people own their own dwellings and are not just purchasing them.  Very few <Col N="948" /> people purchase dwellings except when they are getting married in their twenties or thirties, and by the time they are retiring, they own their own houses.  If they have to pay anything on the house, it is just rates.  They have not got to make loan repayments and pay rates at the same time, so it is not as hard as all that.</P>
    <P>If there is any case for those people, I am sure the local authorities would take it up.  In fact, there is a motion on the agenda for the next meeting of the Dublin Corporation for the setting up of a special committee to examine differential rates for certain classes of people, such as those people who are retired and have only a limited income.  Something is being done in Dublin, and if all the other local authorities took it up, something could be done.  In fact, the Taoiseach said they were examining the matter, and they would be glad to find some solution which would give relief to people on small incomes.</P>
    <P>However, probably only about five or 7 1/2 per cent of the ratepayers are affected.  I do not know how the farming community are affected.  I am speaking about what I know in the city.  I am sure that if the question of some form of differential rates were taken up at local authority level and submitted to the Minister for Local Government, it would be given every assistance possible.</P>
    <P>As I said before, talking about rates is nonsense, because they have gone up practically every year for the past 30 years.  In the last two years the Coalition Government were in office, the rates went up.  In 1956-57, they went up by 2/6, and in 1957-58, they went up by 2/3.  Do not forget that the rates are decided in the early part of the year.  The estimates are prepared in January and the rates are fixed about March.  That means that the 1957-58 rates were actually decided upon while the Coalition Government were in power.  As I said, the increase in rates for their last two years was 2/6 and 2/3 which in present day values would be about 4/- and 3/6.  Yet there is a song and dance about the rates.  Why should the Opposition complain?  The <Col N="949" /> rates will go up because more services are demanded.</P>
    <P>It has been my experience that the people who shout about rates will never tell you where you are to economise. They avoid that like the plague, just as the Opposition avoid saying where they would get the money without the turnover tax.  They want to be on all sides.  When they shout: &ldquo;Down with the rates&rdquo;, they want to get the ear of the ratepayers.  They will not suggest putting up rents because they would lose votes there, too.  They go on shouting about the rates without making any counter-proposals, which is deceit.  They say the rates should go down, but they refuse to suggest how or where they should go down.</P>
    <P>In the odd case where a well-intentioned critic met a committee of experts and got factual information, the experts were able to point out that if certain roads were not done this year, within a few years, they would cost two or three times as much.  If critics have not got factual information, they shout their faces off without knowing what they are talking about. At local authority meetings some people shout about expenditure and rates when the Press are present, but they will not go to a committee where they could get factual answers, or where they could be nailed down.  They are not concerned with being constructive. That does not matter at all. They are concerned with some crowd outside who are listening to them shouting: &ldquo;Down with the rates.&rdquo; That is deceit.</P>
    <P>I mention these things because we are dealing with the rates.  I find the same in this House.  The Opposition refuse to face their responsibilities and to tell the public honestly: &ldquo;Here is how it will be done.&rdquo;  The Government are at a disadvantage.  They have to get the money.  They have to tax the people.  They have to put their cards on the table.  All the Government's cards are on the table.  We know what they have done.  We know about the turnover tax.  The Opposition would like the people to decide between the Government and themselves, with the Government's cards on the table and <Col N="950" /> not knowing what their cards are at all.  That is deceit.</P>
    <P>Quite obviously those who were offended by the 2 1/2 per cent tax&mdash; although it is only a small tax&mdash;may vote against the Government if they are still sore.  They are not given the same chance to vote against the Opposition's hidden tax plans.  It stands to reason that if the Opposition said: &ldquo;OK; we will put up beer by 2d., cigarettes by 4d., and income tax by 1/-,&rdquo; a large number of people would declare war on the Opposition, and the Opposition know that.  Therefore, their object is to get power by deceit.</P>
    <P>I am an Independent, whether you like it or not.  As I said before, I do not care what people think.  I am neither for one Party nor the other. I faced my responsibilities here when I found that the government of the country had to be carried on.  I continued to face that responsibility.  I am satisfied there has been substantial progress, and that what the Government have imposed in the form of taxation has been mild, and in view of the increased benefits and increased wages, that question does not arise at all.  In fact, a friend of mine told me: &ldquo;I got 25s.  If it were not for the turnover tax, I would not have got anything.&rdquo;  That is the practical way of looking at it.</P>
    <P>I know that other social welfare beneficiaries will get increases in the coming Budget.  If they do, it will be an improvement in their standard of living&mdash;not a large one, but still an improvement.  In view of the fact that it has now been proved that the actual result of the turnover tax was an increase of only three per cent, the increases granted to social welfare beneficiaries in last year's Budget more than covered the effects of the turnover tax.  That, of course, must be looked on as an increase in the standard of living of the poorer sections. Here we are not dealing with one or two people but with hundreds of thousands.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party, in their programme, have not committed themselves in regard to social welfare. They say that the Fine Gael aim is to <Col N="951" /> expand existing social welfare benefits as our resources allow.  They do not say they will give it.  In other words, the beneficiaries may not get anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from this so-called policy of Fine Gael.  It is under the section dealing with social welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>It says &ldquo;as our resources will allow&rdquo;.  If there is no taxation, there will be no money, so those people will not get anything at all.  If Fine Gael lose umpteen millions by changing the system of taxation, as they pretend they will do, then there will be little or no money and the beneficiaries will not get even the bob they got before.  So there is no substantial guarantee in that.  The number of such people depending on the Government, between widows and orphans and other State pensioners, total about half a million.  Therefore, when you talk in terms of giving a few bob each to those people, you are talking in terms of millions of pounds.  It cost this Government £5 million last year. If you talk in terms of doubling the increase given to those people, you talk in terms of £10 million.</P>
      <P>It is all very well for Fine Gael to talk of giving without indicating how much or from where the money is to come.  I say that no other Government could do better in this respect than the present Government.  If we judge by past actions, which is really the only yardstick we have, then there is no evidence that any other Government would be any more generous than the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like looking back, but in the last year of the Coalition Government, 1956, the non-contributory classes, the poorer classes, got nothing until they were given a shilling by the incoming Government.  In 1956, in <Col N="952" /> fact, there was sixpence put on every package of 20 cigarettes, an unheard of thing before that and equivalent to putting ninepence on the package of cigarettes today.  Nevertheless, in spite of that huge taxation on cigarettes, the very poor classes got nothing.</P>
    <P>This all serves to prove that the poorer sections would not do any better if there were a change of Government. It is because I am convinced of that, and of the prospect of a grave shortage of money if there were a change, that I continue to support the Government in spite of every innuendo flung at me.  I may say that I do not give two hoots about their innuendoes because I am satisfied I am doing the right thing for the country, not necessarily for the Government.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a calamity if there were a change of Government. Deputy de Valera put a number of questions which were not answered.  I fancy myself as having a sixth sense, and I can imagine what would happen tomorrow if there were a change.  To begin with, Fine Gael have made it clear they will not increase income tax. The Labour Party have said that they will.  There you are.  If income tax is not to bear the increase in expenditure, what will?  Is it the fellow with the pint or the package of cigarettes? They would not absorb very much.  On the rounds, I am convinced that the people would be the poorer.  I am satisfied there would not be as much revenue because, small and all as the turnover tax is, it will snowball as time goes on.  It is a sort of tax we can maintain or discard as the necessity arises.  The Taoiseach has promised that there will be no increase in that tax in the forthcoming Budget.</P>
    <P>The turnover tax is a small impost that harms nobody.  However, it was instrumental in forcing the ninth round of wage increases, and everybody is happy.  There is a complete change in the situation and I am perfectly sure the people at large will think twice before changing from the devil they know to the devil they do not know.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party policy appears to be that they will not enter another Coalition but stay on the outside with <Col N="953" /> a gun to the Fine Gael Party's head so that they can throw them out when it suits them, thus degrading Fine Gael and coming back from a future general election as the main Opposition Party. That is all right for the Labour Party but where does the country come in, where does the stability come in?  At least we have had two and a half years of stable Government and it is still possible for us to have two and a half more years as against the alternative I have suggested.</P>
    <P>Remarks have been made about the Government not having a mandate or a majority.  They are a Party 70 strong, with a couple of Independents.  Compare that with the last Coalition-48 Fine Gael Deputies, 18 Labour, five Clann na Poblachta and five independents, who all supported the Coalition Government.  There was a mixumgatherum. Did they represent the country?  Take all that crowd as against one big Party, with a couple of Independents.  It does not bear comparison.  This Government represent the people and have a right to rule 100,000 times more than the Coalition had before 1957.</P>
    <P>That is my point&mdash;the people have no future, as far as stability is concerned, with Fine Gael.  They have not put their cards on the table as far as financing is concerned.  The fact that the country has absorbed the eighth round of wage increases without any substantial inflation leads us to believe that the ninth round will also be absorbed with only minor increases.  Surely then, despite all the complaints we have heard here, the people have an <i>El Dorado</i> in their laps.  Should we change that to a situation that would obviously mean lack of political stability, in which there would be no common agreement and where our destinies would be in the hands of half a dozen groups?</P>
    <P>The two of us who support the Government do not make any demands on the Government.  In fact, I do not think I have been speaking to members of the Government officially since I came here.  I might bump into one or two and have an unofficial chat. We have to take the view that things are doing all right, that we are doing <Col N="954" /> the right thing in supporting the Government while things are doing all right.  When you compare the situation as it exists with the situation that was&mdash;and mind you the situation that was can be repeated&mdash;we have got to be careful.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell you a little about the situation that was.  I took the trouble of going to the offices of the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the <i>Irish</i><i>Press</i> and had a look at the newspapers for December, 1956 and January, 1957, the two months prior to the collapse of the Coalition Government. The following are headlines or extracts from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of December, 1956: 3rd December&mdash;Secretary of the Standing Committee, Dublin District House Builders: &ldquo;There is no money available for housebuilding&rdquo;; 4th December: Mr. Larkin, T.D., Labour, Chairman, Dublin Corporation Housing Committee: &ldquo;We cannot complete our housing target because of Government's delay in approving housing schemes&rdquo;; 10th December: &ldquo;Non-political group meet at Mansion House to discuss critical economic situation.  Clann na Poblachta warns Government because of mass unemployment and emigration&rdquo;; 14th December: &ldquo;Provisional United Trade Unions state they are alarmed at rising unemployment&rdquo;; 22nd December: &ldquo;Dublin County Council Manager states that loans under Small Dwelling Acquisition were suspended because of scarcity of money.  Victor Carton, Fine Gael Chairman, Housing Committee, said the building trade in the country is ghastly.  Building had almost come to a standstill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The following quotations are from the <i>Irish Press</i> of January, 1957: January 2nd: &ldquo;Dublin Trades Council demands meeting of the Dáil.  They state the Government have no policy and have failed ignominiously to carry out their programme.&rdquo;; President National Plasterers Association, Workers Union of Ireland, states: &ldquo;Grave unemployment, Government cannot govern and has no policy&rdquo;; January 5th: &ldquo;Builders unions protest to Labour T.D.s against mass unemployment.&rdquo;; January 10th: &ldquo;Four <Col N="955" /> hundred unemployed hold protest meeting at Werburg Street, Dublin.  400 workers on short time in Waterford&rdquo;; January 14th: &ldquo;Debate by Bray Literary Debating Society &lsquo;That this House stands behind the Government&rsquo; was defeated by 83 votes to 13&rdquo;; January 15th: &ldquo;Provincial United Trade Unions ask Taoiseach to receive deputation because unemployment is now 88,500, an increase of 16,000 in the last month&rdquo;; January 17th: &ldquo;Unemployed march in O'Connell Street carrying banners stating &lsquo;16,000 live in slums and no work.&rdquo;&rsquo;; January 18th: &ldquo;Registered unemployed now 92,000&rdquo;; January 19th: Trade Unions say &ldquo;workers' position is now disastrous.&rdquo;; January 28th: Provisional United Trade Unions state &ldquo;Thousands are losing their jobs weekly.&rdquo;; January 29th: Unemployed march in O'Connell Street carrying banners &ldquo;We want work.&rdquo;; January 30th: Transport Union say &ldquo;Registered unemployment now 100,000&rdquo;; February 1st: Municipal Authorities of Ireland state &ldquo;This is the worst emergency ever.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Clann na Poblachta decides to withdraw support from the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a chronicle of calamity.  The people are asked to decide between the present state of affairs, in which we have a stable Government, a progressive economy and in which it has been found possible to grant a ninth round of wage increases three times the cost of the turnover tax, or a state of affairs in which a small group would form the Government while another group would put the gun to their head.  In one case, the Government state candidly their tax proposals; in the other, we are told nothing.  If there were a change of Government tomorrow and an Opposition Government had to put on taxation, you would have 100 armies marching on the Dáil from all angles.  Talk about a few helpless women who do not know what they are talking about.  You would have hundreds of organised bodies all demanding their pound of flesh.  They would bring up all the promises made about what was to be done for them, and the people who would have to pay extra would be up in arms.  They <Col N="956" /> would be demanding another election. Surely we do not want that?  Surely those who seek an election are not doing so in the interests of the country?</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Labour Party, whom I admire, are not doing the country justice by trying to force an election at this stage, when they should, if not co-operate with the Government, at least not oppose them.  Whether they like it or not, the situation could not be better than it is.  I hold the Opposition should wait the normal period of four or five years so that the Government will have a reasonable time to carry out their policy.  They themselves would like to have that if they were in Government.  The situation has now changed.  There is not as much venom now as there was some months ago when everyone was being codded and told that there was going to be an increase of 15 per cent.  The increase in wages has put a different complexion on it.  If the Government were defeated, I imagine we would have a situation worse than the present one.  You would have an Opposition Government depending on two or three votes, but the tremendous difference would be that the Government would be made up of four or five groups and would have to put up with the pressures and blackmail of these groups, compared with a large group such, as at present, with only a couple of Independents. Labour may be taking the Machiavellian view of everyone for himself.  They may wish to walk Fine Gael into a situation where they can come in as the second Party.  I will not support a move of that sort.  While I wish the Labour Party well, I will not support a state of instability.  I will not cod people.  I face the music. I believe the Government had to do what they did.  If the Opposition want to be honest, they should say candidly: &ldquo;We are going to withdraw this tax <i>in toto</i>.&rdquo;  But they are not saying that.  All they are saying now is: &ldquo;We will withdraw it in part.&rdquo;  Yet they give the impression that they are withdrawing it in whole.</P>
    <P>On this question of withdrawing the tax, there is no sense in withdrawing something when, in fact, the vast <Col N="957" /> majority of the people have profited by it.  People who a few weeks ago were giving out to me are now all smiles.  Commonsense has told them that they are now getting £1 or £1 10s. extra.  They may not understand economics or this game of politics but they have &ldquo;savvy&rdquo; when, expecting to pay a couple of bob out, they find they are to get four or five times that amount in.  They will be able to buy more beer or whatever it is they want.  As one woman said in the <i>Herald</i> the other night: if paying <Col N="958" /> a little tax would provide employment for her children to remain on in the country, she would be glad to pay it and even a little more.  Her husband was going to get another &ldquo;quid&rdquo; and, as far as she was concerned, she was on &ldquo;easy street&rdquo;.  That is the true summing up of the situation.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13th February, 1964.</P>
