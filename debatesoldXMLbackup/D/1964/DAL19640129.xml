      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the official statement on the matter which was issued on the 17th of this month, in the course of which it was intimated that the State memorial to the late President Kennedy would take the form of a concert and assembly hall to be erected in the city of Dublin and that a Committee comprising members of the three main Parties in this House would be set up to consider the legislative and other arrangements to implement the proposal.</P>
      <P>The Committee has since been set up and is expected to hold its first meeting at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until the Government have received and considered the recommendations <Col N="2" /> of the Committee, it would not be possible to add anything to the official statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if there have been any further discussions with either of the European trade groups, viz., EEC or EFTA; or if any such talks are likely in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. With regard to the second part, it is anticipated that, as arranged at the Ministerial meeting with the Commission of the European Economic Community last November, discussions between senior officials of Ireland and of the Commission will take place within the next few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of the continuing <Col N="3" /> emigration from all parts of rural Ireland; and, if so, if he has any plan to offset this undesirable state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's plans, for the remainder of this decade, in relation to employment and emigration are outlined in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, and will be further elaborated in another publication during the course of the next few months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach dreaming?  Has he been throughout rural Ireland and seen that the country is depopulated, not only the West of Ireland, but Wexford, where I come from?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the figures issued by the Central Statistics Office show that a number to the extent of 19,000 people from rural Ireland could not be accounted for and in view also of the fact that only 8,000 to 9,000 new jobs have been created within the past 12 months by the Government, how can the Taoiseach now suggest that the numbers leaving this country have been reduced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach when the Local Appointments Commission were asked to obtain a dispensary medical officer for Naas dispensary, County Kildare; the date on which they have issued advertisements for such position; the date on which interviews have taken place; and when the Commission hope to be able to recommend an appointee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Appointments Commissioners were asked on the 19th July last to recommend a person for appointment as district medical officer for the Naas and Caragh dispensary district.  The position was advertised on the 21st of this month.  It is hoped to hold the interviews as soon as possible after the latest date for the receipt of applications, which is the 7th of next month, and to recommend a person for appointment as soon as possible after that.</P>
      <P>In explanation of the delay that has taken place in advertising this vacancy, I should mention that it is the practice of the Local Appointments Commissioners to advertise vacancies for these district medical officers in groups&mdash;for one reason, so as to allow candidates who intend to apply for more than one vacancy to have all their applications dealt with at one interview and thus save the time and expense that would otherwise be involved for candidates in attending several separate interviews. The present vacancy was included in the first group of vacancies advertised since the 19th July last.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware that a very serious charge of planned discrimination has been made against the Authorities in the Six Counties to the British Government and Opposition Parties; whether the Government here are satisfied that such planned discrimination does in fact obtain in the six occupied counties; and, if so, what action they propose to take about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the serious charge referred to by the <Col N="5" /> Deputy.  I do not think that it can be questioned that discrimination of the kind referred to exists.  The Government have expressed in public our view about this situation and we have also made representations, when appropriate, to the British Government.  As long as such discrimination continues, we shall continue to press for its termination by every means open to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say when the Government last made representations to the British Government on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had better give notice of that question. From memory, I should say it was in connection with the enactment of the Northern Ireland Bill last year by the British Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach or the Government given any consideration whatever to the fact that people in Ireland are puzzled in regard to Ireland's attitude in the United Nations, which is, to help all other countries while at the same time no action is being taken by the Government or their representatives to bring to the attention of the nations there the discrimination the Taoiseach has referred to here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will have a full English version of the Report of the Commission on the Revival of Irish published as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended to publish a full English version of the Report.</P>
      <P>I should explain that a full English version of the Report was not presented to me by the Commission; the only documents that were so presented to me have been published, namely, the Report itself in Irish and a Summary of the Report in English.  The preparation and printing of a full English version would cost approximately £1,500, and it would be several months before it would be available.  In view of the fact that the Summary in English is already available, I am not satisfied that the demand for a full English version of the Report would justify its production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we, therefore, to take the Taoiseach's word that the English Report contains more or less what is in the Irish Report?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is their Summary. They prepared the Summary in English.  It was the Commission who prepared the Summary in English which was published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider that we should have this Report in English?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. Apart from the practical difficulties of producing a version of the Report in <Col N="7" /> English in time, now that the Summary in English has been published, I do not think the demand for a full English version of the Report would be appreciable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

      <P>It is not clear whether the Deputy requires the gross domestic capital formation of the public sector or the gross domestic capital formation financed by the public sector, some of which is actually carried out in the private sector of the economy.  The information available, based on national income accounting concepts and definitions, relates to (a) total gross domestic capital formation (including the value of changes in stocks) in each year, (b) the gross domestic capital formation financed each year by public authorities (central government and local government), distinguishing that carried out in the public authority sector.  The difference between (a) and (b) is the amount of gross domestic capital formation financed each year by the private sector, including semi-State bodies.  I propose, with your permission, Sir, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the data available, which also includes figures expressed per head of the total population.</P>

      <P>The Consumer Price Index is calculated at four quarterly intervals each year, mid-February, mid-May, mid-August and mid-November.  The most recent data available relate to mid-November, 1963.  The index (base mid-August, 1947 = 100) rose from 159 at mid-August, 1963, to 164 at mid-November, 1963, or by 3.1 per cent.</P>
      <P>The only data on retail prices available to the Central Statistics Office are those obtained for the Consumer Price inquiries and with your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving (a) the national average retail prices of the food items specified at mid-August and mid-November, 1963, and (b) the percentage change between the dates in question in the other items requested, so far as they are available.  In the case of items, other than certain food items, no attempt is made to obtain quotations for the identical quality of the different articles in all areas and, therefore, any average prices computed would not be meaningful.  The correctness of the relative price changes is ensured by the fact that, at each source, the identical article is priced at successive inquiries.  Quotations for briquettes and brandy are not obtained at the quarterly inquiries.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>NATIONAL Average Retail Prices of certain commodities at mid-August, 1963 and mid-November, 1963, and the actual change in each case.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Dublin Health Authority that the heating system in Ballyfermot dispensary, which is normally adequate, broke down in December last.  A standby heating unit was brought into use. This did not provide an adequate temperature in the premises until early afternoon.  The heating in the dispensary in the mornings during this period was unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>The normal heating system was repaired on 18th December last and I am informed that it is since functioning satisfactorily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that Naas, County Kildare, has been without a permanent dispensary doctor for the last ten months; and that in this period there have been no less than six doctors doing locum on a temporary basis; and whether he is satisfied that this is the best method of giving medical attention to the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the district known as Naas and Carragh dispensary district has been without a permanent district medical officer since 1st April, 1963.  As the Deputy has already been informed to-day, the permanent post is in process of being filled by the Local Appointments Commissioners and has already been advertised.</P>
      <P>Some of the inferences in the question are misleading.  When the last incumbent of the permanent post, who had filled that post continuously for over 30 years, retired voluntarily on 31st March last, he remained on in a temporary capacity until 15th July so that the people of the district had, up to that date, the services of the same doctor as they had for so many years.  It is not unusual, of course, after a district medical officer has ceased to serve in a permanent capacity to re-appoint him temporarily.</P>
      <P>Since 16th July, there were four doctors who acted in a temporary capacity in the Naas post.  Therefore, the total number of doctors who acted temporarily in the post since 1st April last was five, not six as stated in the question, and of the five, one was the last occupant of the permanent post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said this, I must say that I agree that changes of medical officer, such as have occurred in the present instance, are undesirable.  I am satisfied, however, that this situation was unavoidable and that the health <Col N="20" /> authority have done all they can to make satisfactory interim arrangements for the provision of district medical officer services in the area pending the making of the permanent appointment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>From inquiries which I have made from the Dublin Health Authority, I understand that this person's application for surgical boots has not been refused.</P>
      <P>The procedure for the supply of a surgical appliance in a case such as this is that the person concerned is referred by his local district medical officer to a clinic where he is seen by an orthopaedic specialist.  It is necessary to do this to ensure that the correct type and size of appliance is supplied.  In the case referred to by the Deputy the procedure and the reason for it were carefully explained, in writing, to the person concerned by the health authority as long ago as July last.  Instead of following the procedure laid down, however, he appears to have done nothing about the matter for several months and then he wrote to me a letter of complaint against the health authority.  I took up the question with the authority and, as a result, and despite the utter lack of co-operation on the part of the applicant, they took the exceptional step of arranging, direct, an appointment for him with an orthopaedic specialist on a day last week.  He did not keep this appointment.  I understand that the health authority are willing to arrange another such appointment and that, despite the difficulties he is creating, they are still prepared to continue to go out of their way to facilitate him.</P>
      <P>There is no question of a charge being made in this case as the person concerned is in the lower income group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>The personal allowances payable under these regulations to single persons, widowers, widows and married couples, were increased as recently as 1st November last and the maximum rates of rent allowances payable under these Regulations were increased substantially with effect from the same date.</P>
      <P>The increases mentioned were part and parcel of the general increases in social welfare payments provided for in the 1963 Budget.  The increases in the rates payable under the Social Welfare Acts became effective on 6th January, 1964, and if the Deputy's suggestion in the latter part of the question were adopted, persons in receipt simultaneously of allowances under the maintenance regulations and of benefits under the social welfare code would get the benefit on the double of the Budget increases.

      <P>To tell the truth I was not so aware.  It seems to me to violate every canon of natural justice to invite people to present themselves for examination, to advise them of having secured a high place, so that they broadcast that information amongst their neighbours, and then to leave them under this slur that for some unknown reason they will not be appointed and when the reason is sought, whether it was because of character or morals, they will not be told.  They will be told &ldquo;We admit you secured a place far higher than many others but we will not state the reason why you will not be appointed.&rdquo; Surely that leaves a man in a truly desperate position.  He is unable to defend himself and nobody knows the reason except that it applies either to health, character or age.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument that the reduction or abolition of death duties would encourage an inflow of foreign capital for investment in this country is one to which I have given considerable attention.  It is dealt with in paragraph 79 of the First White Paper on Direct Taxation (pr. 5952) published in April, 1961.</P>
      <P>Recent legislation has afforded considerable relief in relation to death duties.  The Finance Act, 1960, raised the exemption limit from £2,000 to £5,000.  The Finance Act, 1961, reduced the rates of estate duty on estates between £5,000 and £8,000 and, in the case of estates in excess of £100,000, established a uniform rate of 40 per cent in place of the previous rates which proceeded to a maximum of 53 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Finance Act, 1956, the value of a considerable range of Irish industrial securities is reduced by one-third for estate duty purposes where the deceased dies domiciled in the State.  Stock of certain National Loans is accepted at its nominal value in payment of death duties although the market value at date of death may be <Col N="34" /> below the nominal value.  Furthermore, stock of National Loans is exempt from death duties if in the beneficial ownership of a person who is neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the number of schemes for the drainage of rivers which have been completed under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1954, and the number to be completed; and when it is expected that those schemes will be completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the passing of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, priority lists of 28 major catchments and thirty minor catchments were prepared. Four major catchment schemes have been completed, works are in progress in four cases and eight are at the survey or design stage.  Three minor catchment schemes have been completed, works are in progress in two and three are at the survey or design stage.  The drainage programme was extended a few years ago to include &ldquo;intermediate&rdquo; rivers, that is, small catchments with independent outfalls.  To date two of these schemes have been completed, works are in progress in two cases and another is about to start, and ten are at various stages of preparation.  Embankment schemes have been completed in three areas, two are in progress and four more are at the design stage.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to prophesy precisely when the drainage programme will be completed.  We are going ahead as rapidly as we can and, while the progress has been somewhat better than was originally expected, a great volume of work still remains to be done, but I hope that in about 15 years all the major problems of arterial drainage will have been reached.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, a conference on fisheries problems in Europe was convened in London in last December.  The Conference adjourned on December 6th and reconvened on 8th January.  Meetings were held until 17th January when the Conference adjourned again until 26th February next.</P>
      <P>Ireland was represented at the Conference as were 15 other States and also the Commission of the European Economic Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Conference drew up a draft Convention providing a new fisheries régime for European countries the principles of which were approved by most of the Delegations at the Conference. The draft Convention provides that the coastal State shall have the exclusive right of fishing in a six mile zone drawn from base lines, or the coast where no base lines exist, subject to a short transitional period as regards the outer three miles of the <Col N="38" /> zone to enable foreign fishermen to adapt themselves to their exclusion from this zone.  In a further six miles fishermen of countries which have traditionally fished in that area would continue to do so but they would be subject to powers of regulation and enforcement by the coastal state on a non-discriminatory basis.</P>
    <P>The details of the draft Convention are still incomplete in some respects and I do not wish to elaborate further until the Conference has concluded.</P>

      <P>I instructed our Embassy in London to urge the British authorities to agree to make repayment to Irish residents satisfying corresponding conditions of hardship in this country. I have been informed, however, that those authorities regret that for practical reasons they are unable to entertain claims on grounds of hardship from persons resident outside Britain, except in cases where the applicants are in receipt of benefits from British sources, when, of course, the required certificate from a British authority can be given.</P>

I am not prepared to consider introducing amending legislation to give effect to the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

    <P>CIE's statutory responsibility is confined to keeping the canal in a fit <Col N="45" /> condition for navigation.

      <P>I am not so aware. The abnormal numbers travelling at Christmas peak times create grave problems for all public transport undertakings and some falling off in normal standards of punctuality and comfort is inevitable.  I am informed by CIE that out of 98 western passenger trains operated over Christmas overcrowding occurred on 14 but that overall only 65 per cent of the accommodation provided was utilised.  Heating was provided on all trains but failed on three occasions.  Available catering facilities were utilised to the limit of capacity, but it was not possible to provide such facilities on eight trains in all.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 25 to 33 and substitute:</P>
      <P>4.  (1)  Where a person kills another unlawfully the killing shall not be murder unless the accused person intended to kill, or cause serious injury to, some person, whether the person actually killed or not.</P>
      <P>(2)  The accused person shall be presumed to have intended the natural and probable consequences of his conduct; but this presumption may be rebutted.</P>
      <P>Like the amendments put down in Deputy McGilligan's name, this amendment proposes to introduce a statutory definition of murder &mdash; a statutory definition of that kind of malice which distinguishes murder from other forms of unlawful killing. This distinguishing criterion of murder is called &ldquo;malice aforethought&rdquo;.  That phrase is used in a highly technical sense.  One leading writer, Stephen, said that the phrase &ldquo;is never used except to mislead or to explain away&rdquo; and certainly its exact meaning is not beyond the range of controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Malice aforethought&rdquo; is a comprehensive name for a number of different mental attitudes which had been variously defined at different stages in the development of the law as rendering an unlawful killing murder. The statement of these mental attitudes which is most commonly cited as authoritative is that given in 1877 <Col N="53" /> by Stephen.  This definition referred to the following states of mind: (a) an intention to cause the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, any person, whether such person is the person actually killed or not; (b) knowledge that the act which causes death will probably cause the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, some person, whether such person is the person actually killed or not, although such knowledge is accompanied by indifference whether death or grievous bodily harm is caused or not, or even by a wish that it may not be caused.</P>
    <P>The definition also laid down the rule that it was murder to cause death either in furtherance of a felony or in resisting or escaping arrest.  These are the two cases of &ldquo;constructive malice&rdquo; proposed to be abolished by Section 4 of the Bill.  The definition set out in my amendment proposes not only to omit these two cases of constructive malice but also paragraph (b) of Stephen's statement.  It amends paragraph (a) by substituting &ldquo;serious injury&rdquo; for &ldquo;grievous bodily harm&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The dropping of paragraph (b) is the main point of difference between the definition in my amendment and that of Deputy McGilligan.  I need not deal with it because Deputy McGilligan's amendment has not been moved. My idea is that a killing should amount to murder only if the accused person intended to kill or to injure seriously some person.  I think that the law should make this clear distinction because it has a sound moral basis.</P>
    <P>The result of this amendment of the law will be that some killings will be transferred from the category of murder to that of manslaughter.  The maximum punishment for manslaughter&mdash;penal servitude for life&mdash; ensures that those found guilty are adequately punished.  For example, at present a woman may be guilty of murder by virtue of paragraph (b) of Stephen's definition if she exposes a helpless infant in circumstances where there is not a reasonable expectation that it will be found by someone else. Under the definition I now propose, such a woman may still be found guilty of murder but only if the jury are <Col N="54" /> satisfied that she intended to kill the child or cause it serious injury, that is, serious bodily harm.</P>
    <P>Another difference between the common law definition and the statutory definition I now propose is the substitution of an intention to cause &ldquo;serious injury&rdquo; for an intention to cause &ldquo;grievous bodily harm&rdquo;.  Deputy McGilligan's proposal is on the same lines, though he uses &ldquo;really serious&rdquo; for &ldquo;serious&rdquo;.  The reason for abandoning the expression &ldquo;grievous bodily harm&rdquo; is that it has been interpreted in the past, far too broadly in my opinion, as any serious interference with the victim's health or comfort as distinct from what I should regard as the natural meaning of the phrase, that is to say, serious injury.</P>
    <P>An important advantage of defining malice aforethought in statutory form is that it will remove any possibility that an objective test will be applied in determining intention in murder trials.  I do not think that there is any real likelihood that our courts would accept that our law in this respect is the same as that laid down for Britain by the House of Lords in Smith's case in 1960.  In that case, it was held that once the jury were satisfied that the accused was doing something unlawfully and voluntary to someone, it mattered not what the accused contemplated as the probable result of his actions, or whether he ever contemplated at all, provided he was in law responsible and accountable for his actions.  In effect, the test of malice was not what the accused contemplated but what the ordinary reasonable man would contemplate as the probable result of the criminal act.</P>
    <P>This decision has been severely criticised throughout the world, throughout the common law countries anyway, and there was subsequently a case in Australia in which it was very strongly disapproved of.  Most people will agree, I think, that nobody should be found guilty of murder unless he himself intended to kill or cause serious injury.  If he satisfied the jury on this point, it should not matter whether the ordinary responsible man would have intended the result.  Of course, in practice there will usually <Col N="55" /> not be any question as to the difference between the subjective test and the objective test.  There is a presumption, as much of commonsense as of law, that a person must be presumed to have intended the natural and probable consequences of his acts.</P>
    <P>This presumption is being enacted in statutory form as subsection (2) of the revised section 4 proposed by my amendment.  In many cases the inference to be drawn from the accused's acts will be so strong that if he says he really intended no serious harm the jury will simply not believe the evidence.  But if they believe that the accused, in spite of all the appearances, had, in fact, no intention of killing or of doing serious injury, then the jury must find him not guilty.  That is all I have to say on this amendment, which I commend to the House.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister's amendment is really based on similar amendments which were tabled by Deputy McGilligan on Committee Stage and which are being repeated now on Report Stage.  It would only be fencing to try to distinguish between the Minister's amendment and Deputy McGilligan's amendments. For practical purposes, the results would be the same.  It is true that subsection (2) of the Minister's amendment puts the question of the inference to be drawn by a jury in a positive rather than in a negative manner as suggested in one of the amendments which Deputy McGilligan tabled.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has pointed out, under this Bill the doctrine of constructive malice is being abolished. The doctrine that an accidental killing by a person committing a felony&mdash;at any rate, a felony in which violence was involved&mdash;under the doctrine of constructive malice was regarded as murder and punishable as such.  The Minister's amendment gets away from that and puts into the legislation a definition and a guide as far as the question of malice is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one technical point I should like to bring to the Minister's attention and I think it would be worth his while to look at it.  His <Col N="56" /> amendment sets out that where a person kills another unlawfully the killing shall not be murder unless the accused person intended to kill, or cause serious injury.  Clearly, what is intended there is to cause serious bodily injury and I think it would be an improvement to have that inserted at this stage rather than to find it necessary to put it in later, possibly when the matter has been debated not only here but in the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The existing law relating to patents for inventions is contained in Part II and, partly, in Parts I and V of the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act, 1927, as amended by the Acts of 1929, 1947, 1949, 1957 and 1958.  These Acts also dealt with trade marks, industrial designs, and copyright. New Acts relating to copyright and trade marks have recently been passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of the law on patents has now been carried out.  In making the review the patents legislation in other countries has been taken into consideration, and also, the results of the Conference, held at Lisbon in 1958, <Col N="57" /> for the revision of the International Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property.  The Lisbon Revision of the International Convention cannot be ratified until the law is amended in several respects.  Consideration has also been given to various international trends indicated at other conferences which have been held under the auspices of the Council of Europe. These conferences had as their aim the preparation of conventions regarding the filing in several countries of applications for patents for the same invention and also with the unification of the patent laws of different countries.</P>
    <P>There have been many changes of international thought and law on patents since our Act was drawn up in 1927.  I think it is necessary now to modernise our law so as to keep it in step with that of the main industrial countries.  We must also be ready for important changes which may result from the current discussions between patent experts of many countries.  We do not propose fundamental changes in the system of granting protection for inventions.  What the Bill does is to make a number of detailed amendments to the existing law designed to be of advantage both to the inventors and to the general public.</P>
    <P>A major purpose of all patent laws is to encourage invention, but it is recognised that the existence of unjustified or invalid patents is harmful to the public interest.  Our law already provides for the examination of applications for patents to discover whether there is any reason, such as lack of novelty, why a patent ought not to be granted.  It also provides for the revocation of a patent which is shown, after grant, to be invalid.  A number of measures are proposed for strengthening these existing safeguards, which at present are less stringent than those provided by many national laws, and bringing them more into line with modern thought in the European community.</P>
    <P>As regards novelty, the present law requires the Office to make a search through Irish patent specifications before accepting an application.  The applicant is required to show by evidence <Col N="58" /> that his invention has not previously been published in certain British specifications.  The standard of the test for novelty can, at present, vary from case to case.  Applications for alleged inventions which are not new may be accepted merely because the search for novelty is too narrow. It is not feasible for our Patents Office to undertake a complete search for novelty as is done, at very great expense, by some foreign offices.  Instead of this, it is now proposed, in section 8 (6) and section 12, to give the Minister power to prescribe a wider and more uniform test for novelty.  At the same time, an applicant will have the choice of alternative ways of providing evidence in relation to foreign specifications. For example, the applicant might be allowed to submit the result of a novelty search made by an international search organisation, or one made in any one of several foreign countries, in respect of the same invention.</P>
    <P>Further measures to prevent invalid patents being granted or to enable them to be revoked are contained in sections 19, 20, 34 and 35, These sections give wider opportunities than at present exist for interested persons to oppose the grant of such patents or to secure their revocation, if granted.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the existing law for protecting the public from the abuse by the patentee of his monopoly rights are repeated in section 39.  Certain small changes are necessitated by the Lisbon Revision of the International Convention.  The existing powers under which a Minister may use a patented invention when this is necessary in the service of the State are made more comprehensive in section 92.</P>
    <P>There are certain small changes intended to help applicants for patents. Provisions in sections 6 and 22 make it easier to assign the rights in an invention at an early stage.  New provisions in sections 8, 9 and 10 help an inventor who makes or improves an invention in a number of steps.</P>
    <P>The Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks has to make decisions affecting the rights of inventors and others.  The Bill will give him <Col N="59" /> additional duties of this kind.  For example, sections 52 and 53 may require him to settle disputes as to the joint ownership of a patent or the respective rights of an employer and his employee in an invention.  It is, of course, necessary that there should be appeal from decisions of the Controller. Hitherto, appeal has been mainly to the Attorney General.  The Attorney General is also adviser, under the Act, to the Controller.  It is considered undesirable to have advisory and appellate functions combined in this way.  It is proposed, therefore, in section 75 that all such appeals should be heard by a judge of the High Court.  Where an appeal involves a patent specification which has not become open to public inspection the hearing will be in private.  The principals and their agents will have the right of audience.  Under the new provisions the present advantages of secrecy, expedition and cheapness in such appeals will not be lost.</P>
    <P>The present law has provision for implementing the priority provisions of the International Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, to which the State is a party.  It is proposed, in section 93, to provide, in a more general form, powers to implement not only the existing Convention but also the future international arrangements for the mutual protection of inventions to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Section 86 continues the existing provision whereby the practice of patent agency is restricted to persons, with prescribed qualifications, who are entered in the Register of Patent Agents.  The Minister is empowered to authorise temporary exceptions if exceptional circumstances should make such a course necessary.</P>
    <P>Sections 77 to 85, which continue the present provisions for the establishment of an Office and a Controller and his staff, are designed to cover all the activities centred in the Office and the Controller, namely, those in connection with patents, trade marks, industrial designs, and copyright.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the Dáil.</P>
    <Col N="60" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical Bill covering a somewhat complicated matter in so far as much of the work is done by very specialised persons in conjunction with the Controller who is under the direction of and responsible to the Minister.  For these reasons, it is a measure which will probably require discussion in Committee rather than at this stage.</P>
      <P>I have received some representations, as probably other Deputies also have, expressing some concern that the proposed amendments are being made at this stage, on the ground that while the Convention to which the Minister has referred and which was the subject of what is known as the Lisbon Revision has taken place, so far as is known up to the present, very few countries have ratified the Convention and while such a course might be desirable for this country as a prospective member of the European Economic Community, yet at this stage it may be wiser to proceed more slowly.</P>
      <P>I understand that so far Britain, with whom we have close and commercial trading links, has not ratified the Convention.  Perhaps other European countries are considering this matter and may subsequently ratify it, but I should like to hear from the Minister why it is believed that at this stage it is advisable to proceed with changes in the law particularly when, I understand, discussions are proceeding between member countries of the Council of Europe on the general question of bringing patent law into some uniform system and making certain changes which will have universal application.</P>
      <P>One of the criticisms which have been expressed about the present proposals to amend the law is that it is not anticipated that this country would get any reciprocal benefits from them and that, in fact, they may well operate to simplify the procedure for competitors who wish to apply for patent rights or who have patents granted to them elsewhere and that these competitors will, in fact, have advantages which will not be readily available to traders, manufacturers and persons interested in patents here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="61" /> Concern has also been expressed that certain countries have ratified conventions, if not this convention, conventions similar to it, and while subscribing in theory to the terms of these conventions have evaded them in practice.</P>
    <P>It is right to mention these objections because, while we would generally favour modernising our law and bringing it into conformity with whatever changes are seen to be desirable and appear to be practicable, nevertheless, in a matter of this sort unless we have some reciprocal advantages readily available it would appear that the balance of advantage might lie in postponing action rather than taking it at this stage.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, there is, as I have said, a European Patent Law in draft form under official consideration and the view has been expressed that we might postpone action until that draft law has been either accepted by the member countries of the Council of Europe or, at any rate, until further progress has been made on the matter.</P>
    <P>There are one or two aspects of this Bill which it may be as well to draw attention to at this stage.  One is the question of the definition of &ldquo;published&rdquo;. Concern has been expressed that under the proposed changes in the Bill, in page 6, lines 36 and 37, &ldquo;published&rdquo; means made available to the public by the written or spoken word or by public use, or in any other way.</P>
    <P>The consideration has been expressed that oral publication abroad in, say, a country far distant from here with which we have probably very little commercial contacts might be availed of prejudicially so far as persons in this country are concerned and it is suggested that certain amendments should be made in the definition so as to avoid the fears which are possible if the definition of &ldquo;published&rdquo; as at present contained in the Bill is put into the final form.</P>
    <P>There are also some amendments suggested in respect of the procedure whereby applications may be made to the Controller.  However, these are matters which probably can be more <Col N="62" /> appropriately and effectively discussed on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that it is undesirable that the appeal, which has hitherto lain to the Attorney General, should be dealt with by the Attorney General who also acts in an advisory capacity to the Controller and I note that it is proposed under the Bill to change the appeal provisions so that the matter may be considered by a judge of the High Court.  The only consideration which would affect interested parties there is how it would affect costs.  I notice that the Minister said that all the present advantages of secrecy, expedition and cheapness will not be lost.  I would be glad to have a definite assurance from him on that score because persons might be deterred in matters of this sort where the question of an appeal has to be considered by a High Court judge.</P>
    <P>Finally, can the Minister say how many countries have ratified the Lisbon Revision or ratified the Convention and if there is any indication of what other countries propose in the near future to do so?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Lisbon Revision of the Paris Convention is something separate altogether from the recent Convention in Strasbourg on the unification of patent law.  The original International Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property was signed in Paris as far back as 1883.  It was revised several times, the last revision being in Lisbon in 1958.  We acceded to the former revision which was done in London in 1934.  The Lisbon Revision came into force in January 1962 and 22 countries, including France, Germany, Great Britain, Switzerland and the United States, now adhere to that revision.  We are unable to ratify our adherence until our law is amended and this is the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I should say that one of the reasons for bringing forward the Bill at this time, apart altogether from the desirability of ratifying adherence to international conventions, is that all our laws on industrial and commercial property were contained hitherto in one measure.  Even though they were <Col N="63" /> passed in different years, there was just the one piece of legislation governing them all and recently, as the House is aware, new Acts relating to copyright and trade marks have been enacted. Therefore, patents was the only commercial property, if you like, which was omitted.</P>
    <P>To come to the other Convention, the Council of Europe Convention, it was opened for signature at the end of last November.  It was signed almost immediately by Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and Great Britain and some time later Belgium and the Netherlands signed it.  Therefore, we may expect that these Governments will in the normal course seek approval from their respective Parliaments for whatever legislative changes are necessary to bring their national patent laws into conformity with that Convention. Ireland was represented on the Committee of Experts which prepared the Convention.  This Bill is also intended to meet the requirements of that Convention.</P>
    <P>The other Convention of exercises on unification to which the Deputy referred was, I think, the Common Market draft Convention relating to European patent law.  This draft was prepared by a Committee of Representatives of the European Economic Community.  It is only a draft Convention yet.  It is being studied here at present.  We informed the European Economic Community member countries that we would like to take part in the work of final drafting.  We hope, too, to be able to subscribe to the Convention which will finally emerge. Some special legislation may be required when that time comes.  However, having regard to the relatively slow nature of changes in Conventions dealing with patent law, I think it better that we should proceed with this Bill at present.  I believe only very minor alterations in our law will be necessary to bring our current legislation into conformity with the requirements of that Common Market Convention.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy, apart from <Col N="64" /> his general remarks about it, that this Bill might better be discussed in Committee. He referred in particular to the new definition of &ldquo;published&rdquo; in the definition section.  It is common to all patent laws that a patent cannot be valid if its alleged invention is not new.  There can be no patent in such a case.  In most countries an invention is held to lack novelty if it has been made available to the public by description or use at any time in any part of the world.  Ireland and Great Britain have been almost alone in clinging to the view that description or use does not destroy novelty unless it occurred within the State itself.  This concept, which is a survival from times when travel was dangerous and communications slow and difficult, cannot be justified in this age of easy communications by way of radio, radio telephones and otherwise.  Therefore, the Bill in its definition gives effect to this modern concept.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked how I could justify my suggestion that now that an appeal was to be taken from the Comptroller to the High Court rather than to the Attorney General, the costs would be kept down.  Section 75 (3) gives the right of audience in the High Court to the principal people, in other words to the parties themselves. The fact that one can appear personally to prosecute his appeal before the High Court is, I think, the best indication that there is an attempt to keep down the cost of these appeals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Of the three provisions which it contains, two relate to the Circuit Court and one to the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> In relation to the Circuit Court, the Bill provides that the maximum number of ordinary judges of the Circuit Court shall be nine.  As the President of the Circuit Court is, so to speak, a working Circuit Judge, in the sense that he carries out the full duties of a Circuit Court Judge in addition to his functions as President, the practical effect of the Bill will be to provide a maximum of ten Circuit Court Judges.  In doing this, the Bill does no more than restore the strength of the Circuit Court bench to what it was up to last August when, under the provisions of the Courts of Justice Act, 1953, the maximum number of judges fell to be reduced by one on the occurrence of a vacancy.</P>
    <P>It may be recalled that the 1953 Act authorised the Government to reduce the number of circuits of the Circuit Court from nine to eight, with a provision that the judge who would become unassigned to a circuit on the reduction of the number of circuits would remain unassigned pending the occurrence of a vacancy.  There was also a provision that on the occurrence of such vacancy the number of Circuit Court Judges would be reduced by one.</P>
    <P>Owing to a combination of reasons, the Order to which I have referred did not come into effect until 1960.  It reduced the number of circuits by amalgamating the North-Eastern Circuit and the North-Western Circuit into a new circuit called the Northern Circuit.  A vacancy among the Circuit Court Judges did not arise until last August so that up to then there was a spare judge, unassigned to any circuit, who was available to relieve pressure as required.</P>
    <P>When the 1960 Order, which reduced the number of circuits outside Dublin from eight to seven, was being prepared in the latter half of 1959, there was good reason to expect that, on the occurrence of a vacancy, a total of nine judges, inclusive of the President of the Circuit Court, would suffice.  That expectation was based, in particular, on the belief that it would be possible for two judges to handle the volume of Circuit Court work arising in Dublin.  The number of sitting days <Col N="66" /> required in Dublin in the year 1956-57 was 332, in the year 1957-58 was 367 and in the year 1958-59 was 337,&mdash;a load which could be carried without undue difficulty by two judges.</P>
    <P>Since 1958-59, however, the volume of work in Dublin has increased very substantially so that Dublin now requires practically the whole-time services of three judges.  As I mentioned earlier, the unassigned judge was available for service in Dublin until a vacancy occurred last August on the retirement of a Circuit Judge. To avoid the accumulation of arrears to an excessive extent the Government appointed a temporary Circuit Judge at the commencement of term last October.  As there is no reason to expect that there will be, in the near future, any overall reduction in the volume of business, and as there is a very real objection in principle to having temporary judges other than for short periods in exceptional circumstances, the Government decided that the proper course is to seek legislative approval to restore the number of permanent judges to that which obtained for many years up to last August.</P>
    <P>It is the intention that, when the strength of the Circuit Court Bench has been brought up to that prevailing prior to August last, one of the judges will remain unassigned to a particular circuit.  As I have indicated already, his services will, for the most part, be required in Dublin, but he will also be available to give assistance elsewhere as required.</P>
    <P>In view of the situation in Dublin and the number of sitting days required there it will, I think, be accepted generally that virtually the full-time services of a third judge are required.  It may be objected, however, that, in terms of sitting days, many of the circuits and judges outside Dublin are underloaded and that it should be possible to provide the extra judge for Dublin by reducing further the number of provincial circuits or, alternatively, by arranging that some judges assigned to other circuits would help out in Dublin.  These matters have been given careful consideration; regard has been had to the volume of business in the various circuits, to the undesirability <Col N="67" /> of disturbing frequently the constitution of circuits and to the impossibility, because of the large volume of work involved, of having the extra work arising in Dublin performed on what might be described as a casual basis. It has been decided as a result of this examination that the only practical solution is to restore the number of judges to that available up to last August.  In matters of this sort we must strive to be as economical as possible but at the same time we must see to it that our courts function adequately and efficiently and that our people are enabled to have their affairs decided without undue delay or inconvenience.</P>
    <P>The second provision in relation to the Circuit Court is one which enables the Government, when necessary, to alter the composition of the Circuit Court Circuits, other than the Dublin Circuit and the Cork Circuit.  The primary purpose of this provision is to enable the 1960 reorganisation, which led to the creation of the present Northern Circuit, to be modified so as to reduce that circuit to manageable proportions.  The Northern Circuit was formed in the 1960 reorganisation by the amalgamation of the entire North-Western Circuit, which consisted of County Donegal and County Sligo, with the entire North-Eastern Circuit, which consisted of Cavan, Leitrim and Monaghan.  When the 1960 reorganisation was being considered by the Government, some fears were expressed that the new amalgamated Northern Circuit would prove too heavy for one judge.  In the outcome, these fears have proved to be well founded; despite the provision of additional assistance by a second judge, the position in regard to arrears has been unsatisfactory, so that a further revision is unavoidable.  Fortunately, the volume of work in adjacent circuits is such as to permit the transfer to these circuits of some of the extra load from the Northern Circuit, and on the enactment of the present Bill, the Government will take appropriate action on these lines.</P>
    <P>The provision in the present Bill regarding the alteration of circuits is limited in scope, as it is confined to <Col N="68" /> alterations in the composition of circuits by the addition to or removal from a circuit of a county or county borough.  The reorganisations of the Circuit Court authorised by the Courts of Justice Act, 1936 and the Courts of Justice Act, 1953, were much broader in scope and extended to changes in the number of circuits, to the cessation of the assignments of judges and to the making by the Government of fresh assignments of judges to circuits. These latter provisions are not repeated in the provision now before the House, and in view of its limited scope it is considered reasonable that the Government should make changes, of the minor nature envisaged, from time to time without having to seek specific statutory authority.  The section provides for prior consultation between the Government, on the one hand, and the President of the Circuit Court and any judge concerned on the other hand, in relation to any proposed alteration.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Government will have power to alter circuits from time to time, without specific reference to the Houses of the Oireachtas, should not be taken as an indication of the Government's intention to make such alterations with any frequency.  I accept that on general grounds it is desirable that there should be continuity in the composition of circuits so far as it is reasonably possible to maintain this continuity; alterations will be confined to those dictated by considerations of efficiency and of a fair distribution of work.</P>
    <P>The final provision in the Bill relates to the District Court and provides that the times at which justices of the District Court may take their vacations shall be such times as may be approved of by the Minister for Justice.  This provision does no more than confirm the position which has obtained for the past 40 years.  Section 91 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 provided that the District Court Rules Committee might make rules for regulating, among other matters, the vacations of the justices, and Section 92 of the same Act provided that such rules required the approval of the Minister for Home Affairs, now the Minister <Col N="69" /> for Justice.  No. 173 of the District Court Rules, 1926, provided that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Each Justice of the District Court shall be entitled to six weeks holidays in the year, which shall be taken at such time or times as permit of arrangements being made for the proper discharge of public business.</P>
    <P>A fresh version of the District Court Rules was produced in 1948, and these Rules, on the subject of Justices' vacation, confine themselves to providing that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Each Justice shall be entitled to six weeks holidays in the year.</P>
    <P>From 1924 until last year the vacation periods of individual justices were subject to the prior approval of the Minister for Justice, which was given in general or in particular terms as circumstances made appropriate.  The change in the wording of the District Court Rule in 1948 made no difference whatever to arrangements regarding vacation.  In 1963, however, it was contended on behalf of District Justices that they had a right to take vacation at periods chosen by themselves, without the approval of, or even consultation with, the Minister for Justice.  It is obvious that such a contention, if accepted, would make it impossible to arrange for the smooth running of the District Court service, and could readily lead to chaos.  The provision in section 5 of the present Bill is designed to maintain the position which has operated in the public interest, and with due regard to the convenience of District Justices, for the past 40 years.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the provisions of the Bill as it stands at present, I should like to mention at this stage that I propose to introduce at the Committee Stage, by way of two amendments, two new provisions designed to improve the efficiency of the Circuit Court and the District Court.</P>
    <P>The first of these provisions is designed to impose a restriction on the right of transfer of a criminal case from the Circuit Criminal Court to the Central Criminal Court.  This is a matter which has already engaged the attention of the Dáil.  Deputies will recall that a provision to restrict this <Col N="70" /> right was included in the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill, 1959, as introduced, and that in the course of the debate I permitted myself to be persuaded not to proceed with the provision. In the intervening period, however, it is becoming progressively clearer that some such restriction is necessary in order to prevent dislocation of court business and avoidable hardship and inconvenience to witnesses and others.  The amendment which I shall introduce provides that if the Attorney General or the accused wishes to apply for a transfer of a criminal case from the Circuit Court to the Central Criminal Court, and give seven days notice of the application, the application must be granted. If such notice is not given, the court will have discretion whether or not to grant the application.  I propose that the right to transfer shall be confined, as at present, to offences carrying a maximum penalty exceeding one year's imprisonment or five years' penal servitude.</P>
    <P>The second amendment which I intend to put down provides for the service of Circuit Court and District Court documents by registered post in areas where the post of summons server is vacant or becomes vacant. With the progressive improvement in the employment situation throughout the country it has become clear that we cannot hope to keep the number of summons servers, of whom there are about 400, up to strength throughout the country, as suitable persons will not be attracted in sufficient numbers unless the Exchequer is called upon to accept a much heavier charge in the way of retainer fees.  These fees have recently been increased substantially at a cost of about £6,000 a year, bringing the total annual charge to £20,000 approximately.  I am satisfied that in this matter the State has gone as far as it can reasonably be expected to go in subsidising the cost of what is very largely the initiation of civil proceedings. The service of Circuit Court documents by registered post operated satisfactorily for a number of years during the Emergency, and precedents for the service of court documents by registered post have recently been set in the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, <Col N="71" /> the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1960, and the Charities Act, 1961.  Registered post service is now an accepted idea on the Continent and is, indeed, being provided for in the Uniform Law on Arbitration now being drafted at Strasbourg, which it is hoped to have adopted in this country.  We already have provision for such service in our Arbitration Act of 1954.  The change to registered post, which will be confined to areas where there is no summons server, will in time make a significant contribution to reducing the cost of litigation.</P>
    <P>The contents of the Bill as it stands at present, together with the two additional provisions which I have mentioned, will help to improve the efficiency of our legal system and I am happy to recommend that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the case made by the Minister for this Bill, there is, I think, very little to recommend it to the House.  Substantially, this Bill is introduced for the purpose of increasing the number of judges in the Circuit Court.  I should have expected the Minister, when recommending this Bill to the House, to have given Deputies some idea of the type and volume of work Circuit Court judges are required to do, not only in the Dublin Circuits but throughout the country.  The Minister has not done that.  He has not given the House anything on which the House could judge adequately the recommendation he has made to the House.  He has not told the House what effect alteration in the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and the District Court has had on the question of overloading or underloading the lists with which Circuit Court judges have to deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly inopportune, I think, that the Minister should invite the House to increase the number of Circuit Court judges at a time when the Government have announced their intention of taking away from the Circuit Court jurisdiction workmen's compensation cases, which I have no doubt the House and the Minister will <Col N="72" /> concede, form a very large part of the work of the Circuit Court, particularly in rural areas.  At a time when the Government, through the &ldquo;medium&rdquo;, have announced their policy of taking that work away from the Circuit Court, the Minister comes in here and invites the House to increase the number of judges in the Circuit Court. He will find it very difficult to explain that in such a way as to make it acceptable to and accepted by the people.</P>
    <P>Remember, it was only a comparatively few years ago that Ministers of the Minister's Party were solemnly announcing their intentions to reduce the numbers in the Civil Service and to reduce costs.  Here is a Bill brought in by the Minister now for the purpose of upsetting a decision of this House, taken in 1953, to reduce the number of Circuit Court judges.  It is brought in, as I say, at a time when a colleague of the Minister's announces in the House that it is the Government's intention to take away from the jurisdiction of the court questions dealing with workmen's compensation, which form a very large volume of the work transacted in that court.</P>
    <P>That is the major proposal in this Bill.  It seems to me unwise for the Minister to proceed with this proposal at the moment.  It is unwise for him to proceed with it in view of the circumstances to which I have referred &mdash;the imminent departure from the Circuit Court of a great volume of its work.  It is unwise to proceed with it, too, at a time when the cost of Government in this country is running at such a high level.</P>
    <P>A case might be made for this, but it would require to be demonstrated to the House.  I suggest to the Minister that this particular proposal might be left over for the present and if, when we have had some experience of how the new policy in relation to workmen's compensation works out, then, in the light of that experience, the position could be further reviewed and if the court lists are clogged up and the work is not capable of being discharged with reasonable expedition, then it would be time enough, I think, for the Minister to come to this House <Col N="73" /> with his proofs and say to the House that it is clear that, notwithstanding the reduction in the work, other work has taken its place, the court lists are still clogged and have to be freed by the appointment of another judge, or two Circuit Court judges.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has made a reasonable case for his proposal at the moment.  While I appreciate the Minister's remarks with regard to the alteration in circuits, I do not feel at all happy about the idea of a Minister being able to alter circuits without reference to this House.  I do not propose saying any more on that subject at the moment because, as the Minister pointed out, the variations contemplated by him are of a comparatively minor character and he has given an assurance in his opening statement that it is not intended to have recourse to that part of the Bill to any great extent.</P>
    <P>The third proposal in the Bill, as it stands, is the question of the annual vacations for district justices.  I gather from the Minister that the procedure has been that the annual holidays were, in fact, arranged with the sanction of the Minister, or his Department, and I agree that is as it should be.  It does seem to me, however, that a question arises by virtue of the Court Rules of 1948, to which the Minister referred, which provide simply that district justices shall be entitled to six weeks holidays in the year, without any limiting or defining factor.  A question arises as to whether or not the Minister is not by this proposal altering the conditions of service of existing district justices.</P>
    <P>I have every sympathy with the Minister's point of view.  Holidays should be arranged with the consent and approval of the Minister, or his Department, to ensure there will not be any upset to the work that has to be done in the District Court.  At the same time, I would be slow to legislate retrospectively in such manner as to alter the conditions of service of a person already appointed.  I shall leave that thought with the Minister.</P>
    <P>So far as the other two matters mentioned by the Minister are concerned, I think the better course would <Col N="74" /> be to leave over discussion on them until we see the Minister's amendments. I would urge the Minister, however, to reconsider this question of adding to the number of Circuit Court judges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that Deputy O'Higgins feels I have not made a sufficient case for the appointment of an extra Circuit Court judge.  I was perhaps misled in that I thought Deputy O'Higgins, as a busy practitioner in Dublin, would have been even more aware of the position and the need for this appointment than I am.  All through last year I had experience of prominent Dublin solicitors, friends of mine or known to me in some way, ringing me up and appealing to me, for heaven's sake, to have a look at the morning's list and see the condition to which the business in the Dublin Circuit Court was steadily declining.</P>
      <P>There are some figures which I think illustrate fairly clearly how things have been developing.  In 1958-59 the number of sitting days in Dublin was 337. That increased in 1959-60 to 436.  That further increased in 1962-63 to 464. Therefore, in that short space of time, the number of sittings increased from 337 to 464.  It is not quite fair for Deputy O'Higgins to talk about this Bill providing for an increase in the number of judges.  All we are doing is maintaining the existing number. The proposal was made in 1953 to reduce the number.  That proposal never became operative because, as Deputies know, a retirement did not take place until last autumn.  Therefore, right up to last autumn, we had ten Circuit Court judges and all this Bill seeks to do is to keep that position.</P>

I am assured by the judges, by counsel and by solicitors that the situation in that northern circuit is unworkable and is steadily becoming more so.  Indeed, a prominent member of the Fine Gael Party suggested, when talking to me about this matter, that I should appoint two extra Circuit Court Judges and not one, as I am proposing to do now.  On his assessment of the situation, he assured me that I would be forced to do it eventually and that I might as well do it now.</P>

      <P>Not at the present time.  Deputy O'Higgins has a point, which is to some extent valid, about the proposal to take workmen's compensation cases away from the Circuit. That has been announced as a matter of Government policy.  From my point of view, as the one responsible for the administration of justice, I do not know yet how that proposal is going to work, whether the courts will be still involved to a lesser or a greater extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy Collins is speaking from considerable experience when he says that.  I would be very reluctant at this stage to make any sort of estimate.  My colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, is working on this scheme at the moment. Until it has been settled and promulgated, we will not know exactly what the result of the change will be on the courts.  In the meantime, surely it would be very unwise to let the situation drift?  Deputy O'Higgins is going the wrong way about this.  He says: <Col N="76" />&ldquo;Let us wait until we see how this affects the courts and then decide what to do&rdquo;.  My attitude is the opposite. We must deal with the present situation. I am proposing to deal with it now.  I do not know when this new scheme will become workable.  By that time, if we find we can do without a judge in the Circuit Court, it will be a simple matter to wait for the first retirement.  These retirements come up all the time.  If at that stage we find it not necessary to reappoint, we need not reappoint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not go that far.  Whatever the effect of the change in the workmen's compensation will be, it is true that in our time the work done by the Circuit Court will progressively increase.  Far from dealing with a declining volume of business, I am sure that from year to year a far greater volume of business will be dealt with in the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>My attitude on this is that it is the general public who matter.  We all agree that we want to see our people get speedy and efficient justice and get it at the cheapest possible price.  That is the objective and ideal at which we should aim.  If we are to have this valuable Circuit Court clogged up, then we are not doing a good service to our people.  We owe it to them to enable them to have access to this court readily, freely and without any undue delay or inconvenience.  That is why we are bringing this proposal to the House.  I can assure Deputies that by the time I was satisfied this proposal was necessary and was able to satisfy my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and the Government that it was desirable, every argument was well considered and every aspect of the matter was carefully probed.  It was only because everybody concerned was satisfied it was necessary that I brought this Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Higgins mentions, I think it is better to leave over the discussion <Col N="77" /> of other aspects of the Bill to the Committee Stage.  I recommend the Bill to the House as something vitally necessary for the administration of justice in the country at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The district justices have always been very co-operative indeed.  The system could not work without the maximum amount of co-operation. What happens is that in each year we work out pairing arrangements. Two district justices arrange to go on leave at different times and one takes over the other's district when he is away.  This is worked out in advance with my Department.  The business proceeds quite smoothly.  If it were to be contended seriously by one or two or more district justices that they were entitled to take their holidays at any time they wished, without reference to my Department or without reference to these pairing arrangements, we would be in serious difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  I think the first point I should make in moving the Second Reading is that this is the first occasion on which a Bill dealing with extradition has been introduced in the Oireachtas.  Why this should be so, after over 40 years of independence, is mainly attributable, in my opinion, to two factors.  The first of these is that very few criminals from continental countries have taken refuge here. Secondly, the arrangements for the surrender of offenders to Britain, and from Britain to the State, have operated satisfactorily enough in practice, notwithstanding that they are based on pre-1922 statutes which have had to be adapted in recognition of the altered political circumstances.</P>
      <P>Whatever the reasons may be for not having legislated on extradition before now, it is a fact that there are several advantages attached to our late entry to this field.  It enables us to profit from the experience gained from the drafting of the multilateral European Convention on Extradition which was in preparation for several years under the auspices of the Council of Europe before it was opened for signature in 1957.  What is perhaps more important, it enables us to provide for the enforcement, on a reciprocal basis, of warrants for ordinary criminal offences emanating from Northern Ireland, a step which might not have been possible before now.  This particular provision is, in my opinion, the most significant one in the entire Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to justify the need for a Bill of this kind.  It is universally recognised among civilised countries that an offender should not be permitted to escape justice by fleeing from the State where he has committed the offence to another jurisdiction.  The remarkable improvements in communications and transport in the past century have made the provision of efficient extradition arrangements more necessary than ever.  These improvements have, on the one hand, facilitated the escape of offenders and, on the other, have made the return of these offenders to the countries where the crimes have been committed far less oppressive than was the case formerly.  The real significance of this latter point is that where the return of an offender would involve a prolonged period of travel, extradition might constitute a supplementary punishment in excess of what the particular offence would deserve. Nowadays, when no country is more than a day or two distant from another by jet travel this particular aspect of extradition has ceased to have the same validity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the actual provisions of <Col N="81" /> the Bill, I think that the only provision in Part I to which I need refer at this stage is section 7, which contains certain transitory provisions about extradition arrangements made with the former United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland before 1922, and which may be still in force.  Over 40 of these treaties were in force before 1922, but it is not possible to say definitively which of them are still in force as this is dependent to a large extent on recognition by the States concerned of the applicability of these treaties in our present circumstances. It has not been necessary in practice to invoke more than a few of these treaties, but it can be said that some of them are regarded as binding and could be invoked by us to procure the return of an offender.</P>
    <P>Clearly the present position is unsatisfactory, and it is proposed to negotiate formal extradition agreements in due course under the authority of this piece of legislation.  These negotiations will necessarily take some time but in the meantime it is essential that such of the existing treaties as may be in force should be continued in force. Section 7 provides accordingly, but it places a limit on the operation of the existing treaties beyond 1st January, 1968.  From that date onwards the only extradition arrangements which will be valid will be those negotiated after the commencement of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with extradition generally to countries other than Northern Ireland and Britain.  It sets out the principles which should govern extradition to these countries, principles which must be observed by the Government in concluding extradition agreements or conventions or in applying the provisions of this Part to countries without such a formal extradition agreement.  These principles are almost entirely based on those enunciated in the European Convention on Extradition to which I have already referred and which it is proposed to ratify as soon as the Bill becomes law.  The Convention came into force in 1960 and, so far, has been ratified by six members of the Council of Europe, namely, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Norway, Sweden and Turkey.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> Acceptance of the principles governing the European Convention involves a departure from the present practice of requiring proof of a <i>prima facie</i> case against the person claimed before his extradition is permitted.  This requirement is a feature of the Anglo-American tradition.  In the continental civil law countries generally, extradition may be allowed on evidence that a person is wanted for prosecution or punishment under an order of a competent authority of the requesting country.  I believe it is consistent with our desire to participate fully and effectively as a member of the European community that we should be prepared to subscribe to the principles generally acceptable to the rest of that community.  It is to be presumed that any country with which we may make an extradition agreement will not forward through its diplomatic representatives a warrant for the arrest of a person on a criminal charge unless that warrant has been properly issued on receipt of a complaint by the party aggrieved or on reasonable suspicion that the person claimed has committed an offence against the law.</P>
    <P>All this involves making, so to speak, an act of faith in the administration of justice in the countries with which we are likely to make extradition arrangements, whether these countries be within the Council of Europe or outside it.  My view is that we should not enter into an extradition arrangement at all with any country unless we are satisfied as to the integrity of its judicial institutions; but once we are so satisfied then we should accept a properly authenticated warrant of arrest or of conviction emanating from that country as having been made on reasonable suspicion that the person claimed has committed the offence in question and as an order which should be enforced here without further inquiry into the merits of the accusation.</P>
    <P>What I am saying does not apply to offences of a political, revenue or purely military character for which warrants of arrest may be received. These warrants will not, of course, be enforced.  But in the case of ordinary criminal warrants it must be assumed <Col N="83" /> that any countries with which we have extradition treaties will not forward them unless there are reasonable grounds for thinking that an offence against that country's laws has been committed by the person whose surrender is requested.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also notice that extraditable offences are not being specifically listed as they were in the 1870 Act.  Instead, an extraditable offence is being defined by reference to the maximum penalty which may be imposed for it under the law of the two countries concerned or, where the person has already been sentenced, by the actual penalty imposed. The advantage of having a list of extradition crimes is that extradition can be confined to specified serious crimes, such as murder, manslaughter, robbery with violence, <i>et cetera,</i> but in practice, as in the Extradition Act, 1870, some crimes are specified in general terms which would permit extradition for what possibly might be trivial offences, for example, obtaining money or goods by false pretences.  The disadvantage is that fresh legislation must be enacted whenever it becomes necessary to add to the list of extraditable crimes.  Difficulties may arise, too, owing to the lack of uniformity in the definition of crimes under different systems of criminal law.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the balance of advantage seems to lie in the solution adopted in the European Convention. Accordingly, section 10 of the Bill provides that an offence to be extraditable must be punishable under the law of both countries to the extradition arrangement by a maximum of at least one year's imprisonment or, if there has been a conviction and sentence, where imprisonment for a period of at least four months or a more severe penalty, such as the death penalty, has been imposed.  It may be noted that these limits are minimum limits.  A particular extradition arrangement could provide, for example, that extradition would be allowed only for offences carrying a maximum penalty of two years or, say, even five years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="84" /> Another change of significance&mdash; though it is a change of emphasis rather than of substance&mdash;is that prohibiting the extradition of citizens in the absence of any provision to the contrary in the relevant extradition arrangement.  There is no provision in the present law restricting extradition of nationals but the reciprocity clause inserted in extradition arrangements has a severely limiting effect as in many countries extradition of nationals is prohibited by law.</P>
    <P>The advantages of extraditing nationals are such that I should expect it would be the policy of any Government to allow it provided reciprocity was being afforded.  The main advantage is, of course, that it is easier to deal with a case before a court in the country where the offence has been committed and where witnesses are readily available.  Moreover, non-extradition of nationals implies an obligation on the requested State to prosecute the offender in its own courts. This procedure is likely to prove unsatisfactory under a system such as ours which attaches the greatest importance to oral evidence, having regard to the difficulty of transporting witnesses over long distances and having them available at particular stages of the proceedings.</P>
    <P>However, it is the case that many countries are not willing to extradite their nationals.  The Government have recognised this position in Section 14 by providing that normally our citizens may not be extradited but that the extradition agreement may provide otherwise.  It is the intention that extradition of citizens will be allowed only on a basis of reciprocity.  As a consequence of making provision for non-extradition of citizens, section 37 provides that an Irish citizen who has been accused of committing an offence in a country with which we have an extradition arrangement may be prosecuted for the offence in our courts where that country has requested that such proceedings be taken and where the Attorney General so directs.</P>
    <P>Part II contains also a number of provisions which are customary in international extradition practice, such as the restriction on extradition for <Col N="85" /> political, revenue or purely military offences.  These provisions are, I believe, generally acceptable and I do not think it necessary to list them here. They are all contained in the European Convention on extradition.  The Bill proposes, however, to reduce the period for which a person committed to await extradition must remain in this country before surrender from fifteen days to eight days and it provides also that a person may be surrendered before that period expires with his consent, to be evidence before a district justice.  These provisions recognise the improvement in communications since the 1870 Act. In addition there is provision in section 33 that a person in custody awaiting surrender may be released, if, owing to his state of health, he cannot be surrendered within a reasonable time. There is no specific provision to this effect in the Convention.</P>
    <P>May I say before leaving Part II that an endeavour has been made to follow the text of the European Convention as far as practicable?  This procedure has considerable advantages from the point of view of establishing uniformity of interpretation.  Our courts will be able to have regard to decisions of foreign courts on the provisions of this Convention when interpreting the provisions of Part II and of extradition agreements to which we become party.</P>
    <P>I shall now turn to Part III of the Bill.  In contrast with Part II which, having regard to previous experience, is likely to be availed of rather infrequently, the provisions of this Part will be invoked regularly as between ourselves and Northern Ireland and Britain.  Its most important aspect is that it enables Northern warrants to be enforced here.  Any instance of co-operation between ourselves and the North is welcome but I think it is fair to say that the reciprocal enforcement of warrants in criminal cases which is now to take place is particularly welcome and will be of considerable mutual benefit.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill have been the subject of discussion between officers of my Department and representatives of the Belfast Ministry of Home Affairs and the Home Office in <Col N="86" /> London.  As a result of these discussions, our warrants will be enforced in the North as from the commencement of the Bill under existing legislation and will continue to be enforced in Britain.</P>
    <P>The present authority for the enforcement here of British warrants is section 29 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851.  The arrangements have operated satisfactorily in practice since the establishment of the State. However, after a review of the arrangements in connection with the promotion of the present Bill the Government decided that they should be modified in a number of respects, notably by the introduction of certain safeguards common to international extradition practice.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, provision has been made for prohibiting the surrender of persons who are accused of political offences, offences connected with such offences, purely military offences or revenue offences and in cases where there are substantial reasons for believing that the persons concerned will in fact be prosecuted for political offences or offences connected with them or for purely military offences.</P>
    <P>Moreover, warrants relating to offences punishable by less than three months imprisonment and warrants for imprisonment in default of payment of a sum of money will not be enforced. Restrictions have also been introduced on the enforcement of warrants for summary offences committed in Northern Ireland or Britain.  These restrictions are designed to ensure that a person will not be arrested on a warrant for a summary offence unless he has had adequate notice of the court hearing.  The object is to afford him an opportunity of voluntarily attending the court himself.  A further safeguard for the individual's rights is the provision that any person arrested on a Northern or British warrant must on arrest be given a reasonable opportunity of consulting a solicitor if he wishes to do so.</P>
    <P>The introduction of safeguards in relation to political, revenue and purely military offences has made it necessary to provide that, as far as practicable, a person shall not be <Col N="87" /> arrested where the offence falls within one of these excluded categories. Accordingly, it is proposed that the Minister for Justice will have power to direct that a warrant be not endorsed for execution where he is of opinion that it comes within any one of these categories.  Alternatively, in such a case the Minister may refer the question whether the warrant should be endorsed or not to the High Court for determination.  Apart from these provisions, any person who has been arrested under Part III may, in addition to the ordinary right of <i>habeas corpus</i>, apply to the Minister for Justice or the High Court for a direction for his release on any of these grounds.</P>
    <P>The only remaining provision to which I should like to draw attention is subsection (2) of section 3 of the Bill.  Under this subsection the Act will apply, except where otherwise provided, in relation to an offence whether committed or alleged to have been committed before or after the passing of this Act.  The 1870 Act provided that a &ldquo;fugitive criminal&rdquo; was liable to be extradited whether the crime in respect of which his surrender was requested was committed before or after the passing of that Act.</P>
    <P>In relation to British warrants, the provision is necessary because some of the warrants which will be coming along after the commencement of this Bill will relate to offences committed before then and which can under the present law be sent here for endorsement. As regards Northern Ireland warrants, which will be coming here for the first time, the section will permit the endorsement and enforcement of warrants for crimes alleged to have been committed at any time in the past.  It will be open to us also to forward warrants to Northern Ireland or Britain for offences committed before the commencement of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of expressing appreciation of the assistance given by the Northern and British authorities in connection with the examination of this legislation and their helpful approach throughout the discussions.  As a result, I think it can <Col N="88" /> be fairly claimed that the enforcement of the criminal law in these islands has been brought to a commendable degree of efficiency while preserving fully the rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>May I express the hope that the Bill marks the beginning of further beneficial co-operation in the administration of justice?  I have already communicated tentative proposals for the reciprocal enforcement of various orders and judgments made by Northern and British courts in civil cases and I have little doubt that it will be possible to work out in due course a satisfactory system of mutual enforcement. The most important of these orders, from the point of view of the general public, is the maintenance order.  I am satisfied that the absence of arrangements for reciprocal enforcement of these orders in particular is causing hardship to many wives in this country and I shall endeavour to press ahead with these proposals as quickly as possible. Examination is also proceeding of proposals for the recognition and enforcement of civil judgments and orders of the courts of other jurisdictions. The Hague Conference on Private International Law is, in fact, engaged in the preparation of a draft convention on the subject.</P>
    <P>There is also scope for other measures of mutual assistance between our courts here and courts outside the State in both civil and criminal matters &mdash;such as the service of witness summonses, the attendance of witnesses and the taking of evidence on commission. These aspects are also being actively considered and proposals for legislation to deal with them are in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that the Government consider this to be a desirable and non-controversial measure which will improve substantially the administration of justice and fill a gap in our criminal law which has existed far too long.  If there are any points arising on the Bill which I have not dealt with in the course of this opening statement or any particular provisions which Deputies would like to have clarified, I shall endeavour to deal with them when replying.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> I trust that the House will agree to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We can agree with the Minister that this is not a controversial Bill in the ordinary sense.  As he has pointed out, it is a new departure here in that it is the first Extradition Bill introduced in the Dáil. Generally speaking people will agree that it is reasonable that there should be extradition provisions in force between this country and other countries and, of course, what brings this Bill before the Dáil, in fact, is the European Convention on Extradition. The Minister's officials deserve to be congratulated on the clarity with which the relative provisions of the European Convention have been shown in this Bill by the marginal notes.  I found, on reading the Bill side by side with the Convention, that the references to the various articles in the Convention in the marginal notes were extremely helpful.</P>
      <P>There are some points, however, which I think should be raised in connection with the Bill and which possibly the Minister may clarify.  He has pointed out that the existing practice of requiring a country which sought the extradition of an individual to show that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case against that person goes by the board under this Bill.  That is not specifically done in a positive way here by the Bill or by the European Convention but it is done in the sense that under the Bill and the Convention, certain documents which are required to support the request for extradition are set out and none of these is such that it is necessary to have established in them a <i>prima facie</i> case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure that is a good departure. It is something that should be considered very closely and carefully. The Bill provides that evidence of the institution of proceedings against someone who is in this country&mdash;proceedings instituted abroad&mdash;will be sufficient.  I am not in a position to talk with any authority&mdash;I do not know if other Deputies are&mdash;in regard to the procedure for instituting proceedings in other countries.  I think it is not reasonable to assume that merely <Col N="90" /> because proceedings are instituted either here or in other countries there is in fact a good case against the person against whom proceedings are brought.  Consequently, we should look very carefully at the provision obviating the necessity for satisfying the authorities here when a request for extradition is made that there is at least a <i>prima facie</i> case to be answered by the person against whom the extradition order is sought.</P>
    <P>There are protective provisions in the Bill&mdash;and they appear in the European Convention also&mdash;in regard to political offences and extradition will not lie in the case of political offences.  It is important to know, however, who is to decide on the question of political offences and questions related to political offences which are also excluded under the Bill.  As I read it, it seems that that decision rests solely with the Minister for Justice.  It seems to me a matter of sufficiently wide importance to warrant a decision by the Government rather than by the individual Minister and I suggest that amendment might at least be considered in regard to the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are other matters of a more detailed nature to which I should like to refer briefly.  In section 14 it is provided that extradition shall not be granted where a person claimed is a citizen of Ireland, unless the relevant extradition provisions otherwise provide. I am not entirely sure of what is meant by the term &ldquo;relevant extradition provisions&rdquo;.  I should have thought that the extradition provisions which are being made here are the provisions contained in this Bill.  I assume that that is possibly a reference back to section 8 of the Bill which, to my mind, constitutes one of the weaknesses of the Bill in that it means that to a very large extent this Bill consists of legislation by ministerial order.  I do not think such legislation is, in ordinary circumstances, the type of legislation that should be encouraged.</P>

      <P>The second point I want to raise in connection with section 14 is purely a request for information.  Section 14 is the provision which is designed to cover Article 6 (1) (a) of the European Convention and that Article of the Convention provides for the deposit of a definition of &ldquo;nationals&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House very long on this motion.  The Minister will quite possibly accept the spirit of the motion as he is well aware of the valuable and useful part played by retired and ex-members of the RIC in the struggle for the freedom we now enjoy in this country.  Too often jibes and contumely have been heaped on what, in effect, was a vital contribution made by these people.  It would be remiss of me not to say that the experience I have gained by investigation of the period shows that in elements of the intelligence work of the 1918 to 1921 period, a contribution completely out <Col N="92" /> of proportion to numbers was made by this organisation that was of invaluable help to the national effort. I feel that the Minister will view this decreasing body of people sympathetically.</P>
      <P>I shall not enter into the rights and wrongs of what has been undone over a number of years.  I do feel that in the mood of agreement that is being reached in connection with the ninth round of wage increases, in the mood of co-operation being sought between various sections of the community, employers and workers alike, we should seriously think about putting in order some of the houses that can be put in order at no inordinate cost. I would urge on the Minister that he should do all that this motion seeks and if possible a bit more because I do not think anybody can be more aware of the difficult circumstances under which these pensioners are living.</P>
      <P>A certain type of grandiose spending being a peculiar facet of Government contemplation at the moment, one feels that one is merely pushing an open door in asking for the consideration asked for by this motion for these retired or pensioned members of the RIC.  The amount of money involved is very small.  The amount of satisfaction it would give to the people concerned would be immense.  The delayed recognition of their more than significant contribution to the cause that gave us the right even to discuss the possibility of increases for them should warrant the Minister's favourable consideration.</P>
      <P>I shall not preach on their merit except to say that the Minister will find a spirit of complete unanimity in this House in respect of any attempt he may make to gratify their outstanding claims and give this very limited class a reasonable prospect of being able to exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reference to a point raised by Deputy Collins, I want to say that there is no disputing the fact that those who resigned from the RIC during the struggle here for independence played a very significant part in our fight for freedom and I am sure that <Col N="93" /> nobody on any side of this House wants to denigrate the actions or the efforts of these men at that time.  Even though I agree with that, that is not to say that I should accept the motion. The last part of the motion says &ldquo;and grant them parity with their comrades who continued in the service&rdquo;.  I can only say that the Deputy who put down the motion is begging the question.</P>
      <P>There are two classes we are dealing with here.  There are those who resigned and were dismissed for political reasons during the years roughly from 1919 to 1921 and then there are those who remained on in the force until after the Treaty was signed and who were disbanded by the British Government, I think, early in 1922.</P>
      <P>The arguments put up by those who advocate this motion would go to show that we were not as kind to the resigned and dismissed as the British Government were to the disbanded.  That is the point I want to deal with in particular. First of all, if we go back to the beginning, we find that the terms of the pensions given by the Irish Government and the British Government were largely the same.  There were some slight differences which I shall refer to.  The pensions in both cases were based on service and, with certain slight exceptions, a man who resigned in 1919 or 1920 with, say, ten years' service, got practically the same terms as the man who was disbanded by the British Government and who had ten years' service in 1922. So there could be no complaint by the men who went out at that time against the Irish Government at the time in awarding the pensions they did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were, as I say, certain slight differences.  The biggest difference, I would say, was that those who resigned or were dismissed were not granted a pension if they had not more than three years' service.  On the British side, a pension was given for even less than three years' service.  The reasons&mdash;as far as I can deduce, going back over these papers&mdash;why those who had less than three years' service were not granted a pension came from two different angles.  I should say perhaps <Col N="94" /> that the Provisional Government at that time set up a committee to examine the claims of those men.  The claims were examined by that committee and it made a submission to the then Minister for Finance.  I think he accepted the recommendations except that he did not give a pension to anybody with less than three and a half years' service.  I suppose every Deputy will know that I had no hand, act or part in it.  I do not want to disagree with his ruling.</P>
    <P>From one angle, I think the Minister was of the opinion that a person who came into the RIC after Easter Week must or should have known that he was joining a force which was not very favourable to the independence of this country.  Secondly, it was argued, from perhaps a more sustainable ground, that a person who was only three or three and a half years in the force was not there so long that he could not fit himself into some other occupation.</P>
    <P>We all know that if a person is in an occupation such as a police force, is there for some years and then comes out, he finds it difficult to get an occupation that will suit him. That applies to many other occupations as well as to the police force. A person who is young and who goes in at probably 18 or 19 years of age and who is there only three or four years and then comes out is still young and pliable and can fit himself into nearly any position that is going. Therefore, taking these points of view, there is at least a case to be made for the ruling of the then Minister for Finance that a person with under three and a half years' service could not be considered for a pension.</P>
    <P>There was the difference also that if the resigned or dismissed man got a pension from the Irish Government and subsequently went into any Government service, he lost his pension. That was fair enough, in my opinion. If a person had been in the RIC for whatever number of years he might have spent there and came out and got a job in Government service which, from the finance point of view, was as good, I think the Government <Col N="95" /> of the time should not be expected to compensate him for his service in the RIC.  His pension would be adjusted afterwards when his service in the Government Department he joined had ceased.</P>
    <P>We come across cases even yet where a man joined the Garda and is now retiring.  His pension is adjusted in view of the fact that he was entitled to an RIC pension as well as to a pension for service in the Garda Síochána.  I have come across some such cases myself.  That was fair enough, too.</P>
    <P>The third point was that there was some slight difference but, as far as I can investigate it, it was of no material consequence whatever.  There was a slight difference in the calculation of the service from the Irish point of view and from the British point of view.  These were the differences.  As I say, with these differences in mind, the pension was based on the service given by the man, whether he resigned, was dismissed, or was disbanded by the British Government.  Therefore, I think we must come to the conclusion that the men who were taken on by the Irish Government were as well treated, on the whole, as those who remained on until the force was disbanded by the British.</P>
    <P>One point, perhaps, where we might say it was a bit unfair concerned the men who were not considered for a pension at that time if they had not at least three and a half years' service. In 1934 the position was again reviewed. Another committee or commission was set up at that time.  They made a slight alteration in favour of certain applicants: they brought the three and a half years' rule down to three years.  Apart from that, I think they made very little change.  They considered, I think, the claims of certain men which were rejected in 1922. I am not sure they admitted them but, if they did, it was in a very few cases.</P>
    <P>In both these cases the commission which was appointed did not consist of members of this House.  I believe the chairman of the first commission <Col N="96" /> was a member of this House, but it was composed of men who would be regarded as neutral.  The first commission had representatives of the resigned and dismissed men.  The second commission had no representatives.  It was composed of a district justice, an accountant and a representative of the Minister for Finance.  They made their recommendations and the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance accepted them.  Therefore, it must be admitted that, in the early times when these men's cases were considered, they were justly treated&mdash; as well treated, indeed, as could be expected for any set of men who had claims on the State.</P>
    <P>The question came up again rather acutely in 1950.  It was considered at that time that no change should be made.  It came up again in the past few years and it comes up again now and it is again considered that no change should be made.  Even if I were inclined to agree that the three years' rule was a harsh rule, it would be impossible to go back on it now. Deputies will agree that most of the evidence is almost impossible to procure now.  It would be a job that could hardly be tackled now to go back over those cases again.</P>
    <P>The Deputy who moved this motion is more interested, I think, in the treatment the present pensioners are getting. Therefore, we have to address ourselves to that point rather than to anything else.  Since these pensions were given, the British gave certain increases and so did we in this country.  The last increase we gave here brought the pension up to what the pensioner would get if he were in the same position, let us say, as a Garda retiring on 1st March 1960.  That certainly is not bad treatment for men who retired so many years back.  I think everybody here would have a fair idea&mdash;I have not looked for the figure&mdash;of the salary of a man retiring in 1922 and that of a man retiring in 1960.  If the pension is based on the 1960 salary, he certainly has not any great complaint to make.</P>
    <P>As far as parity goes, I have been trying to find out what the disbanded men are getting&mdash;those who <Col N="97" /> are being looked after by the British.  I have not been able to find out but I know that the increases which were given, so much of an increase here and so much there, over the years have been just as favourable on this side as they are on the British side.  If in particular cases our men are not as well treated as those on the British side at least the difference makes no material impact on a man's income.  It is quite possible that in some cases also the men who resigned or were dismissed are better treated than those who were disbanded later on.</P>
    <P>As I say, I did not find it easy to get figures but I know that the increases given in pensions generally have been as favourable in this country as they have been in Britain and I presume that where these have been applied all round, as generally they are, the position of men who resigned or were dismissed is not very much below those who were disbanded.  That is about all I have to say on the matter.  In other words, there is no case for this motion because there is no genuine complaint that the parity is not there already.  Therefore, there is no necessity for a motion asking for that parity.  It does not serve any good purpose for any Deputy to try to persuade a section of the population, such as the men who resigned or were dismissed, that they are badly treated in this country and that if they had remained on in the RIC and had been disbanded by the British they would be better off.  I do not think that is the case and certainly it does not serve any good purpose to give the impression that a Government have not lived up to their undertaking which was given to these men in 1919 or 1920.  I do not think that the acceptance of this motion would cost the country very much but the acceptance of the motion would imply that we had not treated these men as we should.  For that reason I would ask the Dáil to reject the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would go along with the spirit of the motion but at the same time I am remembering that these men must have been only about 25 years of age&mdash;they could not have <Col N="98" /> been any older&mdash;when they were dismissed or when they resigned and I do not think that young people should get pensions for life, no matter who they are.  I can understand elderly people getting pensions because they might not be able to obtain other employment.  They might be ailing. The whole principle of pensions for life for young persons is wrong.  Even the members of the IRA should have got a gratuity rather than a pension.</P>
      <P>It does not appeal to me that a young man should get a pension for 50 years.  If he has got a pension for that long, he has done well.  Young men who go into any police force are strapping, healthy men, fairly well educated, who certainly would find no difficulty in obtaining other employment. They must have done well over the years.  I differentiate somewhat between the men who were dismissed and those who resigned.  Those who were dismissed have some claim although I do not say that they should have a pension for life.  They should have got some sort of lump sum.  It is argued that the men resigned for the love of Ireland.  That is questionable. Many of them may have resigned because they were afraid.  After all, as early as 1918 and 1919, they were shooting policemen in Dublin and it does not follow that they resigned for the love of Ireland.  However, I am prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I do not like suggesting what I have suggested but it could be true.  As I said, they have done very well if they have had a pension for 45 years.</P>
      <P>In regard to this question of pensions and increases generally, I looked up the Dáil Debates and I found that since this Dáil commenced there have been about 20 motions on the Order Paper calling for increases of all sorts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been about 20 motions asking for increases for everyone.  It is a favourite pastime for people to put down motions of this sort and one follows another.  There is no end to them.  I would not mind if the people who put them down were sincere or at least helped the Government in some way.  It is easy to say &ldquo;Give the RIC pensioners a few pounds&rdquo; but that on top of all the others could put a demand on the Exchequer which would run to millions of pounds, even to £15 million or to £20 million from what I have read. When the Government try to balance their Budget there is a mass attack on <Col N="100" /> them on the grounds that people will not give anything away but they will take everything that is given to them. If the Opposition were generous in supporting the Minister for Finance I am sure he would be equally generous. He has the task of getting the money and of having to make enemies in getting it and risk being thrown out of office&mdash;which is the whole idea involved. It is all hypocrisy.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I am prepared to go along with increases for all those who deserve increases, everyone who gets a pension or a gratuity, and whenever the cost of living is increasing they also should get an increase. I have accepted that principle in motions in the past but there is very little in this motion when you consider that it is a motion involving people who resigned when they were 25 years of age.  They must have had a good life since.  They are not like old people.  If they have had a pension for so long, then I do not think they have any complaint.</P>
      <P>I shall say no more.  I am not against the spirit of the motion but, at the same time, I think there is no similarity between this particular case and other cases that could be mentioned here.  They should be fairly well satisfied.  As I said, in a number of cases, it is questionable whether it was for love of Ireland they resigned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to this debate will be very brief.  I rise to point out that the motion simply asks that the Government should increase the pensions of those who resigned or were dismissed.  The people the previous speaker has been talking about, the strapping young men who have made a good living for themselves after running out of the RIC through fear, are not covered by this motion. This motion refers to people who have already justified their action in the eyes of this State.  They are the people who have already qualified for the type of pension given to them. The motion simply asks that, since it has been recognised that they did the right thing and were entitled to a pension, they should get now the same type of pension as that to which <Col N="101" /> they would have been entitled had they remained loyal to the Crown.  I think the motion is very fair and it is stupid for anyone to try to twist it round and suggest that people, whether they be in Fine Gael, in Labour, or even on the Government benches, bring in motions solely for the purpose of codding somebody. Knowing Deputy MacEoin as I do, I realised he must have felt there was a genuine need for this motion.  I did some research into the matter and I am satisfied that this motion was needed.</P>

      <P>Would Deputy Sherwin keep his speech for the next opportunity he gets of pouring vitriol on somebody?  He will not throw vitriol on me.  I am too used to his type.  I do not want to cross swords with him. I do not want to have anything to do with him, good, bad, or indifferent. Will he keep his remarks to himself or make them to the type of people with whom he is used to dealing?  He had his opportunity and he should have made the best of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is debatable.  This motion simply asks that those who have already qualified for a pension should get that to which they are justly entitled.  It asks for nothing more.  I was very young when all this happened but I am satisfied now that those who resigned from the RIC or were dismissed from it resigned from the highest of motives or were dismissed from the basest of motives and are, therefore, entitled to the best this State can give them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, indeed, very grateful to Deputy Tully for putting the case in a nutshell.  He has put it clearly and succinctly.  The Minister, in apparently refusing the motion, opened a very wide field, a much wider field than my motion envisaged.  Those who resigned and who were granted pensions now have a much lower pension than have those who continued to serve.  They are in an embarrassing position.  Let me be quite clear that <Col N="102" /> there are not ten people in Longford and Westmeath to whom this motion would apply.  As far as votes are concerned, there is nothing in it.  The suggestion was made that this is a political trick.  If this were the only way in which I could get a vote, then God help me&mdash;I should be in a bad way.</P>
      <P>These people were asked to resign. When they were asked to resign, notwithstanding what the Minister has said and what the Commission found, we did not tell the people we were asking to resign that, if they joined the RIC after 1916, they were not to resign.  We put no barrier to or time limit on their service.  We asked them to resign and we guaranteed that they would receive no less generous treatment than those who continued to serve.  That guarantee was broken when they did not get recognition for even the nine months or the three months they served before the call was made.  If a man joined the RIC after we called for resignations, then he was doing something he quite clearly understood; he was joining the enemy forces.  Apart from that, our invitation was to resign.</P>
      <P>Another section of the RIC did not resign but they sent in notice that they were prepared to resign.  Those we told to continue serving.  Some of those were dismissed.  The Minister says he had nothing to do with the Commission in 1923.  That is true. Some were dismissed and some had to leave the RIC over the Border in 1922. They have never got any recognition from that day to this.  Had they been serving with us, and for us, and resigned in the ordinary way, they would have got a pension.  There is no doubt about that.  Because they did not resign, they are now in a very invidious position.  They had to flee the Six Counties and come down here. Some of them joined the Civic Guard. It was said that the Free State Government was taking in RIC men into the Civic Guard and the Guards started a mutiny; these men were expelled by their comrades because of propaganda against them.  These men have never got justice from that day to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion simply asks that those <Col N="103" /> who have been placed in this unreasonable position should now be entitled to a pension equivalent to that which they would have had, had they served on. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, when speaking on this motion, did not take the line the Minister has adopted tonight as representing the Government viewpoint.  He took me to task.  He said I had not prepared my brief, that I had not given the numbers affected, that I had not said what the difference was between what the pensioner here was to get and what the pensioner was to get who had continued to serve.  I deliberately avoided that because it is not easy for the ordinary Deputy to ascertain the correct figures.  But the Minister for Finance and the Government have machinery to find out exactly.  I deliberately refrained from putting down questions to the Minister as to what the pensions payable now are compared with the equivalent pensions for a member of the RIC who continued to serve here.</P>
    <P>I am dealing with the case of a person who resigned from or was dismissed from the RIC and was fortunate enough&mdash;I use the term deliberately&mdash;to be able to remain on in the Civic Guard or in the State service up to the present.  When such a person resigns, his pension is based on the service he rendered in the RIC for the two or three years he was there and the service he rendered to the State here.  The result is that he is on a much lower pension.  In other words, he suffered a grave disadvantage by taking service in the State. If he continued with his full pensionable service, the disparity might not be so great.  But take the case of a sergeant in the RIC who had to resign. That man's pension to-day is not the same as an RIC sergeant who entered the force at the same time and continued to serve.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be well advised to look at the speech of Deputy Seán Flanagan, a member of his own Party.  I am sure Deputy Flanagan has as much information in the matter as I have.  He had no hesitation at all in declaring he was in favour of the <Col N="104" /> motion.  I pressed the Parliamentary Secretary to say whether the Minister was going to accept the motion or not, but he refused to commit the Minister. It is a disappointment to me to hear the Minister say &ldquo;No&rdquo; tonight.  I feel there is an obligation on every one of us here, no matter on which side he sits, to see to it that that pledge, given and accepted in good faith, will be honoured.  The time has come to make sure it is honoured to the full.  I do not know how much money it would take to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it, then, I shall have to put down questions to ascertain the exact figures, from both the British Government and from the Minister?  It would appear the people who made representations to me and gave me the figures are untruthful.  Why would they complain if they had the same advantages?  I regret that the Minister should say so bluntly no financial obligation is involved.  If that is so, surely the Minister can say he will accept the motion because it will not cost anything?  I could understand the Minister rejecting it if he said it was going to cost a great deal of money; I could understand his rejecting it if he said that the advantage to be gained by the persons concerned would be so insignificant as not to be worth the administrative cost of giving it; but that is not the case the Minister made when refusing it.  He refused it on the ground that a commission had found that, unless you had three years' service, you were not entitled to a pension.  I say that was wrong from the very beginning because we put no limit on the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister then said that these people had been generously treated. He went on to make a fairly reasonable argument which is not easy to rebut.  He made the case that an RIC man who resigned or was dismissed has approximately the same pension <Col N="105" /> today as a Civic Guard who served all the time and who goes out now on pension.  He maintained it was hard to ask an Irish Government to pay a pension to people who did not serve the State over a number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want the Deputy to misunderstand me on that, and I am afraid he does.  What I meant was this.  I did not say a man who resigned from the RIC at that time with ten years' service will have as good a pension as a Civic Guard with 30 years' service.  He would get the same as the man who goes out with ten years' service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because he had longer service.  The Minister has something there.  But that still does not meet our obligations.  He is not to be compared with the Civic Guard going out now but with his opposite number, whether that person lives in Britain or in Ireland, in receipt of an RIC pension from the British Government. That is the man for whom I want parity.  The Minister said it would cost nothing.  Let us put that to the test by accepting the motion and let us see what it will cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have my seconder behind me.  I am explaining why I did not move the motion on the Wednesday before the adjournment.</P>
      <P>The motion reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that disabled persons now in receipt of 25/- weekly ...</P>
      <P>&mdash;incidentally, this motion was put down some time ago and they received an additional 2/6d. in the recent Budget and, therefore, the motion actually should read &ldquo;now in receipt of 27/6d. weekly&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
      <P>... paid by the State and the health authority, should receive the same benefits as blind persons or non-contributory old age pensioners.</P>
      <P>Fifty per cent of what disabled persons receive is paid by the local authority, and 50 per cent by the State.  It rests with the State, and not the local authority, to move that an increase be granted.  The local authority follows suit, but it is the Dáil that must make the initial move to increase the benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> Disabled persons can be completely paralysed.  They may suffer from the loss of a limb or from various forms of ailments, but they may also have been completely paralysed since birth. There are various degrees of disability. Even in the worse cases of disability, the maximum allowance is 27/6, whereas a blind person or a non-contributory old age pensioner receives 35/-.  There is the difference.  A person who is 100 per cent disabled receives 27/6.  Incidentally, a blind person may enjoy good health; he may be able to work and earn a certain amount of money.  Do not forget that all these pensions and allowances are subject to a means test, but even with a means test, a non-contributory pensioner is allowed to earn up to £1 a week. Therefore, a blind person can get 35/-a week and he may earn up to £1 a week also.  An old age pensioner may also enjoy good health and he may have a small pension or may earn anything up to £1 a week.</P>
    <P>A great many disabled persons have been disabled from birth.  In a great many cases they earn nothing and many of them suffer all the time.  That is the difference.  I have reason to know these cases because when I am not here pitying myself, I go to the hospitals and mix with those people. I have been doing that for the past 40 years, so I know what I am talking about.  Twenty years ago, a gentleman set up in Bray with something for electrifying the brain and the muscles. His house was crammed to the doors by helpless people from all over the country who had to be carried from cars.</P>
    <P>The reason such people receive only 27/6 a week is that they are beneficiaries of the Department of Health. All others come under the Department of Social Welfare and we have demands on their behalf&mdash;whether they are genuine or just electioneering stunts I do not know&mdash;several times throughout the year.  These social welfare classes have their advocates: year after year we hear all about the old age pensioners, the blind, the widows and the orphans, but rarely do we hear about the disabled people mentioned in my motion.  That is because they <Col N="110" /> do not appear in the public accounts for the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Therefore, on every opportunity when matters of health have been raised in this House I have spoken for those people.  On all such occasions, because of that agitation, the Minister acted.  That is fair enough.  They have got three increases since 1960 because of the agitation here.  After all, that is what we are here for.  We are not all here for electioneering purposes. We do a lot of good even if we do capitalise on certain things.  I feel sure that if it had occurred to members of the House, the class I am now talking about would have been championed more often in the House and not treated with indifference.</P>
    <P>As I have said, up to 1960 those people had £1 a week.  If there was justification for giving £1 a week in 1960, it must have been based on the cost of living.  That being so, there must be further justification for increased allowances since 1960.  They were forgotten; their benefits were allowed to lag.  My point is that they should have got increases to keep them in step with beneficiaries under the Department of Social Welfare.  It is time now that we pulled up that lag. Some of them are 100 per cent disabled and they are to be pitied.  They are bedridden.  They are so disabled that many of them are unable to leave the bed or the chair.  In many cases, as far as their families are concerned, they would be good riddance.</P>
    <P>We all know it used to be a practice for families to try to get rid of their old people.  They were sent to the workhouses.  It is our responsibility, therefore, to give some semblance of independence to those disabled people so that in cases where they are not wanted in the home they can move into a room of some sort and have a few shillings for such small luxuries as tobacco.  In that way they would be able to retain a small measure of independence. Since a large percentage of this class have been disabled from birth, it is not a case of their being able to earn a little on the side by taking part time employment.  They are entirely dependent on what they get from us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> Since the report of the advent of this motion appeared in the Press, I have received hundreds of letters from all over the country and I had intended to quote some of them today.  I hold these people should get at least as much as other non-contributory beneficiaries, that when these other classes get increases the disabled people should not be forgotten.  Up to the moment they are the forgotten class.  It would not be very costly on the State to improve their lot.  The State pays 50 per cent and the local authority the other 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>A point may be made that the local authority can subsidise the existing pension but we have evidence that, while in some cases the local authorities are generous, in other cases they are mean.  It depends on whether each individual authority or relieving officer thinks a person should get additional money or not.  My point is: they have the same right, and exercise it, in subsidising old age pensioners but the old age pensioner in his own right has the maximum pension&mdash;35/- at present &mdash;and he may get more if the local authority think it justified.  Even if he gets a &ldquo;raw deal&rdquo;, he has 35/- and he also has every aspiring politician on his side always because it is a popular cause.</P>
    <P>I want this other class to have at least as much advocacy on their side. They should get at least the same money.  I know from experience they could do with more.  The point will be made that their families should look after them.  We have the same argument made against the old age pensioners but their families we know, often behaved miserably, made little of the old people and, as has been established by evidence and inquiries in the past, often sent them to institutions. Those people should not depend on anyone.  In their own right they should have at least a certain amount of money and with the increasing cost of living they, of all people, should get increases in step with everybody else.</P>
    <P>We talk about pension increases&mdash; and I am not against them&mdash;for the Gardaí and others, but those are <Col N="112" /> healthy able-bodied people who may have some claims about pensions but here I am concerned with people who are not in all but in a great many cases, helpless.  That is my point.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to move this motion and I hope when it comes up again I shall be able to add some evidence. We are at a disadvantage in that we are told: &ldquo;Your motion is on in half an hour&rdquo;.  That is the way we get information.  When we look at the Order Paper we see the motion before ours but we do not know it is going to be withdrawn.  I have none of the material or data I have prepared for this motion with me.</P>

      <P>I have listened very carefully to the previous speaker.  I admit that disability comes without any choice.  We have examples in every county, often in every townland and any of us who are familiar with this cross must feel that the legislation which the Government introduced in 1954 providing some little pension for these unfortunate people was a move in the right direction.  We should consider the effect the presence of afflicted people has on the other members of the family, how it upsets family routine and very often how the poor afflicted person is more or less despised principally because he or she is unable to help himself or herself and also because of the amount of time other members of the family must devote to looking after them.</P>
      <P>There is an obligation, it is true, on the people who are fit and well to provide for the infirm as best they can so that their lives will be a little more comfortable than if there was no such assistance.  Since 1954 these unfortunates have got three increases.  That is only right.  I think that often it is because people are not aware of the problems and have not been close enough to them that they adopt a certain attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local county councils are committed to putting up 50 per cent of the pension that is paid to these people and I think the majority of them try <Col N="113" /> within their limited resources to help but we often find that when the means of the family at large is to be considered it is the duty of the county manager or his officials to make a report on the family circumstances of the family of the applicant.  If they are reasonably well off, in the opinion of those officials, the unfortunate applicant gets no disability pension.  The case was made previously that members of a family have a duty to the infirm people, to the old and sick in their family.  That is admitted but usually, in the case of disability, it takes place early in life and the affliction is often carried from cradle to grave.  It is a tremendous worry to parents and a drag on their resources and on the activities of other members of the family.  This position, I think, should be reviewed pretty often and I think that in examining these claims local officials should not be too severe in regard to means tests because the affliction itself is sufficient hardship. Irrespective of what it might cost, the officials should be more liberal in assessing the means of the family of the afflicted person.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, but I was merely pointing out how difficult it is for these people who find themselves left more or less a burden on their families and depending frequently on what the family can afford to give them if their case is turned down by the local authority.  Sometimes a family may have to employ a person to take care of a disabled member. Sometimes the disability is such that the invalid is unable to fend for himself in any way and we know there are not sufficient institutions to cater for these people.  If all who suffer in this way were to go to the hospitals, we would not have sufficient hospitals to accommodate them.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Col N="114" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned, I was about to refer to section 38 and the difficulties which may exist in relation to this section.  This is the section which provides that when a person has been extradited, he shall not be proceeded against, sentenced or imprisoned or otherwise restricted in his personal freedom for any offence committed prior to his surrender other than that for which he was surrendered, with two exceptions which are set out in the section.  The first exception is, except it is with the consent of the requested country, that is, the country which has complied with the request for extradition made to it.  Secondly, it is where the person who has been extradited, having had an opportunity to leave the State, has not done so within 45 days of his final discharge in respect of the offence.</P>
      <P>It may be that the only remedy is to accept it on faith, which seems to be what the Minister felt was the position but the difficulty I see about this is that, no matter what the intentions are, it does not seem to me that this Bill or any other Bill we can introduce can give any guarantee that that section will be implemented. After all, the section in effect is laying down in our legislation what is to be done in another country.  I am prepared to accept that other countries who have signed or have accepted the European Convention on extradition will have a reciprocal arrangement with this country in relation to this matter because it is laid down in Article 14 of the Convention and section 38 of the Bill follows very closely the wording laid down in Article 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final matter I want to mention is in relation to the backing of Northern Ireland and British warrants. In this case also it is provided in section 45 that a warrant will not be endorsed for execution if the Minister, or the High Court if the question has been referred to the court, directs that it should not be endorsed and this subsection (2) of that section lays down the particular cases in which the Minister or the court, as the case may be, will direct that the warrant <Col N="115" /> should not be endorsed, and those, briefly, are, first of all, a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.</P>
    <P>Here again the point I raised earlier on the general question of extradition applies, as to who should decide whether an offence is a political offence or an offence related to a political offence.  I feel, as I have already mentioned, that that decision is one of sufficient importance to warrant its being taken by the Government rather than by an individual Minister.</P>
    <P>The second category of warrants which will not be endorsed for execution are in respect of offences under the military law which are not offences under the ordinary criminal law.  That, again, is on a par with the similar provision in relation to extradition.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there are revenue offences which, again, is on a par with the position for extradition.  Then the subsection finishes up:</P>
    <P>or that there are substantial reasons for believing that the person to whom the warrant relates will be prosecuted for a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence or an offence against military law which is not an offence under ordinary criminal law.</P>
    <P>What I am a little puzzled about in connection with this section&mdash;I should like the Minister to explain it further &mdash;is that in relation to political offences and the backing of Northern Ireland warrants, this section does not seem to me to go anything like as far as section 11 which deals with the question of extradition for political offences.  I mean, taking political offences or offences connected with political offences <i>simpliciter</i>, the two provisions are the same but in section 11 there is added the subsection which says that the same rule, that is, that there will not be extradition, shall apply if there are substantial grounds for believing that a request for extradition for an ordinary criminal offence has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political <Col N="116" /> opinion or that that person's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything which would in any way be regarded as casting a slur on the administration of affairs in the North or questioning their <i>bona fides</i> but I think the Minister might take into account the fact that his Leader only today answered a Parliamentary Question on the general question of discrimination and, as I understood the Taoiseach's reply, it was to the effect that he accepted that there was discrimination and that representations had from time to time been made to the British Government with regard to it.</P>
    <P>If that is the Taoiseach's belief and the belief of the Government it would seem to me to warrant the inclusion of a provision such as is in subsection (2) of section 11, or some similar provision, with section 45, dealing with the backing of warrants.  In other words, to include it on the question of backing of warrants as well as including it on the question of extradition. The Minister might, at any rate, have a look at that.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill for lawyers.  Nevertheless, we can have a few opinions.  An attempt on the life of a head of State will not be looked upon as a political offence.  If we have any extradition treaty with other countries and someone who is here attempts to take the life of the head of one of the States with which we have such a treaty, he will not be handed over.  Does the question not arise that the head of State might be a dictator, that he might have usurped authority?  Surely you must qualify this mention of &ldquo;head of State&rdquo;?  Is it the head of a duly elected Government? There can be all sorts of heads of State.  Take, for example, what is happening in Africa at the moment. Such events might happen elsewhere. Do we still hand over any person?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as we have a piece of legislation proposing to put extradition on a different basis, nobody can disagree.  International society has got to the point that there is general agreement that we should not allow each other's criminals to hide in our territory.  If it were merely a matter of the ordinary criminal, the position would be clear.  Take a person who is charged with an offence against, say, the statutes regarding larceny, burglary, housebreaking, and so on. That is all right.  But there is a certain amount of deep water and rather turbulent water into which one might get in this matter.</P>
      <P>The general principle accepted since 1870 and tied into a piece of statutory legislation which applied to us when we were part of the United Kingdom, was the Extradition Act, 1870.  A couple of principles were observed in that.  The first was that no country will send back people who are alleged to have broken the revenue laws of another country.  Criminality is one thing but a breach of the revenue laws is another.  The courts have been quite clear about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the person who owes money, say, for income tax, estate duty, and so on, and who does not pay but leaves and goes to another country.  Many efforts have been made in all such countries to get such people sent back <Col N="118" /> so that they could be subjected to the ordinary pressure of imprisonment, and so on, in order to make them pay their debts of a revenue or estate type.  That has always been resisted.</P>
    <P>In the second case, people will not hand back those who are sought because they are alleged to have committed offences political in their character.  Those are the two big exceptions. The ordinary up-to-date procedure has been quite effective.</P>
    <P>The Minister has circulated a memorandum.  There is a certain amount of comment as to whether Orders made under the 1870 Act would be regarded as binding.  In 1931, I was fairly conversant with the names of people for whom we were looking who had gone to the United States.  I know of no case in which a State refused to accept an extradition arrangement on the ground that the arrangement had been made with England and not with us.  In other words, the 1870 Act and all the Orders made under it were tacitly accepted as applying between ourselves when we emerged as a State and the other countries in respect of which these Orders had been made.</P>
    <P>There were occasions when we asked to have certain people, whom we alleged to be criminals and whom we knew to be in the United States, sent back.  They were not, but it was not the case that the United States said the Orders under which we asked them to send back these people were invalid.  It was simply that they could not get their hands on the people.  We tried to get certain people sent back.  They were not sent back.  But the answer is that there was no difficulty with regard to operating the old arrangements as between ourselves and, say, America&mdash; those arrangements having originated between the United Kingdom and America.</P>
    <P>I know of no occasion except under the Petty Sessions Act, 1851, where the arrangements for handing back what I call ordinary criminals had broken down.  It is probably better to tidy up the situation.  Are we breaking new ground?  We are, in certain things, and some of them I do not like.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> The old arrangement about extradition was that there was the extraditing country and the country by which the request was made&mdash;the requesting country and the requested country. There had to be two points of view before there was any Order.  If an effort were made for an extradition or any sending back of a person guilty of a criminal offence, the requesting country gave evidence which convinced the requested country that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case that an offence had been committed.  We are wiping that out.</P>
    <P>The solid test now is: have proceedings of a criminal type been instituted?  That is a very easy matter to write down in legislation and it becomes binding.  It is well known that in England in the past four or five years the Revenue Commissioners &mdash;I suppose, frustrated and annoyed by the number of people found to be evading the tax laws there&mdash;have decided to bring prosecutions against individuals in relation to tax offences. They allege they have made false declarations for the purpose of depriving the Revenue of what it should get. Those are taken in the criminal courts. There is no doubt that in relation to what we would call an ordinary Revenue matter to be fought out in our Chancery Courts, under the present English administration, they parade such a person before their criminal courts.</P>
    <P>Take a person who, 25 years ago would have been asked in the courts to give reasons why he had defaulted on the Revenue, on just debts to the State.  If that person came across here under such conditions that those who investigated the matter felt a <i>prima facie</i> case had been made, and if the background were a revenue matter, we would not send back that person.  I do not know how that will fit into the new scheme because, for Revenue matters, prosecutions may be instituted. Take a person who is prosecuted for a revenue matter, clearly and distinctly for non-payment of income tax or estate duty.  Supposing it is clear that it is just for that reason that a prosecution has been instituted, will we let <Col N="120" /> that override the ordinary prohibition that existed that we did not surrender people if the charge against them was really a revenue matter or was what they called &ldquo;political&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The situation may change somewhat because of the English procedure.  I hope we shall still hold fast to that principle that we shall not surrender people if the charge in the background, no matter how framed, is for Revenue defalcation; in other words, that we will let that be the basis of our decision. For those reasons I would prefer to have a <i>prima facie</i> case made instead of merely the Minister being faced with proceedings being started, by saying there is a summons, there is a warrant for that man's arrest, which seems to be the deciding point here.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is this political matter.  I see on the first page of the Minister's statement that we are to provide on a reciprocal basis for the enforcement of warrants for ordinary criminal offences emanating from Northern Ireland.  Then the exceptions are made, about revenue matters, political matters and things attached to political matters, and then there is the peculiar phrase &ldquo;purely military matters&rdquo;.  I would put the test question at once.  If this had been the law five years ago and there was an IRA foray across the Border and in that foray a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary was killed and if there was identification of the person who killed that Royal Ulster Constabulary man, would that be a political offence or would it be a purely military offence? I do not know what the word &ldquo;purely&rdquo; means.  We talk about offences which are subject to military law.  If that is all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am sure the Minister must have considered this matter because it jumped at once to the eyes of everyone who read this. We ought be clear on it.  I am quite clear.  Any such killing is murder and could not be excluded on the ground that it is a political offence.  Will the Minister agree?  The Minister does not answer.  This matter must have been considered.  How are the exceptions to be ruled?  The Minister is going to rule on them for a period but there may be a question of <i>habeas corpus</i> in the High Court or under some other conditions but could we not get rid of this matter?

Have we at least got standards by which that is to be charged on the ordinary standards of taking human life unlawfully?  I am told this is all to be done on a reciprocal basis and a lot of it will depend on whether other States with which we try to enter into reciprocal arrangements accept our conditions.  On the second page of the Minister's statement, he says that it is proposed to negotiate formal extradition agreements in due course.  I want to find out what is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> There were two cases which agitated constitutional lawyers in England in recent years.  One was the case of Dr. Soblen.  Dr. Soblen was a man who was found guilty of what amounted to treason in the United States of America and he was convicted. He escaped on a passport of his brother and first of all got as far as Israel.  From Israel, he was sent in an aircraft to England and then here but he would not be allowed to land and eventually he went back to England.  I understand that his complaint to his counsel was that he was told here that nothing would happen to him when he went back to England. His case, I think, went to the highest court in England.  He had landed there but there was an aliens order against him.  He could have been prevented from landing but he had committed certain depredations on his own body which meant that he was an ambulance case when he arrived and they let him land.  The question was, having a footing in England, even though by a subterfuge, whether he was entitled to seek the courts on a <i>habeas corpus</i> application.  In the <i>habeas corpus</i> application, it was agreed the offence was a non-extraditable offence.  They took refuge under their Aliens Act. We have an Aliens Act but whether we have the same order, I do not know.  I do not know the details of it. In the end, he was sent back but I think he never got to the United States because he committed suicide on the way to the plane.  It was held that he had no resort to <i>habeas corpus.</i></P>
    <P>Can that situation arise here?  If somebody like the Minister for Justice makes an order, he is not a judicial person.  He has no right, particularly in a criminal matter, to decide something against an alleged criminal.  I know that in England this was held to be non-extraditable; he had landed under a subterfuge, and the order of the Home Secretary was that he be sent back to his own country.  Can that happen here?  It is an involved question, but I should like to know the answer.</P>
    <P>The other question in England raised a different controversy.  A Chief of one of the new States in Africa got as far as England and an application <Col N="123" /> was made either to have him extradited or, in any event, sent out of the country.  There was considerable delay and a great deal of confusion of thought and the Parliamentary discussion about his case was postponed two or three times.  There was a delay of a few months but in the end he was sent back.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the next point. There was a great controversy in the English Parliament about this man, Chief Enahoro.  The contention raised on his behalf was that he was extradited for a particular offence and could not be tried for other offences.  The point made was that it was all very well to extradite a man for something that could mean a term of imprisonment but it was quite a different thing to extradite a man on a subterfuge and have him tried for something which might mean the loss of his life.  It was solemnly stated in the House of Commons by persons like the Home Secretary and possibly the Attorney General, that he could not be tried on a capital offence and that a promise had been got.  At the same time, when that man arrived back, although he had been promised legal aid, the people whom he regarded as proper to defend him were refused permission to enter the country.  The result was that he got what was from his point of view an unsatisfactory trial.</P>
    <P>All that turns on a point that was clearly met in the old extradition arrangement.  When we were part of the United Kingdom, the arrangement was that, if a man was extradited on a particular offence, he could not be charged, when he arrived back in the country to which he was extradited, with another offence.  That was a matter for reciprocal arrangement. There is a section here which is intended presumably to meet the situation.  It applies to a person who has been surrendered to the State by a requested country.  Subsection (2) states: &ldquo;He shall not be proceeded against, sentenced or imprisoned or otherwise restricted in his personal freedom for any offence committed <Col N="124" /> prior to his surrender....&rdquo;  Certain exceptions follow, but they are not of any great consequence.  That was an effort to close the door on what was alleged in Chief Enahoro's case, that he was asked back on offence &ldquo;A&rdquo; and was then going to be charged on a much more serious offence which entailed capital punishment.  Here, as far as our law is concerned, he shall not be proceeded against, sentenced or imprisoned for any offence prior to his surrender other than that for which he was surrendered.  How can we impose that on a country that asks for surrender except by reciprocal arrangement? Is it intended that arrangement will encompass all that field?</P>

      <P>Do not tell me it must.  Is it intended that it will?  We will not enter into a reciprocal arrangement unless this is involved.  Very good.  That means, therefore, that we make the case that if Britain wants to get back under her control a man who has been summoned for what is a criminal offence, the offence of not paying his just debts to the Revenue, and we surrender him because a prosecution has been instituted, can he be charged criminally with what we consider is only a civil offence in this country?  Are we going to make it clear, if we enter into a reciprocal arrangement with Britain, that we will not accept their ruling as to whether a matter is or is not criminal?  The matter will have to be criminal under our law before we will agree to any such arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second step&mdash;it might mean the full closing of the door&mdash;is that we will not enter into any arrangement with Britain, irrespective of whether or not they institute a prosecution, if the offence for which they ask us to surrender a man is, in our opinion, a civil offence.  Take a revenue matter.  The British start a prosecution.  It looks to them to be good from the point of view of their legislation.  Proceedings have been instituted.  The first hurdle has been cleared.  We then find that they are going to charge a man with <Col N="125" /> something that is criminal in their jurisdiction but only a civil matter in ours.  That closes the door at that point.  We will have nothing to do with it.</P>
    <P>These are the two main points I want to have cleared up.  I note there are over 40 countries with which the United Kingdom made treaties and arrangements.  My best advice informs me that that still obtains.  I know of no action&mdash;I can be contradicted&mdash;as a result of which those reciprocal arrangements with the United Kingdom do not apply to us.  That would mean that there are 40 countries with which there are reciprocal arrangements.</P>
    <P>I notice at page 3 of the Minister's statement there are six members of the Council of Europe which have ratified the Convention on Extradition and I presume that, with regard to these countries, there would be a clause corresponding to our Clause 38 providing a person shall not be proceeded against for any offence prior to his surrender or other than the offence on which he is surrendered.  On page 3 it is also stated by the Minister that &ldquo;This requirement&rdquo;&mdash;that is, of a <i>prima facie</i> case&mdash;&ldquo;is a feature of the Anglo-American tradition.&rdquo;  That is our tradition. &ldquo;In the Continental civil law countries generally, extradition may be allowed on evidence that a person is wanted for prosecution or punishment under an order of a competent authority&rdquo; and the Minister then says we would recognise or subscribe to the view that these people would not move except in a proper way.  He goes on to say that, if a warrant for the arrest of a person on a criminal charge has been issued, we would take it that the warrant was not improperly issued. Will that be our test?  A warrant issues for the arrest of a person, a summons for something, which may be criminal in the requesting country and civil in ours and will we say: &ldquo;Very good; the conditions are fulfilled&rdquo;? Will we say to Mr. So-and-So: &ldquo;Back you go&rdquo;?  I do not think that is right.</P>
    <P>The Minister disturbs me when he speaks on page 4 of a &ldquo;conviction emanating from that country&rdquo;.  I cannot <Col N="126" /> understand that.  Mr. A a citizen of Great Britain has come here.  I can understand the situation in which the British can issue a warrant for his arrest or a summons issues against him with details of a conviction.  Does that mean a conviction in the person's absence?  They have tried to get hold of a person and, in his absence, they have proceeded to conviction.  That is contrary to all the rules of jurisprudence to which this country adheres: a person must be present when he is tried.  That holds good in England. This may apply in the case of a man who is arrested, brought before a court, and then escapes.  But that is very unlikely and I do not think we should make any provision for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It happens occasionally.  Is that meant to relieve my doubts about this whole matter? Halfway down page 4 the Minister says that what he has said so far does not apply to an offence of a political, revenue or purely military character. That &ldquo;military character&rdquo; is a peculiar phrase.  What does the word &ldquo;military&rdquo; mean?  I know a military offence is one contrary to our Defence Forces Act or to the corresponding Act in Britain.  &ldquo;Purely military character&rdquo; seems to me to confuse the whole issue.  It could be claimed that action by the IRA is of a military character.  It could even be claimed to be of a &ldquo;purely military character&rdquo;. It would have a political objective. But, even if it had, that is not of course any ground for escape.  This should be a reason for refusing a request for extradition.  I have my doubts that it will be regarded in that way and I want to reiterate my view that this ought not to be regarded as an offence of a purely military character just as I think it should not be regarded as political.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of page 4, the Minister again speaks of:</P>
      <P>... reasonable grounds for thinking that an offence against that country's laws has been committed by the person whose surrender is requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now back to the reasonable <Col N="127" /> grounds.  This seems to be coming back to the <i>prima facie</i> case.  The reasonable grounds are surely grounds that appear to us to be reasonable and not simply because they are regarded by people in the requesting country as reasonable grounds?  Surely we have a right to pass our own judgment on those matters?  That is where I feel that the old standard of requiring a <i>prima facie</i> case to be made meant that a case had to be considered by the Government authorities here, the Minister, the High Court or the Supreme Court on <i>habeas corpus</i>.  They would have to decide there were reasonable grounds to suspect an offence had been committed.  No matter about this Convention, there are ways of writing in your own law into these international conventions.  This international convention has not yet been accepted as part of our domestic law in this country and it does not rule here, although it looks from another statement by the Minister as if we intend to make it part of our domestic law.  However, we have not done so yet.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of a man who has gone through a period of trial, gone through a length of sentence and who has then, somehow, got here. When we come to our nationals, it is stated in the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>It is the intention that extradition of citizens will be allowed only on a basis of reciprocity.  As a consequence of making provision for non-extradition of citizens, Section 37 provides that an Irish citizen who has been accused of committing an offence in a country with which we have an extradition arrangement may be prosecuted for the offence in our courts where that country has requested that such proceedings be taken and the Attorney General so directs.</P>
    <P>I want again to come back to the case &mdash;there is no question about it&mdash;of nationals of this country crossing the Border in a raid.  They commit the offence of murder.  Say one person is identified.  He comes back here. The situation is that he is a national of our country.  We do not like extraditing our nationals for other Governments <Col N="128" /> to try.  Take a national of our country who has committed what was clearly an extraditable offence, if it was not for this difficulty about his being a citizen of this country.  We may prosecute that person here for the offence in a country with which we have an extradition arrangement where that country requests that such proceedings be taken and the Attorney General so directs.  Say some of these people engage in a foray across the Border, commit a crime and come back here.  I must say that if I were the person whose fate was in issue and I was faced with the alternative of being tried here in the Twenty-Six Counties or of being handed over to the Six County judges for trial, I think I know what my choice would be. But the situation is apparently that we cannot try such a person here unless the country where the offence was committed has requested it.</P>
    <P>I do not mind the Attorney General's consent.  That would probably follow if the other country consented.  In the case I am speaking about, it would mean that unless the Six County Government requested us to try such a man here, we could not do it.  Then you travel back to the other situation. This is an extraditable offence.  Do we hand the person over or excuse him on the grounds of an operation of a purely military character or of a political matter?  These are the rather deep and somewhat muddy waters into which we get in dealing with this matter of extradition.</P>
    <P>The Minister says in page 7 of his speech:</P>
    <P>May I say before leaving Part II that an endeavour has been made to follow the text of the European Convention as far as practicable. This procedure has considerable advantages from the point of view of establishing uniformity of interpretation. Our courts will be able to have regard to decisions of foreign courts on the provision of this Convention when interpreting the provisions of Part II and of extradition agreements to which we become party.</P>
    <P>How will we, unless it will be that it is intended to make this international <Col N="129" /> convention part of our domestic law? Until that is done our courts will not merely turn a blind eye; they will say they cannot see and they will not listen. Take the Lawless case.  There they decided the Convention on Human Rights had been agreed to by this country, but it was not part of our domestic law and they could not judge on it.  Is it intended that this European Convention will be made part of our domestic law?  If so, I can see the courts turning to their own interpretation of what the conditions are and probably getting help from their colleagues in other countries who joined with us in agreeing to this international convention.  But until this convention is made part of our domestic law, the courts would pay no attention to decisions made by foreign courts in the interpretation of an international agreement not part of our domestic law.  But they would have a different attitude and would be inclined to listen to other interpretations, if we adhered to the international convention and made it part of our domestic law.  But only in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>As far back as the Petty Sessions Act of 1851 is concerned and the backing of warrants from the North, I am glad we are trying to bring an end to the confusion that has arisen. That confusion has arisen only in the last three years.  The provisions of Section 29 of that Act and the backing of warrants went fairly smoothly up to about three years ago.  There was a certain amount of messing around&mdash;I must say this by way of criticism&mdash;with what was required under the Petty Sessions Act, 1851.  I have no doubt the result of that has been to draw down judgments from the courts in very special cases casting doubts as to whether the Petty Sessions Act applies to the whole country or only to the Dublin Metropolitan Police Area.  That has occurred because of what, I must say on reading the case, we must decide to be irregularities in the operation of the Petty Sessions Act of 1851.  However, we are going to get rid of that.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech:</P>
    <P>... provision has been made for <Col N="130" /> prohibiting the surrender of persons who are accused of political offences, offences connected with such offences, purely military offences or revenue offences and in cases where there are substantial reasons for believing that the persons concerned will be prosecuted for political offences or offences connected with them or for purely military offences.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins drew attention to the fact that in the general extradition proposal, not the one for Northern Ireland, those precautions are not specifically stated.  I hope they will be retained in regard to general extradition and reciprocal arrangements and that we will not surrender persons accused of political offences, offences connected with such offences, purely military offences or revenue offences or in cases where there are substantial reasons for believing that the persons concerned will be prosecuted for political offences or offences connected with them or for purely military offences. It comes back to what I mentioned already.  We will be tied down hard and fast if we surrender a person for a specific criminal matter No other offence can possibly be brought against that man when he goes into the jurisdiction of another country.  While we want to uphold this principle of getting rid of each other's criminals we do not want to have any breach in the old-time law in regard to political offences so that by a subterfuge a man is brought back on an alleged criminal offence and tried on something which is not connected with a criminal matter at all.</P>
    <P>I see that on page 8 there is reference to a safeguard of the individual's rights in the provision that a person arrested on a British or a Northern Ireland warrant must be given a reasonable opportunity of consulting a solicitor. I have not read the extradition proposals in detail but I presume that that would be part of the ordinary extradition proposals.  In this phrase, it is related to arrests on Northern Ireland or British warrants.  If a person is arrested on a United States warrant or a French warrant, surely he ought to be given the right to consult a <Col N="131" /> solicitor?  I hope that is covered in the proposals.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Minister for Justice, this is not a matter to put into the hands of an individual Minister.  Without meaning any criticism of an individual Minister, I say this is a Government matter and I imagine in every case it would be a matter for a Government decision.  However, it should be clearly stated that it is not a ministerial point of view but a Government decision.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see&mdash;and I want to see what the machinery is&mdash;an effort to retain the right to <i>habeas corpus</i> and the right to apply to the High Court for a direction for release on various grounds; in other words, that a person is not entirely tied either to a ministerial or a Government decision.  I want to pursue the details of that procedure before Committee Stage in order to ensure that the machinery of access to the High Court and to the Supreme Court by way of <i>habeas corpus</i> is not blocked by a ministerial or Government decision.  We do not want such a change in the law that, because there is a ministerial decision saying some offence is not a political offence, it will not be possible to ventilate that matter still further before the final court in this country.</P>
    <P>I object to the law which says &ldquo;the Act will apply in relation to an offence whether committed or alleged to have been committed before or after the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  Supposing this measure goes through by Eastertime, I would prefer that we would start from then.  I am not forgetting the countries with which we have extradition treaties and they can still be honoured, but in so far as we are making new law, I do suggest that, even though some people would benefit by it, it would be better to have that than have all this inquisition going back 20 or 25 years investigating the records and the activities of people in respect of offences or alleged offences committed years before the passing of this measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister's memorandum is quite clear on that.  It says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="132" /> As regards Northern Ireland warrants, which will be coming here for the first time, the section will permit the endorsement and enforcement of warrants for crimes alleged to have been committed at any time in the past.</P>
    <P>There is no limitation but we should write it in in this matter.  I do not want statistics in this connection promulgated to the House, but the Department must know how many cases there are of applications not being effectively made to our courts because of some technical defect in the warrant.  I should imagine there are not many.  It is wrong anyway to have a person sent back no matter when he committed the crime. After all if a person had been sentenced years ago he would have gained remission of sentence.  The Minister says on page 10:</P>
    <P>.... It can be fairly claimed that the enforcement of the criminal law in these islands has been brought to a commendable degree of efficiency while preserving fully the rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>That is what I am questioning.  I am not sure that has been done.  While it is accepted that we do not want to have other people's criminals here and that it is desirable to have criminals who are nationals of ours sent back to wherever the crime has been committed, if we start from the date of the passing of this Act, it will be a good and commendable situation.  I do not like this idea of digging back into the past and raking up all sorts of things. Furthermore, it is not right to go the length of making things criminal in this country which were not so at the date of their commission.  Unless they were clearly criminal at the date of their commission, it is unconstitutional to accept them as criminal under these provisions.</P>

      <P>I am not quite clear in regard to the reciprocal arrangements under this legislation.  I should like the Minister to define them at a later stage.  We have seen the form of justice meted out to Irish people in Great Britain, very savage sentences being imposed on them because they <Col N="133" /> were Irish.  Irish people over there are not all carrying haloes but an Irishman who goes up before a magistrate in Britain is looked down upon.  This magistrate is one of the old school tie type brought up in an atmosphere which despises everything Irish and an Irishman is condemned before sentence is pronounced at all.</P>
      <P>There is ample evidence of what is happening to many of our citizens.  It may be said we are soft here but some of our young men have been given anything up to six months there for a crime for which we in this country might think two months would be a harsh sentence.</P>

I only ask the Minister to let us know what his views are on this matter.</P>

      <P>So far, the discussion on this measure has consisted mainly of questions of one sort or another which have been addressed to me, questions dealing, in the main, with matters of interpretation.  As Deputies realise, this is a very important measure and, to a large extent, a very technical one, so I feel that for a number of reasons it would be preferable if we left over discussions on these specific technical questions until Committee Stage.  I feel that is desirable for two reasons: first, because it is certain that they will come up again on Committee Stage and, to that extent, we will be duplicating our work; and, in addition, because of their technical and somewhat complicated nature, it is only with the freedom of discussion we have on Committee Stage that we can deal with them as fully and adequately as we should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> Deputy McGilligan posed one question, at least, of considerable and fundamental importance with which I should like to deal at this stage.  I do not think he had full regard to section 45 of the Bill when he spoke of our proposed arrangements with Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  I should have thought section 45 clearly spelled out the situation with regard to political, military and revenue offences.  First of all, let me deal with the question of purely military offences. I should have thought it was clear from the wording of section 45 that purely military offences in that category mean offences against military law which are not offences under criminal law.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan also posed a question to me about IRA forays across the Border.  I think the simple answer to that question is that the Bill lays down clear and precise machinery for dealing with any situation which may arise.  The Bill indicates that, when a warrant comes to us for endorsement, we have to decide whether it comes within any of these exempted categories.  The decision in the first place as to whether or not it is a political offence will be taken by me, as Minister for Justice.  Here in passing let me assure Deputies that this would be a Government matter.  The Bill speaks exclusively of the Minister for Justice, but in this regard the Minister for Justice would act only on the advice and instructions of the Government. When the Minister for Justice would decide that it either was or was not a political offence, or that he was going to refer the matter to the High Court, that decision by the Minister for Justice would be taken on the facts of any particular case coming before him and, of course, the same would apply if the case were referred by him to the High Court.  In the case of any warrant coming for decision as to whether or not it should be endorsed for execution, it would be taken on the facts of the case and in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister, but the point is that the Bill is retrospective in the <Col N="135" /> sense that it can apply to what happened in the past.  Deputy McGilligan referred to matters which everyone knows are matters of fact and I think he was trying to ascertain whether the Minister regarded them as in the category of political offences or military offences or offences for which warrants would be backed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that that is a purely hypothetical question. We have had a number of incidents of one sort or another, out of any one of which we could have been presented with a warrant if this Bill were law&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On that aspect of the matter, I should like to say it would not be my intention that this Bill would operate, as Deputy McGilligan suggested, retrospectively for anything like 25 years.  I should imagine that three or four years, or something like that, would be the maximum extent to which it would operate in practice.  As I said, as we all know, there have been incidents arising out of which we could, at any time if this Bill were law, have been presented with warrants for execution and we may indeed be in the future, but I think it is not for us here dealing with this measure to deal with that sort of hypothetical situation.</P>
      <P>When the Bill becomes law, the decision whether or not to endorse any warrant is one which will have to be taken in the light of the surrounding circumstances and of our knowledge of the particular case concerned.  The Bill provides that if the Minister for Justice does not wish himself to decide whether or not the offence is political, he can refer the matter to the High Court for decision.  That procedure is enshrined in the Bill.  It also makes quite clear the type of offence for which surrender will not be granted and that is, I think, as far as it is necessary for us to deal with the matter at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the general question of extradition arrangements with countries apart from Northern Ireland <Col N="136" /> and Britain, the important thing is, I think, the reciprocity aspect of the matter.  This is also the answer to the question posed by Deputy Sherwin. We will, of course, of necessity, automatically have extradition arrangements with any of the 16 members of the Council of Europe who ratify the Convention.  We must take it that all these 16 countries which are associated with us in the Council of Europe are countries with whose judicial and legal systems we are quite satisfied.</P>
    <P>Outside those 16 countries, we would make extradition and reciprocal arrangements only with countries about whose legal processes and political set-ups, and so on, we were perfectly satisfied.  We would not enter into extradition arrangements with any country unless we were assured from our knowledge of the situation that anyone we would send back would be guaranteed a fair trial.  I think that is the answer to the question which Deputy McGilligan has posed about the Soblen case in Britain.</P>
    <P>As I remember that case, the British Home Secretary was criticised because he exercised his powers under the Aliens Act and a similar situation could, of course, arise here.  We could deport any alien whom we regarded as undesirable for a number of reasons.  That procedure would still obtain and it would be ridiculous to suggest that the Government here or the Minister for Justice could not deport an undesirable alien simply because he could not be extradited. These are two entirely separate matters, two entirely different territories. We might well be deporting aliens to all sorts of places with which we had no extradition arrangements of any sort.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that the fundamental principle in Part II of the Bill is this question of our not being prepared to enter into any sort of reciprocal arrangement unless we are satisfied that the country concerned is a proper country with which to make such arrangements and that its legal and judicial system is such that it satisfies our notions of justice and fair play.</P>
    <P>Deputy M.J. O'Higgins mentioned <Col N="137" /> the question of religious discrimination in the North of Ireland.  I want to say that a question of that kind is not relevant to this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins seems to suggest that we should incorporate in Part III of the Bill some sort of reference, as we have in Part II, to race, creed or nationality.  It would be entirely inappropriate for us to suggest that in Northern Ireland or Britain such a qualification or prohibition is necessary.  We must look at it this way: extradition&mdash;or in the case of Part III, not extradition but this special arrangement&mdash;can only come into operation where an offence has been committed or where there has been a prosecution for an offence.  It is not an offence under Northern or British law to be a member of a particular religion or of any particular race or to have a particular nationality: it is impossible to envisage a situation where a person would be prosecuted there simply on the ground of being of a particular race, religion or nationality.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I do not think it is really relevant and it would be quite inappropriate for us to insist on any such qualification in the case of either Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am glad that both Deputies McGilligan and O'Higgins have accepted as desirable that we should not permit our country to be a refuge for fugitives from justice from other countries and that we should be able to get back from other countries our citizens who have committed offences here.  That is the basis of this legislation. What we are trying to do here is to ensure that and at the same time, as I said in my opening remarks, to build into the Bill and the system safeguards for the individuals concerned, to make sure that the machinery will only operate to bring to justice those who are guilty of criminal offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the general principle which we adopt in regard to the world at large.  In the case of Britain and <Col N="138" /> Northern Ireland, we have to keep in mind that we have complete freedom of movement and travel inside these islands and we should therefore in framing our arrangements keep that freedom of travel in mind.  If justice is to be effectively administered inside these islands and at the same time we are to preserve this freedom of movement, then we must have some system in operation between us which is more immediate and effective than the rather cumbersome semi-diplomatic process of extradition itself.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason we are establishing this arrangement with Britain and Northern Ireland&mdash;it can be regarded as a concomitant of freedom of travel in the three areas.  It is a satisfactory arrangement, particularly since we have spelled out in the Bill all the offences which are excluded and the safeguards which are built in to protect the rights of individuals who may be concerned.  I have nothing more to say at this stage except to hope that in principle the Bill is acceptable to the House, however we may argue afterwards on particular details or on the safeguards Deputies may feel should be inserted.  All that we can do much more satisfactorily and much more comprehensively when we come to the Committee Stage.</P>

The existing statutory law in regard to the guardianship of infants is contained in four enactments the oldest of which dates back to the 17th century.  There followed the Custody of Infants Act, 1873, the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1886, and finally, the Custody of Children Act, 1891.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of the provisions in the Tenures Abolition Act, 1662, these are all enactments which gave to <Col N="139" /> the mother a better position than she previously had with regard to the guardianship and custody of her child. The guardianship provisions in the 1662 Act were incidental to the main provisions of that Act, which dealt with the abolition of certain feudal tenures or systems of land holding. That Act of 1662 provided that the father might appoint by deed or will a guardian or guardians for his infant children to act after his own death.  It also set out the rights and duties of such guardians both in their capacity as guardians of the infant's person and, of course, as guardians of the infant's estate.</P>
    <P>It is well to remember that at the time the Tenures Abolition Act was passed in 1662, and for over two hundred years after that, the paternal <i>potestas</i> of the common law was absolute.  It was settled law that the father was alone the guardian of his children.  If the father appointed a guardian under the 1662 Act, that guardian took over the father's full rights to the complete exclusion of the mother.  If no such guardian were appointed the mother became guardian by nature and nurture but this was not full guardianship.  The courts would not interfere with the father's paramount authority unless there were grave reasons for doing so in the interests of the infant.</P>
    <P>It was not until 1873 that statute interfered with this absolute power of the father.  In the Custody of Infants Act of that year the power was given to the mother of an infant to petition the court for the custody of, and for the right of access to, her infant.  The Guardianship of Infants Act, 1886, has often in the past been referred to as &ldquo;the Mothers Act&rdquo;.  It re-enacted the provision in the 1873 Act giving the mother a right to apply for custody and also gave her additional rights. Now, for the first time, the mother was declared to be guardian of her child on the death of her husband&mdash;either alone or jointly with any guardian appointed by him.  The mother was given the right to appoint a testamentary guardian.  However, this was not the same right as the father had.  The <Col N="140" /> guardian appointed by the mother could act only on the death of both herself and the father.  The court was given power to remove any testamentary guardian and power to deal with guardianship and custody in legal separation cases.</P>
    <P>The Custody of Children Act, 1891, deals with applications to the High Court for the production of the child by a parent who seeks to enforce his right to the custody of the child.  It provides that the Court may refuse to enforce the right to custody where satisfied that the parent's conduct warrants such a course.  Where the court finds in favour of a parent who has up to then allowed his child to be brought up at public expense, the parent, who is getting the child, may be required to pay part or all of the expenses of bringing up the child.  The 1891 Act also provides a very important change in point of principle. The common law acts on the assumption that the best place for a child is with his parents and that the onus of proving the contrary is on the person who disputes that.  Section 3 of the 1891 Act contains an exception where a parent has abandoned or deserted or otherwise neglected his child in such circumstances as to satisfy the court that the parent is unmindful of his parental duties.  In such a case the court will not give such a parent custody of a child which he has abandoned until he has proved that he is a fit person to have custody.  This is, naturally, a protection for the child. While the provisions of the 1891 Act apply to both parents, in practice the Act is generally invoked where a father seeks to regain the custody of his children.</P>
    <P>As a result of these statutes, the original absolute power of the father although not totally abolished in family affairs was considerably reduced. In addition, since 1883 the tendency in the courts has been against a strict interpretation of this sort of paternal power.  The year 1883 was the year of the noted <i>Agar-Ellis</i> cases which represent the high water mark of the father's common law rights.  Since then the courts have had an increasing regard for the mother's <Col N="141" /> natural claims, particularly in the case of younger children.</P>
    <P>The position in this country is now altered by the Constitution, particularly Article 42 which deals, <i>inter alia</i>, with the rights and duties of the parents in relation to the upbringing of their children.  When dealing with the actual changes proposed in this Bill, I shall go into the Constitutional aspect in some detail.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to give statutory effect to two basic legal principles. These are, first, that, in any proceedings affecting a child, the child's welfare must be the first and paramount consideration and, secondly, that the mother and father of a child shall have equal rights to guardianship and custody.  In addition, the Bill provides for the guardianship and custody of illegitimate children.</P>
    <P>The principle concerning the paramount nature of the infant's welfare is already well established, and is declared at section 3 of the Bill.  The old Courts of Chancery possessed a jurisdiction concerning infants, in the exercise of which the main consideration was the welfare of the child.  The Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland), 1877, abolished the separate Courts of Chancery but provided that all existing courts should exercise the jurisdictions which formerly attached to these Chancery Courts.</P>
    <P>The second principle to which the Bill seeks to give effect is that, in so far as guardianship and custody of their children is concerned, both parents have equal rights.  Article 42. 1 of the Constitution reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.</P>
    <P>In the Supreme Court judgment in the well-known Tilson case it is stated that the principle to be derived from this Article is that the parents &ldquo;have a joint power and duty in respect of the religious education of their children&rdquo; and that the parents in this <Col N="142" /> context cannot be construed &ldquo;in some generic sense that included only the father when he was living&rdquo;.  This judgment marks the establishment of the mother's equality with the father. The Bill reflects this equality.  Subsection (1) of section 6 provides that the parents are guardians of their children jointly, and subsection (2) of section 7 gives the mother the power, which only the father has at present, to appoint a testamentary guardian to act after her own death.</P>
    <P>Under the common law an illegitimate child, being considered a <i>filius nullius</i>, has no legal guardian.  The mother, however, <i>prima facie</i> has custody. The natural father has no rights. In olden times in English law the illegitimate child was the responsibility of the parish.  In the Bill it is proposed to make the mother of an illegitimate child the full guardian of the child.  Subsection (4) of section 6 does this.  The effect of the provision will be that all the other relevant provisions of the Bill will apply only to the mother of the child.  She will be able to appoint a testamentary guardian and to apply to the court for directions on any question affecting the child's welfare.  This latter right is also given to the natural father of the illegitimate child at subsection (4) of section 11. This provision is aimed at the protection of the child.  There could be circumstances in which the mother of an illegitimate child is neglecting the child and where the father may have the infant's interest at heart in wishing to get the custody.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) of section 7 of the Bill introduces another change.  It enables parents who are themselves under 21 years of age to appoint guardians by will.  At present, by reason of section 7 of the Wills Act, 1837, persons under 21 years cannot make a valid will.  Previous to the Wills Act, the father could, by reason of the Tenures Abolition Act, 1662, appoint testamentary guardians although he was himself under 21.  In effect, therefore, what the Bill proposes is to restore the law that applied between 1662 and 1837, with of course the extension of that law to include the mother as well as the father.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> Part II of the Bill deals in general with the law as to guardianship and custody and contains the reforms in that law to which I have referred. Part III provides for the jurisdiction of the High Court in cases involving rights to custody and for some ancillary matters.  This Part proposes to re-enact the existing law which, in the main, is contained in the Custody of Children Act, 1891.</P>
    <P>The Bill may be accused of being legislation for the abnormal situation or for the broken home mainly.  It is, in fact, much more than that.  It declares the guardianship rights and duties of those who are given authority, whether by parenthood or otherwise, over infants and states the legal relationship between these persons.  The aim is always the ultimate welfare of the infant.  Normally the provisions of the Bill will be invoked only in cases of family disputes.  However, I do not think that they are any less valuable because of that.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Bill reflects the fundamental values to which we adhere in our modern society and I commend it to the House on that basis. I trust that the sidenotes to the various sections and the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the Bill will be of assistance to Deputies in their examination of the various proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has expressed the fear that this Bill might be accused of being legislation for the abnormal situation or the broken home.  That might be but in some respects it is the kind of legislation which is possibly likely to give rise to family disputes rather than to settle them.  This is a subject in respect of which the Minister and the House generally must step rather gingerly having regard to the constitutional provisions which are there.  The Minister has referred to some of those constitutional provisions and I am glad he has because it shows that the matter has been under examination in his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty I see with regard to <Col N="144" /> this Bill and with regard to any law on this subject, having regard to the provisions of the Constitution, is that it is difficult to see that we can unequivocally declare that the welfare of the child must be of first and paramount importance.  I am not saying that that should not be the position but what I have in mind is that there are very definite provisions in the Constitution which seem to me to provide that the family unit as a whole, not the individual component parts of that unit, must be regarded as of first and paramount importance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to Article 42 of the Constitution.  He quoted Article 42.1 which states:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the Bill and, it seems to me to be clear from the terms of the Bill itself, the emphasis is laid rather on trying to secure in the case of children that the parents will do their duty but this Article of the Constitution which was quoted by the Minister refers not only to the duty of the parents but also to their inalienable right.  I would suggest to the Minister that he must be very careful to see in relation to this Bill whether or not it is open to challenge on the grounds of the very Article of the Constitution which he himself quoted.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets out a framework for appointing guardians.  To my mind it leaves some questions unanswered and some questions not dealt with at all.  I may be wrong in this&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am&mdash;but on my reading of the Bill there does not seem to be any disqualification of people as acting as guardians.  There does not seem to be any age qualification, for example.  I know there is a kind of overriding authority vested in the court, particularly if an objection is made by a surviving parent, but what is there under this Bill to prevent an infant being appointed as guardian of <Col N="145" /> an infant?  It probably has not been contemplated and would not in ordinary circumstances be contemplated but clearly it is not a type of guardianship that one would regard as likely to preserve and maintain the welfare of the infant who is to be guarded.  I do, as I say, recognise that there is certain authority being vested in the courts under this Bill but Article 42. 5 of the Constitution does provide that only in exceptional cases can the State step in.  It reads:</P>
    <P>In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child</P>
    <P>In other words, the degree of failure under that article of the Constitution is clearly defined and very limited and restrictive in character.  Where the parents for physical or moral reasons, and only for physical or moral reasons, fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard to the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.  As I say, the class of cases in which the State can step in, as it is to some degree stepping in under this Bill, is very limited and confined in character.</P>
    <P>I should like to put some questions to the Minister for clarification.  One I raised already, that is, who may be appointed as guardians?  Is it possible, as it seems to me to be possible under this Bill, to appoint anyone as guardian?</P>
    <P>With regard to section 7 (3), dealing with a testamentary guardian, it is provided that such guardian shall act jointly with the surviving parent of the infant so long as the surviving parent remains alive unless the surviving parent objects to his so acting.  Then the machinery for what is to happen if the surviving parent objects is laid down.  Is the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; deliberate?  It seems to me that the <Col N="146" /> use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather than the discretionary &ldquo;may&rdquo; seems to put an obligation on the testamentary guardian to act whether or not he or she cares to do so.  It is being put in a mandatory sense rather than on an optional basis.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment of the Wills Act to enable people under the age of 21 to make wills by which they can appoint testamentary guardians, I take it I am correct in assuming that that amendment of the Wills Act is limited in character and refers only to the appointment of testamentary guardians.  I take it that it is not intended to alter the law in relation to wills any further than that.</P>
    <P>I concede that a number of these things are possibly more appropriate for Committee discussion but I should like to have the Minister's mind and views on them at this stage to see if it will be necessary to suggest any amendments.</P>
    <P>Section 8 seems to be extremely wide.  It provides that, where an infant has no guardian, the court, on the application of any person or persons, may appoint the applicant or applicants or any of them to be the guardian or guardians of the infant. I can see that there is there a discretion to the court as to whether or not they will appoint the applicant or, if there is more than one applicant, whether they will appoint one or all of them. However, it seems to me to leave it very wide that any person may apply.</P>
    <P>The kind of case I have in mind is that of a child who is orphaned, say, because of a road accident or something like that.  I should imagine that the person who should be encouraged to apply for guardianship of the infant is a relative and the closer the relative the better.  But, under the provisions of this Bill, it is wide open that the secretary of any society and people of that description dealing with children's welfare can come in and apply&mdash;can, so to speak, beat the relative to the punch&mdash;if they want to put themselves in the position of being appointed or at least considered for appointment as guardians of infants. It is a matter that can be of some importance when one considers the position regarding the general religious <Col N="147" /> upbringing, for example, of children who are orphaned in that way.</P>
    <P>I do not quite understand the necessity for Section 8 (2):</P>
    <P>When no guardian has been appointed by a deceased parent or if a guardian so appointed dies or refuses to act, the court may appoint a guardian or guardians to act jointly with the surviving parent.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if the Minister would explain a little more fully what is in his mind in suggesting that provision in the Bill.  The present position, I suppose it would be true to say, is that only in a very small number of cases does the father or mother, as the case may be, appoint a testamentary guardian. In the normal case, when one parent dies, the family continues to exist and if there are infant children, the surviving parent accepts and discharges his or her duties as parent. We have a provision here which, in effect, as I read it, says that if one or other parent should die without appointing a testamentary guardian, the court would automatically give authority&mdash;whether it is requested or not&mdash;to appoint a guardian to act as a guardian with the surviving parent.  I could understand some provision of that nature being brought into the Bill if it were shown to deal only with particular cases where the appointment of a guardian to act with the surviving parent might be desirable but I do not understand it in the general all-embracing manner in which it appears in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 10&mdash;again I raise this matter only for the purpose of getting some clarification&mdash;deals with the powers and duties of guardians.  It provides for the terms the court will fix where a guardian has been appointed by deed or will.  It reads:</P>
    <P>Every guardian under this Act shall be a guardian of the person and of the estate of the infant unless, in the case of a guardian appointed by deed, will or order of the court, the terms of his appointment otherwise provide.</P>
    <P>That seems to mean that it is contemplated that under this Bill a person <Col N="148" /> may, by deed or will, appoint a guardian in a limited sense; that he can appoint a guardian, say, to act in relation to a particular aspect of the guardianship of the child or to act for a limited period.  I should like some information as to whether that is intended. I should like to know whether acceptance of the position of guardian in the case of a limited appointment&mdash;I shall use that phrase&mdash;under section 10 will put the guardian in the position that, so long as he discharges the purely limited function set out in the deed or the will appointing him, that is as far as his responsibility, on the one hand, and his liability, on the other hand, in the case of guardian of the estate, go.</P>
    <P>I confess I do not know to what section 10 (3) relates.  It is a very general provision.  It reads:</P>
    <P>The provisions of this section are without prejudice to the provisions of any other enactment or to any other powers or duties conferred or imposed by law on parents, guardians or trustees of the property of infants.</P>
    <P>In subsection (3), there is a reference to powers and duties imposed by law on guardians of infants, whereas in the earlier part of section 10 it is clearly contemplated that the deed or instrument appointing the guardian can be of a limited character either as to time or as to the function or duties of the guardian.  That seems to me to be nullified to a very great extent by subsection (3) which goes on to say that all that is without prejudice to any duties imposed by law on guardians.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated already, I do concede that many of these points concern matters which can be dealt with in greater detail on the Committee Stage, but I should be glad to have the Minister's views at this stage on some of them, particularly on the question of the qualifications or disqualifications of guardians.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to assure Deputy O'Higgins that we have had the greatest possible regard to the constitutional aspects of this matter and, indeed, we have studied carefully the various decisions which have been <Col N="149" /> given by the courts from time to time. We are as satisfied as we can be in the circumstances that we are treading safely that difficult and delicate path to which the Deputy has referred.  As the Deputy mentioned, most of the matters raised were, strictly speaking, Committee matters but I suppose there is no harm in dealing with them briefly at this stage.</P>
      <P>First of all, with regard to the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in subsection (3) of section 7, it has been used deliberately, so as to convey the statutory obligation to which Deputy O'Higgins referred. With regard to subsection (7) of the same section, the answer is that we do not intend to amend the Wills Act except in this very narrow sense.  The Deputy is right in his interpretation of subsection (1) of section 8.  It is true that any person may apply.  All I might say at this stage is that I think it desirable that the court should have the greatest possible freedom in this matter because once you start to tie the hands of the court in any way, you will almost certainly find in the course of time that you will come up against some snag and the very limitation which you made in the interests of the child will in some particular case have the opposite effect.  When a concrete case did come before the court, the court would find itself prohibited&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The case I had in mind is where the parents of a family are killed in a car crash but there are some adult children in the family and it would seem to me, having regard to the constitutional provisions of the family unit, that automatically they should be preferred to outsiders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy O'Higgins feels strongly enough about subsection (1), or, indeed, about subsection (2), and if he puts down an amendment, we shall certainly consider it fully between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of the qualifications of guardians.  Of course, as he rightly points out, there are none.  It would be an infringement of parental rights and responsibilities to lay down qualifications as to those who are appointed guardians by parents.  As regards court-appointed <Col N="150" /> guardians, the High Court, which has always had special care and responsibility for minors, either in the matter of appointing guardians for them or in taking them under its wing as wards of court, acts primarily in the interests of the child.  This role of being the special protector of infants is so traditionally and historically associated with the High Court that we can safely assume in the case of court-appointed guardians that only satisfactory and proper persons will be appointed.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate to attempt to say to the High Court, as in effect we would be saying, that we cannot trust you to appoint satisfactory and proper persons and that we propose from now on to lay down qualifications. Sometimes when we are leaving things to the court it is appropriate to indicate to the court the wishes of the legislature with regard to a particular matter and to indicate in the statute some limitations or qualifications but I do not think it is at all appropriate in this case because here we are dealing with a court which traditionally and historically has had a special function as the protector and guardian of infants.  That being so, I do not think it would be appropriate to lay down any particular qualifications for court-appointed guardians and it would be equally undesirable to do so in the case of guardians appointed by parents.  I hope the Bill will commend itself in principle to the House and that we can discuss any other points which may arise on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the Registrar of Titles.  It provides in subsection (3):</P>
      <P>No person shall be appointed to be Registrar of Titles unless at the time of his appointment he is either a barrister-at-law or a solicitor who has practised his profession for not less than eight years.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that under this Bill the functions and powers of the Registrar of Titles are being extended very considerably.  In part his functions are now becoming functions of a judicial nature.  Under section 49, for example, he will be exercising powers which previously have been reserved to the courts.  Under section 118 he is going to be the authority to determine claims against the Government for compensation and mistakes in the Land Registry.  It is important in those circumstances, particularly having regard to his position in relation to the determination of claims under section 118, that the Registrar should be completely protected from the possibility of political, departmental or local pressure.</P>
      <P>The suggestion I have to make is that he should be placed in the same position as the Comptroller and Auditor General and removable in the same manner as the Comptroller and Auditor General for misconduct or incapacity. Eight years' qualification as a solicitor or barrister seems to be rather short having regard to the extended functions which the Registrar is now going to get.  It would be well for the Minister to look at that again. It would seem to be more appropriate in the circumstances that some longer period&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The object of this amendment is to enable the functions of the Registrar, in his capacity as Registrar of Deeds, to be exercised by such other officers as may be designated for the purpose by the Minister for Justice.  This will allow a greater flexibility in the administration by the Registrar of the two Registries under his control.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the question of fees.  I do not think it should pass without some comment or explanation from the Minister.  Under this section the Minister is being given authority, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make orders fixing the fees to be taken in the Land Registry in connection with the dealings that will take place there.  It is made clear in subsection (2) of this section that the Minister is going to operate with the aim of making the Land Registry self-supporting. It is intended, when this Bill comes into force, that registration in the Land Registry will be compulsory. At the same time, the Minister is suggesting to the House that authority be given to him to fix fees in such a manner that the Land Registry will become self-supporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rightly or wrongly, I visualise a vast extension of the Land Registry, both in buildings and in personnel, if they are going to handle the volume of work they are likely to be called on to handle when this Bill becomes law. I think it is going to be a very great imposition on people dealing with the sale and purchase of property if they are to be required to foot the bill for this.  There is criticism from time to time of the fees, costs and so on, charged by solicitors.  Under subsection <Col N="158" /> (2) of this section, I think it only right to point out at this stage that, if that goes through unaltered, there is likely to be a very great increase in costs to the person engaged in buying and selling property&mdash;not at the solicitor's end but at the Revenue end by means of the increased fees they will be required to pay in order to make the Land Registry self-supporting.</P>
    <P>As this is a matter of compulsion by the Government, it is only fair that the service should be provided in large measure by the Government and that the ordinary person who has cause to buy or sell property&mdash;I do not mean in the sense of speculating in buying or selling property&mdash;should not, by virtue of this legislation and particularly by virtue of subsection (2) of section 14, be required to face, as he probably will have to face, a considerable increase in Government impositions on him for those transactions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 14 does not establish any new principle.  The principle has always been there that the Land Registry should be self-supporting and there can be no question of departing from that principle.  That principle was enshrined in section 8 of the original Registration of Title Act, 1891.  I should point out that these registration fees are not a tax on a transaction.  They have no relationship to stamp duty in any way.  All the person is being asked to do is to pay for services provided and the practice is there already that the person concerned will pay no more than the service costs.  There is no desire by the Government to make a profit on the Land Registry.  They are only laying down a principle that it must pay for itself and to that extent, therefore, the person who is dealing with the Land Registry is paying no more and no less than exactly what he should pay for the service with which he is being provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from this measure, it is desirable that the Land Registry should be expanded along the lines indicated by Deputy O'Higgins.  We have already taken steps to improve the accommodation situation and also, to a considerable extent, the staff. <Col N="159" /> There are proposals on hand at the moment to make an important administrative change on the staff side in the Land Registry which I hope will be of considerable benefit.  However, I do think most practitioners, if the question were put to them whether they would like a completely efficient Land Registry if it cost a little more in fees or an inefficient one with slightly lesser fees, would answer that they would prefer an efficient Land Registry in which their transactions would be promptly dealt with.  Having said all that, I am not apprehensive that there would be any major increases in the fees payable in the Land Registry as a result of the expansion which will take place because of this Bill.  I am carefully avoiding any opportunity of being political and of pointing out that the Deputy's Party in their time substantially increased the fees in the Land Registry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is only making it, not for answer.  I did not intend to deal with the point the Minister did not make.  There are a few matters in relation to the Minister's remarks on Section 14 which I think it is as well to recall.  The Minister said this was not a question of stamp duty.  I agree with that.  It is a question of the fees that will be fixed by him with the consent of the Minister for Finance in relation to dealings in the Land Registry.  If you take stamp duty and registration fees into account, registered land is costing a person who buys property and the title as registered more than unregistered land, unregistered in the Land Registry sense, that is, registered in the Registry of Deeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of stamp duty and fees collected on the sale of property in four different categories of value, that is, £1,200, £3,000, £5,000 and £10,000.  In the case of unregistered land, the amount paid to the State on the transaction where the value is <Col N="160" /> £1,200 comes to £20.  At the moment in regard to registered land where it is required to discharge equities, the total cost comes to £30.12.  Therefore, in that case there is an extra imposition on the purchaser of £10.12.  It would not be quite so high if the equities were already discharged.  In fact the difference between unregistered land and registered land where equities have been discharged would be only £4.</P>
    <P>The same pattern goes through all these cases.  Where the value is £3,000, in the case of unregistered land the amount payable to the State in stamp duty and fees would be £92.  In the case of registered land where equities require to be discharged, it would be £115 16s.  In the case of property to the value of £5,000, on unregistered land the amount payable by way of stamp duty and fees would be £152. In the case of registered land where equities have to be discharged, it would be £180.  Where the value is £10,000, on unregistered land the total would be £302 and on registered land where equities have to be discharged, £330.  Therefore, in Land Registry dealings there is an additional rake-off for the State.  At any rate as far as the purchaser is concerned, he has to put his hand deeper into his pocket when dealing with the Land Registry than when dealing with the Registry of Deeds.  When that position already exists, I am apprehensive of what the position will be where the Minister is given <i>carte blanche</i> to fix whatever fees he thinks are necessary subject only to the consent of the Minister for Finance, which, I am sure, will be readily forthcoming when one has regard to the fact that the purpose of fixing the fees which the Minister will be undertaking will be to make the Land Registry self-supporting and to ensure it is not a charge on the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Higgins, I am slightly apprehensive about the effect of subsection (2).  As the Minister knows, I am an enthusiastic supporter of the principle in the Bill, in the belief that it will lead to more efficient, quicker and, above all, <Col N="161" /> cheaper transfers of property, but the principle that the Land Registry should be self-supporting&mdash;having regard to the fact that the Bill aims at bringing in all the property in the State&mdash;makes me wonder whether I am right in thinking this will lead to cheaper conveyancing.</P>
      <P>It is undoubtedly true that in order to make the Land Registry as efficient as it should be, and to enable it to deal with the volume of business it will have to deal with, a considerable amount of money will have to be spent on it, and on increased staff.  I suppose it is a question of mathematics, and one would need an actuary to work out how that will affect fees and the volume of business related to the increased staff.  I have a feeling that it will lead to an increase in the actual fees per case.  If that is so, I am afraid it will be rather unfortunate and it may take away a lot of the good the Minister is aiming to achieve.</P>
      <P>I can understand that the Government&mdash;or any Government&mdash;considering this problem would say: &ldquo;The principle has been established that the Land Registry should be self-supporting. Why should we change it?&rdquo; On a cursory examination, it appears quite simple.  You are dealing with people who are buying and selling property, and why should they not be expected to pay enough to make the Land Registry self-supporting?  I suggest there may be room for reconsideration because the principle laid down in 1891 is not necessarily applicable to-day. We are bringing in all urban property under the Land Registry. Some was brought in before but now we are bringing in all urban property. Therefore, we are dealing with a phenomenon which did not exist in 1891.  A large number of white collar workers are purchasing their own houses with great financial strain and effort on themselves, and any additional burden is a vast consideration so far as they are concerned.  That is why I am concerned about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest there may be a case for considering the Land Registry in the nature of a social service, having regard to the altered circumstances <Col N="162" /> since 1891.  I do not suggest it should be free, but there may be a case for considering that the State should subsidise it to some extent, if necessary, and if the fees become too expensive. Certainly a large proportion of the business dealt with by the Land Registry will be compulsory, as Deputy O'Higgins said.  It will also be dealing with the business of people who have not got much money, and for that reason there may be a case for considering it as being in the nature of a social service.  Perhaps the Minister could reconsider the matter even to the extent of taking out the obligation to make the Land Registry self-supporting, with a view to aiming at its being self-supporting, but if it were found that meant the fees were going too high, the Government would then reconsider the position.</P>
    <P>So long as subsection (2) is left in the Bill, I am afraid it is simply a question of fees going up as costs go up, and as we know, it is difficult to amend a thing like that by itself.  It is a very difficult problem for the Minister because the principle is there and it appears to be reasonable on the face of it, but I would ask him to reconsider the matter if he can do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that certainly at this stage there is no question of our departing from that principle. In the years ahead, if the situation got out of control to the extent that Deputies fear&mdash;and about which I certainly am not apprehensive&mdash;that would be a different matter and the Government of the day would have to look at the situation and see whether an alternative was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that this is simply a payment for services rendered. There is no profit element in it for the State: it is a payment for a valuable service.  I feel I should at this stage point out that the system of State registration of title is a very valuable one, and one which confers very great benefits on the people who have access to it.  Furthermore, I want Deputies to remember that once you have your title registered in the Land Registry, the State guarantees that title, and undertakes to recompense <Col N="163" /> you, and compensate you, for any mistake which may arise.  Once you have had access to the service of the Land Registry to have your title registered, you are in a very special and happy position as a property owner. You have this State guarantee which is very valuable indeed, and from that point of view, I think that people who have access to the service should be prepared to pay for it, provided, of course, it is efficiently administered, that costs do not get out of line and that fees are reasonable for the service provided.</P>

It is a benefit, if you like, that is being conferred <Col N="164" /> by the Government.  He will get his title registered in the Land Registry and, as the Minister says, it will be State guaranteed, but at the expense of the purchaser who is not asking for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion in the two amendments is that urban property should be left outside the scope of the Bill for the moment &mdash;that is, property in county boroughs or urban council areas.  My reason for making this suggestion is that it will cause great mapping difficulties to deal with urban property in this way.  By the time compulsory registration has extended to what might be described as non-urban property, that operation in itself will take at least a decade.  If, at the same time as the Land Registry is endeavouring to deal with non-urban property, it also has to deal with urban property, there is likely to be created a very great bottleneck in a number of departments in the Land Registry. Mapping difficulties will especially arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My suggestion to the Minister is that he should exclude urban property from the scope of the Bill at the moment.  I have no doubt that after <Col N="166" /> this Bill has been in operation for some years various amendments of one sort or another will be required, and that the Government of the day will be coming back to the House with an amending Bill.  At that stage it may be that registration of non-urban property will have proceeded to an extent which would then make it a feasible proposition for the Land Registry to tackle the question of registration of urban property.  The more I think of this at the moment, the more I become convinced that this Bill as it stands, in endeavouring to extend registration to urban property, will be utterly unsuccessful because of the mapping difficulties involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendments, as Deputy O'Higgins points out, would be to prevent the system of compulsory registration from being extended to urban land. To me, at any rate, these amendments are unacceptable because they would completely nullify what is one of the main objectives of the Bill.  The bulk of land in rural areas is already registered and there would really be little point in providing for the extension of compulsory registration if we were only to think in terms of the remaining rural land at present not registered in the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>On the Second Reading, I explained in detail to the House why I considered it desirable that compulsory registration should be extended to all land in the State.  I think I can best answer Deputy O'Higgins's case by pointing out to him that on the Second Reading, and subsequently outside the House, I explained it is our intention to extend compulsory registration to an additional area only after we have become absolutely satisfied the Land Registry is dealing efficiently with what it already has on its plate, and that we do not contemplate adding a single piece of extra business to the Land Registry machinery until such time as we are satisfied that it is fully and adequately equipped to cope with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this should be a sufficient protection against the fears to which Deputy O'Higgins has given expression. The whole Bill is based on the idea <Col N="167" /> that extension of the system of registration of title to all land in the State by means of compulsory registration is a desirable aim and if we were to exclude from the scope of this Bill urban property, then we would be nullifying to a large extent the whole aim and object of the Bill.  I do not wish at this stage to attempt to forecast how long it will be before all the land in the country is registered in the Land Registry.  It is a process that will take place over a considerable number of years: very hesitantly, I would mention 15 to 20 years.  Thinking along those lines, I feel we can do this task to everybody's satisfaction: we can bring the Land Registry up to a state of efficiency and extend its staffing and other arrangements to the point where they will be able to cope with whatever additions we may make.</P>
    <P>This amendment from that point of view and from Deputy O'Higgins's own point of view is, I think, unnecessary because no Minister for Justice would be so irresponsible as to add on areas whether urban or rural with which the Land Registry was not able to cope and thereby create confusion and disorder.  I think we can be satisfied that the Ministers for Justice will operate the provisions of this Bill sensibly, reasonably and logically. They are not going to bring trouble on their own heads by asking the Land Registry to do impossible things and if there was any particular urban or rural area which would present exceptional difficulty, that will not be added on or brought inside the scope of compulsory registration until such time as the Minister is satisfied the Land Registry is in a position to cope with it.</P>

      <P>In page 14, line 2, after &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(other than the Land Commission)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to <Col N="168" /> exempt the Land Commission from the sanction which Section 25 imposes for the enforcement of compulsory registration. It is clearly desirable that when the Land Commission buys land in a compulsory registration area that it should be bound in the same way as anybody else to register title to that land.  On the other hand, as practical people, we must recognise that the Commission is in a special position by virtue of the large number of transactions in which it engages and the fact that it is discharging an important statutory function under the Land Purchase Acts.  Because of these circumstances I think it would be unreasonable and pointless to allow Section 25 of this Bill to operate in the case of the Land Commission as the only effect of doing so would be to hinder the Commission in the discharge of the functions with which it has been entrusted by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow the Minister's reasoning on this.  The fact that the Land Commission engage in a large number of transactions does not seem to me to be an argument in favour of excluding them from the provisions of Section 25 unless the Minister's argument is that the time limit imposed is unreasonably short to enable the Land Commission to have themselves registered within the prescribed period.  If that is the case the Minister is making I agree with him because I intend to make a similar case for purchasers generally in the next two amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 14, line 5, to delete &ldquo;three&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;six&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this amendment and No. 11 might be considered together.  In No. 10, I suggest that the three months' time limit which the Minister suggests in the section should be extended to six.  This section is one which provides that a person who purchases property will not in fact acquire any <Col N="170" /> estate or interest in that property by virtue of his property deed unless within three months from the date of the deed he is actually registered as owner.  I think Deputy Colley and others with practical experience will realise that there are definite difficulties and definite dangers in this situation. The idea in the section is not a new one.  One of the difficulties in Land Registry matters as against the dealings that take place in the Registry of Deeds is that the transaction is effective only from the date of registration and, as between the two parties, the buyer and the seller, the purchaser parts with his money at the time the sale is being closed and he is being handed his Land Registry transfer. While he has parted with his money he is still not the owner until he gets that registered in the Land Registry.  That is the present position.</P>
    <P>There are various reasons why there can be delays even about lodging for registration.  The deed will not be stamped until the sale is closed and it is necessary very frequently to have correspondence and negotiations with the Stamps Branch of the Revenue Commissioners on the question of stamp duties which has become quite a complicated subject, so that the application for registration might not take place for some time.  If it was delayed through nobody's fault it might limit the period further in which registration could take place.  I suggest the Minister will certainly not be harming his Bill and will, I think, be improving it, if he accepts that the three months should be extended to six and if he also accepts that instead of the effective time being when a person is registered in relation to the six months, it should be when the application for registration takes place.</P>
