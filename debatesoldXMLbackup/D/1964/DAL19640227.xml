    <P>The Supplementary Estimate contains additional provisions for our contributions towards the cost of the United Nations military operations in the Congo and the Middle East for the six months period ended on 31st December, 1963.  The last assessments which we received and paid in respect of these operations were for periods ended on 30th June, 1962.  Provisions were included in the Vote for the current year for assessments which we anticipated we would receive for our share of the cost of these operations for the year ended 30th June, 1963. However, it was decided that the cost for this period would be met from the sale of United Nations bonds and at its Fourth Special Session, held in May, 1963, the General Assembly established a new basis for apportioning among member States the cost of United Nations operations in the Congo and the Middle East for the six months ended 31st December, 1963.  It was not, therefore, possible to foresee this development when the Estimate for the current year was prepared.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that for the past few years the United Nations has been threatened by a continuing financial crisis resulting from the failure of certain member States to contribute towards the cost of peace-keeping activities of the Organisation.  The <Col N="1722" /> principal defaulters take the attitude that the Security Council alone has the right under the Charter to authorise the financing of peace-keeping operations, the powers of the General Assembly being restricted to the making of recommendations which are not legally binding.  Thus, on political and juridical grounds, many countries have withheld payments and undermined the whole financial structure of the Organisation.</P>
    <P>The International Court of Justice was called upon to sort out the legal and constitutional questions involved and to give an advisory opinion on the point.  This it did in July, 1962, when it announced that the ONUC and UNEF expenditures were &ldquo;expenses of the Organisation&rdquo; within the meaning of Article 17 (2) of the Charter.  This opinion of the Court was accepted by the General Assembly at its Seventeenth Session by 76 votes to 17 against, with eight abstentions. However, the defaulting members still refused to be influenced by this decision, with the result that heavy arrears have accumulated in the ONUC and UNEF accounts.  On the 31st December, 1963, including the current assessments, the arrears on foot of the ONUC account were $96 million and those on foot of the UNEF account were $33 million, a total of $129 million in all.  When added to arrears in contributions to the Working Capital Fund and the regular United Nations Budget, the Organisation's total arrears now amount to $150 million.</P>
    <P>The United Nations, as is well known, had to resort to the sale of bonds to tide it over the crisis.  These bonds are repayable over a period of 25 years and carry interest at the rate of 2 per cent per annum.  The defaulting countries have so far refused to buy these bonds and now refuse to contribute towards their redemption as provided in the United Nations regular Budget.  We played our part in the bond effort by taking up $300,000 worth of the bonds.</P>
    <P>The sale of these bonds brought in approximately $148 million and no separate assessments were made on member States in respect of the cost <Col N="1723" /> of peace-keeping operations for the year ended on 30th June, 1963.  But, of course, this was only an interim measure until a formula could be evolved for the equitable sharing of peace-keeping costs.  Accordingly, a Special Session of the General Assembly was convened in May of 1963 and charged with the task of putting United Nations finances on a firm basis.  The Assembly adopted a resolution setting out general principles to serve as guide lines for the sharing of the costs of future peace-keeping operations involving heavy expenditure.</P>
    <P>The main principles are: (i) financing of such operations is the collective responsibility of all members; (ii) economically more developed countries should make relatively larger contributions than economically less developed countries; (iii) voluntary contributions from members should be encouraged; (iv) the special responsibilities of the permanent members of the Security Council should be borne in mind in connection with their contributions and (v) special consideration should be given to the situation of member States which are the victims of the events or actions leading to peace-keeping operations.</P>
    <P>The Assembly also adopted resolutions on the financing of the ONUC and UNEF operations for the six months ended on 31st December, 1963.  Under the terms of these resolutions, the first $3.0 million of the ONUC expenditure and the first $2.5 million of the UNEF expenditure is to be shared by all members according to the regular scale of assessment for the regular Budget for 1963.  Of the balance, the economically less developed countries were asked to contribute only 45 per cent of their mathematical shares and 26 countries listed, including Ireland, were called upon to make good the resulting short-fall by way of voluntary contributions.  The Assembly considered this as an <i>ad hoc</i> apportionment arrangement for the present phases of the operations which was not to be construed as a precedent for the future.  Thus for the six months period in question our assessment <Col N="1724" /> in respect of ONUC is $46,126 and for UNEF $13,279, plus a voluntary contribution of $6,300 towards both accounts.  This gives a total of $65,705 or £23,560, whereas £14,250 was provided in the Vote for both operations.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in the Supplementary Estimate for a contribution of $25,000 to the United Nations Fund for the Congo.  We made a similar contribution to this Fund in 1961 and I explained to the House at the time that this voluntary Fund is used under United Nations control and in consultation with the Central Government of the Congo for the purpose of assisting that Government to maintain certain essential public services with the ultimate objective of preserving its political independence, protecting and advancing the welfare of its people and safeguarding international peace.</P>
    <P>The United Nations operation in most of the Congo has now largely turned from the maintenance of order to the provision of an extensive programme of economic and technical assistance with the major emphasis on the training of the Congolese themselves to assume the responsibilities of running their essential services.  The needs of the Congo for outside assistance continue to be great and they extend over every aspect of the economic, social and administrative life of the country.</P>
    <P>The target of the Fund for 1964 is $13 million and is required to provide the Central Government with foreign exchange requirements to ensure the continuation of certain essential services, including the employment of internationally recruited personnel such as doctors, secondary school teachers and magistrates.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that this part of the United Nations effort should not suddenly be allowed to collapse for financial reasons.  If it proved necessary suddenly to pull out these essential experts and close down the programme of training in various fields, the Government and people of the Congo would suffer a severe setback and much of the effort of the United Nations in the past three years would have gone to waste.  I hope, <Col N="1725" /> therefore, that the House will agree that the Government should continue to support the civilian operation in the Congo by making a second contribution of $25,000 to the Fund.  Our total payments of $50,000 over a four year period to the United Nations Fund for the Congo could not be held to be excessive.</P>
    <P>The provision in Subhead F is for the purpose of setting up an Overseas Training Fund of £50,000 to assist in the training in Ireland of nationals of the young African and Asian States in administration, management and technical skills.  The Fund will be under the control of the Minister for External Affairs and grants and repayable advances will be made from it in accordance with regulations approved by the Minister for Finance.  In every case the sponsoring Government or body concerned will be responsible for the emoluments of the trainees.</P>
    <P>In setting up this Fund, the Government are giving recognition to their obligation to give increased assistance to the developing countries as our own economic capacity grows.</P>
    <P>The services rendered to these countries over the years by Irish missionaries, doctors, nurses and teachers are well known.  Some years ago the number of Irish missionaries in Africa, Asia and Latin America was estimated at nearly 6,000 and a recent UNESCO publication estimated the number of qualified Irish teachers working in Africa alone at 1,500.</P>
    <P>Similar services in Ireland have been given in great measure by the universities and other post-secondary education bodies.  In 1962/3 there were 1,100 students from developing countries at the National University, Trinity College, Dublin, and the College of Surgeons out of a total student population of 11,000.</P>
    <P>As for Governmental aid, in addition to making annual contributions to the various multilateral aid-giving organisations over the past ten years or so, the Government have assisted the developing countries in two ways: Firstly, by arranging for Irish experts in various fields to work in those countries either under the auspices of <Col N="1726" /> the United Nations or its specialised agencies, or by bilateral arrangements. Since 1950 some 60 Irish experts have worked in 34 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America for periods averaging 18 months.  Of these, 20 were medical experts and others were experts in such fields as public administration, agriculture, meteorology and telecommunications. This is a service which we are endeavouring to expand. Experts are required by the United Nations to have considerable experience in their particular sphere of activity.</P>
    <P>Secondly, also since 1950, we have received either through international organisations or by bilateral arrangements close on 300 nationals of developing countries, some for long but the majority for relatively short periods, for training in various spheres such as public health, public administration, local government, statute law reform, human rights and the educational system.</P>
    <P>The State-sponsored bodies have also played their part in this work. For example, Irish Shipping has accepted four Nigerians for a complete course of training as marine engineers; Aer Lingus has trained up to 80 African and Asian engineers and pilots in the maintenance and flying of planes; CIE has trained a group of Nigerians in diesel electric traction and Bord na Móna have co-operated with the Government of Pakistan in initiating peat development in that country.</P>
    <P>The largest single scheme we have undertaken in the training field has been the acceptance of a large group of young Northern Rhodesians for training in public administration.  When he visited Ireland last year Dr. Kaunda, recently elected Prime Minister of Northern Rhodesia, pointed out that his country would be acutely short of administrators on gaining independence later this year and he requested that 40 students should be given up to a year's training in Government Departments and with local authorities in Ireland.  It was arranged that the Government would advance the living expenses of the trainees against a guarantee from Dr. Kaunda <Col N="1727" /> that the money so advanced would be repaid by the Northern Rhodesian Government after independence.  In accordance with Dr. Kaunda's wishes four of these young men are being trained in the Department of Defence, four in the Department of Justice, four in the Department of Local Government, and the remainder in local authorities.</P>
    <P>At the request of the Government, the Institute of Public Administration has been good enough to undertake the general administration of the training scheme.  I am happy to say that since their arrival towards the end of last year, these young men have been co-operating with enthusiasm and energy in the training arrangements, and that the reports on their progress are very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The practical training is being supplemented by courses for the students in administration and management in the Civil Service Training Centre and in the Institute of Public Administration.</P>
    <P>The Overseas Trainee Fund is designed to meet the expenses of this scheme and to enable us to undertake further training schemes of the same kind.</P>
    <P>The main items of expenditure in current training schemes are the specialised courses for the students in the Institute of Public Administration, their travelling expenses in Ireland and the salary of an officer specially recruited by the Institute to look after the training arrangements and the welfare of the trainees.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Institute intend to expand their facilities for the training in public administration of nationals of developing countries and I would hope that the Government may count on their collaboration in future schemes of this nature.  In view of the substantial aid which is given by various Foundations, largely American, to non-governmental bodies engaged in the training in administration of the nationals of developing countries, we would expect the Institute to endeavour to supplement any assistance <Col N="1728" /> from the Fund by seeking financial aid from all other possible sources. In such cases the Overseas Trainee Fund could assist the Institute to expand its work by means of repayable advances.  Where assistance is not likely to be forthcoming from other sources, a grant would be made from the Fund. The existence of the Fund will ensure that lack of money will not prevent the Government from undertaking a worthwhile training scheme.</P>
    <P>I feel that the proposal for the establishment of an Overseas Trainee Fund will commend itself to Deputies as being in keeping with the splendid traditions established by our missionaries, teachers, doctors and nurses over the years in Africa and Asia, and as a positive indication of our interest in the welfare of the newly-emerging States.  The work of training and education which the Fund is designed to foster was, moreover, of particular interest to that great champion of the emerging nations, Dag Hammersjoeld, and I am happy to know that it is the intention of the Institute of Public Administration to be associated in this field with the work of the Dag Hammersjoeld Foundation. Because of the speed with which history is propelling the developing countries into independence, most of them find themselves disastrously short of trained teachers, administrators and medical experts.  We can help them to help themselves by giving them basic training in administration or other technical skills.  This is a form of aid which owing to our traditions and our history we feel Ireland is particularly suited to give to many of these new States.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Irish-American Foundation.  As Deputies are aware, the American-Irish Foundation was launched on the occasion of the visit to Ireland of the late President Kennedy and the late President and President de Valera consented to become its Patrons.  The Foundation was incorporated as a non-profit making organisation in New York in June, 1963.  The principal objective of the Foundation is to promote cultural, intellectual, educational, literary and scientific relations between the <Col N="1729" /> United States and Ireland.  The Foundation will sponsor the interchange between the two countries of students, teachers, lecturers, professors, writers, musicians, artists, etc.</P>
    <P>The Foundation will be financed by donations and bequests and I understand that it is organising a fund-raising campaign in the United States.</P>
    <P>The very large number of Americans of Irish descent in the United States are playing an increasingly important part in the political, educational and industrial life there.  From time to time Americans of this kind have suggested that cultural and educational exchanges between Ireland and the United States should be increased. Already, of course, such exchanges are taking place.  Under the scholarship exchange scheme administered by An Bord Scoláireachtaí Cómalairte and financed by an allocation of £500,000 from the Grant Counterpart Fund, a number of scholarships in the United States for Irish graduate students and for American lecturers and professors in Ireland have been provided annually since 1958.  Exchange scholarships have also been awarded by the Society of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in both Philadelphia and Washington and in 1959 through the generosity of Mr. Joseph P. Kennedy, father of the late President, a number of fellowships in American colleges were awarded to Irish students of economics and of pure and applied science.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the new foundation will prove an important and enduring advance in this field.  With the encouragement and support of our Ambassador in Washington.  Dr. Kiernan, a group of prominent Irish Americans has come together and formed this Foundation.  The present Board of Directors of the Foundation consists of Daniel F. Cohalan, John Coleman, James Cummins, Roger Faherty, James Farley, Joseph Gannon, John McShane and Thomas J. Kiernan, our Ambassador to the United States.  I am very happy indeed that the Foundation is governed by such a distinguished group and in view of their wide experience and their <Col N="1730" /> high reputation, I know that under their guidance the Foundation will prosper.  The Foundation will, of course, have the full and wholehearted support of the Irish Government and as an earnest of their interest the Government have decided to make a capital contribution of £10,000 to the Foundation.</P>
    <P>The establishment of this Foundation will, I hope, result in substantial benefits to both countries in the educational and cultural fields.  Its success will mean educational opportunities at some of the great American universities and institutes for our graduates and will help Americans to study here and learn more about Ireland.  Opportunities of this kind for young Americans and young Irishmen cannot readily be measured in monetary terms but it is clear I believe that in making this contribution to the Foundation, we are making a wise investment.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to stress that in doing all we can to assist the Foundation, we shall be honouring in a particularly fitting manner the late President of the United States who throughout his brilliant career always showed the highest regard for education and culture and cherished the ties between Ireland and the United States. In seeking the authority of this House for a capital contribution of £10,000 to the Foundation, I do so in the knowledge that this will be yet another worthy memorial to the late John Fitzgerald Kennedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We approve the subheads of this Supplementary Estimate. I do not quite understand why copies of the Minister's statement are so scarce.  It would be much more convenient if one were available for myself and Deputy Corish so that we should not have to share one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given a brief summary of the now perennial crisis which seems to afflict the United Nations, particularly in regard to operations in the Congo but he did not tell us what his prognostication was of when the financial confusion in this regard is likely to end or if it is likely ever to end.  The International Court <Col N="1731" /> of Justice declared that it is the liability of all the members but some members do not seem to have paid much heed.  I should be glad to know if the Minister can tell us whether, in his judgment, the various devices that have been operating and now operate will prove sufficient to maintain the essential work of the Congo, with special reference to the provision of civilian assistance by way of experts and administrators and doctors who are helping in keeping the Congo on its feet, as the Minister has described in his statement.</P>
    <P>That work in which we play our part&mdash;but, of course, many others participate in it&mdash;cannot go on if funds are not available and I agree that it would be a great tragedy if that vital help had to be withdrawn before the Congo people were in a position to carry on themselves.  The Minister says the Congo operation now has changed. The United Nations operation in most of the Congo has now largely turned from the maintenance of order to the provision of an extensive programme of economic and technical assistance. If this is true, can the Minister forecast approximately when it is proposed that the Irish troops now in the Congo should return home?  How long does he expect to keep troops in the Congo? How long will that be necessary?</P>
    <P>On an occasion such as this, it would have been well for the Minister to give us some general indication of what prospect he sees of the maintenance of order in the Congo because frankly some of the stories one reads in the newspaper make one wonder how far is it possible, in present conditions, to maintain order and how far order is in fact maintained outside the relatively restricted areas where United Nations troops are situated.  I should be glad to hear the Minister's picture of the real situation at present obtaining.</P>
    <P>I note in the Minister's reference to the training of students from Africa in this country, he tells us that ten per cent of the entire student body in our universities and the College of Surgeons are now students from Africa. Everybody here is anxious to do his part in helping in the education of <Col N="1732" /> students from Africa but I should like to hear from the Minister whether he is satisfied that we have sufficient university accommodation for all our own students as well as the 1,100 we are now receiving from Africa.  We should be generous in receiving students from Africa and helping them in every way but we must have some regard to the availability of accommodation for our own children and if my information is right, the number of places in a good many faculties at present is already severely restricted, mainly on grounds of space and accommodation.  That aspect of the situation should be kept constantly in mind in determining how great a number of foreign students we can properly undertake to educate within the limited resources at our disposal.</P>
    <P>I am particularly gratified to learn of the development of the scheme under which 300 nationals in developing countries have come for training in various spheres, public health, public administration, local government, statute law reform, human rights and the educational system.  I think this kind of work is most valuable and is the means of making a very real contribution to the future of these countries. It is an excellent thing that State-sponsored bodies have been able to train applicants as marine engineers, engineers and pilots in the maintenance and flying of planes, diesel-electric traction operators and the like.  There is, I think, no contribution we can make which would be of greater value than giving young Africans a knowledge of the methods of our Civil Service and our organised semi-State bodies and enabling them to bring that training back with them to Africa to use in the service of their own country.</P>
    <P>In regard to the reference by the Minister to the American-Ireland Foundation, I should be glad of some more precise information. The Minister says that the Foundation will sponsor the interchange between the two countries of students, teachers, lecturers, professors, writers, musicians, artists, etc., and that it will be financed by donations and bequests.  Is this <Col N="1733" /> Foundation to operate more or less on the model of the Fulbright scholarship scheme, primarily designed to exchange students and post-graduate students between the universities here and universities in America, or will it be extended to finance concerts and lectures of visiting professors?</P>
    <P>I observe that the Minister recalls that already such exchanges are taking place under the scholarship exchange system administered by An Bord Scoláireachtaí Cómhalairte and financed by an allocation of £500,000 from the Grant Counterpart Fund.  I hope the Minister bears in mind some of the residual advantages of Marshall Aid of which on another occasion he was extremely critical.  I agree with the Minister that the names of the distinguished gentlemen who constitute the board of this Foundation are a guarantee of its ultimate success.  Personally, I would be happy to see this Foundation concern itself primarily with educational purposes and if its resources were mainly devoted to enabling young students from this country, or indeed post-graduate students, to go to American universities and, <i>vice versa,</i> receiving American students and post-graduate students in our universities or in the Institute of Advanced Studies, I believe this would be the best use to which the funds of this Foundation could be put.</P>
    <P>I venture to doubt whether the endowment of concerts or lectures or that kind of activity has very much effect.  I have no doubt at all that the provision of scholarships which make it truly possible for students to have access to the universities which otherwise they could never have is a valuable activity and one that produces results down the years.  I should be glad to hear from the Minister, if he can tell us, that it is the intention of this Foundation to concentrate its attention on that kind of activity.  I notice that both in respect of the £500,000 which we have invested in the Counterpart Fund and of other exchange scholarships awarded by the Society of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in both Philadelphia and Washington, and through the generosity <Col N="1734" /> of Mr. Joseph P. Kennedy, a number of fellowships in American colleges awarded to Irish students of economics and of pure and applied science, have all recognised the superior value of opening academic opportunities to students who otherwise would not have them.  I hope the Foundation will take an example from that and concentrate its attention mainly in that direction.</P>
    <P>We approve generally of the proposals in the Supplementary Estimate but we should like to have further and better information about the situation in the Congo, the prospects of our being relieved of Army duties in the maintenance of order, and I should like a reassurance that our efforts in accommodating African students is not overtaxing the capacity of our university resources to the detriment of our own students who may find themselves excluded from the medical, engineering or science faculties for want of place to accommodate them.</P>

      <P>I must confess to a slight disadvantage in that I did not have the Minister's brief in which is contained, in the first part, a number of figures to which one might like to advert.  However, I do not think there is any controversy about this Supplementary Estimate.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, we approve of it wholeheartedly.  For some time now the news has been current that many of the Member countries of the United Nations were seriously in arrears in their contributions to the Congo operations.  The Minister should give us some details about these countries. He should name the countries who are in arrears and give the amount of the arrears.  We can be justly proud of the efforts this country is making to maintain peace in what are now being described as the emergent countries of the African Continent.  We can rightfully boast about the contribution Ireland has made in the Congo, not alone in regard to the money it has subscribed through this House and through the Government, but in regard to the personnel it has supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right to say that this country has done its utmost both in regard to <Col N="1735" /> money and personnel in trying to ensure peace in the Congo.  On a proposal like this, we should record in the Dáil Debates our appreciation of the sacrifices that undoubtedly have been made by those soldiers who volunteered to go to the Congo and also express a word of gratitude to the women and children whose loved ones &mdash;fathers or brothers or sons&mdash;were away from them for such a very long time.  It is a welcome proposal by the Minister and the Government that we should continue to try to ensure that not alone will there be peace in the Congo but progress as well.  It is a good thing that we should contribute towards the development of this country and for that reason also we welcome the proposal to provide this subscription from the Irish Government towards the development fund.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also embodied in his proposal a contribution for the training of students and the training of Government and local government personnel from some of the African States in this country.  All of us have seen some of this scheme in operation in the various local authorities.  As far as one can judge, it has been most successful.  Great benefit is accruing, I think, to those who came from Northern Rhodesia particularly in the local authorities, in order to equip themselves with the knowledge and experience essential in the running of the affairs of any country; this knowledge and experience they will be able to apply when they return to Northern Rhodesia.</P>
    <P>I had to leave the House, unfortunately, when the Minister was speaking about the Irish-American Foundation. Again, this is something we applaud.  In the Minister's remarks on the subject, possibly because of necessity, we did not get the full details Deputy Dillon seeks.  I assume, however, that when a satisfactory scheme has been threshed out and the details have been agreed upon, the Minister will make an announcement here.</P>
    <P>Finally, we approve the grant of the money the Minister seeks from the House in this Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse the remarks of the leader of the Labour Party.  There is just one suggestion I should like to make to the Minister.  With regard to the student exchange plan&mdash;I have had experience of this and I consider it a very wonderful scheme &mdash; I would urge on the Minister that students from Northern Ireland should be included in any scheme that is drawn up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and his successors will always, I think, find that funds needed for international co-operation will be readily granted by this House.  These contributions are essential.  They are inevitable.  They are very fitting for a nation of our size and with our proud history.  As the House knows, we have added to the funds in recent years; we have subscribed with blood as an earnest of our international sincerity.</P>
      <P>However troublesome and difficult the Congo experiment may have proved, it was certainly a noble experiment. It may mark the beginning of a new and more intelligent co-operative world.  The fact that Irish lives and Irishmen contributed to that evolution is a matter of deep and heartfelt pride.</P>
      <P>I was particularly interested in the brief reference the Minister made to work that is not sufficiently well known as yet.  I refer to our supplying skilled personnel to the emergent countries and our reception of the nationals of these countries for training here in the machinery of administration.  I refer in particular to those who come, not for university education but for education and training in the ordinary, practical running of a country.  The Northern Rhodesian experiment contains the seed of developments of great importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Kaunda has a peculiarly difficult task before him and if we can help him to overcome the grave difficulties he is facing by providing his public servants with the kind of standards necessary to ensure support and co-operation from the nationals of Northern Rhodesia&mdash; I do not mean the nationals of one race only; the white race in Northern <Col N="1737" /> Rhodesia must learn to accept the position&mdash;we shall be making a unique contribution to world co-operation. The white race must learn that the dominant race, if properly trained, can supply officials worthy of the respect of the white races.  This training, therefore, can be of great value not alone to that country but also to us.</P>
    <P>Our history in this regard is a very good one.  Our struggle for freedom has fitted us in a unique way for this great task.  It gives us an international purpose out of all relation to our size and economic importance.  I regard the matter as the most important one in this Supplementary Estimate.  I am enthusiastic about this development.  I believe it is very important that we should keep the faith and trust of these new nations; indeed, keeping that faith and trust should be a very sacred responsibility. I believe this work and its results will, in time, equal what this country did for the world in the Dark and Early Middle Ages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in a certain difficulty in drafting the opening speech in that, since it was only a Supplementary Estimate, I did not want to make it too long.  I dealt, therefore, principally with the matters that were quite new, such as the Irish-American Foundation, and the Overseas Trainee Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked when the Congo experiment is likely to come to an end and will the special funds for the development there be available to complete the job.  It is very difficult to answer that precisely.  The more one knows of the Congo, the less one is prepared to prophesy when our troops will come home and whether the amount of money necessary to put the Congo properly on its feet will be available.  There is, however, this to be said: the Congo has made remarkable strides.  Perhaps we get an overemphasis here on the unfortunate tragedies that occur from time to time. Our reports are that, in the recent outbreak, the trouble was confined to a very small portion of one of the provinces and Congolese troops, who are now trained, are successfully containing <Col N="1738" /> the outbreak.  The United Nations efforts were confined to rescue work.  Containing the revolutionary forces on the warpath was done by the Congolese forces, who are now better trained than they were a couple of years ago.  Indeed, I hope that training will continue to the point at which they will be able to look after their own affairs, and keep law and order to the extent necessary.</P>
    <P>I agree completely with what Deputy Dillon said about having places in our universities for our own students.  I do not think any of the universities would give places to outsiders, much as they might like to do so, if they had not sufficient accommodation for Irish students.  I would prefer to see young Africans educated to the graduate stage in Africa itself and coming here for post-graduate courses or for actual in-service training.  The most valuable thing we could do for them is to give them in-service training in one or other of our Government Departments, in State companies or even in private companies.  The great need of the newly emerged African States is the sort of experience we can give them here, management and administrative experience.  For a number of years, I have been urging upon these African countries that what they wanted more than money was administrative and management skill and that we were prepared to help them to the greatest possible extent if they called upon us to do it.</P>
    <P>The need for this fund is that we had no moneys available to take care of trainees coming here if the African Governments had not the funds to pay for their keep.  In the Northern Rhodesian situation, it was not possible for the Northern Rhodesians to see their young men through a course here.  It is for that reason I proposed to the Government that we should establish this £50,000 fund to cover the expenses of trainees and enable the Institute of Public Administration to carry on this work.  Pending the receipt of subscriptions from other sources, this £50,000 should enable the Institute to carry on with competence their work of training young men from the developing States.</P>

      <P>Is there any over-all direction of the work in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Government Department charged with doing it is External Affairs, and the Institute of Public Administration is the non-Civil Service agent that is administering the scheme.  It has given these young men a series of lectures before they went to Government Departments and down to certain local government bodies and it is the Institute of Public Administration that handles them on our behalf.</P>
      <P>Coming back to what we can do for Africa, I said I would much prefer that the people we get from Africa would be those of the post-graduate type or people coming to look for administrative experience.  The secondary schools and the universities in most of the young countries in Africa are expanding very rapidly and I should hope that before many years they would be able to train in their own homelands a number of young men and women who will be able to run their countries.  From the point of view of expense alone, I think we should try to give them help in Africa or train post-graduates here to help them to organise their own countries.</P>
      <P>One other aspect of this problem we have tried to help is the provision of Irish civil servants and teachers for these young countries who have requested such help.  As the members of the Dáil may know, for a number of years now, civil servants or teachers who wish to go to Africa for a year or two are guaranteed that their seniority and their pensions will be kept in good standing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish asked about the countries that did not subscribe to the UN and what would happen to them. There is a long list of countries in all parts of the world and some of them will soon have reached the arrears which amount to more than two years' subscription.  It seems to me quite evident that when that time arrives there will be a situation in the United Nations whereby, under the terms of the Charter, those who do not pay or keep themselves below the two years' arrears will lose their vote.  I hope it will not come to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1740" /> In regard to the Irish-American Foundation, I take it the tendency will be to run it more or less on the Fulbright lines, that American students will come here and Irish students will go to America.  However, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Foundation, a copy of which is in the Library, provides that the directors of the Foundation may promote an exchange not only of students between universities and colleges but of professors and may also promote an exchange of musicians, artists and technicians of various kinds.  The Certificate of Incorporation is wide enough to enable the Foundation to do a good job of work.  Its activities will be known and if it were to spend too much money on one activity to the detriment of other activities that should be taken care of, it would be amenable to public criticism. I have every confidence that the men who have so generously burdened themselves with being the first directors of this Foundation will do a good job of work and will try to get a good exchange of students and professors, so that not only will young Irishmen benefit by experience in America but that Americans will benefit and will learn something of the Irish way of life and get to know the Irish people while doing some further study and lecturing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carroll asked whether this Foundation would be confined to the Twenty-Six Counties.  The answer is no.  It is to promote, aid, develop and support cultural, educational, literary and scientific relations between the United States and all parts of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £330,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1964, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and of certain other Services administered <Col N="1741" /> by that Office, and for payment of Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is mainly required to meet (a) unforeseen additional payments for the conveyance of mails; (b) increased telephone development; and (c) an increase in the Grant to the Broadcasting Authority consequent on increases made in radio and television licence fees since the original Estimate was framed.</P>
    <P>Taking the subheads affected in order and giving the main reasons for the excesses, the sum of £66,000 required under Subhead A is the result of additional overtime in the mails and telephone services and of higher social welfare contributions.  Mail traffic, particularly at Christmas, has been heavier than expected and there will of course be a corresponding improvement in revenue.  The overtime on telephones has been partly on the engineering side, and partly on the accounting side where further mechanisation has been introduced to enable the rapidly growing volume of accounts to be more efficiently and economically handled.  On Subhead B, £16,300 is needed to meet the cost of additional travelling and subsistence incurred mainly through the replanning of engineering work to speedup the provision of new trunk circuits throughout the country.  On Subhead D, £96,400 is required because of extra mail traffic by rail and air, changes in the incidence of airmail accounts falling due for payment in the year, and the adoption of a monthly instead of a quarterly payment basis for a large CIE contract, causing two additional monthly payments to become due this year instead of next.</P>
    <P>A further £34,200 is being sought under Subhead E to meet the cost of extra postal vans required for rural services, and also the cost of additional purchases of stores on behalf of other Government Departments.  On Subhead F £109,000 more is required to cover increased purchases of engineering stores to provide for the expanded programme of telephone trunk line construction.  When introducing <Col N="1742" /> the Telephone Capital Bill in November last, I told the House that this year's programme was being revised to give priority to the provision of additional trunk circuits needed for current and future expansion.</P>
    <P>The additional £235,000 being sought under Subhead K. 1 is to enable my Department to pay over to the Broadcasting Authority the extra amount which will be collected in the current financial year as a result of the increase in the broadcasting licence fees as from 1st November, 1963. Figures of actual receipts from licence fees and expenses of collection for the current year will not be available until after the 31st March.  Accordingly the payment to the Authority under Subhead K. 1 will be an estimated figure, and an adjustment will have to be made later when precise figures of net licence receipts are available.</P>
    <P>The new fees of £1 5s. 0d. (sound) and £5 (combined sound and television) were fixed following careful consideration of representations made by the Authority regarding the inadequacy of its revenue.  In 1962/63 the Authority received a subsidy of £150,000 to bridge the gap between sound broadcasting income and expenditure. Only £71,600 of the aggregate subsidies of £500,000 authorised by the Act remained unissued on 31st March, 1963, and this amount was clearly inadequate as costs have been increasing.  The increase of 5s. in the sound licence and in the sound portion of the combined licence will bring in an extra £130,000 in a full year.  This will fall somewhat short of the amount required to cover the present deficit on sound broadcasting. The Authority also wishes to effect some improvements in sound broadcasting and the recently announced decision on a VHF service will increase expenditure by about £50,000 a year.  Under the Act the Authority is required to become self-supporting as soon as possible and the difference between expenditure and receipts attributable to sound broadcasting will therefore have to be made good from the Authority's general revenue.</P>
    <P>The Authority's accounts for the year ending 31st March, 1963, showed <Col N="1743" /> a deficit on television of £17,000.  This was very small in relation to a total expenditure on that service of £1,130,000.  The Authority expected, however, that expenditure would increase faster than income from advertisements and licence fees.  Part of the increase in expenditure is inescapable. For example, expenditure in 1963-64 will be substantially higher than the 1962-63 figure because of the extension of television to the provinces, and the Authority will have to meet higher charges by way of interest and depreciation as its capital construction programme nears completion.  The Authority also desired to improve the present level of programmes.  It was anxious to reduce its dependency on films of American origin and to enlarge the scope of its film purchases; to give greater prominence to drama; to undertake more feature programmes with deeper coverage of the country as a whole; to increase the content of home-produced programmes and to give greater scope to native talent. Finally, it wished to produce more programmes of an educational and instructive nature.</P>
    <P>The increase in the television portion of the combined licence fee has made it possible for the Authority to carry out some, at least, of its plans for improving the programmes.  The higher fee will augment television revenue by about £157,000 in a full year but this figure will increase according as the number of combined licences grows.</P>
    <P>The gross excess of £556,900 on these subheads is expected to be reduced to £330,000 by savings of £26,400 elsewhere and by additional receipts of £200,500 from Appropriations-in-Aid under Subhead T.  These consist of £115,000 from Telephone Capital funds as a consequence of the expanded development programme; £25,500 from the Social Insurance Fund mainly in respect of higher staff costs; £40,000 from increased issues of stores to other Government Departments on a repayment basis; and £20,000 from miscellaneous repayable services which have yielded more than expected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1744" /> Excluding the £235,000 in respect of the Broadcasting grant-in-aid, the balance of £95,000 represents less than one per cent of the original net Estimate of £12.4 million approximately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House have no objection to the Minister getting this money to carry on these services to the end of the year. There are a few points I should like to raise and one has to do with the provision of telephones.  I know the Minister did mention that he proposed to devote more time and money to the development of trunk service but, at the same time, we thought that people who have been waiting for telephones would be able to get them in a reasonable time.  Up to the present that has not been the case.</P>
      <P>I applied for a telephone for a man who had just been appointed as a cattle exporter, a very important position in this country, but when I made an application on his behalf, I was told that he could not get any priority whatever, that all priorities were reserved for doctors and veterinary surgeons.  I know that the line would have to be brought from his dwelling back to the sub-post office but I thought my case was a reasonable one.  However, I did not get anywhere. As we have not refused the money to the Minister for the development of telephones, we are entitled to get a better service.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made provision for increased overtime and increased social welfare contributions to the amount of £66,000.  He has made no provision for the increases that will come with the ninth round up to 31st March.  That will be a substantial amount and there is no provision for it.  Neither has he made any provision for increases to the subpostmasters. We thought that after the recent strike, which lasted a long time, the Minister would have got down to some reasonable form of arbitration with the subpostmasters.</P>

      <P>I am wondering why these items have not been put into the Estimate.  The broadcasting service was under discussion last week in connection with the increase in the funds for capital development and there is no use in going over the matters raised then on this Estimate.  I think the television service is much improved in recent times.  The local programmes are welcomed by the people who are delighted to see something to do with their own part of the country.  I hope that development will be extended in the coming year and that the people will get a good local service and fewer canned programmes.</P>

      <P>We in the Labour Party have no objection to the Minister being provided with the money he is seeking but we wonder if there is likely to be a further Supplementary Estimate or in what way the Minister proposes to deal with the ninth round of wage increases.  Unless it is not proposed to pay the increase until after the new financial year has opened, which is unthinkable, the money must be found somewhere.  There has been agreement with the Civil Service that 1st February will be the operative date and I am surprised that the Minister has not taken the opportunity of including the amount in the Estimate.</P>

      <P>The Minister will forgive me for trying to discuss the matter under various subheads.  On this matter of the carriage and conveyance of mails, some years ago we were told that this was going to be a revolutionary thing.  Some of us did not think it would improve matters.  Has the Minister now discovered that the new method is no faster and no cheaper? I am asking a question and I should like the Minister to comment on it. This is a matter on which many people have very decided views.  A large number of people objected to the alteration in the system and now it would seem that they were right and the Minister was wrong.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Minister give me any idea as to when the embargo on phones for private people will be removed?  He has stated that until enough trunk lines have been provided, there was no use in putting in additional phones.  However, there was a large number of applications from people before the embargo went on and it is strange that the Minister cannot do anything for people who have been waiting for phones from three years to seven years.  It is embarrassing that these people can point out to other people who were able to get connection just by making an application. Some of them told me that they had to wait only three weeks while <Col N="1747" /> people in the same circumstances had to wait up to seven years.  Will the Minister say if that position is to be improved?</P>
    <P>I should like to know if there will be a contra item shown in the new budgetary proposals regarding this question of increased licence fees. There is an estimated amount to be given to the Broadcasting Authority by the Post Office to cover the increased licence fee.  That sum must come to the Post Office eventually because the Post Office is not making a present of anything to the Broadcasting Authority.</P>

      <P>It took about three minutes of Post Office officials' time to collect £5 from me.  I do not know what those three minutes were worth to the Post Office.  The Minister may explain it at a later stage.</P>
      <P>On the question of programmes, I consider it a good idea to have the accent on the home programmes.  I referred the Minister to one matter which I hope he has followed up.  I would suggest that the sporting programmes which, in fact, are admirably suited to TV, as any of us who have time to look at them know, are a very good way of filling in local programmes and in a relatively cheap way.  I referred the other night to the GAA.  The GAA games should get more prominence than they are getting. The fact that they are being supplied at practically nominal cost to the Authority should be borne in mind when we talk about improving local programmes.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into the question of the type of programme I have in mind, apart from that, but I would say that we have had a number of programmes of Irish songs, dancing and music on TV and they are really excellent.  We should all be gratified by the amount of new talent appearing throughout the country as a result of these programmes.  The Minister will agree with me that in Meath two very outstanding young artistes have been produced as a result of these programmes. I shall not stray any further along that line.</P>
      <P>Another reference, which again appears to be rather on the fringe, that I want to make is to the question of subpostmasters.  I should like to know whether or not it is proposed to introduce another Supplementary Estimate in respect of subpostmasters.  If not, we are again going to have an awful lot of trouble with these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to say a word about the telephone content of <Col N="1749" /> this Supplementary Estimate.  I would ask the Minister to be frank with the public now before the beginning of the summer.  Are we going to have the same chaos in relation to trunk lines as we had last summer?  If we are going to have the same overloading this summer, will the Minister be frank with the people and tell them that they must expect it, the periods in which they must expect it and the times at which they must expect it, and tell us frankly that such an hour is an off-peak hour and that callers should try to put back their calls to the off-peak hour if they possibly can?  There are many calls that could be deferred to an off-peak time if one knew what that time was but there is nothing more exasperating than being unable to get accurate information in relation to trunk call delays.</P>
      <P>If one rings up, one is sometimes told there is a half-hour delay.  I have often, as a test, immediately put down the receiver and dialled 10 again, got a different operator and got through straight away.  Both cannot be right. Either the second operator was giving me a priority to which I had no right&mdash; and there was no reason on earth why he or she should&mdash;or the first operator was merely saying there was a half-hour delay for the purpose of getting shut of the inquiry.  It is quite understandable if one is told that all the trunk lines are busy at the moment but that there will be a trunk line free in a minute or in ten minutes.  I want the Minister to be frank with us on this.  I think there is a standard instruction to operators that when they cannot get a trunk line at once, they are to say that there will be a half-hour delay.  That is not a frank way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be better, perhaps, if I left this until the main Estimate but the Minister might like to make some remarks now on the progress in relation to the automatic changeover.  In relation to the subscriber trunk-dialling system, there is, again, a lack of frankness by the Minister with the public.  The position should be explained. It might cost a little money to do it in terms of advertisements or in terms of an explanatory leaflet going <Col N="1750" /> out to subscribers with their accounts, telling them frankly the cause of the various queer noises one gets when one tries to dial the trunk circuits.  It might help us, particularly peppery people like myself, to keep a more equable temperament on the subject.  I do not know why, when one starts to dialling Kildare, one gets a blow-up on dialling the 0 or why sometimes one gets as far as dialling the 4 and sometimes succeeds in dialling the complete number and gets no tone of any sort, quite regularly, on the system of exchanges that ring around 045.  If there were greater education of the public in relation to the difficulties by a frank statement by the Minister, it would be much easier for the public to appreciate and understand them and it would probably mean easier working for the telephone staffs if the public knew what they were at.</P>
    <P>I think there is hidden away in this Estimate a reference to the Telephone Directory and I want to make a suggestion to the Minister in relation to it which I have made before.  I do not know whether I can make it now or not.  The Telephone Directory is divided into three parts&mdash;Dublin city and county, the rest of the country and subscribers lately connected.  The part devoted to subscribers lately connected is not up to date and cannot be up to date in the nature of things because the Directory goes to print somewhere about mid-August.  It has now got to the stage that no matter how well the Directory is bound, the size of the volume makes it difficult to last a full year.  Would it not be far better to divide the Directory into two issues, to publish one in April for Dublin city and county, one in October for the rest of the country and have at the back of each issue the subscribers lately connected?  In consequence, there would be a very much more up to date Telephone Directory.  There would be exactly the same situation as we have at present: the issue proper would be a year old but you would have the supplementary issue of additions only six months old, which would help a great deal and would remove much of the loading on Directory Enquiries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1751" /> I should like the Minister to do as Deputy Tully suggested and say categorically now when he will have the trunk line installation finished from the engineering point of view and when he will be able, in consequence, to resume installation of private lines. The Minister, if the correspondence I get is any indication, must be damned with letters from people outraged because they have not got the telephone for what appear to them, with every justification, to be purposes of great urgency, after waiting a long time.  This is not the time and the place to discuss priorities but we might not have the main Estimate for two or three months and it would help, before getting into the peak period in the summer, if we knew more or less what we may expect and what the ordinary telephone user can do either by deferring his calls or taking them in advance, in the early morning, to avoid peak times.</P>
    <P>Many people would be prepared to cooperate in that respect if they got an indication of how they could do it. Last year in the chaos&mdash;that is the only word I can use for the situation then&mdash;there was no indication from the Minister and as a result one did not know whether one was likely to incur greater difficulty at 11 o'clock or at 7 o'clock and people were completely at sea.  An indication would help everyone, not least those like myself who become quite peppery when you keep on ringing and get no reply or have to make half a dozen shots before getting any answer on an ordinary STD call.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  There were certain claims in the Minister's statement <Col N="1753" /> with all of which we do not agree.  I agree that Telefís Éireann is providing a good service. It has been the object of many brickbats and it is no harm to be critical, but I am satisfied from what I can glean that it provides a worthwhile programme for those who can watch it.  Members of this House may be authorities on the mail system and may have plenty of experience of telephone operation but the nature of their duties as public representatives does not make them conversant personally with the content of television programmes.  Still, our constituents wish to be satisfied with the service for which they are paying more than was originally expected.</P>
      <P>The Minister has at his command additional finances which he got by virtue of increased payments by licence-holders for both sound and television and it is natural that the people should come to their public representatives and express views about the return they are getting for their investment in licences.  Again it is our duty to expose any complaints brought forward. Included in the Estimate is provision for the expenses incurred by Telefís Éireann in televising many programmes outside Montrose and I want to know from the Minister what occurred to one particular programme. No doubt some expense was incurred and the House is being asked to vote moneys to cover such programmes.</P>
      <P>What happened the televising of the Commemoration ceremonies at Béal na mBláth last year.  It would be interesting to know what happened this recording.  There are very strong rumours that something queer occurred.  I am not charging anybody in authority in Telefís Éireann with having deliberately omitted this programme but it would be well to clear the air because there are many rumours current about the disappearance of this recording.  Those who pay licence fees and the taxpayers invested in the expenses incurred in making this record and it is a disturbing matter to many people, particularly in Cork city and county and I am sure throughout the country, that the ceremony was filmed but was not projected on the television screen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1754" /> We have pretty faithful reporting of many events throughout the country but again there are occasions on which inexplicable errors are committed.  We had the remarkable occasion before Christmas when a ceremony was televised at which the Taoiseach was presented and immediately after him we had Deputy P.J. Burke of County Dublin presented as the Tánaiste.  The Tánaiste does not suffer very much from humility and I was rather surprised&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the question of size entered into it, but the presentation of a particular Deputy as Tánaiste was a pretty formidable error on the part of whoever was responsible.</P>
      <P>In regard to sound radio, I was one of the first to appeal on the main Estimate for more frequent news summaries and I want to express pleasure at the way this appeal was responded to by whoever is responsible.  Shorter and more frequent newscasts appear to be the order of the day.</P>
      <P>I want to inquire whether the Supplementary Estimate contains money intended to meet the demands of the subpostmasters.  This situation cannot be allowed to continue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is understandable that a certain amount of difficulty and confusion should be created by the rearrangement of mail collections in an effort to speed up particular services, nevertheless confusion still exists in relation to the extreme changes that were affected.  I want to know if there is any suitable directory available from which people may get information regarding such changes.  We have had townlands <Col N="1755" /> divided not among two post offices but in some cases among three.  While there may be a logical explanation regarding better services, it is still confusing to very many people.</P>
      <P>The public were very satisfied with the announcement that educational programmes were to be launched on Telefís Éireann but I want to ask why there were not adequate preliminary consultations with teachers' representatives before the announcement was made.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Sweetman, I am concerned about the service provided by the Department in regard to telephone inquiries.  I was amazed to hear from one of my constituents, who was aware that a relative was staying at a particular guesthouse, the address of which he knew, but did not know the surname of the proprietor, that when he wanted to telephone this person urgently, he was informed by Directory Inquiries that a street directory was not provided for those in the inquiry section.  A few months ago, I had the experience in the United States of being able to ring up anybody without having the phone number: by providing the name and address, the telephone number was produced in a matter of minutes.  If that can be done in a country where millions of people have telephones, surely we could improve our service.  I should be grateful if the Minister could answer my questions, even at such short notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister on page two of his brief says that the money which he is now seeking from the House is to be used to provide additional trunk circuits.  That in itself is a welcome development but can the Minister give any indication or any hope to those people who have been waiting so long for telephones that the waiting period will be reduced to any extent?  I have been asked frequently to intercede with the Minister or his Department to get telephones for people, especially people in rural areas. Inevitably the reply is that there is no possibility of providing a telephone in the near future and that it will be quite a long time before it will be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On occasions the Minister has said <Col N="1756" /> that he cannot get enough engineers or technicians to do the work and on other occasions he has said that the equipment is not available.  I have no reason to believe or disbelieve the Minister but it is ludicrous to say that in the year 1964 people have to wait for years to obtain telephones.  That is not an exaggeration.  Everybody has not got to wait so long but there are people who have been waiting for years to get telephones.  Surely such a situation should not be tolerated unless the reason is valid and the Minister cannot get engineers or equipment.</P>
    <P>We are doing all sorts of things in this country.  We are going to purchase supersonic jets.  Yet people cannot communicate with each other. Those who are living six or seven miles outside provincial towns are told they will have to wait a considerable time before getting telephones.  I had occasion to ask for a telephone to be installed in the premises of a chemist but it could not be done.  Surely we should give priority to a man who closes shop at six o'clock but who guarantees a 24-hour service every day.  If this man is to engage in his business, every effort should be made to provide him with a telephone, not only for his own sake but for the sake of those relying on him to fill prescriptions. The Minister must be aware that there is grave dissatisfaction with the long periods people have to wait for telephones.  While saying that, everybody appreciates the Minister's difficulty but a greater effort should be made to ensure that telephones will be supplied within three or four months.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister on page three has acknowledged that some of the criticisms of Telefís Éireann have been justified.  He says that the Authority desires to improve the present level of programmes and that it was anxious to reduce its dependency on films of American origin.  Deputies from both sides have criticised them for the fifth-rate films they have been importing since they were established. If this is going to mean that they will cut down on the number of out-dated American films they get, the money <Col N="1757" /> will be well spent.  If he can, the Minister should enlarge on those seven or eight lines.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the television Authority are much too sensitive about criticism.  Criticism is healthy, but criticism from members of Parliament does not seem to be tolerated. Every television critic and newspaper can criticise Telefís Éireann and people can write to the newspapers, particularly to the <i>Evening Press</i> and the <i>Evening Herald</i> about television programmes and nobody seems to take exception.  The Press regard it as healthy public discussion but when anybody in this House criticises Telefís Éireann, the Authority and those in charge and the Minister and the people in his Department throw up their hands and say we should not bring politics into Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>When we talk about Telefís Éireann, we do not want to appear in the role of politicians; we are speaking as viewers or as fathers, as ordinary individuals who look at Telefís Éireann and we genuinely try to give the point of view of people we represent.  These are not people who can take up the telephone and tell Telefís Éireann what they think of this or that programme. The people I represent do not want to rush into print or write to newspapers or the Minister.  While I exonerate the Minister of responsibility for programmes that appear on Telefís Éireann, occasions like this should be used to express honest criticism of the Authority both in regard to television and sound broadcasting.</P>
    <P>It is, as I say, encouraging to know that the Authority are trying to reduce their dependence on films of American origin and to enlarge the scope of their film purchases.  Perhaps the Minister would expand on that.  Does this mean British films or Canadian films&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Other films from various places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very welcome. &ldquo;Give greater prominence to drama&rdquo;&mdash;everybody would agree with that. &ldquo;To undertake more feature programmes with deeper coverage of the country as a whole&rdquo;&mdash;and God save us <Col N="1758" /> from &ldquo;Location.&rdquo;&ldquo;To increase the content of home produced programmes and to give greater scope to native talent.&rdquo;  If money is spent in that direction, it will be worthwhile.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Minister says that the Authority wished to produce more programmes of an educational and instructive nature.  I do not know whether the Minister can answer this or not, but I am told that the people who appear on educational programmes, giving lectures, demonstrations, and so on, are pretty badly paid. I cannot mention the figure, but I know that some people who appear on Telefís Éireann who do not open their mouths, who confine themselves to performing some menial actions, are paid extremely well.  To a certain extent, of course, it is good advertising for them in the promotion of their careers, but I think the Minister ought to inquire as to what fees are paid to those who are doing such an important job on the educational programmes.  We appreciate that these programmes have started only in the past few weeks, but they can be of tremendous value to schools, colleges, convents, etc.  They may, however, fall down if we regard them as fifth or sixth rate features because of paying such small fees.  I make no specific allegation.  I said, deirtear liom, that is the situation.  Perhaps the Minister and his officials will inquire into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to programmes generally, there is a dearth of music.  The Minister may say, and quite rightly, that music is the prerogative of sound broadcasting.  That is true, but there is practically no music at all on Telefís Éireann.  Any there is is of the &ldquo;pop&rdquo; or, shall I say, &ldquo;Beatle&rdquo; type. Some time ago, the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra gave excellent performances on Sunday night.  We have dancing contests with dance music of the Forties, which may be nostalgic for many of us, but, apart from that, there is just no music.  Some may say there is room for both, sound broadcasting and television.  I do not care what anyone says, but sound broadcasting will eventually go out and television will be the medium of communication.  I think Telefís <Col N="1759" /> Éireann ought to try to get more reasonably good music into its programmes; otherwise, it will fail to provide for many people who want to listen to good music.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Judging by the discussions so far, at any rate, the ninth round of wage increases is not included in this Supplementary Estimate and we must, therefore, regard this Estimate as incomplete.</P>
      <P>The question of rural telephones is a hardy annual here.  I, too, have my list of complaints about delay in installation. I rather imagine this situation will obtain this year, next year, and the year after.  It will be a problem always with us.  That does not mean, however, that we are not entitled, indeed obliged, to keep pressing the Minister on every possible occasion and encouraging him to keep, in turn, pressing his officials to work to maximum capacity for the purpose of speeding up the installation of telephones in rural areas.  These telephones will, in time, pay a dividend. This is a worthwhile commercial expenditure and we are, I think, justified in raising the matter again and again, even though it may prove boringly repetitive.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to increased expenditure on overtime in connection with mails, telephones and accountancy. We have something in the region of 60,000 unemployed and I should like to know from the Minister if any effort is made, when the question of overtime arises, to recruit suitable personnel from these 60,000 unemployed, thereby keeping down overtime costs.  It is understandable that the officials naturally like to corner a bit of overtime for themselves, but I think the Minister should be at pains to make work of a non-specialist nature available for suitable unemployed personnel; the unemployed should be drafted in to do the work during peak periods.  I do not know whether he has examined into that aspect.  If he has not, I would exhort him to do so.  I should like to hear what he has to say about it when he comes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1760" /> I find it difficult to understand the increased costings in regard to accountancy, in view of the Minister's statement here.  Perhaps I have misinterpreted him.  He says that overtime on telephones has been partly on the engineering side and partly on the accounting side, where further mechanisation has been introduced to enable the rapidly growing volume of accounts to be efficiently and economically handled.  In one breath, he speaks of increased mechanisation to cope with the work and, in the next, he is asking for more money to enable him to cope with it.  It is difficult to reconcile these two statements.  Perhaps the innovations have not yet begun to fructify.</P>
    <P>There are increased travelling expenses in connection with the installation of telephones.  Yet, we are complaining of delay in the installation of these telephones.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Increased money is to be provided in order to increase the content of home-produced programmes on television and give greater scope to native talent. I think the Minister will have universal support for that principle.  If, however, we try to improve our programmes by introducing more native talent, surely we are entitled then to expect improved <Col N="1761" /> performances from the personnel of Telefís Éireann.  I have occasionally watched very poor performances on Telefís Éireann.  I remember occasions when one could hardly see the performance except through a smokescreen thrown up by a monosyllabic cigarette-smoking female employed by Telefís Éireann, dominating the scene completely. Apart from public health considerations altogether, does the Minister consider it quite proper to have officials of Telefís Éireann coming on the screen, puffing cigarette smoke into the faces so to speak, of viewers? Carrying it a bit further, may I ask does he consider the excessive use of Christian names and the atmosphere of over-familiarity it engenders is conducive to a proper presentation in Telefís Éireann?  Admittedly, it is very homely but if we carry that atmosphere around with us, I shall start addressing the Minister as &ldquo;Michael&rdquo; and the Ceann Comhairle will call me to order immediately.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to attend to these two points: cigarette-smoking and the &ldquo;Hello, Mick&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hello, Jack&rdquo; atmosphere which is prevalent in Telefís Éireann.  It is hard to expect that we can be completely satisfied that the £157,000 extra which the Minister is getting in licence fees for a year will be returned in full value in the educational, cultural and entertainment spheres if this atmosphere of over-familiarity, this atmosphere of parlour games and buffoonery is allowed to continue in Telefís Éireann.</P>

      <P>Last year I issued a statement which I thought was a complete exposition of the telephone situation and, in introducing the Telephone Capital Bill recently, I explained at great length to the House and to the country the position that confronted me in relation to the telephone network when I accepted this office of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I then pointed out to the House that since I became Minister, I had taken all steps open to me to improve the position and to secure the necessary capital money to enable a complete reconstruction of the telephone network <Col N="1762" /> to be carried out by the Engineering Branch of the Department.</P>
      <P>It is impossible for me to deal with complaints in relation to individual cases that have been raised by Deputies in regard to the installation of telephones. It is also a very difficult matter in the situation that exists at the moment and has existed for a long number of years past, to depart from a priority list in relation to the installation of telephones.  I have gone to great lengths to explain to the people and to the members of this House the steps the Department are taking to carry out this colossal job of development. No effort is being spared by the Department to increase the technical staff available to it and to increase the intake of university graduate engineers for this work.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish said I offered various explanations in relation to the chaotic conditions that existed last summer in this service.  It all depends upon the time at which the statement was made. I explained to the House on many occasions that orders for telephone equipment cannot be filled overnight. The equipment must be designed. What is needed must be specified and the contract must be placed.  All of these contracts are placed abroad. Sweden, Germany, Britain and the United States supply this country with telephone equipment.</P>
      <P>There is a long delay between the date of ordering the equipment and the date of its delivery.  It may be one or two years, and in some cases three years, before delivery is secured.  We are in the market in competition with other administrations who need this equipment.  Many of them are in much the same position as we are in ourselves in relation to telephone services; the demand has exceeded all expectations.  The demand here has exceeded all expectations.  That demand has been created by increased productivity, the buoyancy of the economy, and by an increase in business and manufacturing activity within the State over the past five years.  The public are becoming more educated in relation to the cheap service the telephone system can provide for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no time, since I became <Col N="1763" /> Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, when there was no delay in obtaining delivery of this equipment.  At the same time, we were building up the technical force.  The technical force at the disposal of the Department is now 50 per cent greater than it was in 1960.  I am speaking off the cuff but I think that is right.  These people cannot be trained overnight.</P>
    <P>In relation to the overtime that is being worked on the engineering side, may I point out to Deputy Hogan, who wanted to know why we do not take in other people instead of working overtime, that the people engaged in this work are trained personnel.  They cannot be found in the street or at the labour exchange.  They must be brought in as youths or intelligent men who can be trained to this kind of work, who have the gift of using their hands and becoming efficient in this work in a short space of time.  That is what the engineering branch are doing in this regard.</P>
    <P>As a result of the steps I took in 1960 to secure the authority of the Government to seek the approval of the Oireachtas for the expenditure of £10 million there is now a steady rhythm in the delivery of equipment to this country from the manufacturers and we hope that, unless something of an untoward nature occurs, that equipment will keep coming into the country and that we shall be in a position to use it expeditiously in order to overtake the colossal arrears of work that have accrued over the years.</P>
    <P>There is not any ban on the installation of telephones.  It is a mistaken idea for any Deputy to think that I announced a ban on such installations. They are being installed at a steady rate throughout the country.  I shall not have the full figure for the year ending 31st March until after 31st March but the rate of installation this year is very slightly less than the rate of installation last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they are all over the country.  It is working in this way. <Col N="1764" /> I made a decision this year that, in telephone exchange areas where this essential trunk work had to be done first, no telephone would be installed until that work was completed but, in areas where we have the necessary network to carry the traffic, telephones are being installed.</P>
      <P>It is the practice of the Department to instal the telephones area by area. They deal with a whole area at a time and clear all the applications made within a telephone exchange area, except those involving very heavy construction work.  That means that people who are waiting maybe two years are connected and people who applied only three months previously are also connected at the same time. It is the most economical way in which the telephones can be installed.</P>
      <P>I do not think I could under any circumstances accept the responsibility of instructing the Telephones Branch or the Engineering Branch to go here, there and everywhere else all over the country in an effort to connect a single telephone.  It is such a diversified job that it would be a complete waste of engineering time to take on the installation of telephones on that class of a system.  There is no use in my telling the House or in being anything but frank in relation to this matter.  We are not in a position to meet the demand until the back is broken in the arrears of trunk work.  That work must be completed before we can seriously take on the job of increasing the installation of telephones and I would say that that will take at least another two years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody in this country is making it.  We buy some minor items of equipment from a couple of firms <Col N="1765" /> here but generally the equipment we need is all manufactured abroad.  It has been my policy and that of previous Ministers, I think, to try to conserve as far as possible the capital moneys made available for telephone development. In so doing, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is forced into the position of denying the person who lives over a certain distance from an exchange a telephone for a long period of time.</P>
      <P>The long-line cases, as they are called are deferred: that has been the practice in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for a number of years past.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with the decision which I took this year in relation to the provision of the trunk network first.  It is a separate matter.  It has been my policy to defer these long-line cases in order to conserve the capital available to me-and the same applied to former Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs for a long period.  They wished to make the greatest possible general use of the capital moneys provided by this House for the purpose of telephone development. Capital moneys are got from the yearly capital formation.  Unless the formation is there, the capital moneys cannot be advanced to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for this most essential work.</P>
      <P>There is no harm in my reminding the House again that in this decade the State will invest £40 million in telephone development.  I cannot in any circumstances push the installation of this work at any faster rate.  I have, of course, decided that we shall put as much of this work to contract as we possibly can.  If we can get private contractors to contract for work of this nature we shall avail of their services to speed up the work but, in the main, it will have to be carried out by the Engineering Branch of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as making predictions in regard to what the traffic position will be next summer, I would not wish to enter into that field.  It all depends on the amount of traffic that will offer on the exchanges.  It is very difficult to estimate the amount of traffic that will <Col N="1766" /> offer in any particular week, even a week in advance, or in any particular day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman asked me to give an assurance that during the summer months ahead the situation will not be as bad as it was last summer.  I think the standard of the telephone service at the moment is as good as ever it was.  I could not under any circumstances make a forecast as to what it will be like in the summer unless I had some indication of the amount of traffic that would offer.  I am of the opinion that as a result of the work carried out since we got in equipment we were waiting for, and which arrived about the middle of last summer&mdash;the increase in the trunk circuits and the outlets from the various exchanges and the increase in the outlets from the central exchange here in Dublin&mdash;we shall be able to handle more traffic more efficiently than we handled it last summer.  But then we would have to assume that a greater volume of traffic would not be offering.</P>
    <P>There may be a steep increase in the volume of traffic offering in this country next summer.  I have no objection whatsoever to considering the the matter and to giving consideration to the issue periodically of statements from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs setting out what the prospects might be a short period of time in advance.  I shall have the suggestions made by Deputy Sweetman in relation to giving the public notice of peak hours and the other suggestions he made in that regard examined fully by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. If we think it will be of material benefit to the users of telephones, I shall see that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will make announcements periodically during the summer months in relation to the question of telephone traffic.</P>
    <P>It is no pleasure to me to know that the telephone situation last year was chaotic.  It was chaotic and I knew it to be so, but there was absolutely nothing I could do about it.  The traffic was such that the network was not able to take it.  It is a mechanical <Col N="1767" /> business that I could not possibly be expected to remedy in such a short period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I admitted it at all times.  If the Deputy reads my statements on the introduction of my Estimate in any of the years since I became Minister, he will find I made reference to the fact that we were lagging behind, that we had colossal arrears of work, that we were not in a position to carry the traffic offering. Over the years, I have made several efforts to induce the Government to invest greater sums of money in this business.</P>
      <P>I was asked about the ninth round of wage and salary increases.  This is a Supplementary Estimate dealing with specific matters listed here under various subheads.  It deals with moneys that fall due for payment up to 31st March next, and that only.  In so far as the pay of the Civil Service is concerned, that is a matter primarily for the Minister for Finance.  As Deputies will know, the policy followed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for a number of years past has been that the Department must pay its way and any increase in costs must be taken into consideration in regard to the charges the public have to meet for the services the Post Office renders to them.</P>
      <P>Deputies can accordingly take it for granted that with a steep rise in wage and salary scales, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, when introducing his main Estimate for next year, or perhaps before that, will have to tell the House what the increased charges will be to the people in order to recover the moneys that will fall due for the payment of increased wages and salaries so that the revenue accounts of the Post Office will balance at the end of the year and show a small profit.</P>

We cannot control the terms at which Post Office authorities in other countries demand payment.  The balance is due to a change in the manner of paying a CIE contract. There will be two extra months' payments this year.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan also asked about the townlands in the different postal areas.  We have no directory of addresses, or any other published document, showing how the townlands are allocated, but information can be obtained in this respect from the head postmaster of the area concerned.

      <P>Deputy Corish asked what additional programmes there would be.  I must tell the House that the educational programmes are a matter for settlement between the Minister for Education and the Broadcasting Authority.  They are the responsibility of the Minister for Education and any question relating to payments to persons engaged in these programmes is a matter for him.  It is for him to answer such questions.  I do not know how their salaries and allowances compare with others in the service.</P>
      <P>The question of television programmes generally has been raised by many Deputies and there were suggestions in relation to particular programmes. All these suggestions will be passed on to the Broadcasting Authority. It is not true to say that nobody pays any heed to what Deputies say in relation to Radio Éireann programmes, generally, through both media.  I take a deep interest in what Deputies say in relation to television programmes.  The Authority do also, but the Authority have to make up their minds as to how they should conduct their business.</P>
      <P>I do not interfere in the ordinary day to day matters of television programming. I have an overriding responsibility in relation to the type of programme the Authority broadcast. I have to see that they do not overstep their responsibility in regard to the standards we hope the Authority will maintain.  Beyond that, as I have already said, I do not interfere in the day to day arrangement of programmes or in the setting up of any programme or how it is conducted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many ways of putting across a live television programme.  I think that the programmes where people are relaxed and so on are the best programmes.  It might not seem proper to have people smoking and being over-familiar in addressing one another, but there are people who like <Col N="1770" /> that sort of thing.  The Authority, by and large, are doing a fair good job in relation to home-produced discussion programmes.  At times, of course, people are not too pleased with what is said about themselves, but we all have to take it.  We are here as public representatives.  Anybody who stands for election or who is engaged in politics must learn to take it.</P>

    <P>The need for the Estimate in each case arises primarily from the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1963, which increased various rates of insurance benefits with effect from the beginning of January, 1964, and various rates of assistance payments as from the beginning of November, 1963, and also affected other improvements in both the insurance and the assistance services.</P>
    <P>The additional sum of £875,000 required for the Social Insurance Vote for 1963-64 is the net result of an estimated excess of £880,000 on the original Subhead A provision, offset by a small saving of £5,000 on Subhead B.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, Subhead A of the Social Insurance Vote provides for payment by the Exchequer into the Social Insurance Fund of the estimated amount by which the expenditure of the Fund will exceed its income in any year.  The amount now estimated for <Col N="1772" /> 1963-64 is £8,862,000, an increase of £880,000 on the original provision of £7,982,000, for the year.</P>
    <P>The cost of the increases in rates of benefit and other improvements is estimated at £662,500 in the quarter ending 31st March, 1964, the figures for individual services being as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Other increases in expenditure in 1963-64, attributable mainly to an upward trend in the numbers of claimants and an increase in average duration of disability claims, are estimated to require additional provision in the current year amounting to a net sum of £831,000, of which disability benefit accounts for £590,000.</P>
    <P>Taking into account an increase of £36,000 in administration costs, the total additional expenditure to be provided for in the current year accordingly amounts to £1,529,500.  This is offset, however, by an estimated net surplus of £522,000 on the income side. The principal single item in this surplus is an expected increase of £425,000 in employment contributions, of which £300,000 is attributable to the increase in the contribution rates which took effect from 6th January, 1964, and the balance is due to favourable trends in the employment position generally.</P>
    <P>There is a further offset of £127,500 representing the amount overdrawn by the Social Insurance Fund from the Exchequer in 1962-63.  The net supplementary provision required for Subhead.  A is therefore £880,000. Taking into account the saving of £5,000 on Subhead B, the total Supplementary Estimate for Social Insurance becomes £875,000.</P>
    <P>As regards Social Assistance, the additional sum required for 1963-64 is estimated at £1,651,000.  This is the net <Col N="1773" /> figure resulting from increases on Subheads A, B, C and D totalling £1,674,000 onset by savings on other Subheads amounting to £23,000.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1963, increased the rates of old age and blind pensions, widows' non-contributory pensions and unemployment assistance from the first week of November, 1963, extended the children's allowances scheme to families with one qualified child and increased the rates for the third and each subsequent child and effected other improvements in the assistance services.</P>
    <P>The cost of these increases and improvements in the current year is estimated at £1,687,000 made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>This total needs to be adjusted in the light of other factors.  In the case of old age pensions and widows' non-contributory pensions, there are savings, estimated at £102,000, on the original provision due to a slight decrease in the expected number of pensioners, while there are estimated excesses amounting to £89,000 on the original provisions for children's allowances and unemployment assistance because of an upward trend in the number of recipients.  Minor savings on other subheads amount to £23,000.  The effect of these adjustments is that the net additional sum required for Social Assistance is £1,651,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We commend to the House the adoption of the Supplementary Estimates for Social Insurance and Social Assistance as the necessity for providing this section of the community with the benefits the State has decided are necessary to meet the obligations of the day is only too apparent to all Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the presentation of the Estimates under the Minister's responsibility, <Col N="1774" /> I wonder if he has considered the report of the Committee on Public Accounts just published where, in paragraph 38, they recommend to the Minister that, because there is such a close link between the services provided under these Votes&mdash;Social Welfare, Social Insurance and Social Assistance&mdash;they should be combined? They consider that there would be no diminution of financial control by such a combination.  We have streamlined some of our Estimates in an effort more expeditiously to dispose of Parliamentary business and also to provide for more clear discussion on the Departments of the various Ministers.</P>
    <P>I should like to know the Minister's reaction to this important recommendation by such an important body. Rarely does this Committee give advice to any Government or Minister which has not been fully and comprehensively considered by the members in conjunction with the officers of the various Departments before being arrived at.  It would be well if the Minister would give an indication of his reactions to this particular recommendation as I am sure sufficient time has elapsed since he received it for him to arrive at some decision.</P>
    <P>I note that in this Supplementary Estimate we have a sum of £36,000 for increases in administrative costs.  To our knowledge, there has been a laying off of personnel in the rural parts of the country under the authority of the Minister.  Surely the reason for dispensing with such posts was the economic reason and consequently one would expect that there should be some saving on the administrative side.  If we have an expansion in the costs of administration, one can assume that the officers of the Minister's Department will respond to the admonitions so frequently given by the Minister's leader to those in private concerns relative to giving some suitable reward for work done.</P>
    <P>My experience has been that never has it been so difficult to obtain a decision from the Department of Social Welfare.  I have been a member of this House for about 15 years and I cannot recall any year in that time when it <Col N="1775" /> took longer for the Minister's Department to arrive at a decision.  That is taking into account the fact that it is now a separate Ministry.  For many years, the Minister responsible for the Department of Social Welfare was also responsible for another important Department.  This Minister is responsible only for the Department of Social Welfare and yet the number of instances in which people cannot receive a reply from the Department at all is appalling.</P>
    <P>When people do make representations to the Department, as they are entitled to do, these appalling delays occur.  I know instances where cases under appeal were solved by a far greater power than any exercised by the humble members of this House, where people have been called to their eternal reward within the protracted period of re-examination.  It would be well if we had an allaying of the public disquiet which is evidenced by many of the letters recently written to the newspapers about the long delays in these matters.  As Deputies, we are inundated with letters and complaints about these delays.  I should like to get from the Minister some explanation of the delays and some indication that they will be rectified very soon.  We are dealing with a class of people to whom Providence will not give the time to wait for a decision.  It is a matter of grievous concern to these people whose benefits are withheld pending these decisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises under the heading of £36,000 for additional costs in administration.  At this time, the Minister is participating with his colleagues in the preparation of proposals for the improvement of the lot of the many people dependent on the activities of his Department.  I wish to make a plea for the inclusion of a class who are at present in a pitiable plight due to the fall in the value of money and the increase in the cost of living&mdash;spinsters of 65 years of age who have no other means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> If we persist in levying taxation on all the necessaries of life, we should return to these people at least sufficient to enable them to combat the increase in the cost of living.  I want to know whether it has been brought to the knowledge of the Minister that there will be an increase in the cost of living which was not taken into account at the time this Supplementary Estimate was prepared and whether there are any proposals for additional awards to these people to enable them to combat the increase in the cost of living.  In recent weeks, it has been projected through Radio Éireann that there are some people in this country who have grapefruit and yoghourt for breakfast. Not many of the people catered for in these Estimates are in that happy situation.  They depend on bread, butter, tea and sugar for the main elements of their diet.</P>
    <P>These people know that they had to pay a penny extra last week for the loaf of bread.  The bakers have now been notified that there is to be an increase of 4/- in the price of flour which may entail an additional penny on the loaf of bread in the next week.  That will be the second increase in the price of bread since the people had an opportunity of expressing their opinion a short time ago.  I want to know if the benefits for which we are now providing the money are sufficient to meet these additional imposts on the poorer sections of our community.</P>
    <P>There was a reference in the Minister's speech to a decrease in the expected number of pensioners under the non-contributory heading.  Is this the effect of a more stringent application of the means test?  We have had another Minister telling us that our people are living longer although perhaps they only feel that they are living longer because they are finding it so difficult to live at all.  It is true that due to advances in medical science, people are living longer and so one would expect that there would be a greater number of non-contributory pensions. Nevertheless, the Minister states that there is a slight decrease in the expected number.  I want to know if that is being achieved by a more stringent <Col N="1777" /> application of the means test.  If it is, I consider it most unjust.</P>
    <P>We have a complete admission that money values have fallen so much that it is essential that those sections of our community who are in receipt of these benefits should get an increase in their amounts to compensate for the fall in the value of money.  If the Minister persists in this strict application of the means test, as indicated by his expectation of a reduced number of qualifying persons, it must be remembered that the level of income of these people was fixed at a time when money had some value, before the deliberately inspired spiralling of the cost of living. That fact must be remembered in applying the means test and some consideration must be given to the fact that what was originally defined as the limit is completely outdated by what has happened in the meantime.  Instead of there being an easing in the application of the means test in relation to these persons, the Minister forecasts a reduction in the number of persons qualifying.</P>
    <P>Also, in relation to unemployment assistance, would the Minister explain the reason for the upward trend in the number of recipients, which would not seem to be in accord with some of the statements contained in his introductory speech?  The Minister has recorded an additional sum of £425,000 from employers' contributions in relation to one of his Estimates but is he aware that this charge is merely one of several which are being unloaded on to the shoulders of the consumer, like rate increases and many other increases that certain members of the business community have to contend with.  When these increases are levied there is no assurance that the money will come directly from the pockets of the people concerned as employers. There are too many indications of the effective transference of such impositions to the shoulders of the recipients, the supposed beneficiaries, of those increases.  It is desirable, in the conduct of the finances of the State to ensure that this practice be brought to an end.  Instead, it is gaining momentum daily.  It is a matter which will entail for everybody a considerable <Col N="1778" /> reduction in the value of whatever income he may have, whether it is from direct earnings in employment or the assistance which the State can afford to give to those who are unfortunate enough to be unable by their own efforts to provide for themselves.</P>
    <P>It is in these circumstances that we examine these Supplementary Estimates. We agree to them as being necessary but we must express grave concern at the fact that because of policies that have been pursued in recent years, pursued in defiance of warnings issued from these benches and elsewhere as to what would happen if the Government were to continue the policies which they were operating, the supposed benefits that recipients of social welfare payments would derive, have been considerably reduced by cost of living increases.</P>
    <P>Today it would appear that there is complacency and satisfaction among the front bench members of the Government regarding the cost of living figures but these figures are of grave concern to those persons who rely on these payments, which give them a relatively low level of income. We want some assurance from somebody that some effective action is being taken to protect these people.  Everybody is aware and must admit that the Government could have secured, if they had available to them the increases that have been imposed on luxury items alone over the past 12 months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the reduction in value of the amount that was decided as being sufficient for this class in the community and the need to ensure that what they get will leave them in a position to provide the necessaries of life.  In that respect we are not satisfied.  We feel that while it is projected that they are getting a particular sum, there is no effort being made to guarantee that what can be purchased by way of necessaries of life for that particular <Col N="1779" /> pittance will be sufficient to guarantee to these persons who are dependent on the community that level of subsistence which is vital for the survival of themselves and their families.</P>
      <P>It is in these circumstances that we agree to this Supplementary Estimate but we must express regret that the cost of living has been permitted to vitiate the alleged improvements provided for these categories.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party also support the Estimate.  I am glad to say that my experience in dealing with the Department of Social Welfare has not been the same as Deputy O'Sullivan's. As far as the officials of the Department and the Minister's officers are concerned, I have found them most courteous and obliging and prepared to do everything they possibly can in order to try to get matters which I complain of dealt with speedily.</P>
      <P>Having said that, however, I would agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that for some unknown reason there have been very prolonged delays in dealing with certain types of cases, appeals, particularly unemployment benefit appeals, disability benefit appeals and pension appeals.  The Minister possibly might find out if there are enough officers dealing with these matters because, while, as I have said, I meet with the greatest courtesy from the people to whom I have made representations or from whom I have made inquiries, very often they tell me that there will not be an appeals officer in the district concerned for some considerable time.  That is of very little use to the person who is depending on social welfare benefit for his livelihood.  It is just too bad that the convenience of some Departmental official must take precedence over his right to a benefit in respect of which he has been paying over a number of years.  Obviously, there is a regulation which governs the way these matters are dealt with and which the Minister can alter.  I would ask the Minister to consider that matter.  It is too bad that the regulations should be working out in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1780" /> The Minister might be able to tell me if his recent decision to increase the period for which the average test must be satisfied for contributory old age pension from 15 to 20 years has had much impact.  Would he have any idea as to the approximate number of persons who have qualified as a result? I should like to tell the Minister at this stage that I am grateful to him for the effort he has made to have this increase in the qualifying period put into operation.  I still think he could have gone a good deal further because while it has been said that the Departmental records are not such as to show evidence of insurance of insured persons back further than perhaps 15 or 20 years, I was able&mdash; and others have been able&mdash;to get insurance records back to the early twenties, on application.  I think if the Minister so decided, these back records could be obtained just as easily.</P>
    <P>The Minister told me he proposed to consider the dependants of old age pensioners.  Strange as it may seem, there are quite a considerable number qualified for pensions who have children and it is too bad if those people have been working and drawing disability benefit or unemployment benefit until the age of 70 and, while doing so, have been receiving children's allowances in accordance with their entitlement and on reaching 70 years get the old age pension for themselves and a wife, if the wife is alive, and nothing for the children.  I discussed this with the Minister in the House and privately and I understood he was favourably disposed to doing something about it.  I have not heard of anything being done yet and I should like the Minister to refer to it when replying.</P>
    <P>I am rather intrigued by his statement that:</P>
    <P>The principal single item in this surplus is an expected increase of £425,000 in employment contributions, of which £300,000 is attributable to the increase in the contribution rates which took effect from 6th January, 1964, and the balance is due to favourable trends in the employment position generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1781" /> Is the Minister really serious when he makes that statement because the figures published by his Department do not bear that out?  They show, in fact, that there appears to be no appreciable increase in the number of insured persons.  I can understand that the increase in contributions has affected the total but I should like to know if the Minister can give us any definite figures as to the extra number who, as a result of being employed, are paying insurance and have helped to reach this sum because I have been unable to find any evidence of that. Incidentally, it is rather unfortunate that it appears that the number employed is less than it was some years ago.  That is something we all deplore. I am not blaming the Minister for the situation but if the position is as I say, the opposite should not be stated in his opening speech.</P>
    <P>This total needs to be adjusted in the light of other factors.  In the case of old age pensions and widows' non-contributory pensions there are savings, estimated at £102,000, on the original provision due to a slight decrease in the expected number of pensioners, while there are estimated excesses amounting to £89,000 on the original provisions for children's allowances and unemployment assistance because of an upward trend in the number of recipients.</P>
    <P>We all know, if we know anything at all about social welfare benefits and assistance, that people on unemployment assistance are people who have exhausted their right to unemployment benefit and if the upward trend in unemployment assistance is there it means we have a bigger number of people who have been unemployed for periods longer than six months. That is a very serious situation and I should like the Minister, if he has time when replying, to make a comment on it because to me it seems to be contradictory of what appears earlier in his statement.</P>
    <P>I want to make some brief remarks about a matter which Deputy O'Sullivan referred to, the question of the <Col N="1782" /> change in social welfare offices in certain districts and which has occurred in Meath constituency also.  While there is a certain amount of local agitation and while I have asked the Minister to meet a deputation consisting of another Meath Deputy, a Senator and myself to discuss this matter&mdash;he has agreed to meet us&mdash;I feel it is not as serious as some people make out.  If I know the regulations, the office which has been closed down is the office in which the person who carries out investigations was located.  That person's job was to carry out investigations on the spot, not in an office and if somebody wants his services or if he himself feels he needs certain information, it is his job to go out to the insured person or the person drawing assistance and not ask him to hire cars, go on buses or travel miles to see him.  I think I am stating the position fairly but in view of the fact that there has been so much agitation, I wonder would the Minister say whether or not there are circumstances which would require having an office for even one day a week or a month during which certain people could see him.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly convinced that no hardship is being done to the people who are being looked after&mdash;if that is the right phrase&mdash;by this particular official but in case there is something in it which I do not know and which the Minister might consider should be explained, perhaps he would comment on it when replying.  I should like to know if there is something of which I am not aware that would require the office being kept open full-time.</P>
    <P>I have no further comment to make, except to say that I am very grateful to the Minister, his Department and officials for the courtesy they have shown me during the past 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little need to do much more than thank the House for dealing with the Supplementary Estimate so expeditiously but some points were raised which call for reply. First, I should like to tell Deputy O'Sullivan that the recommendation made by the Committee of Public Accounts has been accepted and that <Col N="1783" /> in future it is intended to have only one Estimate for Social Welfare and to combine both insurance and assistance in that.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned that there was provision here for £36,000 due to increases in administration costs.  That is not due to the fact that there has been any extra expenditure in this year on administration.  The extra amount arises as a result of adjustments for underclaims in respect of administration which is proper to the previous year, 1962-63.  It is divided as between, Posts and Telegraphs, £26,000; Office of Public Works, £7,000 and the Stationery Office, £3,000.  These other Government Departments submitted claims for the previous year which were subsequently found to have been too small and the £36,000 is for those adjustments in this year.</P>
      <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy O'Sullivan claim that the position in regard to delays in dealing with claims and appeals was never worse than now. The experience of my Department is that the position has improved considerably and that there are not now long delays in dealing with claims or appeals.  There may be exceptional cases in which delays do occur but there is usually some very good explanation for any such case.  If Deputies would bring to my notice any case in which there has been excessive delay, I shall have it investigated and indicate why that has been so.  If necessary, I shall take whatever remedial action is required.  Certainly my experience has been that the position has improved considerably.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to suggest that there is a too stringent application of the means test in regard to the non-contributory old age pension and that this is resulting in a decrease in the number of recipients.  In fact, in the two years since I became Minister for Social Welfare, the means limit for old age pensions has been extended in each year.  So far as that is concerned, the only effect has been to bring in more people for the lower rates of pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that there are savings in the non-contributory old age pensions is not due to a decrease in the expected <Col N="1784" /> number of pensioners but means simply that there was an over-estimation last year.  Another factor that has contributed to it is the matter to which Deputy Tully referred, that the period over which contributions qualifying for contributory old age pensions can be counted has been extended from 15 years to 20 years.  Deputy Tully asked how many new pensions had been granted as a result of that.  So far, 600 new contributory old age pensions have been granted and I dare say that a considerable number of those had previously been in receipt of non-contributory old age pensions. Certainly there is not a more stringent application of the means test.  Most rural Deputies will agree that now the transfer of land by a person who has reached the age of 70 is accepted almost automatically where previously it was not.</P>

      <P>Yes, it is almost automatically accepted and that was not the position previously.  Therefore, I do not think there is any substance in the claim that the means test is being applied more stringently now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised a point about making provision in the contributory or non-contributory old age pensions for dependent children of pensioners.  I fully recognise that it is anomalous that it is only in the old age pension schemes that there is no such provision while all the other social welfare schemes do take account of child dependents. It will require legislation and nothing has been done so far.  Strange as it may seem, this will cost a considerable <Col N="1785" /> amount, but, as I told Deputy Tully, it is one of the things I have in mind and provided the financial situation allows, I intend to make that provision.  It is an obvious development of these schemes that should take place to bring them into line with the other social welfare schemes.</P>
    <P>In regard to the closing of a number of social welfare offices throughout the country, I think Deputy Tully appreciates the position very well.  These were just offices in which the social welfare officer was accommodated.  His work is mainly field work and consists, in the main, of investigating claims. It is not true to suggest that the public have been caused any inconvenience because of the closing of these offices. The complaints that have been made from urban district councils and so on, about the closing of these offices have to do rather with the question of the status given to the town by the location of Government offices there than any question of inconvenience.</P>

      <P>No, that was not supposed to happen and is not supposed to happen.</P>
      <P>I dealt with the question of these savings mentioned in the last paragraph of my opening statement in so far as non-contributory old age pensions were concerned.  In regard to the widows' non-contributory pensions, it has been a feature that the number of recipients falls each year.  That is because a bigger proportion are becoming eligible for contributory pensions and we under-estimated what the fall would be in this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1786" /> In regard to the estimated excess of £89,000 in the provision for children's allowances and unemployment assistance, only £35,000 of that is due to the upward trend in unemployment assistance.  In that respect every time there is an increase in the rates of unemployment assistance, due to the new methods introduced last year for deciding the means limit for a qualification certificate, then automatically that means limit is raised and more people can qualify for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I made a statement that there was an improvement in the employment position and that some of the £425,000 of the expected increase in employment contributions was due to the favourable trends in the employment position.  That is a factual statement and there is only £300,000 of the total attributable to the increased rates of contribution. The remaining £125,000 is due to the fact that more people are in insurable employment.  I do not think there were any other points raised and I thank the House for dealing so expeditiously with this Estimate.</P>

      <P>I really do not think that comes within my consideration of this question.  I can only add that the prohibition order was made last June by the Corporation and a declaration of unlawfulness was also made on 20th June in respect of the extension referred to.</P>

      <P>Appointments to the staff of the National College of Art are, in the case of whole-time permanent posts, made on the recommendation of the Civil Service Commissioners.  In the case of part-time posts, which are filled on a sessional basis, the normal method of appointment is by selection from a panel of persons regarded as suitable for the particular work in question.  The four appointments referred <Col N="1794" /> to in the Deputy's question were part-time appointments and were made in accordance with the normal method. Arrangements are in train for the appointment through the Civil Service Commissioners of a professor and an assistant professor to the staff of the College.</P>
